Do Not Shoot!: I am Che Guevara
US: His leg riddled with bullets, his gun knocked out of his hand, Ernesto Che Guevara surrendered.
Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead, he said as US-trained Bolivian forces closed in. The Argentine-born doctor and Marxist rebel leader who helped Fidel Castro seize power in Cuba was finally captured after years of living in secrecy. Guevara, the beret-wearing guerrilla leader who had led firing squads after the Communist victory, abruptly resigned from his government posts and left Cuba to spread the revolution in Africa and South America.
But the missions, including the one to arouse an uprising in Bolivia, were all but doomed. On that afternoon of October 8, 1967, Guevara was taken prisoner and carried by soldiers to a one-room schoolhouse in the town of La Higuera in Bolivia, about 4 miles away from where he was captured, according to Richard Harris biography, Death of a Revolutionary: Che Guevaras Last Mission.
Felix Rodriguez, a Cuban-American CIA operative posing as a Bolivian military officer, would find him covered in dirt inside that schoolhouse the next day. His hair was matted, his clothes were torn and filthy, and his arms and feet were bound. The US government wanted him alive to be interrogated, but Bolivian leaders decided that Guevara must be executed, as a public trial would only garner him sympathy. The official story would be that he was killed in battle. Rodriguez, who was instrumental in Guevaras capture, had mixed emotions at that time, as he had acknowledged later in an interview. Here was a man who had assassinated many of his countrymen, Rodriguez said, and yet he felt sorry for him.
Then, he told the guerrilla leader that he was about to die. I looked at him straight in the face, and I just told him. . . . He looked straight to me and said: Its better this way. I should have never been captured alive, Rodriguez recalled during a 60 Minutes interview years later. - THE WASHINGTON POST

Unbeaten, MAS Silueta and Power-Tech Cement advanced to the final of the 01st 'Fair & Lovely Men' Trophy, MCA 'B' Division 50-Over League Tournament 2018.
In the semi finals worked off over the week end, MAS Silueta beat Commercial Credit 'B' by 06 runs on the DLS Method and Power-Tech Cement took sweet revenge over John Keells 'B',beating them by 07-wickets.
Both Matches were played on October 7. The top half semi final between MAS Silueta and Com. Credit 'B' at MCA grounds was abandoned without a ball being bowled and went on to the reserve day, October 8.
The bottom half semi final between John Keells 'B' and Power Tech Cement at FTZ Katunayake too was marred by rain, but managed a result.
The match got off to a late start and reduced to 47 overs-a-side. John Keells 'B' came into the game 'Cock-a- hoop' having beaten Power Tech Cement by 09 wickets on the DLS Method in the league stage on September 25 at MCA. Power Tech won the toss and elected to field; their decision proved absolutely correct, as John Keells treaded on a mine field and got caught in the cross fire of Lahiru Fernando (10-01-29-5) and Dasun Seneviratne (4.5-15- 3) and were all out for a paltry 149 runs in 44.5 overs.
With evening showers in their mind, Power-Tech raised to their target in a double quick time reaching 151 for 3 in 21.3 overs with Malindu Maduranga hitting a brisk 50 and Dineth Thimodaya stroking a fine 40.
John Keells 'B'  149 (44.5) (R. Kodituwakku 24, K. Bandara 39, Lahiru Fernando 5/29, Dasun Seneviratne 3/15)
Power Tech Cement  151 /3 (21.3) (Malindu Maduranga 50, Dineth Thimodaya 40, M. de Silva 28 not out, Dasun Seneviratne 20 not out, S. Perera 2/47)
The top half semi final played on the reserve day was once again marred by bad weather. The match got off to a very late start, reduced to 34 overs a side. Commercial Credit, sent into bat struggled for runs and managed only 120 runs for the loss of 05 wickets.
As the heavens opened once again, MAS Silueta faced a new target of 149 in 29 overs (RPO 5.13).
In order to keep up with the required DLS par score they kept on losing wickets in regular intervals. As the wickets were tumbling on one side, 'Mr. Reliable', Denuwan Rajakaruna (24 not out) doggedly held on when the rains came down again to terminate the match with the score board reading 115 for 7 in 22 overs, MAS Silueta 06 runs ahead of DLS par score.
Commercial Credit 'B' - 120/5 (34) ( A. Inham 51 not out, Anura Dias 29, D. Hemantha 3/26)
MAS Silueta (given a revised target of 149 in 29 overs) - 115/7 (22) (Denuwan Rajakaruna 24 not out, N. Madushanka 22, D. De Silva 3/17, M. Fernando 2/31)
The final between MAS Silueta and Power-Tech Cement will be held on October 14 at the MCA Grounds, commencing 10.00 am. MAS Silueta beat Power Tech Cement by 25 runs on the DLS Method in their league stage match at the same venue on October 4.

Land prices in Colombo keep rising; remain best investment option
Land values in Colombo are growing at a remarkable rate, a recent study has found. According to the National House Price Index maintained by LankaPropertyWeb.com, average land prices in Colombo has increased by 36% within the last year alone, making it the biggest increase in the real estate sector, when compared against house and apartment prices. The overall land prices for the country have also shown an accelerated growth within the last year.
Moreover, a study by Candor Group which compared all investment options, including share market, savings, bonds and property found that lands in Colombo remained the best performing asset class.
Colombo's land prices heat map shows that Colombo 1, 3 and 7 remains the most expensive, while 9, 13, 14 and 15 are the least expensive.
Just to highlight how expensive the Fort area is, a recent ad on LankaPropertyWeb.com for a land near President's House was priced at Rs 30 million per perch.
Buying the freehold of lands in the country is currently limited to residents, while foreign individuals can lease land on a 99-year lease.
With the Port city adding 269 hectares of land in to Colombo and sales expected to start by 2018, it will be interesting to see at what prices the lands will be sold at, LankaPropertyWeb.com said.
While it's much cheaper to buy an apartment than to buy land and build a house in Colombo and on the outskirts, owning lands remains the best long-term investment due to its double-digit growth in the last few years, which shows no signs of receding yet, it said.

Need to commence banking relations between Iran, SL
Dr. Hossein Bamiri, Commercial Attache, Embassy of Iran, New Delhi, urged the need to commence banking relations in order to give a further fillip to trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and Iran.
He was speaking at a seminar on Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Iran, organized by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, yesterday.
According to Dr. Bamiri, at present, Iran and Sri Lanka dont have banking relations. However, Iranian President Hasan Rauhani and Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament Karu Jayasuriya have emphasised the need for development of banking relations between both countries at a meeting held in August, this year.
Dr. Bamiri also expressed the hope that banking relations between the two countries would start by the end of this year or in the first quarter of next year through Euro system.
Commenting on the bilateral trade between the two countries, Dr. Bamiri also mentioned that during the 2014-2016 period, there was not a much fluctuation in Irans imports to Sri Lanka and the main products that Iran imported from Sri Lanka included coffee, tea, spices, vegetables, paper and paperboard, perfumery, cosmetics and textiles and fiber, etc.
In the meantime, Iranian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, M. Zaeri Amirani speaking at the event, highlighted the importance of commencing banking relations with Sri Lanka to further boost commercial ties and also noted that issues pertaining to the bilateral relations between the two countries can be solved by avoiding negative people and shortsighted approaches.
Iran has helped fund a number of development projects in Sri Lanka. Iran has invested in Sri Lankan oil refineries and its investments have helped to double Sri Lankan oil production capacity. Iran has also invested in rural electrification in Sri Lanka.

Padmavati to release in 500 more screens than Baahubali
Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, the co-producers of Sanjay Leela Bhansalis purported magnum opus Padmavati are not only going ahead with the release as per plan on November 17, they also intend to unleash an unprecedented number of prints on the Indian movie going public.
A source close to the producers reveals mind-boggling release and marketing plans for Padmavati.
It will open on approximately 8,000 screens in India alone. That is 500 more screens than Baahubali: The Conclusion. That makes Padmavati the most widely circulated Hindi film ever. It will also be screened abroad on a scale never seen before.
That isnt all. The producers and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali plan a dubbed English-language version of the film for selected European and American outlets. And no, the songs and dances - Bhansalis forte - wont be trimmed out of the English version of Padmavati.
Says Sanjay Bhansali, Ive been proud of our song-and-dance culture. My protagonists will always sing, and dance too, when the emotions are high. We Indians are like that only emotional and demonstrative. The West had better accept us the way we are.
Emotional and demonstrative may all be very well. But thats not the way Bhansalis lead pair Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are expected to be when the films promotion and marketing starts.
According to the elaborate marketing strategy planned, Ranveer and Deepika who are said to be a real-life couple and who play historical antagonists in Padmavati and who never meet during the course of the story, will promote the film separately.
As for rumours of the release date of Padmavati being postponed, Ajit Andhare the COO of Viacom 18 puts an end to the speculations with two words, Not true. The Quint

Zeros are not zero, they have value
Great leaders should not rule by fear, but always rule by respect, said Anura Perera, Division Director, Toastmasters International District 82 Sri Lanka/India.
Not even the leader should be above the rules and if they do wrong they should get the same punishment that is meted to other employees and create an environment where everyone feels equal,  Perera said.
He made these remarks when he was invited to deliver a special speech at the Vancouver Entrepreneurs Toastmasters Club in Canada, recently. He spoke on 'Zero are not zeros, they have value'.
He also said that youngsters should have goals and work towards them.
When I was young like you, I had a goal, and I always wanted to achieve it. I started working in 1980 and started my Toastmastering career as a zero in 2014 end. Normally zeroes are zeros, but they have value. Through commitment and hard work, today I have I progressed to become an Administrative Secretary of the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association.
In team sports, you have captains and rules; in business we have leaders and teams at different levels. If you want to be a good leader, you have to walk the talk.
He said its very important for youth aged between 15 to 24, (60% of total youth population live in Asia) to get engaged and enabled and to contribute to the development process in their countries.
He also said in this world nothing is impossible. Scientists send astronauts to the moon and now they are trying to go to beyond the moon.
If you think you can, you can. Never underestimate your ability as you've got some kind of talent in you to be a future leader.
He said being a Toastmaster helps to build a persons character, bring out leadership qualities in a person and would also help to improve the public speaking knowledge which is very important for the future.
If you become a Toastmaster and you become a good public speaker, this would mould you to become a good leader."

Annual NCE Export Awards celebrates Silver Jubilee
The Silver Jubilee of the Annual NCE Export Awards was conducted on September 29, at the Hilton Colombo.
Despite the barriers and challenges encountered by Sri Lankan exporters both locally and internationally, their resilience and hard work has enabled the export sector to make a vital contribution for the economic development of Sri Lanka, says Secretary General of the National Chamber of Exporters, Chamber Shiham Marikar.
In this background the annual awards conducted by the Chamber has enabled to motivate Sri Lankan exporters and keep them together without deviating from exports to other alternatives. Over the years this event has achieved National Significance to become the most looked forward business event conducted professionally amidst much glitter and glamour.
He added that he was fortunate to be a part of the Silver Jubilee of the Annual NCE Export Awards, which had been conducted for 25 years without interruption. The event has had a very humble beginning commencing in 1993, to fill avoid which prevailed at that time since there was no official event to recognize and reward the achievements of Sri Lankan exporters in the international market place.
The Secretary General states that the Silver Jubilee event had special significance, as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Chief Guest, endorsing the priority given by the Government to exports for the Economic Development of the country to achieve National Economic Development targets that have already been set.
The Prime Minister in his address emphasized that Joint Ventures for Exports was the way forward for Lankan manufacturers.
Ancient Ceylon has always been an export oriented nation and even Cinnamon grown up- country, had been exported from harbours in the South.
With a population of only 20mn, there are limitations for local manufacturers and the only way forward is to go global. If Sri Lanka did not export tea, rubber, coconut and apparel, the country would not enjoy the present lifestyle.
Among the grey areas identified by the Prime Minister is the high cost of power. He also predicted that with wages and other expenses increasing some local manufacturers would move out of the country.
The President of the NCE Ramal Jasinghe, noted that overall exports of Sri Lanka has been stagnant, or have recorded an erratic and declining trend since 2010reaching USD 10.3 billion at the end of 2016. Further, exports as a percentage of the GDP currently stands at 12.7% having progressively declined from over 30% since 2000.
According to the Annual Report of the Central Bank for 2016, industrial production as a percentage of the GDP was just 26.8% out of which only 35.2% of the production was exported while the major portion was consumed domestically.
However, the latest figures show a welcome a positive turnaround achieving USD 6521.9mn (Rs 6.5Bn) for the first seven months of 2017 compared to USD 6013.1mn (RS.6 bn) for the comparative period in 2016, reflecting a growth rate of 8.4%.
The proposed removal of import duties and CESSES on certain items which compete with local produce, as well the proposed removal of CESS on raw material exports which hinders value addition locally, without giving sufficient time for local enterprises to adjust to the competition was also viewed with concern, along with the general increase of Corporate Taxes on export enterprises including the removal of exemptions hither to available to exports related to the IT sector and gems and Jewellery, were also seen to have negative impacts.
The requirement for enterprises to export at least 80% of production to be entitled to the lower taxation rate available for export oriented ventures was also seen to be counter productive, since it would discourage many SME entrepreneurs to develop as established exporters, since it requires their beginning with a smaller percentage of exports and developing thereafter progressively to become established exporters which has been the case for many big exporters.
The Chamber made use of the occasion to honour Eardley Perera who had made a vital contribution to the work of the Chamber initially including his services as the first Chairman of the Independent Panel of Judges who selected the award winners. He was presented with a plaque to record the appreciation of the Chamber.
The Secretary General records the gratitude and appreciation of the Chamber of all sponsors of the event who over the years contributed generously to develop it to the very high standard it enjoys today. The Chamber is particularly grateful to Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd., who has been the main sponsor from the inception underlining its commitment as a leading State Sector Corporate in Digital Services, by supporting Sri Lankan exporters with generous contributions over the years, for the Economic Development of Sri Lanka through exports. Similarly, other noteworthy Service Providers to Exporters such as leading Banks have partnered with the Chamber over many years, recognizing encouragement of exports as a National Course.
The Chamber also appreciates the partnership and contribution made by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), as the Print Media Sponsor throughout the years providing valuable pre-event and post event print media publicity to highlight the achievements and success stories of Sri Lankan exporters in the International market place, to enable them to win over new customers for the expansion of their export ventures.
The judging process itself has been very professional, comprising of an independent panel of Judges who are experts and professionals in their respective specialized fields related to exports.
This year the Chamber has taken additional step of utilizing the services of the Multi National Audit Firm - Earnst & Young, to facilitate the Panel of Judges and the Technical Committee by providing their professional through analysis of the information provided by applicants to enhance the credibility and transparency of the selection process.
The theme of this year's award related to the Polonnaruwa era'. In this regard the backdrop and the intervening entertainment items, reminiscent of the glorious past of Sri Lanka were fascinating, and appreciated by many participants.
This year the Chamber introduced Special Regional Awards to recognize the valuable contribution made by Regional Enterprises, specially SME Entrepreneurs to overall exports of the country by being a part of the Export Value Chains'.
This approach was in keeping with the concept that in addition to the volume and value of exports as a direct measure, there are other important aspects of International Trade including the participation of Sri Lankan Enterprises in production value chains thereby effectively integrating with multinational production networks related to International Trade.
For this purpose the President and the Secretary General of the Chamber had visited several Regional Chambers in the Provinces to educate them on the importance of contributing to Export Value Chains as a first step to developing into direct exporters. In this context the Regional Awards of the Chamber was a means to enable them to demonstrate their potential as future direct exporters.
Their recognition was also expected to contribute to the efforts of the Government to increase the number of direct exporters by another 2000 by 2020, through the encouragement of export entrepreneurship.
A special panel was constituted by the Chamber to evaluate the applications received through the Regional Chambers to compete for the Regional Awards.
Among the criteria use for evaluation were the extent of participation in Export Value Chains, as well as the effective utilization of local raw materials and services to the communities in the Provinces for improvement of their livelihood through economic advancement.
A notable feature of the three enterprises selected from the Jaffna, Trincomalee, and Vauniya districts for conferment of special awards from among the applications received was that one of them has already graduated to commence direct export while the other two were effective indirect exporters.
In many countries SME's are a vital component of their economies creating substantial employment as well. In the field of exports too SMEs play a vital role both as Direct Exporters, Indirect Exporters and participants in the Export Value Chains.
In the above context the Founder President of the NCE, the late Deshabandu Patrick Amerasinghe passionately appreciated the contribution made by SMEs for Economic Development and especially exports. He made it his mission to aggressively represent their issues and concerns with the relevant State Authorities and harness their contributions to the economic development efforts of the country.
The Chamber confers the special award for a Best SME Exporter in recognition of the contribution made to the export development effort to the country and in memory of the services rendered by the Late Deshabandu Patrick Amerasinghe for the development of the SME sector.

Another close call for Earth today
FRANCE: A house-size asteroid will give Earth a near-miss Thursday, passing harmlessly inside the Moon's orbit while giving experts a rare chance to rehearse for a real-life strike threat.
Dubbed 2012 TC4, the space rock will shave past at an altitude of less than 44,000 kilometres (27,300 miles) -- just above the 36,000-km plane at which hundreds of geosynchronous satellites orbit the Earth.
That represents about an eighth of the distance between the Earth and the Moon.
NASA's Mike Kelley, who leads the exercise to spot, track and intimately probe the transient visitor, insisted there was no danger. Not even for satellites.
We've now been observing TC4 for two months, so we have very accurate position information on it, which in turn allows very precise calculations of its orbit, which will not cross that of Earth nor its satellites, he told AFP.
As its name suggests, the object was first spotted five years ago when it called on Earth at about double Thursday's projected distance, before disappearing from view.
It is 15 to 30 metres (50 to 100 feet) wide -- about the size of the meteoroid that exploded in the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk in central Russia in 2013 with 30 times the kinetic energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The resulting shockwave blew out the windows of nearly 5,000 buildings and injured more than 1,200 people.
While the Chelyabinsk event caught everyone unawares, TC4 is one of thousands of space rocks whose whereabouts are known.
Millions are not.
On its 609-day loop around the Sun, TC4 will return to Earth in 2050 and 2079, according to Ruediger Jehn of the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object programme in the Netherlands.
We know today that it will also not hit the Earth in the year 2050, but the close flyby in 2050 might deflect the asteroid such that it could hit the Earth in the year 2079, he told AFP by email.
With a one-in-750 chance of hitting the planet then, TC4 is listed at number 13 on the risk list of objects posing even the remotest impact risk.
We need to make very precise observations to be able to better predict the return in the year 2050, Jehn said.
Flybys like this one are actually quite common -- about three objects similar in size to TC4 graze past at a similar distance every year.
What makes TC4 special is that it has been chosen to test the global asteroid pre-warning system, fed by a network of observatories, universities and labs around the world.
The asteroid's close approach will allow teams to evaluate how accurate they were in predicting its orbit and size, while using telescopes to learn more about its composition.
For us this is a test case, said Jehn's colleague Detlef Koschny. We are practicing for the real serious case. Many scientists believe the Earth will once again be hit by a space rock of the size that wiped out the dinosaurs, though nobody knows when.
And even if they become better at predicting a strike, there is very little to be done about it, for now.
Futuristic projects mooted to deflect or destroy incoming space rocks have come to nought so far, and the only strategy would be to evacuate people in zones at risk.
TC4 will make its closest approach to Earth just before 0541 GMT on Thursday, at a point south of Australia, according to ESA and NASA.
It will not be visible to the naked eye nor with regular binoculars, but it can be seen in the night of 11-12 October until about 4.00 am from European observatories, Jehn said.- AFP

Australia jet and navy data stolen in 'extensive' hack
Sensitive information about Australia's defence programmes has been stolen in an "extensive" cyber hack.
About 30GB of data was compromised in the hack on a government contractor, including details about new fighter planes and navy vessels.
The data was commercially sensitive but not classified, the government said. It did not know if a state was involved.
Australian cyber security officials dubbed the mystery hacker "Alf", after a character on TV soap Home and Away.
The breach began in July last year, but the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) was not alerted until November. The hacker's identity is not known.
It could be one of a number of different actors," Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday.
"It could be a state actor, [or] a non-state actor. It could be someone who was working for another company."
Pyne said he had been assured the theft was not a risk to national security.
Weaknesses exploited
The hack was described as "extensive and extreme" by ASD incident response manager Mitchell Clarke.
It included information about Australia's new A$17bn (10bn; $13bn) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, C130 transport plane and P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, as well as "a few" naval vessels, he said.
Clarke told a Sydney security conference that the hacker had exploited a weakness in software being used by the government contractor. The software had not been updated for 12 months.
The aerospace engineering firm of was also using default passwords, he said.
ASD officials began repairing the system in December.
A report by ZDNet said officials referred to the months before ASD intervention as "Alf's mystery happy fun time".
"For those visitors overseas to Australia, Alf is Alf Stewart from an horrific Australia soap opera called Home and Away. It's just a thing we do," Clarke told his audience, according to BuzzFeed.
'Salutary reminder'
The government distanced itself from the Adelaide-based firm, saying it had most likely been employed by another contractor.
"I don't think you can try and sheet blame for a small enterprise having lax cyber security back to the federal government. That is a stretch," Pyne said.
"Fortunately, the data that was taken was commercial data, not military data, but it is still very serious and we will get to the bottom of it."
However, he said "we don't necessarily let the public know" about the identities of hackers, because such investigations often involve confidential information.
The incident was a "salutary reminder" about cyber security, he added.
Last year, Australia announced a surge in defence spending, a move that reflects concern over military expansion in the region.
Military spending would grow by A$29.9bn over 10 years, including plans to buy 72 Joint Strike Fighters, the 2016 Defence White Paper outlined.

Barren paddy lands to be cultivated
The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council has taken initiatives to cultivate 8,850 acres of barren paddy lands in line with the national agriculture revolution programme of the Government. The commencement of the aswaddumization programme was held recently under the patronage of Sabaragamuwa Governor Marshal Perera at the Morawatte paddy fields at Ruwanwella recently.
According to provincial statistics, there are around 57,640 acres of paddy lands out of which there are nearly 8,900 acres of barren paddy lands in the Sabaragamuwa province. It has been planned to bring those barren paddy lands under plough by the Agriculture Ministry of the Provincial Council.
On the concept of President Maithripala Sirisena, the entire country has been subjected to a rapid agriculture revolution aiming to increase the local food production drastically. Under this programme, paddy farmers are assisted in many ways including introducing modern technology and machineries used in the agriculture sector so as to increase productivity. Accordingly, paddy farmers of the province, were offered weeding machines and paddy planting machines at the ceremony.
Moreover, farmers are paid a grant of Rs 10,000 each for every barren paddy acre to be prepared for paddy cultivation.

Bridging cultures
Sixty years of Diplomatic Ties between China and Sri Lanka and its overall impact upon the general political environment in the world is one of great fascination. Indeed it is a partnership that has had a huge impact on Sri Lanka economically and socially. Its impact has been felt by almost all segments of Sri Lankan society. It has been a partnership that has been closely watched by the great powers in the world. It is a necklace of pearls around both countries.
Sri Lanka is going through a period of great change. The Chinese Government still wants to honour these ties and wishes to further consolidate this relationship. Therefore for the first time in Sri Lanka, the Guangxi Cultural Week was held recently.
Guangxi Region comprises of many ethnicities of China and the region is popular due to its rich cultural heritage and beautiful natural landscape. The China Cultural Center in Sri Lanka initiated this unique program with the contribution and advice of the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in Sri Lanka.
The opening ceremony consisted of feats displayed by the performers who displayed amazing acrobatic skills. The Guangxi costumes and ornaments displayed at the Chinese Cultural Center at the opening ceremony were certainly beautiful and gave an understanding about the textile sector in the Guangxi region of China. A painting exhibition was also held parallel to the event by Chinese and Sri Lankan painters.
The Minister of Cultural affairs, Wayamba development, S.B. Navinna and the Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China Yi Xian Liang attended the opening of the Guangxi Cultural Week.
In his address the Ambassador stated that it was his great pleasure to be present at such an important event occurring in this juncture of time.
All the stakeholders and individuals must be congratulated for this noble endeavor. Guangxi is a very diverse region. There are so many minorities. Todays event pays tribute to this cultural diversity. I have visited this area many times. So this theme of cultural diversity is relevant to 60 years of diplomatic ties between China and Sri Lanka. Events of this nature bring Guangxi and Sri Lanka much closer since there are many similarities between the two cultures. The people in both regions are so friendly and open. This is the first time we have the Guangxi cultural week and this is a new milestone. Human beings are cultural animals and we are attuned to each other culturally. This is why cultural relations between China and Sri Lanka are so important, said Ambassador Liang. He also emphasized on the importance of people understanding each other.
Minister of Cultural affairs, Wayamba development, S. B. Navinna,stated that China and Sri Lanka have a long history, with the two countries enjoying a traditional friendship as close neighbors.
This year marks the 60 anniversary of the establishment of Diplomatic relations between the two countries. During this eventful long period our business relations have been further strengthened. This relationship and corporation between Sri Lanka and China will definitely yield rich dividends for both countries. May the friendship between our two countries be everlasting and benefitting for our people, Minister said.
China Cultural Center in Sri Lanka, Director, Liwen Yuesaid Guangxi cultural week is a programme that will have a positive impact on cultural ties between the two countries.
Guangxi cultural week is a comprehensive programme. What we want to do is to introduce Chinese local cultural styles to Sri Lankans so that the local people will understand more about China. I must say that the painting exhibition is a learning experience for all involved. Since being established as a formal institution to promote the exchange of culture/education between the two countries, the China Cultural Center in Sri Lanka has been actively involved in many programmes which were a first to many Sri Lankans, Yue said.
The Guangxi cultural troop in Sri Lanka, a team of 40 skilled traditional singers and beautiful dancers took part in this week long schedule of events where special shows free of charge were held atChina Cultural Center, The Nelum Pokuna Theater, CINEC maritime institute theater and Anuradhapura Central College, Anuradhapura.
With the vision of re-establishing the new maritime Silk route and with the initiative to create greater awareness of the economic prosperity that could have been achieved, the Chinese government has been engaging with a series of activities and the establishment of the China Cultural Center (CCC) in Sri Lanka is one such initiative of the cultural ministry of China.

Cabinet approval to import 50,000 metric tons of rice
Sathosa received Cabinet approval to import 50,000 metric tons of rice to cover expected rice shortages in the near future.
The Yala season rice harvest this year had fallen by 50 percent as a result of the drought which had led to a possible shortage of rice in the market until December this year.
Of the total amount needed, 100,000 metric tons have already been imported from India and a committee is to be appointed under the leadership of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to make arrangements to import the remaining 400,000 metric tons.
The above was proposed through a joint proposal by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathuideen, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and International Trade and Development Strategies Minister Malik Samarawickrama.

Cabinet Paper to increase crop insurance
The Agriculture Ministry has presented a Cabinet Paper to increase crop insurance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 40,000 per hectare with the support of National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), Agricultural Ministry Secretary B Wijeratne said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) yesterday, the Secretary said the potato, chili, Soya bean, maize and big onion cultivations would be covered from this insurance scheme in addition to paddy cultivation.
In order to implement this plan, we need a contribution of Rs.1,350 from each farmer. The NITF agreed to provide Rs 675 of that amount. The Government has asked for a survey report to determine whether the farmers can afford to pay the balance of Rs.675.We have asked the Peradeniya University to furnish this report after an opinion survey of the farmers, he said.
The Secretary said the Government hitherto obtained a contribution of Rs.150 from each farmer when facilitating the voucher for fertiliser subsidy and utilized that contribution to offer a crop insurance coverage upto Rs 10,000. The insurance scheme covered crop damages at a natural calamity.

What is the role of youth
Youth are the backbone of any nation. They can change the future of society with their well-being and courageous behaviour. They are here to show us that which we have not been willing to look at within ourselves.
Unfortunately today, we find the youths more interested in other places not quite useful to them as well as the nation.
They choose drugs and video games. More and more young men of this age group are sitting at home in front of their televisions playing games all day instead of bettering themselves or going to work.
They have no vision and if they do have dreams they do not have the drive to make any attempt at achieving them.
We must get control of this and motivate our youth. We must teach responsibility and goal-setting. I fear if we do not, we will soon be supporting an entire generation of the homeless and needless on welfare families.
Things have to change with our schools with the older generation being good role models. With the older generation being mentors and with the youth who are right now doing nothing, you have a choice. You can allow yourselves to stay faithful to your course and do nothing or you can rise above what the cynics around you expect and get educated or get jobs. You might be surprised at how proud you can be yourself.
I can tell you that nothing can happen if you do not try. Key role to youth in society is to renew, refresh and maintain a civilization.

Colours that flatter your skin tone
The colours we wear play a crucial role in whether we look bright and fresh or dull and washed-out. Indian girls have a particularly hard time choosing clothes that 'match' their skin tone.
Considering the changing weather, the harsh sun and a general variation in complexion, there isn't one sure-shot formula for all women.
Here are a few points to make sure you get it right.
Skin tone: As a general categorisation, your skin is either light, medium or dark. Luckily, there are some colours that flatter each one.
Light: Pastel hues and softer tones such as lilac and baby blue work in most situations. Avoid cream and beige as they might make you appear tired and dull.
Medium: Think tropical colours such as teal, saffron and dusty rose. Avoid neons.
Dark: Earthy tones like peach, coral and jewel tones of blue, olive and purple work best. Avoid extremely bright tones especially during the day.
Undertones: Don't be intimidated by the fact that the term 'undertone' is thrown around by fashion specialists. There's an easy way to figure out whether you have a cool or a warm undertone. If your inner wrist is more yellow than blue, you have a warm undertone and if not, a cool undertone. Warm, earthy tones complement those with warm undertones whereas lighter, softer colours bring out cooler undertones better.
The mirror test: Don't just pick up items from the rack and decide to bring them home. When buying new clothes, stand in front of a mirror, hold them up against your neck, and look at them with respect to your own colour. A beautiful colour may not look as good on you as it will on someone else. Ideally, it should make your skin look brighter and more luminous (not to be confused with fairer). If not, try a shade you might not usually pick up. It may actually surprise you.

When in doubt: Navy blue, black, white, plum and olive green suit most people irrespective of skin tone, so clothes in these colours can be staples in your wardrobe. Neutral colours are another safe option.

Go the natural way: Colours closer to your skin tone will look better on you. For example, dark brown or magenta will suit dark-skinned girls while rose pink will suit very fair girls.

Comfort is key: No matter what giudes say, the ultimate confidence comes from feeling comfortable in your own skin. If you hate bright colours, no amount of coaxing will make you feel beautiful in them. So always pay regard to your personal preferences as well. -Times of India.com

A corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was today re-fixed for trial by Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, defence counsel appearing for the accused moved court that a further date be given for the trial since his senior counsel was not present in Court.
Accordingly, the case will be taken up for trial on October 25. The sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth witnesses of the case were advised to appear in Court on next date.
At an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled a preliminary objections raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitery transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the Section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.

CSE finalising plans for dollar trading board
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is finalising plans to launch a dollar trading board, part of a broader strategy to develop Sri Lankas bourse into a regional capital markets centre and boost the inflow of foreign funds.
In mid-July Ray Abeywardena, Chairman of the CSE, announced that the Exchange had received regulatory approval to launch a dollar trading board for foreign investors by the end of the year. This would allow shares of listed firms to be quoted and traded in US currency rather than the Sri Lankan rupee.
According to the initial plans, only foreigners will be allowed to buy and sell shares on the new board, meaning non-resident and resident foreign currency account holders will be excluded.
The new board should create opportunities for regional companies to trade on the CSE, with the platform to be opened up to domestic firms at a later unspecified date, Abeywardena told the Oxford Business Group (OBG).
While some trade and listing restrictions are in place, officials have said that multinational companies operating in Sri Lanka may list on the dollar board. The CSE currently has 295 companies listed on its main and secondary boards, covering 20 separate business sectors.
The introduction of the dollar platform is part of wider efforts by the CSE to increase the number of foreign listings on the bourse, with the aim of enhancing the visibility of Sri Lankas capital markets and strengthening the countrys position as a regional player, a move that would, in turn, boost the inflow of foreign funds.
One such potential market for new listing opportunities is the Maldives, according to Vajira Kulatilaka, CEO of NDB Capital. Various companies within the region, but particularly companies based in the Maldives, have shown increased interest in getting listed on the CSE, he told OBG.
Rajeeva Bandaranaike, CEO of the CSE, told OBG, The Exchange is looking at diversifying its product portfolio so that investors would have a greater range of capital market instruments.
Among the measures being used to attract more local and foreign investment is the introduction of real estate investment trusts, Bandaranaike announced at an industry event at the end of August.

Days of depending on US are over- Pakistan PM
PAKISTAN: Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said the days of Islamabad's dependence on Washington to meet its military requirements have ended.
In an interview to Arab News, published on Monday, the Prime Minister said the world should recognise Pakistans efforts in fighting the worlds war on terror. If one source dries up, we have no option but to go to another source. It may cost more, it may consume more resources, but we have to fight that war, and thats what we emphasised to all the people that we met.
We have major US weapons systems in our military, but weve also diversified (our arsenal). We have Chinese and European systems. Recently, for the first time we inducted Russian attack helicopters, Abbasi said.
Responding to a question, the Prime Minister said that US newly devised policy to include India for peace-building in Afghanistan will be detrimental for the region.
We dont believe that injecting India into the Pakistan-US relationship will help resolve anything, especially in Afghanistan, where we dont see any role for India. India has a relationship with the US, and that is between them and the US, Abbasi said.
He added that Pakistan wants an equal relationship or partnership with the US, like every other nation and wants to work with Washington in resolving regional and global issues ranging from the economy to nuclear matters.
He said that in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly and side meetings, he stressed that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan.
Were partners in the war on terror, and thats what we emphasised. We emphasised to everybody we met (at the UNGA) that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. Abbasi said that in the recently held meeting between Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Asif told his counterpart that Islamabad pursues a zero-tolerance approach to all terrorist and militant groups. - IANS

Dealing with Mother Natures wrath
In an article in Meththawalokanaya Magazine in the January 2017 edition, Venerable Bhikku Dr. Walpola Piyananda Thera Chief Sangha Nayaka of USA states that his teacher once asked him to grow identical plants of Jasminum Gradiflorum species (Saman Pichcha) and regularly each morning and evening scold one plant while praising the other with loving-kindness. Both plants were given equal amounts of water and fertilizer and exposed to sun the same way. After 6 months he noticed that the plant that was scolded did not flower while the other flowered with flowers giving pleasant aroma.
Thus without delving into the science, I will delve into the teachings of the Enlightened One the Buddha.
The reason being that the full understanding of it all is there in the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha. In describing the consciousness of the Buddha and Arahaths, the Buddha stated thus, Vingananan anidassanan, ananthan sabbatho paban; eththa apocha pathavi thejo wayo nagadhathi, eththa digancha rassancha anunthulan subasuban, eththa namancha rupancha asesan uparujjathi, vinganan nirodena eththethan uparujjathi.
The non-illustrated consciousness is limitless bright in all sides, where water/viscous, earth/hardness, heat, air/oscillation, long and short, big and small, good and bad are not present and where name/form (nama/rupa) is eliminated without any trace.
All is eliminated in the stilled (Nirodha) consciousness.
The enlightened one and his arahath disciples have only compassion, loving-kindness, equanimity, altruistic joy etc. for all. However, the mundane people who are not like them and their illustrated-consciousness has such things as hatred, enmity, anger, ingratitude, obstinateness, envy, craving, ill will etc., in different intensities. Different people will have different levels of these negative things and these name/form illustrates their consciousness.
Hatred
Looking around the world today one can only see hatred in abundance everywhere. Right now it is there in Asia-Pacific region due to ongoing ballistic missile tests by North Korea and USA responding in kind with a test of their ballistic missile, and is getting fueled all the time due to rhetoric and the words used by other national leaders, the statements of North Korean leader, concerns whether more such tests or even a nuclear war would take place etc.
Adding fuel to fire on September 3 North Korea supposedly has carried out a nuclear test triggering earth tremors which has been detected by South Korea, China and USA. Tension and concerns are building up and what will be the response of USA and other nations
Then there is much anger in the BREXIT process in UK and Europe with each day statements which are not conciliatory being issued by UK and European sides, hate and anger at what has happened in Spain, France, Belgium, Germany etc. in the last few weeks.
The ongoing influx of refugees from Middle East and North Africa to Europe is another matter creating stress and anger. The agony, death and destruction that the people of Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan have been facing too has caused much chagrin and anger. Ongoing media negative talk about USA President is also cause for anger in many a minds. All these are releasing extremely high volumes of hatred and we are also reaping the harvest as well.
Thus today in this world, the biggest commodity available is hatred and envy, among nations, among people, between different races, between different political parties or different politicians, at times between those of different religious faiths and beliefs, between media people or media people and politicians, politicians and unions etc.
Sadly, though often things that are minute and extremely localized are given wide exposure by the international media who at times use their own adjectives to make mountains out of molehills, which often result in attrition and dangers elsewhere who otherwise would not have known it at all.
Political meetings and rallies
Hatred is an extremely powerful force of very high frequency and would impact the normal working of the four fundamental things such as water, heat, air and earth. These four things are also conditioned and the Buddha said the conditioned have three characteristics, Theeni mani bhikkave sankathassa sankatha lakkanani, kathamani theeni. Uppado pannayathi, vayo pannanyathi, thithassa annaththan pannayathi meaning, Bhikkus, there are three characteristics visible in conditioned, and the three are where arising can be seen, ceasing can be seen and what is this becomes that. This clearly explains the nature of these four things water, air, earth and heat. These have very high frequency of change not visible to naked eye or even with any scientific instruments.
Right now in our own nation the media are full of stories about anger and strife among politicians, where at times vituperative words are being used by some. Each day in the morning most TV channels take to air with the discussion of news in daily papers and the focus is mainly on negative articles and where the presenter uses more adjectives to expand further. We see it within the government, between various members in the government, between Joint Opposition and government, unions and government. We are witness to fights that are taking place inside the chambers of provincial councils, screaming at each other inside the parliament, angry rhetoric used in political meetings and rallies, use of very hard language in TV discussions amongst political party representatives and others etc.
All these negative forces are impacting our mother nation badly. Had it not been for the three visits made by the Enlightened One Buddha to this country over 2,500 years ago, the sacred Buddha relics that are enshrined in our land and the Sri Maha Bodhi, and if not for that power of the Buddha this nation could have experienced worse situation than what has happened.

Defence Ministry proposes new Naval Air Force wing

The present threats emanating from the Indian Ocean due to Sri Lankas geostrategic location has called for establishment of a Naval-Air Force wing to secure our waters with greater surveillance and striking capabilities, stated the Secretary to the Ministry of Defense today.
He also proposed that a Joint Naval Command with the Air Force be set up with a Joint Communication Network with air and maritime capabilities.
Such a network, said the Defense Secretary, Kapila Waidyaratne will go in hand in hand with air force intelligence and reconnaissance services which will be modernized to better improve maritime domain awareness.
This would also led to a better centralized command and control intelligence structure to develop enhance situational applications, he added.
Being an island strategically located, Sri Lanka is well aware of its significant position in a world influenced by maritime geopolitics, said the Defense Secretary.
Addressing the two day, 3rd Colombo Air Symposium, he delivered his the key note address on Air Power in Addressing Asymmetric Threats at the Eagle Lakeside Convention Hall in Atthidiya.
The Sri Lankan Air force which engaged in asymmetric warfare during the Eelam war has found that it can be of significant use in assisting the navy through its greater reach, speed and ability to garner important intelligence not directly available to a naval force.
It is due to this that the government believes that we should develop air capabilities both in traditional and non-traditional spheres. Sri Lanka was once lagging behind its regional peers, in research and development, both in civil and military developments but this will is soon expected to change with such forums and I hope the Air force will gain knowledge to become regional leader in air capabilities, added Waidyaratne.
On the part of the government, the Secretary Defense said they had supplied the Naval-Airforce wing with unmanned aircrafts (UAV) and stressed that the SLAF stay abreast of the latest in the field of technology and that asymmetric plans be constantly modified.
The UAVs which were effectively used against the LTTE were indigenized and further developed by the SLAF during the war and the Defense Secretary said they would work on further developing research on these crafts, UAV aircrafts will be leading future air battles and surveillance, said Waidyaratne.
He added these developments in security would also be used for benefit of the public in future.

Dengue rising with ongoing rains
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the National Dengue Control Unit to implement mosquito control activities without interruption because there is a possibility of dengue increasing with the ongoing rains in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, North Western and Northern Provinces, a Health Ministry Spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, a total of 158,024 dengue patients and 394 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of the country this year up to October 9 (last Monday). This is the highest number of dengue patients and deaths reported in Sri Lanka so far. There is a possibility of dengue increasing again with the ongoing rains, he said.
Meanwhile, the National Dengue Control Unit sources said during the last National Mosquito Control Week which concluded on September 26, the inspectors discovered positive mosquito breeding sites in construction sites (6 percent), religious places (3 percent), schools (2 percent) and institution (3 percent).
If there are dengue patients at home, school or workplaces, residents should inform the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) or the Public Health Inspector (PHI) of the area for mosquito control activities and outbreak prevention. If a large number of schoolchildren are infected with dengue, school authorities should arrange early shramadana activities, the sources said.
If anyone is suffering from fever, seek medical attention without delay. Appropriate treatment should be given according to medical advice.
"Those who are diagnosed with the more severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), they should be hospitalized for in-ward care. All should be protected from mosquito bites during daytime.
"Children when resting during daytime and those who are suffering from fever should be nursed under a bed net to avoid mosquito bites, the sources added.

Dilruwan  Lankas silent match winner
DUBAI, Thursday  He is the silent performer, hardly in the news with his most illustrious team mate Rangana Herath hogging the limelight most of the time with his outstanding left-arm bowling.
But in his own way Dilruwan Perera has become an integral part of the Sri Lanka cricket teams bowling combination and played the support role to Herath to almost near perfection.
On Tuesday at the Dubai International Stadium, the roles were reversed as Perera played the role of chief destroyer of the Pakistan second innings taking five wickets for 98 to bowl his team to a series clinching 2-0 win.
Amongst his victims were Pakistans top order batters like Shan Masood, Haris Sohail, Babar Azam and skipper Sarfraz Ahmed. Herath was left to clean up the tail which he did by dismissing Yasir Shah and Wahab Riaz.
Pakistan concentrated too much on Rangana and tried to prevent him from taking wickets. They came with that plan and they didnt think that I can be a threat to them, said Perera. I knew on this pitch the ball would turn and I concentrated bowling in the right areas.
We bowl according to the match situations. In the last Test (Abu Dhabi) when Rangana was taking wickets my role was to close up one end and help him get wickets from the other. Today the roles were changed because I was taking the wickets and Rangana played the role of containing the batsmen. Thats how we complement each other.
It was Pereras fifth five-for in a Test innings and on four of those occasions Sri Lanka had ended up winners. Having begun his Test career at the age of 31 Perera who made his debut in 2014 has 93 wickets in his bag from 22 Tests at an average of 32.
He is currently being played as a bowling all-rounder at number seven because of his ability to contribute with the bat as well having scored 783 runs (avg. 21.75) with six fifties (highest score 95).
Bowling with the pink ball Perera said that there was a difference when it lost its shine.
The one difference with the pink ball is that when it gets old it wont grip the surface so much. Thats what happened to us last night (4th day) we couldnt get much turn because of the dew as well and Pakistan was able to bat comfortably, said Perera. We knew the next day with the second new ball available we will be able to get the required grip from the surface.
The pitch at Abu Dhabi helped the batsmen in the first four days, it was only on the fifth day that it began helping the spinners, but here the ball began to spin from day two and by the time we came to the fifth day we knew the runs we had on the board was sufficient to get Pakistan out, said Perera who went through a tough series against India at home.
I came here with a plan because against India I did not have the right rhythm. I did a few adjustments to my bowling thats how I was successful in this series. I also gained confidence because I was able to contribute with the bat as well, said Perera.
I only bowl the off break but my biggest plus factor is that I am able to vary my deliveries and also bowl the arm ball which goes away from the batsman. The key to my wicket taking is the off spinner that drifts, he said.
Perera who is not part of the Sri Lanka one-day squad will return home to prepare for next months three Test series in India.
We have the Mercantile one-day tournament to prepare for India. I am concentrating on the three tests with India. I think I can perform better than I did against them in the last series if I can produce this same form, he said.

Frontier markets show divergent credit paths: Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that frontier markets (FMs) will show differentiated credit exposure to rising interest rates globally, just as they demonstrated divergent shock absorption capacities during the commodity price slump of 2014-2015.
In addition, the debt levels of FM sovereigns will remain elevated and they will continue to spend more on debt service costs in the next year.
Benign global liquidity conditions have permitted some FMs to raise commercial USD sovereign debt, at relatively favorable rates, says Anne Van Praagh, a Moodys Managing Director. One quarter of FMs had issued new debt on commercial terms as of August 2017. Meanwhile, some FMs are relying on finance and investment from China and less on multilateral concessional debt.
Looking ahead, as global liquidity conditions evolve, elevated debt service costs and liquidity risks are key credit challenges for FMs, she said. The ability of individual FMs to handle rising interest rates and rollover of commercial debt is differentiated. Vulnerabilities are highest for those countries where high leverage combines with a constrained ability by domestic policymakers to ease monetary policy and preserve fiscal flexibility.
Vulnerability to rising global interest rates is highest in Mongolia (Caa1 stable), Mozambique (Caa3 negative) and Egypt (B3 stable)- with these sovereigns demonstrating limited available fiscal and monetary space - and buffers vary across FMs.
Bangladesh (Ba3 stable), Nigeria (B1 stable), and Vietnam (B1 positive), in contrast, are better positioned to withstand higher interest rates.
Moodys says that the strength of institutions determines a sovereigns ability to counter negative shocks, such as a rise in global capital costs. In many FMs, weak institutions constrain their ability to buffer against shocks.
In addition, direct external vulnerability risks are high for around one quarter of FM sovereigns that Moodys rates. Reliance on foreign capital to fund current account deficits heightens the vulnerability of these sovereigns to capital outflows or lower inflows that can exacerbate difficulties in meeting current account and external debt payment obligations.
These external vulnerabilities are highest in Tajikistan (B3 stable), Belarus (Caa1 stable), Mongolia, and Georgia (Ba2 stable). Moodys views on Frontier Markets are contained in its just-released report titled Frontier markets: Divergent credit paths.
Moodys rates 36 FM countries, most of which carry ratings in the B1-B3 range. Of the 36, downgrades have outnumbered upgrades and none have climbed to investment grade since their sovereign rating was initiated.
Moodys will be elaborating on its assessment of FMs when Van Praagh speaks on a Frontier Markets panel at the 2017 IIF Annual Membership Meeting on October 11, 2017 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC.

The Attorney General yesterday opposed Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpilas request that he be allowed to travel to Italy from October 17 to November 4 to attend a function.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for his Rs. 20 million alleged fraudulent share transaction, sought Colombo High Courts permission to temporarily lift his travel ban.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe that Gammanpilas request cannot be considered at this moment since court was unable to conclude recording evidence from Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, the key witness in this case.
It would be unfair to the aggrieved party, if court allowed the accused to go abroad without concluding his evidence, who has travelled all the way from Australia, Ratnayake said.
The High Court is to consider MP Gammanpilas request on the next trial date.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, the first witness in the alleged financial fraud case is to be further cross-examined on October 17.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling the shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail.

Govt can decide on future action after UN Special Rapporteurs report:Ministry
The UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence Pablo de Greiff is currently on an official country visit to the country.
During the visit, the Special Rapporteur is scheduled to meet with Ministers and Members of Parliament, Government officials at central and provincial levels, civil society, religious leaders, academics and representatives of the international community in Sri Lanka.
He will travel to Trincomalee, Mannar, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Kandy and Matara. He will deliver two public lectures, one in Jaffna and one in Colombo, and address the media at the conclusion of his visit on October 23, following the practice of all Special Rapporteurs with respect to country visits. As required of Special Rapporteurs, he will present a Report on his visit to the Human Rights Council, in September 2018.
Successive Governments in Sri Lanka have been inviting such Special Rapporteurs to the country to obtain their views and expert advice on specific thematic areas. Governments are not bound by the advice or recommendations of Special Rapporteurs, but can avail of the expert knowledge and experience of Special Rapporteurs who are available to Governments as a resource. Their advice and expertise can be obtained by countries in a manner that would benefit institutional capacity building, policy formulation, and policy reform, training needs etc., as a Government may consider necessary.
The attention of this Ministry has been drawn to some media reports connected to this visit, which give erroneous and misleading information.
Mr.de Greiff, as is the case of all Special Rapporteurs, is an Independent Expert in a specific subject area. Special Rapporteurs are mandated to report and advise Governments on human rights from a thematic or country-specific approach. Mr. de Greiffs mandate is thematic. His mandate, approved by the Human Rights Council in 2011, is the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence which are the four elements of a comprehensive approach to transitional justice which focuses on promoting healing and reconciliation, establishing independent oversight of the security system and restoring confidence in the institutions of the State and promoting the rule of law. His mandate allows him to make recommendations and advise countries concerning, inter alia, judicial and non-judicial measures when designing and implementing strategies, policies and measures for addressing violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law. In his work, the Special Rapporteur follows a victim-centred approach and integrates a gender perspective. The victim-centred approach means all victims of a situation of conflict and not one group or one community.
Like any other Special Rapporteur,de Greiff too undertakes country visits at the invitation of Governments. The country visits he has undertaken so far includes the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Spain, Tunisia, Uruguay, Burundi, and Gambia. The terms of office of Special Rapporteurs are decided by the Members of the Human Rights Council.
Once de Greiff presents his Report to the Human Rights Council in September 2018, it is for the Government of Sri Lanka to decide whether there is anything that the Government considers beneficial to the people of Sri Lanka in his recommendations, and whether the Government wishes to draw on his knowledge, expertise and advice and consult him further in any manner.

Heavy fine for errant public officials
Non declaration of assets: fine to be increased to Rs 100,000
New ACT GETS CABINET APPROVAL
Public officials who fail to declare their assets will in future incur a fine of Rs 100,000 according to the recent Cabinet paper approved this week.
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala this week sought Cabinet approval to increase the fine imposed on those who did not declare their assets from Rs 1,000 to Rs 100,000.
A person involved in public life needs to adhere to the tenets of honesty, integrity and transparency, she stated in her Cabinet paper for the increase in fine and explained that given the higher stakes today, a mere fine of Rs 1,000 was insufficient to motivate politicians or public officials to declare their assets.
The Declaration of Assets Act No 1 of 1975 requires that a public official declare his or her; assets and liabilities, the assets and liabilities of his or her spouse, the assets and liabilities of each child in and outside Sri Lanka and to provide for investigations to be conducted upon complaints made against a person to whom the law applies.
Those who fail without a reasonable cause, to make any declaration of assets and liabilities which he or she is required to make, who makes any false statement in any such declaration, who fails without reasonable cause to give such additional information as the Bribery Commissioner may require under the law; or who otherwise contravenes any provision of the law, will be guilty of an offense, states the Act further. Section 9 (1) of the Act which deals with fines, will thus be amended to state Rs 100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both.
Cabinet granted approval for the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to make the necessary amendments.

Help him
L. L. K. Karunaratne of Aluthwatta in Palatuwa, Matara, is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and urgently needs a liver transplant to save his life according to Consultant Transplant Surgeon Dr. Ruwan Dissanayake.
This life-saving procedure and related expenses for medicines would cost Rs. 6 million if carried out locally and Rs. 10 to 15 million if carried out overseas.
Karunaratne, who is a teacher attached to Sultanagoda Maha Vidyalaya, says he is unable to foot this bill due to his present financial plight.
He requests philanthropists and the public to assist his cause by sending whatever financial contributions possible to help expedite the transplant surgery and save his life. All contributions should be remitted to account number 152200150052148 at the Peoples Bank, Matara Dharmapala Mawatha Branch. His contact numbers are 071 6310385, 071 7683757 and 076 5865340.

Islandwide emergency ambulance service from next year
The emergency Pre-Hospital Care Ambulance Service now available in the Western and Southern Provinces free of charge, will be expanded covering the entire country by next year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, currently there are 88 ambulances in service and this number will be increased to 250. Steiger Foundation of Germany will provide 24 helicopters, 1,025 ambulances and 24 emergency vehicles. But only helicopters and emergency vehicles were obtained by Sri Lanka considering the existing road traffic congestion in the country. He was addressing the gathering after distributing first aid equipment among schools and MOH offices during a ceremony held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that sometimes ambulances could not travel through roads due to traffic congestion and therefore accident services in Sri Lanka need to be implemented by air and land. New accident wards are to be established in 24 General Hospitals and Teaching Hospitals located island wide. A total of 48 blood transfusion centres have already been established island wide.
A total of 43 percent accidents take place at home, while 26 percent of the accidents take place on roads from the total number of accidents that take place in the country. Two percent of the total number of accidents take place at workplaces. Around 10,000 accidents take place in Sri Lanka annually, he added.
The first hour of the accident is called the `Golden Hour due to the importance of it to save the life of a victim. The first ten minutes of the first hour is the most crucial time period when it comes to saving the life of the accident victim. About 50 percent of accident deaths can be cut down if required medical care can be given to the accident victims during this time.

Journalist seen actively taking part in Hambantota protest: Sagala
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said Susantha Bandara Karunaratne, the journalist who claimed he was assaulted by a senior police officer during a protest in Hambantota last week, had actively taken part in the protest.
"He was not assaulted when carrying out the duties of a journalist. Karunaratne's active involvement in the protest, despite a Court order, had led to the confrontation with the police," the Minister said.
The Daily News is now in possession of several photographs in which Susantha Bandara Karunaratne, the journalist who claimed he was assaulted by a senior Police officer, is seen actively taking part in the protest, holding placards.
"The law should apply to both sides equally. While the police officer is under criticism for slapping a protester in the heat of the moment, it is also important to know that Karunaratne was not assaulted while covering the protest as a journalist. He was a protester actively taking part in the demonstration. The incident has to be understood in the right context," Ratnayaka explained.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara has already called for a report on the incident from the regional police chiefs.

Kyrgios fined for storming off court in Shanghai
Shanghai: Temperamental Australian Nick Kyrgios was fined $10,000 and lost another $21,085 in prize money on Wednesday after storming off midway through his first-round match at the Shanghai Masters.
Roger Federer meanwhile survived a scare as he struggled past Argentine Diego Schwartzman, but Rafael Nadal raced into the third round as he attempts to win one of the rare tournaments that has eluded him.
But it was the 22-year-old Kyrgios who was again in the spotlight following what was just his latest controversy on Tuesday.
The ATP said it had fined Kyrgios for unsportsmanlike conduct and he will not collect his prize money because he failed to get signed off for a medical after retiring from his match against Steve Johnson.
Kyrgios's time at the Shanghai Masters is over after he also pulled out of his scheduled doubles match with Frenchman Lucas Pouille on Wednesday.
He apologised after walking off court on Tuesday, having lost the first-set tie break.
In a statement posted on Twitter a few hours later he said that he had a "stomach bug" and had hurt his shoulder.
It was a nasty case of deja vu for the world number 21 -- a year ago he argued with spectators and was accused of giving away points in a defeat in Shanghai.
The talented but fiery Kyrgios was consequently fined and suspended. His immediate future in tennis is again under threat following Tuesday's incident, when he hastily exited the court with jeers and boos ringing in his ears. It came after he complained about the umpire and spectators in the arena, and was docked a point penalty for the second match running because of his conduct, which included blasting a ball out of the court in a flash of rage.
"What's happening here" he asked, seemingly irritated by spectators moving around between points in the tie break.
"Exactly why I shouldn't come here," he muttered, later adding: "Sick of this place."
Swiss legend Federer was far from his best against Schwartzman and next faces another potential banana skin in Ukrainian qualifier Alexandr Dolgopolov. There were 24 places in the rankings between number two Federer and Schwartzman and a significant height difference -- Federer towering over the 170cm (five foot seven inch) Argentine.
But Schwartzman cut the 185cm Federer down to size and an unusually error-strewn performance from Federer was summed up when he squandered an easy backhand volley at the net to go to the first-set tie break, which the Swiss eventually won 7/4. Still Schwartzman refused to go quietly in the second set, before Federer battled through 7-6, 6-4.
In contrast, Nadal was fast in dumping out the American Jared Donaldson in 54 minutes, but rising star Alexander Zverev was even faster -- on court for just 12 minutes when Britain's Aljaz Bedene retired hurt.
The 20-year-old Zverev, the German prodigy, faces 16th seed Juan Martin del Potro on Thursday in arguably the match of the day. Top seed Nadal takes on the colourful Italian Fabio Fognini and said he was hoping to keep hold of the world number spot from old rival Federer at the end of the year.
"If that happens will be I think a very important achievement for me," said the 31-year-old Spaniard, fresh from winning the China Open in Beijing.
"(It) will be number one four times in my career at the end of the season with so many years of difference (between the first time and this), I think that is something very difficult."
Grigor Dimitrov, Bulgaria's sixth seed, had an almighty scare and saved three match points before pulling through against the American Ryan Harrison.
Also through in Shanghai, where matches were forced indoors because of the rain, were Gilles Simon of France, Sam Querrey of the United States, Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff and Kyrgios's conqueror Johnson. AFP

Licence for toddy tapping
The Excise Ordinance is to be amended to reintroduce the licensing system for the tapping of Kithul, Palmyrah and Coconut trees for toddy.
In 2011 and 2013, Section 15 of the Excise Ordinance was amended to exempt Kithul, Palmyrah and Coconut from having to obtain a license to tap for toddy or draw toddy from the trees mentioned above.
A Cabinet paper submitted by Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera this week however, pointed out that these exemptions have simply led to greater difficulties faced by the Department of Excise and they have found it difficult to monitor the volume of liquor produced from toddy and in the collection of excise duty as they could not monitor the quantities of toddy received by distilleries, toddy taverns, etc
He thus asked that Cabinet approve the proposal to bring back the tapping and drawing of toddy from Coconut, Kithul and Palmyrah trees into the licensing system. Cabinet thereby granted approval to establish a regulatory methodology to monitor the quantities of toddy received to distilleries, toddy taverns, bottled toddy manufacturers and vinegar manufacturers and preserve tax revenue and control unlawful toddy production by calculating the toddy harvest drawn from a tree as per Excise Regulations.
The new amendments are to be published in a gazette and presented to Parliament soon.

Lightning strike leaves train commuters stranded
The sudden train strike last evening resulted in a tense situation at the Colombo Fort and Maradana Railway stations. All trains starting from Colombo Fort and Maradana, were cancelled due to trade union action staged by the engine drivers and railway guards yesterday.
The Railway Control Room said that trains operating after 5.30 pm were cancelled due to the strike launched by the Locomotive Operating Engineers Union.
Thousands of commuters were left stranded which resulted in a tense situation since the train services were cancelled without prior notice.
Sources said the trade union action resulted due to talks between trade unions and higher officials breaking down over the recruitment of engine driver assistants.According to sources, Trade unions had protested a change in the procedure of recruitment of engine driver assistants.
Assistant Transportation Superintendent (Operation) of the Railway Department said they were not given prior notice of a strike in the evening. But the engine drivers and guards have not reported to duty, he said.
Meanwhile, the SLTB deployed additional buses to provide service to commuters. Chief Superintendent (Operation) SLTB Chandrasiri said that discussions were underway with the Gampaha, Kalutara and Colombo Bus Companies to deploy more buses for the convenience of the commuters.

Low income families refuse to move from shanties to apartments
The 500-unit condominium apartment complex in Angoda built for low income families in Colombo has been put up for sale as the families have refused to move from their shanties in Colombo to condominiums in Angoda.
The Urban Regeneration Project under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five-storeyed condominium apartment complex on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises. The Ministry had proposed this as a solution to remove undeserving settlements from the heart of Colombo.
The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
The low income families, however, have stated that they were not willing to move to Angoda, given their childrens education, access to work and other amenities and facilities.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka this week submitted a Cabinet proposal to sell these flats to members of the tri-forces, lower middle income government servants, artistes, small and medium scale businessmen, and women and civil activists.

Magnificent historical haven
Located at Sir Marcus Fernando Mawatha the National Museum is a majestic construction that is a familiar site to those in Colombo. With a long history, it is one of the most famous of the old Colonial buildings in the country. The Daily News spoke to Archt. Ismeth Raheem on the National Museum where he shared some known insights of the construction of the National Museum.
Raheem highlighted some material from one of his books on architecture of this massive building.
The Colombo Museum Complex provided the public whether Briton, Ceylonese middle class or hoi polloi with an important cultural facility. It was set out majestically on 12 acre garden in a prestigious site in Edinburgh Crescent (presently Sir Marcus Fernando Mawatha) and set the tone and scale for many of the civic buildings at the time. Its Architect at the time was James G. Smithers (1833- 1910) who was the Chief Government Architect from 1867  1883. His Designs encompassed a remarkable range of styles which varied in complexity and scale from residential bungalows to larger civil buildings, he said.
The Colombo Museum Complex was his most outstanding work and stands as one of the finest achievements in 19th century Colonial Architecture in South East Asia.
The two floor building is ingeniously designed around several courtyards which provide ventilation, a necessity in a tropical climate particularly before the advent of electrical or mechanically aided ventilation.
This elegant structure is effectively enclosed by an arcaded verandah protecting the building against the harsh monsoon rains and glare. The Verandahs not only provide a functional and practical space, but also aesthetically enhance the buildings appearance.
The focal feature is the portico from which the building is approached by a flight of steps leading into the entrance lobby lined with Ionic columns. Beyond the lobby is the grand staircase leading to the upper floor exhibition halls. The shallow pitched roof is effectively concealed by a parapet balustrade heightened by pediments over the entrances. The interior including the floor and ceiling is exquisitely finished and fitted with local wood Raheem said.
Raheem also pointed out that the original purpose was for it to be a scientific, historic and anthropological artifact museum like the British Museum. It encompassed everything. The original purpose of the museum 100 years ago was just a collection of artifacts. It also features the regalia of the country, including the throne and crown of the Kandyan monarchs.
The whole Museum idea must have been around three to four years old. It was opened in 1877, but any big idea like establishing a museum involved curators, specimens, equipment, space and staff. So it must have taken around three to four years. The contractor has to be paid, then you have to consider the lighting and you need to consider who will staff the museum. Then you need to advertise to get the staff. You cant hire just anyone. The salary scale has to be set. It is a huge task. I dont know exactly how long it took for the above to be in place but it was opened in 1877. Those days it was manned by scientists and zoologists such as Dr. Arthur Willey and Dr. Joseph Pearson, Dr. P. E. P. Deraniyagala, Dr. P. H. D. H. de Silva and Sirinimal Lakdusinghe, said Raheem.
The whole idea belonged to its founder Sir William Henry Gregory, the British Governor of Ceylon (1816  1892). However the purpose of the building has changed now. The construction of the museum was carried out by Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar, is a legend and a story. Whether he constructed the whole building or part of it is debatable. They even spread the story that because he was a Muslim, they closed the museum on a Friday.
The museum caters to different interests. There are people who are interested in history and many other subjects. There are a very valuable collection of coins. There is a very valuable collection of textiles. The importance depends on the person. If he is interested in bronze statues of the Polonnaruwa period, you can find that in the museum. Over the years there has been a lot of remodeling. The natural history section was added much later. However it is still considered as one of the best colonial buildings, explained Raheem.
During the British times the emphasis was quite different. There was a lot of emphasis on Colonial furniture and history. Now we have received independence and it has changed a lot since then. The emphasis and focus has changed, said Raheem.
The Colombo National Museum Library was also established on January 1, 1877 incorporating the Government Oriental Library that had been established in 1870. Since 1885, by law, a copy of every document printed in the country has to be deposited in the museum library.

Minister Kabir Hashim, following his testimony before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday, told media that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was Highways Minister had left behind a series of unpaid bills amounting to billions.
Minister Hashim addressing media outside the court room of the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday afternoon said he had treated the ministry as a play house.
Minister Hashim, explaining as to why he was summoned before the Commission said that he was asked about the Breakfast meeting he attended at the Central Bank on February 26, 2015. Minister Hashim said he and his ministry officials participated in the said meeting to request emergency funding for several road development projects which were unpaid by the previous regime.
I went to this meeting accompanied by my ministrys accountant and other officials to request funds for these projects which were already finished. Former Highways Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa had acted like this ministry was his play house. There were millions of unpaid bills we had to see through, Minister Hashim pointed out. Hashim also reprimanded certain groups who have said that he and Minister Malik Samarawickreme have requested President Maithripala Sirisena to postpone the hearing in an attempt to dodge giving evidence.
He said it is the responsibility of a good citizen of a country to appear before a court to give evidence when summoned and emphasised that it is the same values of good governance that he upholds.
As a citizen it is our responsibility to provide our full cooperation for an ongoing investigation. One should never refuse to do so or run away from it. I fulfilled my responsibility today by giving evidence before the Commission today, he added.

We had a chat to some of the players who did not make this tour and we had long chats with them to understand what their thinking was. Then we shared what our thinking was, said Labrooy who was here for the second Test against Pakistan.
Some of them were feeling they were bowling all-rounders and from the support staff and selectors point of view we thought they were batting all-rounders. We tried to clear those areas and let the players know where they stand.
On Lasith we rested him for the ODIs because he has been playing ODIs after a while and we gave him a break. We are looking forward to bringing him back for the T20Is. We still feel that he can contribute in the ODIs as long as he is on top of his fitness and match fitness. We still have him in our radar for the ODIs, he said. What the new selection committee headed by Labrooy has brought in is the trust on the players that there would be consistency in selections so that everyone gets a fair chance to prove himself.
Before the team came to the UAE we spoke only to the captain and vice-captain we didnt have much time to speak to the rest of the team but we passed on the message that we are looking for continuity, said Labrooy.
We basically said that once you identify the players we will continue playing them and giving them that confidence rather than shoving them in and out. If they are selected to play in a Test match or ODI and they are good enough we will continue with the identified lot as long as possible and give them a fair chance of performing out in the middle rather than letting them play one or two innings and replacing them with somebody else. Thats one confidence we gave them, he said.
We also said that we will identify their skills and let them play in their areas where they are comfortable in. For example if someone wants to be an opener or bat at no. 3 we will let him play in that position. Just because we want to make the 11 we would not bring him back into the middle order.
In that aspect thats why players like Kaushal Silva and Chamara Kapugedera have been persisted with and Kusal Mendis asked to bat at number four.
It is how we give them opportunities whether we give them about six innings at a stretch and pull them out and bring
them back again or to give them six innings continuously and then theyve got to fight for their place in the team, said Labrooy.
Kaushal Silva or anybody else if somebody is a middle order batsman he
will remain in the middle order. Just because we want to strengthen the batting we wont shuffle the players up and down the order.
Kapugedera is another player who has been in and out of the squad. He has been given a lot of chances but again not on a continuous basis maybe as a stop gap or a person who has always been on standby. We also have Kusal Perera, Angelo Mathews and Asela Gunaratne to come in, so it will be interesting going forward when they are 100 percent fit. All these players in the middle order will have to compete against each other.
On Mendis batting position Labrooy said, With Kusal Perera, Gunaratne and Mathews to come in we have been still discussing that. We feel that the best we can get out from Mendis is at no. 4. We have to see how we can fit in Mathews and Gunaratne in the middle order.
Lahiru Thirimanne is another cricketer whose selection and appointment to the vice-captaain raised eyebrows.
The success in our cricket goes back to the late seventies where lots of the captains and vice captains have worked out very well. We try to give them the experience and the confidence which they need. Thats one reason we gave Lahiru the vice-captaincy looking at the future 4-5 years down, who are our leaders and also that they need to work in pairs, said Labrooy.
We feel he is a good enough player to be in the side and he has been given that opportunity. Hes been scoring runs in the last two ODIs and based on that we are confident that he will basically make good on the longer version of the game. As Chandimals vice-captain they work together well and we want that partnership to build on the long term.
One of the areas the new selection committee that also comprises Gamini Wickremasinghe, Jerry Woutersz, Sajith Fernando and Asanka Gurusinha, the cricket manager has emphasised is fitness which had been a core issue during the recent defeats suffered by the national team.
We have stressed on the fitness and it goes back to where the Sports Minister laid down a fitness test where you need to get through a yoyo with a minimum standard and your skin falls has to be less. Thats one reason we are not rushing Mathews, we want him 100 percent fit. We have a long Indian tour coming up and we want most of them fit for that, said Labrooy.
There were lots of changes done by the previous selection committee but to be fair by them there were lots of injuries and they were forced to make changes. They had a tough job because there was lots of cricket played and players were getting injured.
Labrooy 53, who holds a unique record of not playing any of his 9 Tests and 44 ODIs for his country at home said that he was glad for the boys they won the series against Pakistan.
They needed the win very badly playing away from the pressure back at home also helped them. They stuck to their guns and they stuck to their plans and delivered that win. I hope they can build on that confidence and take it forward from here.
Labrooy, a tall right-arm fast bowler who represented CCC in domestic club cricket and was later a match referee said that he undertook the job of head selector (after turning it down previously on four occasions) because he thought the time was right to give back something to cricket.
I declined the post of selector four times because there were many people who were around who would take it and do it. This time I thought if I was to give back something to cricket I would put up my hand especially at a time when the team was going through a difficult period and the whole cricketing fraternity was against them. I thought I try and get Sri Lanka back to winning ways, Labrooy said.

Man of the Series and Man of the Match: Dimuth defines his role in team as anchor man
DUBAI, Wednesday  To stabilize the Sri Lankan batting order since the retirements of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene has fallen on the shoulders of left-handed opener Dimuth Karunaratne and he certainly wants to play that role to perfection.
Karunaratne won the second Man of the Series award of his career when he steered Sri Lanka to a morale-boosting 2-0 series win over Pakistan at Dubai on Tuesday.
It was his marathon career best knock of 196 that gave Sri Lanka their first innings total of 482 on which they later built their 68-run series clinching victory. Prior to that Karunaratne put his team on course for another big first innings total in the first Test at Abu Dhabi when he blunted the Pakistan bowlers scoring 93 off 205 balls. These two knocks fetched him a total of 306 runs in the two Tests for an average of 76.50 to edge out Rangana Herath (16 wickets) for the Man of the Series award. Karunaratne also bagged the Man of the Match award as well which was the first of his career and probably with many more to come.
Our batting coach Hashan Thilakaratne worked with me and stressed how I should be playing the anchor role in the team. Adjust to situations and bat longer. That is my role and others to bat around me, said Karunaratne after receiving his awards.
When I occupy one end it is easier for others to play their shots and that is how the team is working. My job is play out the new ball. That is the toughest thing to do as an opener. Once you do that while the others cash in, you also need to get some runs for yourself.
I know that what I have done on top of the order has made things easier for others. Kumar (Sangakkara) once told me that why are you doing the tough job and then getting out rather than going onto make a big one. Even in club cricket, what I do is to bat for long and get big runs once I get a good start, he said.
There were a few technical issues to overcome before Karunaratne could adjust to his present role.
I had some issues with the new ball. My head was falling over. I had that problem from the time I was playing for school. I have worked on that area and rectified the errors. The last Indian series I got out to Umesh Yadav the same fashion, said Karunaratne.
I asked Kumar how to play the inswing. I watched Kumars videos. County games also I watched a lot. He plays well to the ball that comes in. What he identified was that as I am tapping the bat, the head goes down and the eyes are not positioned properly. You may have seen that when I bat at the start I try to stand straight. That is easy for the bowlers who bring the ball into you.
I also had a chat with our batting coach and sorted a few things out. I am not usually troubled by spin bowling theres nothing to change there. Once I survive the new ball I know what has to be done.
I have a few areas to work on in batting against left-arm quicks. My technique needs to improve. I had a few issues when they bring the ball back in. I play with two minds. If I am able to rectify that technique it will be better.
Karunaratne has had the misfortune of getting dismissed in the 190s or in the 90s and he certainly is disappointed at missing out on a couple of milestones in his career.
I was very disappointed to get out for 196. I knew that was Wahabs (Riaz) last over. I wanted the strike to attack the leg-spinner because I knew I could score off him. I didnt think that he was going to cut the ball in. The run out (at Abu Dhabi for 93) of course I usually try to rotate the strike and get singles. When I am in the 80s and 90s I try to get singles. That is how I got out, said Karunaratne.
Yes I feel upset. You do the hard work and not to get the hundred and double hundred is disappointing. I dont think anyone has scored a double since Kumar. It was a great opportunity and I missed it. Glad that I scored a hundred with the pink ball. I should have gone onto get a double. Lets see what happens. Next time I will put in more hard work. In a way it is good as that it will make me work harder, he said.
To overcome his disappointment at getting out in the 90s Karunaratne has been working on it with Tillakaratne.
What I try to do is to get the singles in. If the field is up I play shots. Even at club cricket, if a weak bowler is operating, I never try to get to the hundred by scoring a boundary. I should have stayed on, said Karunaratne. Unfortunately to get run out in Abu Dhabi and here I was trying to score a shot. I have been told not to think of it. Even during Marvans (Atapattu) time, he had told me not to watch the scoreboard but to just play the game.
During his lengthy innings of 196 Karunaratne became on the third Sri Lankan opener to cross the 3000 run mark in Test cricket after Sanath Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu.
I would like to bat through the innings. That allows others to bat freely. If I bat for a day, I will get a hundred. I need to be calm and take time. There are bowlers against whom you can score quickly and others whom you cannot, said Karunaratne 29, who has seven hundreds to his name in 44 Tests.
The role I have been given by Hashan is to be positive. If I can get 20 to 25 Test hundreds at the end of my career that will be great. It could be a little bit higher as well depending on how it goes.
Will you get close to Sangakkara who has 38 Test hundreds
Youll never know. I have lots of confidence now, lets see how it goes.

## Title: MARTIAL LAW RIOTS IN 1915 IN CEYLON AS A RESULT OF A JUDGEMENT: Order in chaos
## Supertitle:

MARTIAL LAW RIOTS IN 1915 IN CEYLON AS A RESULT OF A JUDGEMENT: Order in chaos
The Martial Law was declared in 1915 in Ceylon by Sir Robert Chalmers the then Governor. The British Government Agent of Kandy was directly responsible for the riots.
The rioting was in consequence of the denial by the GA of the Central Province to the Buddhists of Gampola, permission to conduct their procession as of old, from their temple, with music rights, through Ambegamuwa Street, to a part of the Mahaweli Ganga. An application was made to the GA by the Trustee/Nilame of the Devale, on August 27, 1912. But the British GA refused to grant his permission on the ground that the Hambaya Mohameddans (not the Ceylon Moors), who had recently built a mosque in Ambegamuwa Street, objected to the Buddhist procession passing their mosque with music.
The Trustee of the Devale let the preparations for the procession temporarily slide, and instituted an Action in the District Court of Kandy in September 1913, complaining that the GA wrongfully and in breach of the Kandyan Convention (signed in 1815 by the British Govt and the Kandyan Chieftains), refused the Plaintiff permission to conduct the procession through that portion of the Ambegamuwa Street, within one hundred yards of the Hambaya Mohameddans mosque, with the accompaniment of music, as was done for hundreds of years.
With the coming of the British Rule, a disturbing element crept in. The Coastal Moors from South India, identified as the Hambaya Mohameddans (some of the most fanatical and intolerant among the Muslims of India), came to Ceylon in large numbers for purposes of trade and were allowed to establish themselves in various towns. The Ceylon Muslims somewhat looked down upon these coastal moors. They, therefore, erected their own mosques for their worship.
Divide and rule policy
They then insisted on the stoppage of all music whenever a procession passed one of their mosques. This was a preposterous and unprecedented demand, which the British GA gladly gave into, in a predominantly Buddhist country of nearly 82% Buddhists, and not even half percent Coastal Moors! Processions, like Peraheras, play an important part in the religious and national life of the people. The stoppage of this particular procession was bound to lead to trouble. It was the obtuse intransigence of the Coastal Moors (the Hambayas) that was the direct cause of the Riots of 1915. The GA and the British authorities foolishly and shortsightedly backed the demands of the Coastal Moors.
In any event, the British adopted the policy of Divide and Rule, in all the countries they colonised.
In this instance, it boomeranged on the British.
For the Diyakapana ceremony, the procession from time immemorial had gone from the Devale along Ambegamuwa Street to Porutota, to the Mahaweli Ganga, with the accompaniment of music. It had to pass some Christian churches, Hindu temples and even some mosques of the Ceylon Moors. No one objected to this perahera passing these places of worship with music. These Coastal Moors threatened to riot if the perahera passed with music within 100 yards of their mosque.
On the refusal of the British GA to grant him a license, the Basnayake Nilame Tikiri Banda Elikewela on Sept 30, 1913, filed an Action against the British Attorney General of Ceylon. The Plaint was settled by the well known Kandy lawyer C A La Brooy. To this Plaint, the AG filed answer through F C Liefching, settled by Sir Thomas Garvin  Solicitor General. Sir Thomas was later elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. He was assisted by Crown Counsel V M Fernando (later Justice Fernando).
The Trial in the District Court of Kandy came up before a Christian judge, Sir Paul E Peiris (DLitt Cantab) Barrister and of the Ceylon Civil Service. He was one of the cleverest judges of his day surpassing the intellect of many a British judge.
The Judgement of the District Judge Sir Paul, permitting the perahera to pass along the streets accompanied by music, was delivered in June 1914. He found that instead of binding the Hambaya Mohammedans of the mosque to keep the peace, the British GA directed the Police to plant pipes 50 yards away from each side of the mosque and to inform the Buddhists that they should not sound their music while going over these 100 yards. Incidentally, Sir Pauls daughter Miriam de Saram was a great meditator, though a practising Christian. Two of her sons, Rohan and Druvi, are world famous musicians, the former a cellist and the latter a pianist.
At the trial before Sir Paul, Sir Stewart Schneider with C A La Brooy, E W Perera, Charles Batuwantudawe and D R Wijewardene (owner of Lake House) appeared for the Plaintiff. After the DJ Sir Paul gave judgement in favour of the Plaintiff Basnayake Nilame, the British authorities promptly appealed against this judgement.
We can see to what extent they would go to appease those whom they are sponsoring. The present generation of British rulers is no better. The leopard can never change its spots. The Appeal came up before Justice W S Shaw and Sir Thomas E de Sampayo KC and was argued from January 18 to 21, 1915. Sir Anton Bertram KC Attorney General, with James Van Langenburg KC Solicitor General, and V M Fernando Crown Counsel appeared for the Govt. B W Bawa KC with E W Perera and D R Wijewardene of Lake House fame appeared for Plaintiff-Respondent Elikawela. This was during the World War II (1914 to 1918).
British planters
In 1915, the riots between the Sinhalese and the Coastal Moors broke out and spread to Kandy and other neighbouring areas. The British panicked. They thought that this was to oust them from Ceylon. The Governor Sir Robert Chalmers was determined to quell the riots by foul means or fair. He declared Martial Law with orders to shoot the Sinhalese at sight. Before his arrival in Ceylon, he was the financial genius of the British Treasury, who prepared the famous budget of Prime Minister Lloyd George in 1909. As a reward for his services, he was sent to Ceylon as Governor. He was no administrator. He lived in an ivory tower, in Queens House, Colombo, and Queens Cottage in Nuwara Eliya. He was a Pali scholar. Chalmers Granaries in Pettah was named after him. Now it houses the SL Customs.
Herbert Dowbeggin, the IGP, enlisted the British planters to quell the riots in the central province. Several Kandyan Chieftains were killed. Edward Henry Pedris (the son of William Pedris) was court-martialed and shot dead in a gruesome manner by the British. It is reported that Edward Pedris father was prepared to give his sons weight in gold to the British to save his life. Issipathanaramaya in Greenland Road was built by Edwards father in his memory.
The great patriot, lawyer E W Perera, braved the submarine-infested seas and sailed to England, to make known the situation in Ceylon to the British authorities in London. It is said that this trip was financed by another patriot, Barrister F R Senanayake (brother of D S Senanayake). E W Perera whilst in England made a nuisance of himself to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, by persistently getting some Irish Members of Parliament to put awkward questions about the atrocities taking place in Ceylon by the British, in the suppression of the riots.
The Secretary of State called upon Governor Chalmers for a report. It is said that E W Perera risked his life by smuggling a Shoot at Sight Order of the Governor, stitched into his shoe when he set sail. Had it been detected in Ceylon, he would have surely been shot. Such were the dirty tactics of the British.
The whole country was inflamed by the atrocities committed by the Governor, the IGP and the Commander of the Army. Several leaders such as D S Senanayake, F R Senanayake, Charles Batuwanthudawe, the Hewavitharanes, Proctor A A Wickremasinghe of Kegalle were incarcerated and were to be shot.
They committed no crime but agitated against the British as members of the Temperance Movement. One man who was perfectly unafraid was Proctor Wickremasinghe (father of lawyer Winston and father-in-law of General Wijekoon) who boiled with indignation when he learned of the wanton shooting of the poor villagers. When once roused by any injustice, nothing could stop him.
After E W Pereras representations in England, and after being released from jail, DS, FR and Wickremasinghe were elected to a committee to collect necessary material, and a Memorial was sent to Bonar Law, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Many commissions were appointed. The British here knew that the Ceylonese were going hell for leather for Independence if nothing was done to redress the grievances of the Sinhalese.
Tamil Leaders, headed by Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan KC, and Sinhalese Leaders spoke in one voice. Governor Sir Robert Chalmers was recalled, and Sir John Anderson was sent to replace him. Though it appeared that Chalmers made an ignominious exit he was later made Lord Chalmers. This was no punishment for atrocities committed, but a reward for maintaining their policy of Divide and Rule.
To restore order, Governor Anderson gave peremptory orders that the perahera was not to be interfered with. The Coastal Moors climbed down and cooled their fanaticism. In 1917, Sir John Anderson himself attended the perahera as did the Sinhalese Kings of old, and the perehera marched thereafter along Ambegamuwa Street in all its splendour and glory, with the accompaniment of music.

Masked     and ready!
Every woman dreams of having picture perfect, flawless skin and in an endeavour to turn this dream into a reality, we try out almost all the beauty and skincare products available in the market, doing more harm than good to our skin. Nourishing, natural remedies is the best solution for this problem. Face packs or masks cleanse, sooth and revive your skin. Your kitchen is loaded with ingredients that can be put together to make an amazing face mask to suit the requirements of your skin. This roundup of information about face masks and packs will have you pampering your skin in no time.
The importance of using face packs
The right face mask can help to improve the appearance of your pores and also tighten the skin. This is also an excellent way to help get rid of impurities. Every healthy skin care regime should include the daily use and weekly use of products both men and women can benefit significantly from using a mask. Your skin will go through a noticeable transformation that you can see and feel. For example if the skin is dehydrated you must use a pack to hydrate it.
If the skin needs lightning you must use a pack to lighten the skin. If the skin has acne use a pack which will absorb the oil, take away the redness or sensitivity and control the acne. If the skin needs firming, use a pack which will tighten the skin and give it a lift.
Daily use
A facer pack is usually used to sooth sensitive or irritated skin and give off a cooling effect.
These types of masks can probably be used daily since they are gentle on the skin. This can also improve the complexion making it clearer and more youthful looking. Face masks or packs have deep cleansing and conditioning action on the skin. They also refreshen tired skin and soothe troubled skin. Using a face pack daily has obvious benefits.
Using multiple homemade face packs in one day
You can use a face pack twice a day. However this depends on your face packs as some may be too harsh

on your skin.
You need to be careful in choosing what kind of ingredients go into your face packs.
Difference between a face pack and a face mask or peel
Face masks and face packs are basically used for facial purposes. They both function similarly but in a nature that are different from each other. Face masks are unsettling and are usually used for dry skin. Face packs are basically settling masks which take longer to dry.
The skin gets cleaned for a particular duration when you use face masks that are prepared naturally by adding the components which the skin lacks. They remove the dead skin and give a glowing effect.
All peel off products come under this category.
Face packs that are used at night time
Night masks or sleeping packs, however, are a relatively new concept. They are basically worn just like night cream in exponentially more powerful ways. They contain all of the nourishing and hydrating ingredients of a night cream but also repair, brighten and work as anti age agents while sealing in all the treatments from whichever serums you layer underneath.
Acne and face packs
Acne is a skin care problem that cannot be avoided. Getting rid of those red bumps and pimples can be tricky.
A good face pack that will control all this will help reduce the formation of acne and leave your skin looking smooth and radiant.
Raising your face after using a face mask
Whether you need to raise your face after using a face mask or not depends on the face mask you are using. Some are meant to be left to sit for a certain period of time, letting the remaining products massaged into your face. Others must be washed off after a specified time period. For example a mask for acne or clarifying masks are too strong to be left on indefinitely and if they are left on for longer than they should be, they can irritate your skin or dry out your skin. The kinds that are sometimes ok to be left on without rising off are typically more moisturizing. It all depends on the product you use.
Lighten your skin tone using face packs
Dark and dull pigmented skin can be caused by a lot of factors such as over exposure to the sun, pollution or even stress. A fair and flawless skin complexion is a dream many women possess. Many women use various types of masks to make their skin tone lighter. Some of these masks may be harmful to the skin. So it is very important for you to use a product that will lighten your skin over a period of a time than in one or two allocations. Use a quality face mask and you will be able to reap beneficial results.
Applying moisturizer after washing off the face pack
It is not necessary for you to use a moisturizer after using a face pack. However this also depends on the type of skin you have. If your skin is on the more dehydrated side, then, yes, it is very important that you use a moisturizer.
If your skin is oily and prone to acne then you should avoid using a moisturizer as this will aggravate the acne. Your skin will look and feel oily too if you go head and moisturize. Find out what type of skin you have before applying a moisturizer after a face mask.

Minister proposes only one member from family be permitted to contest LG polls
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said yesterday that there should be a system to ensure that only one member from one family can contest at the forthcoming and Provincial Council Local Government elections.
Under the present system, most of the candidates are from political families. This deprives so many others in the 20 million population of contesting at any election.
We should consider taking forward the concept of only one candidate from one family at the forthcoming election, he added.
We do not want family members and relatives of politicians to be elected to Local Government authorities and Provincial Councils. The opportunities should be diversified, allowing others to contest at any election. We must encourage more intellectuals,social workers and philanthropists to contest the upcoming elections, he added.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Minister Mustapha said Parliament has approved the proposal of allocating 25 percent of representation to women in Provincial Councils and Local Government Institutions recently.
But, most politicians try to get nominations for their wives and daughters as candidates. We must change this culture and provide an opportunity for more women to enter politics. We all should show greater collective commitment in increasing women representation in Local Government institutions and Parliament as well, he said.
However, there is a tendency that women do not vote for women. But, we should create a belief among women that women can lead the women in society, the Minister said.
Meanwhile, a Cabinet memorandum will be submitted shortly by the Minister to initiate an awareness programes among the women through the media and social media with the aim of increasing the womens representation in Local Government bodies, thereby ceating a new political culture, Minister Mustapha said.

MODI used nudgeeconomics before Richard Thaler won Nobel
INDIA: While the world watched US economist Richard Thaler win the Nobel Prize for economics on Monday, little is known about how the Modi government has been putting his famous Nudge economics theory into practice for a while now. Thalers award-winning theory in behavioural science propounds on the idea that subtle nudges can guide human behaviour towards developing habits that are beneficial in the long run, without forcing them to comply.
According to a report in Economic Times, the government has been following this policy since last year when Niti Aayog joined hands with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to set up a nudge unit, that would work towards achieving behavioural changes that would make programmes and policies of the government more effective.
The project was set-up when the think-tank was riddled with complaints from various state governments on policy implementations. The unit aimed at sensitising people about the benefits of programmes like Swachh Bharat, Jan Dhan Yojana, Digital India and Skill Development through social messaging and new ad campaigns. Other countries like UK, USA and Australia also have such units.

Moonasinghe further remanded till October 25
Two suspects including suspended Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe arrested in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal accounts in Sri Lanka were yesterday remanded till October 25 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused bail for Moonasinghe taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence.
The CID had arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account,last Friday (6). The second suspect Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested on the charge of misappropriating Rs.30 million last Monday (9).
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo. The CID initiated an investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6. The Taiwanese government had also taken a decision to send investigators to Sri Lanka to probe the cyber money heist.
At a previous occasion, Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky had issued an order to the Immigration and Emigration Controller preventing Shalila Moonasinghe from leaving the country in connection with the Taiwan bank heist.

National Audit Bill amendments recommend surcharge on corrupt public officials
Recent amendments introduced to the National Audit Bill and recommended by Cabinet states that a surcharge be imposed on government officials caught misappropriating government funds.
It also recommended that the authority to impose such a charge be given to the relevant line Ministry Secretary of the officer concerned.
The above recommendations were made by the Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by Special Assignments Minister Dr.Sarath Amunugama, who was to look into various recommendations and amendments suggested to the Audit Bill and come up with a draft for approval.
If a government officer through his incompetency, misuse, fraud or corruption, has caused loss to the government, powers to be granted to commission to recover that money through a surcharge imposed on the official, and the power to impose such a surcharge be given to the relevant Ministry Secretary of the officer, was proposed as an amendment to cabinet and approved.
The Cabinet sub committee also approved the amendment to include two officials from the government service and engineering field to the surcharge appeals committee which will hear any petitions from government officials thus accused.
The National Audit Commission however has pointed out that to empower the Secretary to impose the surcharge would simply undermine the powers of the Commission and has advised against such a move.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne however explained that this would simply reduce the workload of the Commission and it would help speed investigations along.
One Commission cant handle everything. Look what happened to the Public Services Commission. It has a huge load and it cannot cope. People have to wait for months for a decision, the Minister said.

Nkar Travels and Tours organizes tourism promotion campaign for three-wheel drivers
Sri Lankas first-ever awareness campaign for three-wheel drivers on the importance of reaping long-term benefits from tourists rather than looking at immediate short-term gains was conducted by Nkar Travels and Tours to coincide with the World Tourism Day.
The campaign motivated over 1,500 three wheel owners and drivers, mainly in the Colombo and suburban areas on several important issues pertaining to the welfare of foreign tourists who are using three wheelers.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Nkar Travels and Tours Managing Director Nilmin Nanayakkara said the objective of conducting such a programme for the first time in the country was to educate owners and drivers of three wheelers on the importance of giving foreign travelers the maximum protection during their tours in their three wheelers.
He said they were educated and motivated on avoiding reckless driving, over charging passengers, behaving in unruly manner in the presence of passengers, committing sexual harassment on passengers, using drugs and consuming liquor while driving and avoiding drug promotions to passengers.
Commenting further on the event, Nanayakkara said the campaign ended very successfully and even other tour operators warmly welcomed the programme and considered it to be a social responsibility project to support both tour operators and passengers, especially foreign travelers.
The programme was highly admired even by people on the streets. It was also a pleasant sight to see the three wheel drivers showing an interest and enthusiasm.
On the way, staff of Nkar stopped them for a short briefing about the programme. They issued hand-outs, printed in all three languages which were displayed on the vehicles.
A senior official in a private tour company commended the programme and said that this is the kind of support and guidance all tour operators including three wheel owners want from responsible industry partners.
The programme was highly admired by Director, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Mihira Liyanarachchi, Tourist Police OIC Prabath Vidanagama and Kolllupitiya Police OIC Priyadharshana Silva.

## Title: Planning for Sri Lankan Corporate Sector

Planning for Sri Lankan Corporate Sector
There is lot of anxiety among the corporate entities and the high net worth individuals as to the impact on their tax liabilities arising out of the taxation legislation and amendments passed in parliament recently.
The government expects substantial additional revenue from the new tax legislation. Even the chambers of commerce are upbeat on the new legislation. As we all know our tax revenue has been falling steadily over the past decade with indirect taxes climbing the ladder. As a percentage of GDP, the tax revenue dropped to below 11%.
However, the trend was reversed from 2016 onwards with the revision of vat rate to 15% from 11%. Since the introduction of GST and VAT in 1998 and 2002 respectively, the tax revenue especially from direct taxation started on the downward path. Due to inadequate controls in the introduction of VAT, there was a huge vat fraud from 2002 to 2004 resulting in a loss of over Rs. 4 billion to state coffers. There was collusion on the part of revenue officials as well for this. The malpractices were originated from the refunds due to VAT payers on the returns filed. Prior to this there was a tax amnesty granted especially on taxes upto year of assessment 2000/2001. As a result, the tax payers got into a Holiday Mood. This affected all revenue collection modes.
Tax legislation
Some are of the view that the recent tax legislation was forced on the Government by the IMF to release the quarterly dollar loan instalments on the loans approved by them. Naturally, strings are attached to IMF loan packages. The developing countries developed their economies on large tax collections over 30% of GDP. We did not employ sufficient measures but were hell bent on providing subsidies on education, health, transport, electricity, petroleum and other areas. The real culprits are the successive governments which ruled this country for the last 70 years. At every elections the parties include many relief measures to win the public vote. We should have built our infrastructure in the seventies coupled with donor grants and tax revenue. However, even the so called  Colombo Plan was also not materialized. The politicians come up with very long term plans for goal achievements for the country. These should have been medium term plans broken into short term segments with specific responsibility centres.
Even the promised Audit Commission was not established. The chambers of commerce should appoint private sector Audit Committees for every state enterprise and corporations without any further delay, like in quoted companies backed up by internal audit divisions of the private sector. The funding for this exercise could be sought from the IMF and other overseas donor agencies. This will no doubt eliminate waste and corruption of public funds. The private sector will also greatly benefit by lower and meaningful taxes for the future. These internal audits should be extended to provincial councils and local government authorities also.
Sri Lanka too had higher tax revenues in the past especially with the BTT(business turnover tax) in force at those times. However, there were very few infrastructure development projects at that time. Infrastructure projects received outright grants and loans of very long term tenure coupled with low interest rates. Scenarios changed with the reduction of funds to overseas countries from the so called development countries. This was mainly due to those countries beefing up their regional cooperation endeavours and the beefing of their defence capabilities.
India took a late start in the late nineties to liberalise their economy and they were fortunate to attract huge capital and latest technology from their own countrymen in overseas countries. United States Of America reiterates that they now need the support of India to take their economy to greater heights and also to maintain their role as the  police force of the world.
In a scenario where grants and soft loans will not be forthcoming to Sri Lanka, the government should strike a balance with corporate sector taxation and the maintenance of steady tax revenues and higher economic growth rates to create more employment opportunities and higher per capita incomes.
Black money
Single individuals and non corporate bodies are resorting to a number of tax evasion measures which need extensive tax investigation measures. The inland Revenue should seek the assistance of retired private sector tax practitioners in mapping up strategies to unearth these evasive measures. There should be equality in tax collection measures for all sectors. Single personal allowance is quite adequate even to cover dependents. There are vast sums of  Black Money in the economy. The state should attract this black money for fruitful ventures to generate more employment. The employment measures to be created should be stable in the long run, so that excess staff in loss making state ventures could be encouraged to join. Over the years the government allowed the importation of various types of vehicles and raked in substantial  Black Cash in the economy by way of taxes and also achieved the double objective of raising the revenue levels of the already completed highways.
The government should always endeavour to reduce the local and foreign debt to under 60% of GDP to bring up a manageable economy and to lower the taxation levels. The biggest problems faced by the present Government is to meet the interest cover and loan repayments of both the local and foreign debt and the meeting of additional monthly salary bill of the state sector. The RS.10,000 increment given to state sector employees is a huge burden monthly. The number of state sector employees is around 15 lakhs and the annual additional salary bill is around RS.180 billion. Even now trade unions demand more salaries and perks and the Government is forced to give in to some of their demands giving rise to escalations in salary bill monthly. This will have the chain effect of local borrowings and higher taxes.
Fuel increases
The fuel prices are expected to go up in the near future. The LIOC has already requested price increases for their products to cover up their lossess. If Ceylon Petroleum follow suit, this will have a killer effect on consumer prices. A cost of living committee and a taxation committee will have to meet on a weekly basis along with treasury officials and the officials of the consumer protection Authority to arrest the adverse effects on the general public and the private sector. With the new tourist season commencing soon, there will be an additional demand for consumer goods especially on food and beverages.
The PPP Authority will also have to speed up their efforts to improve productivity and profitability of public sector enterprises to lessen the burden on the treasury but not with the objective of selling off these enterprises to outsiders. The objective need be higher productivity, efficiency and profitability.
To tackle the task of tax planning by the local corporate sector, a three pronged strategy should be adopted. They could be listed as follows.
1. To file the annual tax return for
year of assessment 2016/17
2. To carry out a tax planning and control
exercise for year of assessment 2017/18
3. A detailed tax planning exercise
for year of assessment 2018/19
Talking about the first task, the annual tax returns are due by 30 November 2017.The audited accounts and a detailed tax computation need be obtained from the company external auditors for this purpose. The return should be filed only after paying the balance tax liability, if any,as per the final tax computation.
When we come to the second task we have almost 6 more months for the ongoing financial year to end. By now the tax payable for the first quarter should have been paid. The second quarter instalment of tax is due by November 15 2017. The 3rd and 4th quarter payments are due by February 15 and May 15 respectively of 2018.
The companies should always endeavour to prepare the actual tax liabilities for above quarters based on actual draft accounts for quarters ending December 31 2017 and 31march 2018 to avoid huge balance tax payments possibly with penalties. Maintenance of accurate accounts is a must for determining actual liabilities.
Fixed assets
The decisions to acquire fixed assets such as much needed plant and machinery, office equipment, computer software, need be considered based on tax benefits and liquid funds available. ualifying payments and corporate social responsibility needs(CSR} are other considerations.
Another major factor in determining the purchase of fixed assets are the prevailing interest rates on leases and long term loans as long term assets need be purchased with long term funds either by fresh capital or through debt with low interest.
This would ensure sound cash flows for the company and will assist in achieving corporate goals at all times such as enhanced market share, enhanced turnover and enhanced profitability coupled with higher staff/worker benefits.
Tax planning for year of assessment 2018/19 should take place after the presentation of budget proposals by the government in November 2017 as the future scenarios could be accurately predicted. Certain proposals will be operative from 1 January 2018 and some will come into effect from April 1 2018. There could also be proposals effective from midnight of the announcing of the budget proposals
An indepth study of recent tax legislation approved by parliament could be taken up for a brainstorming session in every company amongst the finance management firstly and tater with the top management.
Based on outcomes and decisions reached a formal meeting should be conducted by the top management with the board of directors to decide on future strategies for finance, production, marketing, transport. The decisions should be taken after the budget is passed in parliament as there could be proposals for amendments.
Long term objective
The medium and long term objective of government will be to increase the direct taxes to a level of 60% of total tax collection. Further the government is targeting a tax collection of over 20% of GDP. The international donor agencies, particularly the IMF has been voicing their concerns for the last few years over the lower level of tax collections and steadily climbing country debt.
The companies should also plan for their taxes vis a vis the tax liabilities of the directors arising out of remuneration & perks to the directors from the company with the objective of mitigating the liabilities for both the company and the directors.
At the same time, the maximum returns also should be ensured for the shareholders for their investment. It should be a win win situation for all parties. The employees at all levels should not be forgotten and they too be ensured increased take home pay packets.
For raising fresh funds for development and also to mitigate or pay additional taxes, the following options could be employed.
1. Rights issues preceded by bonus issues
2. Issue of Long term debentures
3. Arranging low cost syndicated long term loans
4. Finding strategic foreign/local investors for a strategic alliance which would boost the company
profits and market shares
Other than the above 3 stages of tax planning, it is of paramount importance to check the company tax position based on records maintained by the inland revenue. The following aspects are vital for a healthy tax position of a corporate entity and even for a partnership or files of individual tax payers.

1. Check whether there are any appeals outstanding.
2. Check with the computer division of the Inland Revenue whether there are any default taxes
3. The possession of acknowledgement cards duly date stamped and signed for all tax returns filed or
acknowledgements via electronic modes, if applicable
4. Always forward the tax return along with a covering letter and also obtain an acknowledgement
on the copy of a the letter for preservation in the company tax file
5 Covering letter should itemize the attachments to the return such as tax computation, donation
and other approved investment receipts ,fixed asset purchase receipts, interest paid/received
confirmations from banks and financial instituitions.
6. Always attach only the copies of original supporting claims due to possibility of misplacing
7. Retain a copy of tax return after the signature of the declarant
8. Clearly indicate the tax overpaid for the year of assessment and the desire to carry forward the
overpaid tax for future liabilities
9. The tax overpaid, if substantial, should be agreed and minuted with the assessor concerned as any
disallowances later will result in penalties for future years on the overpayment disallowed later.
10. Any estimated assessment should be settled after filing the return and proceed to get the estimated assessment withdrawn as soon as possible and peruse same in the computer records of the inland revenue department.

11. Do not delay filing returns and forwarding requested data and details by the inland revenue Department as these would leave room for possible raids to be conducted by the inland revenue Department
The above points are only a few in maintaining a healthy tax position for any company as there are contingent liabilities for additional taxes imposed by the Inland Revenue Department.
The Inland Revenue is handling a large number of files and there could be delays in updating their computer records. An updated tax file will improve company standing with the inland revenue and also with banks and other financial instituitions as they regularly request tax certificates for processing of new facilities or renewing the existing facilities.
The corporate growth could be spurred by an accurate and timely system of tax planning. The corporates also could take advantage of specific incentives, reliefs and concessions applicable to their industries.
The treasury officials should have regular dialogues and formal meetings with chambers of commerce, trade associations and professional associations to ensure a fair system of taxation for the corporate sector with objectives of creating additional employment avenues, higher volumes of trade and higher tax revenues and minimal tax evasive practices.
The treasury should themselves eliminate wasteful expenditure to lessen the dependence on taxation for running governments. Tax planning is a legitimate right of the tax payer. Tax evasion takes place on a larger scale in sole trader and partnership businesses and also among individual tax payers.
India tax revenue
Talking about our giant neighbor India, corporate tax collections have risen nearly 12 fold in the 15 year period ending in 2016 and personal income tax by 9 fold. However, share of direct taxes in the economy has fallen to almost a decade low of 5.4% of GDP in 2015.It was also found that 2.8 crore Indians filed income tax returns in 2015.This amounts to a little over 2% of Indian population.
Considering the Sri Lankan population, this 2% benchmark comes to around 420,000 tax files of individuals. This should be our first target in trying to raise direct taxes. The local corporate sector should be armed with lower taxes and lower interest rates, if they are to create more employment avenues. The foreign investors should be sought primarily for new companies with flagship status mainly for infrastructure development and creation of more export markets.
India State of Maharashtra generated the highest tax revenue, like in Colombo for Sri Lanka. Delhi is the next tax generator. Direct taxes in India is made up of 36% of total taxes in 2000/01 and has risen to 51% by 2015/16.This percentage has gone down from a high of 60% in 2009/10.
The standard VAT rates range from 12% to 15%.Different states have different tax legislation based on levels of poverty and development drives. Certain states employ very high point of sale taxes on tourists for services provided to them.
Looking at Singapore, where there is a rigid tax administration, the VAT was introduced in 1994 at the standard rate of 3% which has now gone up to 7%. However, citizens in Singapore do not engage in public protests since they are aware that the government is doing their best to upgrade the living standards of their people.
Singapore tax revenue is closing in on 60 billion Singapore dollars. Singapore has high property taxes. As a result, the property prices in Singapore are quite high.
Every successive government praises the corporate sector as the engine of growth for Sri Lanka and every government should assist the corporate sector by awarding major mega development project tenders to the local private sector as they are second to none.

Sathosa Motors launches Isuzu NMR dump truck
Building on the success of the first-ever Isuzu NMR Dump Truck launched in the Sri Lankan market late last year, Sathosa Motors PLC (SML) proudly launches the higher capacity the Isuzu FTR 33F-23 Dump truck to cater to the rapidly expanding construction sector. An ideal companion for large scale construction companies, this new version is capable of hauling as much as 7 tons of loose earth, sand or soil, thereby reducing the need for frequent trips. Another high productivity feature of this truck is the sharp tipping angle of 57-degrees, which is well beyond the tipping angles in existing vehicles in the country. This far more flexible angle offers greater precision and complete emptying of the truck bed.
A durable workhorse vehicle, it boasts a powerful 6-cylinder engine that lasts longer and outlasts existing competition in the market. Ideal for long haulage, this model combines great value for money, higher productivity for high value construction projects and the security of the Isuzu brand name.
More than 80 years have passed since the first Isuzu truck pulled out of the factory and onto the road, but Isuzu is today Japan's best-selling truck manufacturer and a major force for innovation. SML leads the sector in the Light Commercial Vehicle category as the exclusive distributor of Isuzu.
Commenting on the launch of the new vehicle category, SMLs Managing Director, Deshamanya Tilak Dias Gunasekera says, We are delighted to introduce the Isuzu FTR 33F-23 Dump Truck for the benefit of construction companies engaged in large scale infrastructure and building projects. The rapidly expanding skyline in Colombo and other cities is giving rise to demand for heavy duty dump trucks that offer durability and higher productivity. This is the main reason we have introduced this powerful dump truck with substantial hauling capacity and engine power to support the construction sector. Manufactured in Japan, Isuzu vehicles are known for their exceptional quality, long term durability and high resale value. SML is offering special rates for the first 3 trucks which are in stock presently. We are confident that this vehicle will serve as the ideal component to deliver their projects successfully.

Scenic railway
A Railway station is not a place for admiration. But thousands visit this countryside railway station to admire its beautiful garden and landscaping and a make a day out trip. Spring Bluff Railway has a prize winning garden throughout the year.
I was surprised when it was suggested that we drive almost 130 kilo meters to spend the time at a railway station garden located in the regional council of Toowoomba. Further I was told that my friends family was making an annual trip there to spend the day with the children. September is the best time for the trip as it is the season of best flowering my friend added.
Within of about an hour drive we sighted the sign board to "Spring Bluff railway station. It was a Monday morning and we anticipated less people. To my surprise we found a young female volunteer in a yellow jacket and duty tag signalling us to stop at a quite distance. Peeping in to the vehicle greeting us warmly with a smile, she self-introduced herself and said she is there to help with the parking. There are three carparks in this hilly location and she checked up on the walkie talky whether we have space closer to the station for parking. Some vehicle was pulling out and we were asked to drive direct to car park one near the station.
Location reminded me of a place like Nawalapitiya railway station as I was a frequent traveller by train to my work place, Tea Research Institute Talawakelle. We could see the beautiful garden at a distance and the people above the carpark. Happy faces of people indicated the impact of the garden.
The car park was surrounded by trees and bushes full of many different coloured flowers.
These trees must have been planted many years ago. There was a train stopped on the track and it was a beautiful view to see a train surrounded by flowers.
History
This station had been established in 1860 and today this station and the garden are heritage listed. It is the station master Ralph Krisoo and his wife Lillian that had taken the interest in making the place beautiful. He had received the help of the station staff and the neighbours to do the beautiful land scaping. This was far back in 1930. They set picnic tables to encourage people to visit the station and enjoy the evenings.
Prize winning garden
Regional Council of Toowoomba then began the annual flower show. It was then the station master took the initiative to enlist the place as a competitor for the event of carnival gardens. Spring Bluff railway station became a prizewinning garden many times and people began to visit it.
Weddings and parties
It became so popular it has now become a place for wedding events as the garden remains beautiful throughout the year and the small caf does the catering for such garden events.
No fee is charged for using the garden or the car park and people come with the families to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. People can bring their own food and refreshments.
The caf building is supposed to be the living quarters of the then Station Master.
In a clever and a simple way the place is maintained with ever smiling flowers make us forget that it is a railway station and make the visitors long to go there again the next September during the Carnival Garden show time in Toowoomba.

Shuttling against adversity
Sri Lankas undisputed badminton champion, the countrys badminton singles national champion and champion shuttler - these are terms which have been associated with him for a span. Olympian Niluka Karunaratne went down in history by becoming the youngest national champion in 2001 when he was 16 years old.
Coming from a family which plays badminton Niluka has followed his father, national level badminton champ and Coach Louie Karunaratnes footsteps by taking up the sport when he was eight years in 1993. His brothers, Diluka, and Dinuka, too have done their bit to give identity to badminton in Sri Lanka.
My passion for badminton emerged mainly when I realized that I had a natural flair for the sport. I was playing cricket too at that time but once I began to excel in badminton I had to dedicate myself to one of the sports. I chose badminton, Niluka explained.
An old boy of Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda, and Royal College, Colombo, Nilukas first national win was in 1994 when he became the runner up in the under 11 all island age group. He represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championship in Jakarta, Indonesia, when he was 15 years in 2000. By July 2012, Niluka was ranked 48th in Mens singles from the World Badminton Federation. He considers becoming the runners up in the Welsh International in 2003 as his biggest win. One of the happiest moments in his life was representing Sri Lanka at the 2012 Olympics as the captain of the Sri Lanka Olympic contingent. He defeated world number 8 Kenichi Tago of Japan 2-0 recording 2118, 2116 in 44 minutes at the Wembley arena in the Olympic Mens badminton singles Group C. He also took part in the 2016 Olympics Games in Rio.
He notes that you need talent to climb up the ladder in badminton.
Passion and how much effort you put into the game count as well. You need discipline to excel in this sport. Years and years of continuous training will horn your talent. This will take you to the global arena and get you opportunities to compete with the top rankers in the world, Niluka said.
He says that maintaining the world ranking is the biggest challenge for an international level badminton player. He is currently in the 85th spot. He has been in the 34th rank in June 2013. This is the best he has attained so far in his career.
He notes that Sri Lanka still lacks facilities to mould budding young badminton players into international champions.
Training here itself is a challenge when you have to venture on and face opponents who have been trained with world class equipments and the latest techniques. Though things are tough I have no plans to leave my motherland and play for a foreign state, says the gifted youth who had gotten opportunities to train in Harvard in 2005 and Durham, UK, in 2012.
Though I was offered scholarships in two of the best universities in the world, it was not what I wanted in life. You get into a totally different mindset when you go there and you get into a different lifestyle. I would also have to give up my first priority which is representing my country continuously, he noted adding that his schedule includes training for three hours two times a day for six days a week.
Besides badminton Niluka has a thirst for wanderlust. He has travelled to more than 70 countries, taking part in tournaments for around 17 years. He is a wildlife enthusiast and had visited many wildlife destinations in the world including the wilderness in South Africa. Queried if a badminton player would make a worthy squash or tennis player Niluka said that badminton is more strenuous than the latter. A badminton player needs to cover more distance on the court than a tennis player.
We also get less time to rest during our sets. However there are many badminton players who have later taken up and excelled in squash. I too have played the game for fun but my forte is badminton, he stressed.
He admires three figures in the sports world: Michael Jordon, Mohammed Ali and Bruce Lee. He is motivated by the inspiration they have given to the public rather than their achievements in sports.
The trials he faces every day to become a better person and athlete drives him to work hard and aim higher.
Niluka says his parents, Louie Karunaratne and Mithra Mendis, have been the pillars of his strength. His brother Diluka has his own badminton association while Dinuka works for HNB. The youngest in the family, Chamika, is into cricket. Niluka is employed at Sampath bank.
His future plans involve starting his own business. His message to youth is to start dreaming at a tender age.
The size of your dream or how many dreams you have do not really matter. Your dreams may change overtime. Decide what you want to do with life for yourself. Work towards achieving your dream. You cannot be somebody else but you can be a better person in a different profession. Gather experience and learn. Enjoy what you do, he advised.
He will be taking part in the Scottish Open and the Open Grand Prix tournaments soon.

Simply, Simplify
If you have worked with me either at the University of Kelaniya or at Lake House, met me two or three times in a publisher's office in Colombo or seen me at the school gates waiting to pick my daughter you would know I wear(pretty much)the same thing every day. If you ask me why, I would probably shrug and say I love minimalistic living. I would also add, 'The fewer clothes I have, the more liberated I feel.'
And it's true.
Don't we all know that feeling in the mornings where we just cant tell whether this top goes with those pants, if those sandals are the right footwear, but what if its too casual What if everyone else is dressed in formal wear And the end result is a giant pile of rejected outfits on our bed, and nothing feels right It is surely a constant struggle in our lives, as we try to piece together outfits that strike a balance between professional enough to be taken seriously and casual enough not to stand out like a sore thumb in the kind of atmosphere where dress rules don't really exist, and you have to instinctively know what kind of clothes will make you fit in.
Have you ever thought about how much time you likely waste deciding what to wear before you leave the house It has probably made you late to work or appointments or even dates, more times than you can count.
When we come to think about it, it does seem as though we waste so many precious moments concerning ourselves with frivolous details. An outfit will not change the world, would it It probably won't even change your day.
This is not to say that fashion isn't important, as it has an immense impact on culture and, in turn, the direction of society. According to experts in the field, fashion is where art, culture and history intersect. If we look at the 1960s, for example, the way people dressed was very much a reflection of the counterculture movement and the anti-establishment sentiments of the era.
Simply put, clothes can tell us a lot about sociology. Yet, at the same time, we have arguably become an excessively materialistic and superficial society. Undoubtedly, there are greater things to worry about than clothes.
Similarly, as the great American author Henry David Thoreau once stated: Our life is frittered away by detail...(so) simplify, simplify.
Correspondingly, a number of very successful people have adopted this philosophy in their daily routines.
Whether you love or hate him, it is hard to argue against the notion that once upon a time President Barack Obama had the most difficult job in the world. As the leader of the most powerful country on the planet, the president had a lot on his plate. No matter what he did, he was criticized.
He obviously, had a lot of important things to think about beyond his wardrobe. This is precisely why he wore the same suit every day. In an article from Michael Lewis for Vanity Fair, the president explained the logic behind this routine: Youll see I wear only gray or blue suits. Im trying to pare down decisions. I dont want to make decisions about what Im eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.
As Stuart Heritage puts it for the Guardian, "Barack Obama has pared his wardrobe down to such a degree that he can confidently walk into any situation and make decisions that directly impact on the future of mankind."
The former US president is not alone in this practice. The late, great, Steve Jobs wore his signature black turtleneck with jeans and sneakers every single day. Moreover, Mark Zuckerberg typically wears a gray t-shirt with a black hoody and jeans when seen in public. Similarly, Albert Einstein reportedly bought several variations of the same gray suit so that he wouldn't have to waste time deciding what to wear each morning.
According to John Haltiwanger in the Daily Elite this is all related to the concept of decision fatigue - a psychological condition in which a person's productivity suffers as a result of becoming mentally exhausted from making so many irrelevant decisions. By stressing over things like what to eat or wear every day, people become less efficient at work, says Haltiwanger.
For Matilda Kahl, an art director in New York decision fatigue and less time getting ready are not the only reasons for wearing the same outfit every day. She adds another: less-stress, specifically, less stress during the day over the decision she originally made in the morning.
Is this too formal Is this dress too short Almost always, Id choose something to wear I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform. But now, in her trademark silk white shirt and black trousers, she has one less source of anxiety during the day.
Christopher Nolan thinks the same. Nolan, who has created several of the most critically and commercially successful films of the early 21st century says he decided long ago it was a waste of energy to choose anew what to wear each day. Now, he settles instead for a dark, narrow-lapeled jacket over a blue dress shirt with black trousers over sensible shoes to wear whenever he goes out.
And so, from former President Obama, to Steve Jobs, to Mark Zuckerberg,to Albert Einstein, to Christopher Nolan and many others, we learn of how life becomes easier by adopting a monotonous wardrobe. Needless to say, as these are some of the most successful and productive individuals in history, they are on to something.
True enough, the world would be an extremely boring place if we all wore the exact thing every day.
Yet, we might all consider simplifying our lives a bit more by reducing the amount of time we spend thinking about pointless aspects of our day. In the process, we might find that we are significantly less stressed, more productive and more fulfilled.
In the end, the mantra is to dress with less and create a life that is full of what matters most to you.
May be its time you gave it a try.

With the release of the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka on September 21, the debate over constitutional reforms has begun earnestly. We welcome the Interim Report and recognise the positive contribution it makes for the purpose of developing an inclusive and harmonious Sri Lanka. This is a great opportunity to develop a constructive dialogue among the stakeholders, both local and overseas, so that the country as a whole will embark on a new political path respecting and recognising its ethnic diversity.
The Constitution sets out Sri Lankas basic law and the system of government, including how Parliament works, what power it has, how the Parliament and local elected bodies share power and the roles of the Ministers and the Courts. It also reflects the principles and values by which the countrys people wish to be governed. As sovereignty is derived from the people, the citizenry need to actively and constructively participate in this important conversation, articulating their views prudently to build consensus on the complex issues that affect their lives and governance. Constitutional reforms, therefore, should aim at ensuring good governance with the legitimate interests and security of all communities of Sri Lanka at heart, including protection of their unique cultures and languages.
A better, fairer and equitable future can only be built upon respect for the human rights of all citizens irrespective of their ethnicities, including the rights outlined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. With the above considerations in mind, Australian Advocacy for Good Governance in Sri Lanka (AAGGSL) organised a workshop on "Constitutional Reforms and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka" on September 24th at the Darebin Intercultural Centre in Preston, Victoria, Australia.
The Interim Report
The workshop, facilitated by Emeritus Professor Joseph Camilleri of La Trobe University and guided by Associate Professor Ken Coghill of the Monash University, discussed specific topics including the role of constitution, rule of law, devolution of power, separation of powers, judiciary and judicial independence, independent regulatory bodies, accountability and reconciliation. Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, MP and Presidents Counsel, provided a useful update via video link on the workings of the Steering Committee and answered several questions raised on the Interim Report. AAGGSL Page 2 of 4 Participants representing Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher expatriate communities of Sri Lankan origin in Melbourne, deliberated on the just issued Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka, including the observations and comments contained therein, made by the Steering Committee Members.
Recommendations from the AAGGSL
And undoubtedly, we find further enhancements are necessary. The following is our collective and considered position on the constitutional reforms being deliberated in Sri Lanka, which we hope will lead to the most desirous outcomes for all its peoples:
1. Sri Lanka to be known as the Republic of Sri Lanka; Sri Lanka shall have only one Parliament consisting of the First Chamber (House of Representatives) and the Second Chamber(Senate) that is representative of the Provinces; The Second Chamber should consist of equal number of Members drawn from each Provincial Council and a local person of eminence recommended by each Provincial Council;
2. The Second Chamber should have powers to review legislation and make recommendations to the House of Representatives, including specific powers to ensure the devolved political authorities of the Provinces are not diluted or interfered with;
3. The Constitution should clearly enshrine the doctrine of Separation of Powers between the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary to avoid any one group having all the power;
4. The Executive Presidency should be abolished. The Executive powers should be vested with the Cabinet of Ministers following the doctrine that human liberty should be preserved by avoiding concentration of powers in one person or body of persons; If the period of the current executive presidency is to be extended, it should be only in exceptional circumstances and only for a very brief period. In that event, a specific process and a time frame to abolish it should have been agreed upon by the Constituent Assembly; Executive decisions on any matter including on national security and lands acquired for security should be subject to judicial oversight;
5. Sovereignty shall be inalienable and shall vest in the people in an undivided Sri Lanka; Due to the high volume and diversity of subject matter the Supreme Court deals with, it is prudent to establish a separate Constitutional Court for resolving urgent constitutional matters of national importance; While granting maximum devolution of power to provincial administrations, specific provisions to prevent secession need to be made;
6. The Constitution should recognise the multi-cultural nature of the Sri Lankan populace;
7. Recognition of Province as the primary unit of devolution with clearly demarcated and unambiguous national and provincial lists is a pragmatic way of handling centreperiphery relations; If all parties agree, use of the term aekiyarajyaya / orumiththanadu is acceptable, given that the relevant proposed Article defines aekiyarajyaya / orumiththanadu means a State which is undivided and indivisible, and in which the power to amend the Constitution, or to repeal and replace the Constitution, shall remain with the Parliament and the People of Sri Lanka as provided in this Constitution; If people of two provinces desire to form a single unit and so attest at a referendum held in each of the provinces, the Constitution needs to allow the people to exercise that democratic right to unify their provinces;
8. The President should appoint Governors, subject to consultation with the respective Provincial Council and the Parliament; Interference by a Governor in the decisions of the Board of Ministers of a Provincial Council should be made if and only if there is a constitutional breach; Ad hoc interventions by Governors must end and their official functions be guided by advice received from the Board of Ministers of the Provincial Council;
9. Human rights should be recognised as inalienable and inherent rights of all citizens; Formal mechanisms should be spelt out to defend this right for all peoples including the linguistically and socially diverse communities;
10.The State needs to be secular, though a constitutional provision giving Buddhism the foremost place is acceptable providing the relevant clause stipulates that all other faiths are to be treated with honour and dignity with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they can function in the community free of discrimination;
11. The Constitution should guarantee civil and political freedoms, including that of conscience, religion, belief, opinion and expression, as well as freedom of the press and other media and of peaceful assembly and association; Anyone whose rights and freedoms have been infringed or denied should be able to apply for remedial justice to a court of competent jurisdiction;
12. The Constitution should also guarantee the right to life, liberty and security in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice; the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure; the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned or made disappeared; the right to be informed promptly upon arrest or detention of the reasons therefore; to retain and instruct counsel without delay; to be informed of that right; to have the validity of detention determined by way of habeas corpus; and to be released if the detention is not lawful;
13. All should be equal before and under the law, which should afford equal protection and benefit without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, gender, age and mental or physical disability; Sinhala and Tamil should be recognised as official languages with equality of status, rights and privileges regarding their use in all institutions of both Parliament and government; English should be declared a national language;
14. The declaration of emergency should be subject to Parliamentary approval within a strict time frame (e.g. two weeks), and be subject to a judicial review at the earliest opportunity; We strongly disagree with and object to the proposition that the approval of Parliament and judicial review are not necessary for imposing Emergency Laws. This would be tantamount to retaining some of the undesirable and authoritarian powers of the Executive Presidency;
15. State Land: Constitution should provide for unambiguous and appropriate administrative mechanism to efficiently and fairly resolve land disputes between the Centre and Provincial Administrations;
16. The Constitution should provide for improving gender equity and alleviate the significant under-representation of women in the Parliament.
17. The Constitution should safeguard the Privacy of citizens from being infringed by data digitisation such as using biometrics, identity management systems and mass surveillance, and ensure the ethical use of data and digitisation does not discriminate against anyone or diminish human rights; The digital and human decision-making processes used should be explicable, auditable, evaluable, trustworthy and in the public interest; and
18. The Constitution should recognise the need for environmentally sustainable developments, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and participation in international endeavours to contain Global Warming.
Conclusion
Our Constitution should help foster a society that nurtures a culture of peace based on mutual respect, understanding and cooperation. A constructive dialogue within and between the Sri Lankan Diaspora communities around the globe can make a vital contribution towards building trust and reconciliation, and help create a more favourable environment for durable peace. We emphasise the need for stakeholders to encourage and enable new opportunities for dialogue between communities of Sri Lankan origin in Australia and beyond with a view to developing consensus on the proposed constitutional reforms. We call upon the people of Sri Lanka and civil society organisations to engage in a grass roots level campaign among the voters and politicians for the need for bold Constitutional Reforms, with checks and balances that are vital to the health of democracy, peace and prosperity of all peoples of Sri Lanka.

SriLankan Airlines, Galle Face Hotel and Ebert Silva Holidays celebrates World Childrens Day
SriLankan Cares, the charity arm of the National Carrier, in collaboration with Galle Face Hotel and Ebert Silva Holidays, celebrated World Childrens Day 2017 on October 1, by hosting a special programme for children from three development homes - Kirillawela Senehasa Deri Sevana Childrens Development Centre, Senarath Gunawardena Childrens Development Centre and Gangodawila Childrens Development Centre.
These three much-reputed members of Sri Lankas corporate sector have over the last several years built a laudable tradition of jointly organising special eventsfor children and other special segments of the community such as families of war veterans.
Pradeepa Kekulawala, Head of Human Resources at SriLankan Airlines, said:Children are the future pillars of our nation and we are steadfast in our conviction that a child has to be provided and facilitated with a proper education, the due care and positive upbringing to develop into a human being with sound mind and body. We will continue to take all steps to ensure a better future for the children of our country to the best of our ability.
Deni Ohlsen-Dukic, General Manager of Galle Face Hotel, said, We are truly privileged to be a part of events such as this and we look forward to Childrens Day every year. This is the third year we are partnering with Ebert Silva Holidays and SriLankan Cares; it gives us the opportunity to inspire these children to do better and grow in life.
Rajini De Silva Mendis, Chairperson, Ebert Silva Holidays, said: Joining hands with SriLankan Cares and the Galle Face Hotel, we were able to synergize once again to offer a unique experience to deserving children which was given to them by all, with much love and respect. We believe that this gesture will encourage these children who cherished this day, to give that love and respect back into society when they walk into the world as responsible citizens.
The organizers and volunteers witnessed signs of pure hidden talent as the kids engaged in a song battle during the trip. At the airport, the children were given a familiarization tour.
The highlight of their outing was the chance to experience on-board hospitality on a SriLankan AirlinesAirbus A330 aircraft. They had never before sat and experienced inflight entertainment or hospitality, let alone entered a real aircraft cabin.
The organizers had also arranged a surprise magic show, which enthralled them. Before departing, each child was presented with a gift bag. One of the children gave a vote of thanks in appreciation of the dedication of the staff of SriLankan Cares, Galle Face Hotel, Ebert Silva Holidays and their respective homes for making this eventful day possible.

Then and now
Sri Lankas post-independence political landscape has certainly moved into the surreal. Since the inception, it has being the ruling party which called the shots, while the Opposition lay in submission. The government was placed in the role of the hunter, while the Opposition was the hunted.
But things appear to have changed- drastically so. The government which had the Opposition in its grip, and placed in the role of the hunter, has today become the hunted. Not by the Opposition. BUT BY THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.
First it was Ravi Karunanayake - the powerful Foreign Minister in the Yahapalanaya Government. Yesterday it was Messrs. Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim, the Chairman and General Secretary of the UNP, the dominant partner in the Unity Government. They had one thing in common. All three of them had to abjectly submit themselves before the most searching probe by the Attorney Generals Department, read, the Legal Advisor to the government, before the Bond Commission. RK., perhaps, was subjected to the most intense, and, one would venture to say, the most humiliating inquisition, as it were, of the trio. The fact remains that three powerful stalwarts of the government, bowed their collective heads before the law of the country. None of them put on airs and assumed important postures. RK, in particular, dealt with the salvos hurled at him by the Presidents Counsel of the Attorney Generals Department, without pulling out his rank.
Their conduct was a ringing endorsement of the Yahapalanaya governments commitment to uphold the rule of law. It was a clear indication that the law applied, across the board, to all the countrys citizenry, - the high and mighty, ensconced in the seats of power, as well as the humble soul. This is what the citizens of this country expect from a government. To ensure that the rule of law prevails, and applied with equal force to all and sundry.
And the long arm of the law, indeed, is reaching out to its targets with a monotonous regularity. It is not just the Malik, Kabir, RK trio who had felt its ample reach. High ranking members of the Yahapalanaya government, those who risked their lives working for the election of the Common Candidate, are also feeling the heat. Both Chairmen of the two State Banks were summoned before the Bond Commission, to spill the beans of what they knew of the alleged Treasury Bond scam. The former Central Bank Governor, appointed by the Prime Minister, no less, was specially singled out for a roasting by the Attorney Generals Department. The latest to be hauled before a court of law is the very individual who loaned his political party and its symbol, the Swan, to the Common Candidate.
But the undisputed evidence that the law applies indiscriminately, without respecter of persons, starkly presented itself in the form of the arrest of the Presidents brother, who was involved in a fatal accident, where the police refused to grant him bail.
Rewind the scenario to pre-January 8, 2015 and what did we have A country where law and order was treated with contempt and where the minions of the Rajapaksas held sway, cocking a snook at the very law enforcement establishment (the grabbing of a policemans cap by a mob led by Wimal Weerawansa, after a phone call was made to Gota, the scene going viral on social media). Individuals such as Mervyn Silva and Duminda Silva virtually functioned as the de-facto law enforcement, the latter having his rape case withdrawn by the AGs Department, curtsy the benign intervention of Mahinda Rajapaksa ,and the outlaw subsequently made a Monitoring MP, in charge, of all things, defence.
Not a single official, let alone a government minister, was brought before a court of law, or commission of inquiry (the only exception being the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, and that too due to the close watch on the case by the British authorities - the victim being a British national). There were ample instances where the law should have been enforced in its full force, such as when Sri Lankas High Commissioner in London was assaulted by Sajin Vas Gunawardena, a Rajapaksa factotum. On the contrary, the law was confined only to the textbooks and any attempt to implement the law and ensure justice was met with resistance. The fate that befell the countrys only lady Chief Justice, who delivered a verdict that went against a Rajapaksa sibling, is only too well known and needs no elaboration.
Sections of the pro-Rajapaksa media have today worn blinkers and putting out screaming headlines about the predicament of those in the dock, in the alleged Bond scam. Did any of these print or electronic media have occasion to report even a single instance of a government minister having to answer similar charges, under Rajapaksa. Isnt this concrete evidence that democracy, which was yearned for by the people, prior to January 8, has been fully restored, where even powerful government ministers are hauled over the coals

He alleged that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is the person who attempted to destroy the SLFP. All SLFPers and the people of this country very well knows that, Basil Rajapaksa cannot form any party and he can only destroy a party.
Thilakasiri was speaking at a media conference held at Shawasthri, Colombo yesterday.
Thilakasiri also questioned as to why the Pohottuwa Party has not yet revealed the name of its Chairman. He further said that nobody will hand over their nominations if they know who the chairman of this new party is. Therefore, they have allegedly published newspaper advertisements without mentioning the name of the Chairman.

Thousands of commuters stranded in Sri Lanka due to train strike

Thousands of commuters were left stranded in Sri Lanka on Thursday as railway unions launched an indefinite strike urging the government to fulfill their demands.
The unexpected strike was launched late on Wednesday evening, at a peak rush hour, leading to the cancellation of all trains throughout the island.
A tense situation erupted at the Fort Railway Station in capital Colombo on Wednesday when passengers were informed that trains had been cancelled.
The angry passengers launched a protest of their own against the railway unions, resulting in special police teams being deployed to calm the situation.
The Railway Unions launched the strike alleging that a group of junior train drivers, who were still under training, had been appointed by breaching the normal recruitment procedures.
The unions urged the government to look into the matter and revise the recruitment procedure of trainee.
Thousands of commuters who arrived at the railway stations on Thursday morning were left stranded.
Groups were seen get onto special buses. Special luxury buses had also been parked outside the stations to transport passengers to the north and south.
The strike caused severe traffic jams in Colombo and its outskirts as additional buses were deployed by the Transport Ministry.

Three pointers for Race 3
Salman Khan is one of the most sought-after superstars and has a gazillion fans. However, there are few things you would never come across in a Salman Khan film: explicit content, Salman in an antagonistic role and skimpily clad female actors. Staying true to his brand of cinema, the Tubelight actor has once again reportedly laid down these three clauses in front of the makers of Race 3.
According to reports, apart from that, Salman also wants to increase the humour content in the film. Salman has reportedly asked the writers, and producer Ramesh Taurani to make the film funnier and add more humour in the script. Also, there was allegedly a drug-peddling scene in the film that was nixed on Salmans insistence as he did not want to set a bad example for his fans, especially kids and youngsters who follow him.
Add to that, the Race franchise has also featured some steamy scenes between its protagonists. But that wont be the case with Salmans Race 3. The superstar wants the film to cater to family audiences and therefore, he doesnt want even one steamy scene, the reports add.

The much-anticipated Tourism Leaders Summit and International Research Symposium got underway for the 3rd successive year at the BMICH.
The event which was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena saw the launch of two commemorative stamps marking the occasion.
Over 1000 industry leaders, hoteliers and nearly 100 foreign delegates took part in the summit which hosted a series of informative and interactive sessions on tourism and in particular development and sustainability.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga who spoke at the Summit remarked that Sri Lanka is a key player in world tourism and the governments tourism vision 2020 will enable the country to achieve grater and sustainable benefits. Development and sustainability are two words that have become an oxymoron in the tourism sector, for being somewhat mutually exclusive, said Rilwan Razick, CEO of Universal College of Learning (UCOL), a vocational training centre for tourism and hospitality studies. There is no point in tourism growth if it ignores the plight of the vulnerable, address climate change or alleviate poverty.
A number of students from UCOL who were present at the summit cited that there was a dearth for such sessions and events that delve on how todays tourism leaders can pave the way for sustainable development in tourism, which is essential in a country like Sri Lanka. The event also saw the participation of many foreign academics and delegates who were there to share their lessons and experiences.

Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme and State Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim testified before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigation into the Treasury bond issue yesterday .
It was observed that both Ministers were summoned by the Commission and not the Attorney Generals Department. The tribunal questioned both Ministers on matters with regards to the Breakfast meeting held at the Central Bank on February 26,2015 and on the Rs. 15 billion urgent borrowing requirement as at February 2015.
Minister Malik Samarawickreme took to the witness box first. Commission Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioned Minister Samarawickreme on the Breakfast meeting held at the CBSL. According to evidence led before the Commission, the discussion at the Breakfast meeting was in relation to the emergency borrowing requirement of Rs. 15 billion to pay for certain road development projects which were already completed. Minister Samarawickreme said the emergency borrowing requirement of Rs. 15 billion was to do with payments for certain road development projects which were not settled by the previous regime.

KH: Then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Minister Malik Samarawickreme, then Governor Arjun Mahendran, the accountant of my ministry, Treasury and Central bank officials.
JC: What was the purpose of this meeting
KH: Why I was there was that I had just taken over the Ministry and some highway projects started by the previous regime were stopped halfway. We had gone to the Economic Management Committee and made a request for funds. If you give me permission, I can refer to my documents my ministry referred to at that time. (Permission granted). On February 6, 2015 my accountant wrote to the Treasury Secretary saying that there are certain contractors who have stopped work and that we need urgent funds to clear the Rs. 18 billion outstanding, out of which we had an allocation of 3 billion. So basically we needed 15 billion for immediate purposes.
KH: (Continues) Subsequently at a meeting held on February 24, 2015 at Temple Trees, the Economic Management Committee, these road development projects were taken up and again, this fund requirement was emphasized. Then we were asked to come to the Central Bank on 26 February 2015. My accountant certified me that there was Rs. 3 billion available. However, these numbers were uncertain. Unpaid bills were coming from projects done by the previous regime.
JC: So what were the decisions taken at this discussion
KH: We submitted our requirement to pay the unpaid bills. The Ministry of Finance and the general Treasury made us known that they will help us with the funds.
Justice P.S. Jayawardena: Was the Central Bank asked to do anything
KH: Not that I am aware of.
JC: So what was done after the meeting
KH: Subsequently we got Rs 8.3 billion in March 2015 from the Treasury. Then again we sent a new requisition on March 16, 2015 asking for Rs 15 billion. We said we received Rs 8 billion, but that we need the balance 10 billion. We got the money in March.
Justice Jayawardena: In the month of March, the ministry requirement was 18 billion and the requirement remained in March You wanted Rs 18 billion. Then you got Rs 8 billion. You asked for the balance of 10 billion. Which means, your requirement remained the same
KH: I cant say they transferred in March exactly.
JC: Was the February 27,2015 auction discussed at the meeting
KH: No.
JC: Did you meet or speak on the telephone with Arjun Mahendran after the Breakfast meeting on February 26, 2015 Or during the course of the following day
KH: I cannot remember but I do not think so.
JC: What is the position you held in 2015 to 2016, in the United National Party
KH: The General Secretary.
JC: During that period from 2015 to 2016, can you say that Perpetual Treasuries Limited or any member of Perpetual Capital group or Free Lanka or Arjun Aloysius or Geoffrey Aloysius or an immediate member of their family, did any fund contribution or payment to the United National Party
KH: No not to my recollection.
The panel of the Attorney General did not question Minister Hashim.
At the afternoon session, former EPF dealer Indika Saman Kumara was briefly questioned on recordings of two telephone calls that have transpired between him and a dealer in the Pan Asia Banking Cooperation with regards to certain Treasury bond transactions.
The Attorney Generals panel submitted a list of 20 witnesses who they recommend to be summoned before the Treasury Bond Commission. The Commission decided to summon, 3 of the 20 witnesses for questioning. The three witnesses were, Indika Saman Kumara (former EPF Chief Dealer), Steve Samuels (PA of Arjun Aloysius) and Nihal Fonseka (member of the Monetary Board).
Meanwhile, legal counsel Jeewantha Jayathilake informed the Commission that his client Steve Samuels was hospitalised due to a cardiac issue. Steve Samuels is the personal assistant of Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius. He was to testify before the Commission yesterday as well.
According to counsel Jayathilake, Samuels has been admitted to the emergency ward of the ICU of the Asiri surgical. It is the emergency ward for cardiac problems. He has been diagnosed with a chest pain and they are running a full investigation at the moment, he further said.
Counsel Jayatilake also said that he will tender the medical reports as soon as they reach him.
He has been present every day, even yesterday. This is a genuine problem. He has no reason to avoid; he has been present every day when he was asked to come, Jayathilake informed the Commission.
Commenting on Samuels absence, Justice Jayawardena told counsel Jayathilake that the Commission expects certain files to produced despite the witnesss absence.
Mr. Jayathilake, one of the reasons why Samuels is called is as you know; there were some text messeges where he refers to files maintained in the names of certain people with initials. We want to see those files. We have asked Mr. Samuels to produce those files. Even though he is not here, he can produce those files to the Commission during the course of today. These are not his personal files; these are presumably the companys. Make sure these files are produced for our perusal today, Justice Jayawardena said.
We have also endeavoured summons on Mr. Arjun Aloysius and Mr. Geoffrey Aloysius who apparently are difficult to locate. Counsel to Aloysius, please make sure these files are delivered today. We will not look at failure to produce these files very kindly.These files are maintained under the headings RK and AM. We want to see these files, Justice Jayawardena added.
Counsel Jayathilake said that his client has told that these files that were requested are not in his possession.
We expect to know in whose names these files are maintained, these persons who were the subject matter of these files.There was a reference to AM and an RK, so we would like to know who RK and AM were, Justice Jayawardena firmly concluded.
Re-examination of former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran will take place today at the Commission. Monetary Board member Nihal Fonseka will also be examined today.

Two-faced Rajapaksa sibling
There may be no elections for local government institutions or provincial councils this year but that hasnt deterred the major political parties from getting into elections gear in anticipation of these polls being held early next year.
The two partners in the National Unity government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) find themselves in an unusual and unprecedented situation. They are allies in the government, but they will be competing for votes with each other at the elections.
It will be recalled that, at the time of the August 2015 general election, the SLFP was not a coalition partner in the government although President Maithripala Sirisena was President; it was a minority UNP government that was in office. Also, in the run up to the election there were direct contests between UNP and SLFP stalwarts both at the district and electorate level.
This time around, although parliamentarians of the two parties are not contesting each other, politicians at the provincial and local government level would be, while their ministerial colleagues would be working together in the same Cabinet.
The mainstream SLFP, under the leadership of President Sirisena, has arguably the toughest challenge ahead. With the President at the helm of the party, it will be keen to record a substantial performance, especially in the wake of competition from the SLFP dissidents, who will contest under the banner of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP).
SLFP ministers
Towards this end, the President has already initiated one-to-one meetings with his parliamentarians, giving an ear to their grievances and instructing them to be prepared for elections at short notice. President Sirisena has also taken measures to replace Rajapaksa supporters with his own loyalists within the party organisation.
Previously, there was speculation that some SLFP ministers and parliamentarians in the government would cross-over and sit as independents in Parliament. There were suggestions that this would occur when the 20th Amendment was presented in Parliament. The 20th Amendment has now been all but withdrawn and President Sirisena- through personal meetings with his parliamentarians- has succeeded in preventing any cross-overs, at least for the foreseeable future.
The President is also acutely aware of the need to revitalise the SLFPs grassroots organisations and election network. That is because a sizeable section of that well-oiled apparatus has been depleted by the defection of Rajapaksa loyalists to the SLPP.
In the months prior to the current impasse between the SLFP and the Rajapaksa faction of the party, there were some attempts by party seniors to engineer reconciliation between the two groups. These efforts have yielded no results largely because the dissident faction operates on the principle that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should once again be considered as first among equals within the party.
To do so would fly in the face of the commitments to good governance undertaken by President Sirisena and place the investigations into allegations of corruption committed by the previous regime in jeopardy. As such, the prospect of a peace deal between the SLFP and SLPP is non-existent right now.
New Constitution
The arrest of parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa on Tuesday virtually confirms that there is little love lost between the mainstream SLFP and the Rajapaksa faction of the party. Hence, there is no political intervention that ensures that the Rajapaksas are molly-coddled when they are faced with consequences from the long arm of the law.
The SLPP meanwhile, is also getting its act together. It is now all but certain that the Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP will opt to market themselves to the electorate as the SLPP, where former ministers G.L. Peiris and Basil Rajapaksa are the official leaders of the party.
Basil Rajapaksa, in fact, undertook a recent visit to Jaffna and the fact that the SLPP was concerned about its electoral prospects in the North was very much in evidence during this tour. Rajapaksa was to some starling pronouncements- that Sri Lankan troops may have individually committed crimes during the war and also undertaking to return land now held by the military in the North.
If those statements were meant to appease the electorates in the North, it is somewhat at variance with its strategy in the South- where it has not hesitated to drum up anti-minority sentiments, playing the communal card to the Sinhala Buddhist majority- a tried and tested Rajapaksa strategy.
This tactic has been given a new lease of life with the ongoing debate and discussion about the proposed new Constitution. Although the Constitution is still in its draft form, the Joint Opposition (JO), the grouping of the Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP as well as other parties in the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), has already recorded its dissent.
The JO claims that what is being discussed is a federal set up and is keen to get the Buddhist clergy to back their call. They havent succeeded so far, with the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Venerable Thibbotuwave Sri Sumangala Thera publicly stating that the assurances provided by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in this regard are sufficient to allay any concerns. It will be interesting to see how the JO continues this discussion in the context of the differing viewpoints it articulates in the North and South of the country.
At the other end of the political spectrum meanwhile, the UNP is trying to get its act together, mindful that its image has taken a beating in the face of the rising cost of living and the public backlash following the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds.
The UNP is still upbeat about its prospects because it is aware that any division within the ranks of the SLFP will only split that partys vote. However, it cannot afford to be complacent. It is anybodys guess as to which party- the UNP or the mainstream SLFP- will suffer more from the burdens of incumbency, so the elections are likely to be a truly three-way contest, unlike the tussles between the UNP and the SLFP which the country has witnessed for many years.
Grand Old Party
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too has instructed the rank and file of his party to be alert to the possibility of a poll in the coming months. Analysts point out that despite being in power now and in 2001 and being the single largest party in Parliament, the UNP has not won an overall majority in a major election for nearly thirty years-since 1989. That is a sobering thought for the Grand Old Party. With the SLFP split into two camps, this could an opportunity for the UNP to regain its lost glory.
The left-of-centre Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will also hope that it can cash in on the electorates general discontent with the major parties which have alternatively held power in the country for nearly seven decades. However, even under the leadership of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, it has shown a reluctance to move with the times and embrace more progressive economic policies and this appears to be hampering its electoral prospects.
It is now likely that Local Government elections will precede Provincial Council elections and will be conducted early next year. It will be the first real test of popularity for all three front runners - the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP. While its results will not radically alter the balance of power in Parliament or within the Presidency, it will be a key indicator of popularity for these parties as they jostle for political supremacy- at least in the south of Sri Lanka.
