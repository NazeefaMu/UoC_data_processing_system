Fire ravages 200-year-old  Brazilian museum
BRAZIL: A massive fire on Sunday ripped through Rio de Janeiros treasured National Museum, one of Brazils oldest, in what the nations President said was a tragic loss of knowledge and heritage.
The majestic edifice stood engulfed in flames as plumes of smoke shot into the night sky, while some 20 fire brigades battled to control the blaze that erupted.
Five hours later they had managed to smother much of the inferno that had torn through hundreds of rooms, but were still working to extinguish it completely, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.
The museum, located in the citys north near the Maracana football stadium, was closed to the public when the fire sparked from a yet unknown cause.
The fire spread very quickly; there is a lot of inflammable material, a spokesperson for Rios fire department told AFP, adding that there were no reports of victims so far. The natural history and anthropology museum was founded in 1818 by King Joao VI and is considered a jewel of Brazilian culture, housing more than 20 million valuable pieces.
This is a tragic day for Brazil, President Michel Temer said in a statement. Two hundred years of work and research and knowledge are lost. The loss of the collection of the National Museum is incalculable, he said.
The collection included art and artifacts from Greco-Roman times and Egypt, as well as the oldest human fossil found within todays Brazilian borders, known as Luzia. The museum also housed the skeleton of a dinosaur found in the Minas Gerais region along with the largest meteorite discovered in Brazil, which was named Bendego and weighed 5.3 tons.
Pieces covering a period of nearly four centuries -- from the arrival of the Portuguese to the territory in the 1500s until the declaration of the first Brazilian republic in 1889 -- had also been stored there. A deputy director at the museum, Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, voiced profound discouragement and immense anger as the treasured institution burned, accusing Brazilian authorities of a lack of attention. He said the museum, a former palace that was once the official residence of the Portuguese royal family, had never had necessary support. We fought years ago, in different governments, to obtain resources to adequately preserve everything that was destroyed today, Dias Duerte told journalists. The National Museum, which is linked to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has suffered from funding cuts.
As flames raged researchers, professors and university students expressed a mix of sorrow and indignation, with some calling for demonstrations Monday in front of the ravaged building.
Senator Lindbergh Faris of the countrys leftist Workers Party decried the institutions lack of funding and blamed it on spending cuts ordered by the government. The fire comes as campaigning for Octobers critical presidential vote gets underway, one of the most uncertain Brazilian elections in decades. - AFP

Get paid to eat avocado every day
Avocados are delicious. They're great in salads, burritos, smashed on toast and are especially good for making guacamole dip.
The only downside is that they're pretty expensive . In most supermarkets a large one costs at least 1 - and that won't go very far, especially for big families. But now there's a dream job going where you get paid to them for six months.
It's all in the name of science , as researchers are trying to figure out whether the fruit (yes, avocado is a fruit) trims belly fat or not.
Loma Linda University in California is looking for 250 avocado lovers to eat them in large and small quantities as part of the study.
Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: one will eat one avocado every day for six months, while the other will eat just two per month. At the end of the trial, each avocado eater will be paid 230. Not bad for simply munching on avo every now and again! It would probably need to be your side hustle though.
On their website, researchers write : "Since avocados contain the highest fat content of any fruit, it seems illogical to think they might actually help people lose their belly fat.
"Nevertheless, thats the hypothesis behind an upcoming study." The only downside is, the avocado eaters in the trial will have to undergo tests to see if they lose weight or not - so you really need to live across the pond to do the job.
There's also a few requirements. Participants need to be over 25, measure at least 40 inches around the waist if they are male and 35 inches if they are female. They also need to be willing to eat plenty of avo, obviously. Mirror

Government has created economic stability  PM
The government has now created economic stability in the country disproving the predictions made by opponents and pessimists that it was heading for bankruptcy. The people are aware that the country is able to service the enormous debts bequeathed by the previous regime, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was speaking at a meeting in Padiyatalawa on Sunday after launching development work on the Badulla - Chenkaladi road from Bibile to Chenkaladi.
The Prime Minister said the government was able to establish economic stability as a matter of priority, due to the difficult and unpopular decisions taken during the last three years. As a result, there were now sufficient funds to administer the country while servicing debts.
Usually a government elected to power wished to start development work from Day One. But the yahapalana government could not do so due to the enormous debt burden left over by the previous regime. At first, the government had two options. It had to decide whether to increase VAT facing public opposition or to refrain from it to steer the country to bankruptcy. It bravely took the first option of increasing VAT and enabled the country to gain economic stability, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier said the previous regime went for early elections before schedule because the country was in dire straits economically without sufficient funds to carry out the governments daily operations. The countrys total income in 2013 was Rs. 1,137 billion, while Rs.1,162 billion was needed to pay premium and interest on foreign debt.
Today, the government was moving forward by granting all forms of relief needed by the people notwithstanding their criticism. He had instructed all ministers to go all out to cater to the needs of the people and their development needs.
The Prime Minister said despite various difficulties, the government had accomplished a great amount of work during the last three years. Steps had been taken to fill 4,000 vacancies for principals in the education sector, 854 vacancies in the Education Administrative Service and 1,700 vacancies in the teacher service. Measures had also been taken to cater to sanitation needs in schools by building 26,000 toilets.
Steps were taken to provide stents free of charge to heart patients, the Prime Minister said. A range of medicines had been subjected to price control and cancer patients had been given a lifetime medical allowance of Rs.1.5 million. Under the Nearest school is the best school programme, new school buildings have been provided to 3,000 primary schools and 1,000 secondary schools. All schoolchildren have been given medical insurance cover under the Suraksha programme.
The Mahapola allowance has been increased from Rs.2,500 to Rs.5,000. A Rs.20,000 allowance has been offered to expectant mothers, the Premier said. Work has been started on 1,100 reawakened villages and 10,000 plantation sector houses. Nearly 1,000 land deeds have been awarded up to the end of August. Jobs have been given to a batch of 5,000 unemployed graduates.
The country has regained the GSP facility and this would help increase export income. The Hambantota Port would start operations soon, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said development of villages has begun under the Gamperaliya programme for which the government allocated Rs. 9,000 million. The Opposition which had got into a frenzy after witnessing the enormous development work in process had started making wild accusations that the government was mortgaging the country and hunting for war heroes.
They were doing this to sabotage the work undertaken by the country. This in itself proved that the government had accomplished a great amount of work for the wellbeing of the country and its people.
The people are free to judge the governments performance and exercise their votes in its favour at the next elections if it has done something concrete for their benefit and welfare. The government has shown results notwithstanding all conspiracies hatched against it by its opponents.
The total extent of the Badulla - Chenkaladi road is 175 kilometres. Altogether, 500 kilometres of roads would be developed in the Moneragala district, the Prime Minister said.
The government would develop 3,700 kilometres of roads after paying contractors hired by the previous regime for road development work and paying compensation for people whose land was taken over for road construction.
When the Mattala Airport is developed by year end and areas like Moneragala, Ampara Padiyatalawa and Mahiyangana witness speedy development, everyone should unite behind the government to take the country forward, he said.
The Prime Minister said the handing over of the BIMSTEC Chair to President Maithripala Sirisena at the recent summit itself has disproved critics who claimed that the country had been marginalised internationally.
The Prime Minister thanked everyone present including Ministers Kabir Hashim and Daya Gamage and Deputy Ministers Anoma Gamage and Sriyani Wijewickrema.

Government to open vocational training institute in Orugodawatte
Sri Lankan government will open a new vocational training institute, Korean Tech, in Orugodawatte to provide technical, vocational education and training for Sri Lankan youth with an investment of Rs 2,500 million shortly.
Korean Tech, funded by the Korean government is slated to open in January next year and will recruit 2,000 selected candidates per annum for eight different courses which include Automotive Technology, Robotics, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology, Welding Technology, Refrigeration and A/C Technology, Electrical Technology, Mechatronics, Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) Chairman, Ravi Jayawardana told Daily News Business.
In addition, Sri Lankan government will lay the foundation stone for another vocational training centre in Polonnaruwa district with the financial assistance of the Netherlands government at a cost of Rs 6 billion.
He said further that Sri Lankan apparel and construction industries currently face an acute labour shortage and have close to 400,000 and 200,000 job vacancies in these two industries respectively. There is less demand for vocational training courses in the field of carpentry, masonry, plumbing and other construction related activities due to lack of recognition for these occupations in the society, Wijewardana said.
Wijewardana also emphasised the need to change the name, commonly used to call the professionals in masonry work, Basunahe and come up with a proper name to identify them and to give their profession a due recognition in the society.
In the meantime, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Sarath Amunugama speaking at a press conference to announce the launch of Nipuni Skills Platform held at Sethsiripaya on Thursday (30) said the government has identified Construction, Automobile engineering, Tourism and hotel management, Information technology and health care service as key priority sectors which have immense potential to create job opportunities both home and abroad.
The minister said the main objective of launching the Nipuni platform is to identify National vocational Qualification (NVQ) qualified individuals dispersed throughout the country, store their information and keep tabs on their progress in all in one centralized databases. With the launch of this platform, the Ministry hopes to enhance the link between supply and demand of qualified individuals in the country.
Accordingly, the employers will have the opportunity to obtain information on NVQ certified individuals via Nipuni Skills platform, identify individuals who are most suitable for their demands and hire them.
Minister Amunugama said further that he had given instructions to National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), VTA and other technical colleges which come under the purview of his ministry to double the annual student intake for courses conducted in the field of Construction, Automobile engineering, Tourism and hotel management, Information technology and health service sectors.
The government in an ambitious drive to give due recognition for technical education in the country has taken measures to further improve the quality of courses offered by NAITA, VTA and other technical colleges which come under the purview of the Ministry. Furthermore, plans are underway to obtain international accreditations for NVQ level courses, offered by the technical colleges in Sri Lanka.
In addition, under the directions of Minister, a separate unit has been set up to constantly review and keep the contents of ongoing courses of technical colleges updated and relevant to be on par with the standards of courses offered internationally.
The minister also emphasised that present education system is not updated and relevant enough to cater to the job market requirements and urged the need to popularize and create awareness among Sri Lankan youth on the importance of pursuing a diploma or a well recognized degree course from a technical and vocational education institute in Sri Lanka.
According to the Minister, wages of those who have obtained NVQ level certificate in Sri Lanka are much higher than the wage of an employee with a degree from a local university.
Every year close to 325,000 students sit for Advanced level examination, of which only 30,000 students get the opportunity to enter state universities in Sri Lanka. This shows that present education system has failed to understand or redress the major issues facing the local youth in Sri Lanka, Minister Amunugama said.
According to the minister, the governments patronage to further improve the quality and increase the student intake capacity of technical and vocational education and training institutes in Sri Lanka will help address the youth unemployment in Sri Lanka.
He also said that the ultimate objective of his Ministry is to help local youth pursue a fair and dignified career rather than sending them abroad for unskilled jobs.

Health statistics to be digitized
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will be able to view all statistics and other information on Sri Lankan health services in a few weeks by punching a key in a computer placed on his table, Prof. Vajira Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) in Colombo yesterday.
He said even now all statistics and other vital information on Sri Lankan health services is available online.
It is a baseless lie that the Health Ministry is alleged to be ignorant of the basic information on health service such as the number of state hospitals etc. Health information of schoolchildren numbering about four million is now available online.
According to Prof. Dissanayake, in the future, all state and private hospitals will be networked to speed up the availability of information on patients. Citizens will be given a Personal Health Number enabling them to visit any hospital and obtain medical treatment without taking their documents such as blood reports, medical reports etc.
Patients will have their own identification similar to the National Identity Card.
Prof. Dissanayake said there are around 600 small state hospitals and about 30 of them are connected to the eHealth system, while 300 more are to be connected within the next three to four years.
There are around 50 large state hospitals at present and 10 of them are connected to the system. The rest will be connected soon.
All maternal and child related data is available online while tabs or smart mobile phones will be given to midwives and public health nurses to feed information to the National System.
Sri Lanka is well ahead of other countries with regard to eHealth and Sri Lanka launched it before the WHO stressed the requirement of such a system, Prof. Dissanayake added.

IIT introduces Masters in Cyber Security and Forensics
Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in British higher education in Sri Lanka, has launched Sri Lankas first-ever Cyber Security and Forensics Masters programme from the University of Westminster, UK.
Students following the two year part time course will gain insights into the nature of the security threats faced by todays computer systems, the type of information that is stored on digital devices and how digital evidences can be traced and extracted from them.
The course offers students the chance to learn about a variety of tools available today which include forensic tools. It will also look into the analysis of professional and ethical issues relating to computer security and forensics, and the development of related professional competencies, such as report writing and presenting evidence in a court of law.
The course is structured in a way where all students cover five core modules and choose a specialisation in Cyber Security or Digital Forensics.
The core modules include Cyber Security Evidence and Procedure, Fundamentals of Security Technology, Internet Security, Research Methods and Professional Practice.Cyber Security focuses on analysis and assessment of risk plus how to minimise it. Digital Forensics addresses how to extract and use digital information from a wide range of systems and devices to detect crimes.
Commenting on the newest addition to the institutes portfolio, Naomi Krishnarajah, Dean of IIT said, In todays high-tech world, computers play a vital role in all aspects of our daily lives. Numerous industries and institutions  from hospitals, banks, power plants, telecommunication companies and many more  rely heavily on them for virtually every aspect of their operations. Unfortunately, while the world is becoming increasingly inter-connected, there is not enough attention paid to the security aspects and therefore computer systems and the huge volumes of data on them are vulnerable to attacks by malicious parties. Therefore, the need for improved computer security has never been greater and will only continue to increase into the future. We are introducing this Masters programme to increase the number of skilled professionals in the country to cope with this fast-changing field of IT, she said.
The first intake for this programme commences in September 2018. All IIT courses are offered by friendly, highly-experienced staff, and benefit from the diverse specialist knowledge and skills within the institute.
Teaching methodology at IIT includes lab-based sessions, student-led tutorials and lectures by internal staff and guest lectures from experts in the industry while assessments will be carried out primarily through practical or research-based course work.
Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) was established in 1990 as the first private higher education institute that awards reputed British degrees in the field of ICT and Business.
IIT is an award-winning campus offering internal postgraduate and undergraduate degrees from the University of Westminster, UK and Robert Gordon University, UK. IIT has played a pivotal role in strengthening the IT and Business sectors in Sri Lanka over the years by producing world-class graduates.
These graduates have gone on to become successful entrepreneurs and IT/Business professionals in both local and international corporate and government entities. Since its inception, IIT has produced thousands of graduates who have excelled in over 250 organizations around the globe.

Improvement in external finances, Fitch
Sri Lankas recent reforms and automatic pricing of fuel will improve state finances and debt, but political uncertainty has heightened following recent regional polls, Fitch Ratings said in a statement yesterday.
In its Asia Pacific Sovereign Credit Overview for the third quarter of 2018 Fitch said, Sri Lankas rating balances an improving policy framework, which supports macroeconomic stability and rising government revenues, against a challenging external debt servicing outlook and high government debt. The rating is supported by higher per-capita income levels and stronger governance standards than the B category median.
Sri Lankas rating balances an improving policy framework, which supports macroeconomic stability and rising government revenues, against a challenging external debt servicing outlook and high government debt.
The rating is supported by higher per-capita income levels and stronger governance standards than the B category median.
The IMF completed its fourth review under a three-year extended fund facility in place since June 2016. Progress has been made on critical fiscal reforms, including approval of an automatic fuel price mechanism effective May 2018.
The authorities have also taken steps to introduce an automatic electricity pricing mechanism and establish a committee to develop a detailed restructuring plan for Sri Lankan Airlines. Nevertheless, Sri Lankas government debt remains high at around 77% of GDP, far above the B median of 66.6%.
The sovereigns projected debt service payments are significant, at USD15 billion in 2019-2022, from a bunching of sovereign bond redemptions, while its foreign-exchange reserves stood at only USD 9.3 billion at end-June.
The scale of external refinancing over the next few years creates a potential vulnerability for the sovereign particularly as US interest rates are on the rise.
Further improvement in external finances supported by higher non-debt-creating inflows or a reduction in external sovereign refinancing risks from improved liability management.

Indian media bemoan spineless cricketers
New Delhi, Monday: Decrying a meek surrender and heartbreak defeat, Indian newspapers said on Monday that Virat Kohlis world number one Test side had only themselves to blame for their series defeat in England.
The cherished dream of staging one of the greatest comebacks in modern cricket history could so easily have been fulfilled but some spineless batting saw Kohlis men crashing to another series loss away from home, the mass-circulation Times of India wrote.
Mail Today bemoaned Indias meek surrender and the Times of India said it was a heartbreak that will not be easy to deal with.
Kohlis side needed 245 to win the fourth Test in Southampton but they were bundled out for 184 after tea Sunday, giving the hosts a 3-1 lead with one match left to play.
Earlier this year India lost 2-1 in South Africa.
India faltered with the bat in both the innings against England, triggering questions about their temperament and technique.
The Indian Express headlined its story: Almost, but not good enough and said the loss should both hurt and teach.
They have a band of men that comes close but falters, cant cross over, the English-language daily said.
The papers concurred with Kohli that challenging rivals is not enough and that India must find ways to win close matches.
The Hindustan Times said the bowlers had given momentum to Indias push for overseas success but the batsmen havent stood up, leaving far too much to the class and consistency of skipper Virat Kohli.
Kohli has been the leading batsman in the five-Test series with his tally of 544 runs at an average of 68, including two hundreds. AFP

Since the beginning of this year, Nations Trust Bank has conducted Investor Forums via a Webinar providing an easily accessible, flexible platform for investors from diverse backgrounds to participate.
The Investor Forum webinar, which focused on the first-half performance of the Bank for 2018, was conducted on the 31st August 2018. Renuka Fernando  Director/CEO of Nations Trust Bank PLC delivered the main presentation and this was followed by a lively, interactive Q&A session. A panel comprising of top Bank officials was present to provide answers to questions in real-time. The panel was made up of Renuka Fernando, Director/CEO, Ajith Akmeemana, Chief Financial Officer, Priyantha Talwatte, Senior Executive Vice President Consumer Banking & Cards, Thilak Piyadigama, Chief Operating Officer and Hemantha Gunetilleke, Senior Executive Vice President Commercial Banking
Discussing the Investor Forum Webinar, Renuka Fernando, Director/CEO, Nations Trust Bank said, At the beginning of the year, we decided to host our investor forum via webinar for the first time. This was in keeping with our commitment to digital technologies and harnessing the power of the emerging digital, paperless, electronic economy.

We have performed satisfactorily despite increased impairment charges slowing bottom line growth. Tightening liquidity in the market has also moderated credit growth and increased NPLs during the 1st half and this has affected the industry as a whole and not just us in isolation. Overall, there was plenty to discuss at this years webinar and we also received a good response in terms of interaction between investors and the Banks panel.

## Title: Invigorating civil society

Invigorating civil society
The chase after individual heroes in order to solve the countrys problems was futile, as this column had earlier stated. It is necessary to seek suitable rational policies instead. However, last week we demonstrated that the policies practised by all post-independence governments have failed. Hence, there is also a need for new policies. It is also obvious that we need new political actors, which does not necessarily mean new political parties. It is up to the civil society to facilitate this change.
The civil society needs to awaken itself from the deep slumber. Sri Lankan civil society passes through spasms, becoming generally active on the eve of elections and vice versa. There is much to be desired in its organisation. Just as in politics in general, it also shows a tendency to rally round individual leaders.
However, the role of leaders cannot be denied or under-valued. They are necessary but they could lead only insofar as they represent the interests of the masses as such. Exaggerating their role or deifying them as per tradition or otherwise leads to unwholesome developments including curtailment of democracy.
Excepting for political parties and their affiliated front organisations, trade unions and professional bodies and few religious associations most other civil society organisations tend to be elitist and basically undemocratic. Some do not even enroll members, the organisation being limited to a coterie of leaders and their yes men. Most NGOs also belong to this category despite the massive resources at the command of some of them.
Democratic principles
However, there are numerous civil society organisations with an organisational basis at the local level. They are dispersed and are exclusive in nature. There are no moves for any coordination among them as they are so diverse and so dispersed.
In this situation how could civil society play its vital role in pushing the country on a new path of independent development This is the question that warrants an answer.
From the above it would be obvious that what are required are civil society organisations with a mass democratic character. To be such they should be based on rational democratic principles which could guarantee freedom, equity, equality and fraternity among all citizens.
As often said we have been unable to cement a Sri Lankan identity. Instead communal and even religious differences continue to divide us. Diversity which should be a source of strength has been transformed into cause for separation. Of late ethno-religious fundamentalism or groups promoting Sinhala-Buddhist hegemony are on the rise. This is despite all religions preaching universal brotherhood of man or maha karuna. Hence, what is required is a secular civil movement or a socio-economic movement based on secularism. Only such an organisation would be all inclusive.
Rule of Law is a sine qua non for development. Corruption and fraud would thrive in a society devoid of the rule of law. The failure of the Yahapalana Government in bringing to justice those who were alleged to have been involved in massive acts of fraud and deception can be attributed to the breakdown of the rule of law.
Even the judiciary is not free from suspicion in this environment. What is more despicable is a new tendency in which interested parties are agitating to get laws repealed or prevent new laws being formulated for crimes they are likely to commit.
An example is the agitation against the revision of traffic fines. Surreptitious and not-so surreptitious moves are afoot to reduce the powers of the State judicial authorities and exempt them from adjudicating in cases where the accused are members of the Buddhist clergy. It is imperative that any movement for socio-economic change should uphold and defend the rule of law.
Governments have been always shown a tendency to ignore or shoot down public opinion. The obstinacy with which the Western Provincial Council insists on importing chairs at Rs 650,000 each is a case in point. Numerous are the instances in which even the Parliament is faced with fait accompli in various commercial undertakings. e.g. The SL-Singapore FTA. Hence, another vital principle that should be adhered to is transparency of dealings. This is especially so since all public officials and representatives should be held accountable.
On the economic front Sri Lanka should naturally opt for a mixed economy. Being a small country with a narrow market it is imperative that it produces goods and services for the wider international market.
Foreign direct investment likewise is necessary. The latter should be conditional on the requirements of the economy. The practice of approving unsolicited proposals or those with environmental concerns should be abandoned.
Agriculture should receive prioritize attention in economic planning and development. Sri Lanka could abandon its traditional commercial crops - tea, rubber and coconut at its own peril. It is necessary to develop both commercial and subsistence agriculture down the value chain without abandoning them half-way. Moreover, FDI should be engaged mainly for production oriented industrial and agricultural development rather than costly and less productive infrastructural improvements.
Poor and under- privileged masses
Whatever economic reform that a new social movement should guarantee it must in the main benefit the poor and under-privileged masses. Though the neo-liberal economic reforms promised that its benefits would trickle down to the bottom it did not happen and is unlikely to happen.
Hence, what are required are pro-poor reforms or reforms that guarantee a decent living to the masses.
It is true that such development may require tightening belts and reduction of wasteful expenditure including the luxury and opulence of the rich. In a society in which the rich and the poor are polarized in the extreme, it is not enough to tighten the screws at the poor pole alone.
Sri Lanka has to charter its own path to independent development. There are no short-cuts or ready-made foreign models to replicate.
That means the Singapore model, among others is an utopian dream. The same goes for replicating Korea, Japan or China. Sri Lanka has both physical and human resources for such a venture. In order to log on to the path of independent development national unity, creative thinking and innovation have to be assembled.

Irrigation tank renovations soon in Anuradhapura
The island-wide Gamen Gamata, Wawen Wewata minor tank renovation project would soon begin in Anuradhapura. It was planned under President Maithripala Sirisena's Grama Shakthi village development project aimed at renovating and restoring dilapidated irrigation and drainage networks, to avert drinking water scarcity.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that President Sirisena would inaugurate the minor tank renovations at Nabadagasdigiliya in Mahawilachchiya, coming under the Dunumandalawa tank network. The network consists of eight tanks, namely the Nabadagasdigiliya, Helambawewa, Mahamillagollewa, Ihala Millagollewa, Ihala Helanlawewa, Galahitiyawa and Ihala Ethawewa tanks.
The army would carry out the construction under the supervision of Brigadier Chandana Wijesundara, while technical assistance would be provided by the Agrarian Development Department and the Provincial Irrigation Department, he added.
The Mahawilachchiya and the Nochchiyagama Divisional Secretariat divisions had been affected the most by the prevailing drought. Farmer organisations would provide additional manpower. Once the Dunumandalawa tank network renovation is complete, the Ambagahawewa tank network in Nochchiyagama would be next, Wanninayake said.
The second network consists of the Ihala Galkiriyagama, Diwulwewa and Pahala Galkiriyagama tanks, as well as the Ihala Kongasdigiliya Wewa, Lena Wewa, Kimbulpetiyawa Wewa, Nai Wewa and Elapathgama Wewa, Wanninayake added.
Project Coordinator and Assistant Anuradhapura Agriculture Director Sirisena Herath said that funding was provided by the Presidential Task Force for Food Production.

## Title: The JO roadshow

The JO roadshow
The Joint Opposition is all set for yet another roadshow tomorrow. The JO is planning to bring one million supporters to Colombo tomorrow (or at least that is what MP Sisira Jayakody has told a newspaper), to protest against the postponement of elections, sale of public assets, political victimization and the rise in the cost of living among other things. In other words one in every 20 members of the Sri Lankan public will join the protest tomorrow. Through this the JO hopes to bring the government to its knees. The latest circus is seen by many as a springboard for the JO to launch its campaign for the major elections that are round the corner. However, cracks have already appeared among JO ranks, particularly in the choice of the next Presidential candidate, with Mahinda Rajapaksa already out of the reckoning. How these fissures will play out at tomorrows do, no doubt, would be keenly observed by political observers.
Being a working day, the protest demonstration certainly is going to cause chaos in the city by way of traffic snarls, disruption of transport and public life in general. There is also the likelihood of damage caused to public property by the thugs and hooligans who will descend on the city from the outstations. Hence it is appropriate that IGP Pujith Jayasundera has issued a dire warning to would be trouble makers. Security has been beefed up with additional units, including the STF, deployed to doubly ensure no untoward incidents take place. This is because there will be those hell-bent on creating mayhem to cause the maximum damage to the government. Special protection has also been given to Parliament and other vital institutions, according to the IGP.
While political protests are a democratic right which this government has ensured to the optimum, on no account should this be at the expense of law and order, and the riffraff to run amok. We say this because the calibre of supporters in the ranks of the JO are inclined to turn violent and cause damage in their wake, as has been demonstrated time and again. One recalls an incident in Anuradhapura where JO supporters blocked an ambulance transporting a patient in serious condition during a similar protest rally. On that occasion TV also showed some of the participants lying on the ground in various poses of inebriation. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that at tomorrows do also liquor will be in free supply and the likelihood of unruly scenes could not be ruled out.
No doubt, a massive financial layout is involved in the whole campaign. Like Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said, the huge war chest accumulated by the Rajapaksas during their 10 year rule is being put to good by the siblings for making a comeback. There are big stakes involved, including the corruption cases pending against the former first family that are being accelerated by the special courts already set up. By showing the numbers the Rajapaksas also hope to intimidate the investigators probing these misdeeds. There is no other reason for a futile exercise as that which is planned for tomorrow.
Elections will not be held until the due dates and the cost of living will not be brought down through demonstrations. Similar circuses were held in the past too, with Wimal Weerawansa threatening to surround Colombo api kolomba watalanawa. Nothing came out of these except giving an opportunity for the denizens to get their fill of Colombo. Like Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said, the protest will only serve to loosen the limbs of the participants (kakulwala hiri eraganda hondai) and would have no impact on the government.
Be that as it may, whatever the numbers the JO could muster for tomorrows s demonstration the fact remains that its vote bank would remain at 40%, the maximum it could attain, at the local government poll, at a time the governments popularity had hit the nadir. With President Sirisena all but announcing he would run for a second time, the coveted 50%+1 would only be a distant dream for whoever contests from the Pohottuwa. Things can only get worse, what with stalwarts such as Kumara Welgama and Vasudeva Nanayakkara openly opposing the candidature of Gota. Besides, the same dynamics would not apply in the case of a Presidential election as with a LG poll where voters are bound to consider the larger picture.
Also the government has taken concrete measures to redress the issues that confronted the people at the time the LG poll was held. The Samurdhi benefit which was withdrawn from a large number of villagers has been restored and the prices of a variety of essential drugs slashed. The high charges levied by private hospitals too has been reduced. Farmer subsidies have also been increased. The Udagam programme of Minister Sajith Premadasa too is continuing apace while the development programmes, which were hitherto not visible to the public are presently receiving full publicity. Perhaps the positives that are evident and appreciated by the public may have prompted the JO to divert their attention through such a circus as the one planned for tomorrow.

Misappropriation of Rs.5.2m in public funds
JOHNSTON, TWO OTHERS REMANDED
Former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others were remanded yesterday by Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds, until completion of the hearing.
The three suspects in the Lak Sathosa financial misappropriation case, former Cooperatives and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando and two others were remanded when the case came before the Kurunegala High Court.
The Kuruengala District Member of Parliament along with former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M. Fernando and the former Ministers Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer were also served with indictments for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
The three suspects are charged under the Public Property Act.
According to the Court, Fernando as the Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.
The former Minister and two others were arrested by the Financial Crime Investigations Division (FCID) on May 5, 2015. In 2015, he arrived at the FCID to give a statement on complaints of financial fraud at Lak Sathosa.
He was released on bail by former Kurunegala High Court Judge Sunanda Kumara Rathnayake on May 28, 2015.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appeared for the suspect with the assistance of Attorney Rashmi Kalinga Indatissa and Resan Widhanagamage.
They were remanded until the verdict will be delivered. Tight security was deployed in and around the Court premises. The case will be consecutively heard from September 11.

Kohli wants India to do more than  compete after England series loss
SOUTHAMPTON Sept2: India captain Virat Kohli said being competitive was not enough after a 60-run defeat by England in the fourth Test at Southampton condemned his side to yet another away series loss.
Sunday's result, achieved with more than a day to spare, left England an unassailable 3-1 up ahead of the fifth and final Test at The Oval in south London starting on Friday. For all India are the world's top-ranked Test side, they have now won just one of their last nine series outside Asia. A target of 245 at Hampshire's headquarters proved beyond them, with India dismissed for 184 after tea on the fourth day as England off-spinner Moeen Ali, the man-of-the-match, took four for 71.
While the in-form Kohli (58) and vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane (51) were sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 101, India were in the hunt.
But they folded quickly after Ali snared Kohli and Rahane either side of tea.
We can look at the scoreboard and say we were only 30 runs away or 50 runs away, but we have to recognise that when we are in the midst of the situation, and not later, Kohli told reporters.
Crossing the line
We know that we have played good cricket but we cannot say again and again to ourselves that we have competed. India only lost the first Test by 31 runs.
Kohli is the leading batsman this series with his tally of 544 runs at an average of 68, including two hundreds.
But it still has not been enough to drag India to a series win.
When you come so close, there is an art of crossing the line as well, which we will have to learn, Kohli insisted.
We have the ability, which is why we are getting close to a result, and we have belief in that ability.
But when a pressure situation comes, how we react to it... is something we have to work on a bit, and everyone is ready to work on that. It may well also help India to have more warm-up games in order to adjust to local conditions, which often play such a large part in Test cricket.
They had a solitary red-ball match against Essex prior to this series -- and that game was reduced to three days from four at their request.
India then went 2-0 down before winning last week's third Test at Nottingham's Trent Bridge by 203 runs. At Southampton, they reduced England to 86 for six only for Sam Curran to again prove a thorn in their side, with the 20-year-old all-rounder's Test-best 78 taking the hosts to 246 in their first innings.
We've spoken about that, even during the match when we're in a driving position, we should be able to capitalise on it and not let the opposition come in and fight back again and again, said Kohli. At Nottingham we did that, for three days we were relentless and were on top.  AFP

Leaders Surrey  beat Notts  by an innings at The Oval
LONDON, Saturday: Division One leaders Surrey finished off Nottinghamshire just after lunch on the third day at The Oval to win by an innings and 125 runs to claim a seventh straight County Championship win.
Resuming on their overnight 83-2, things looked even bleaker for Notts when Morne Morkel removed Samit Patel and Billy Root in successive balls. And when opener Kraigg Brathwaite was sixth out for 60 it looked all over. Conor McKerr took 4-26 and Morkel 3-39 as Notts were all out for 149.
Surreys 23-point victory - their eighth in 10 Championship matches this season - strengthens their already dominant position at the top, now 55 points clear - prior to the finish of second-placed Somersets game with Yorkshire - with just four games left.
Reigning county champions Essex beat Hampshire by an innings and 52 runs to ease Division One relegation fears.
Australian Test paceman Peter Siddle took 5-48, while spinner Simon Harmer chipped in with 4-64. Hants, 17-2 overnight, made a bad start when Ian Holland played on before James Vince had his off stump extracted by Siddle, then Kyle Abbott was run out.

Love at first sight may be real
Love at first sight has been subject of a number of stories and has been portrayed in films and pop culture for decades. But while the idea of falling in love after catching the first glimpse of a person may not make sense to many, can it be real
Psychologists have discovered that love at first sight exists and it causes a rush in the body similar to the pleasure of eating candy. A study found that it takes just one second for a person to register beauty as an intense jolt of pleasure follows. The finding is a part of a project which tries to understand how beauty can be measured to know its effect on actions in day-day life. Focussing on a branch of psychology called empirical aesthetics, the study found that the most alluring angle for the curve of a womans spine where it meets the bottom is 45 degrees throughout history.
These norms relating to beauty play a part in choices people make as they spend money and time to acquire beauty or enhance their appearance. The findings also back the claim of philosophers that experience of beauty is a feeling of pleasure.

Making meaningful music
If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you - Friedrich Nietzsche The world is descending straight into the abyss. Our humanity and morality are being dragged into this never ending pit. However there is always hope as long as people like Arun Jilukshan and his band continue to play. Melodies speaks to Abyss a band that is a voice raising awareness about issues that need to be discussed.
The abyss to us is a never ending pit. That is our perspective. To elaborate on what it means to us is that there are certain rules and regulations imposed on us by the political systems in this world, even though there are those who say they dont want to conform to this system, most of us are forced to follow it. Basically the entire nation is being dragged into a never ending pit, where they are forced to conform to these rules and regulations.
It is sad, but we are fighting a system that is corrupt. Man people hold positions when they do not deserve it, said Jilukshan. A Death Groove Metal Band they feel strongly about burning issues in society and with the power of their rock music they highlight these issues.
Basically Abyss does not only focus on one type of genre. We normally do a genre called Groove Metal with a mix of death elements called Death Metal Elements. Basically we call ourselves a Death Groove Metal Band! In Sri Lanka rock and metal music is not very much supported. It is supported through a few social media platforms. The message we want to give people is about what this country is going through. The message we want to give everyone is to live your life the way you want to live your life. You dont have to follow rules and regulations given to you by other people. As long as you know that what you are doing is right just do it and just follow it, explained Jilukshan.
Jilukshan states that there is talent in this country when it comes to rock and metal. These people just need the exposure and opportunity. We want rock and metal to be a big part of this country. There are so many talented musicians in this country who want to bring their talent out in this sphere. But there do not have this opportunity because of the lack of support they get. So we want to get this message out, said Jilukshan.
There is a need for equal treatment in society. You cant have one set of rules and regulations for one group of people and a totally different set of rules and regulations for another group of people.
The day to day events and the unfairness people go through this world inspire us to write our lyrics. Let me give you an example. If you take a pregnant woman about to give birth to her baby and she is rushing to the hospital. But on the roads no one even realizes she is there and she needs to get to the hospital urgently. No one makes way for her to travel fast to get to the hospital. But you take a minister; all the roads are opened up for him. Everyone makes way for him. So this unfairness in society is what we want to bring out through our music. An expecting mother is not treated the right way but a minster is given all these privileges. She is poor and stuck in a three-wheeler and doing her best to get there.
We need everyone to be treated the same we need to get that awareness. Everyone should be treated the same. There should be equality, pointed Jilukshan. Jilukshan added that there is a misconception about local rock and metal, people think it is dangerous and satanic or they think is gives a bad message to society. They do not appreciate it. But actually it is not. It is an art.
My major musical influences are bands such as System of a down, Lamb of god, Pantera and Motorhead (The game and King of kings by Motorhead). And my guitar influence is Daron Malakian of System of a down. I am also a huge WWF fan and I like the wrestler Triple H ! The theme music was by Motorhead and I got addicted to this music and got into the genre. I love it! I liked that rock heaviness, said Jilukshan. He feels that Sri Lankan rock and metal music must be showcased to the rest of the world. They have a group of dedicated fans who flock to their gigs but he feels Abyss and other rock bands have the potential to go international.
We have a passionate following in the form of our fans. One FB post is enough to get them all the way over to where we do our gig. We are very happy with our fans. We need Sri Lankan talent to be shown to the world and we need to go internationally. The world should know there is a Sri Lankan local metal scene going on. They have to know Sri Lanka has many passionate talented musicians, added Jilukshan. Jilukshan stressed that there are so many entities in Sri Lanka who are brainwashing people saying that rock music is bad and not to listen to it. They say it creates evil in you which is not true at all.
They say that those who listen to rock music are not normal and sort of outcasts. Basically anyone can listen to metal and have fun and it brings your emotions out.
My message to those who want to succeed is not to give up even though there may be only two or three people at your gig. Just play for them. Dont stop just keep doing it. So many bands do well initially and have talent but along the way they come to a point when they feel they have no support. So what they do is they stop the band. Make original music and support the local industry Lastly I wish to add that brainwashing people is a problem.
When you read the newspaper or go on the internet or FB, you see stories of children getting raped and women getting raped, so we just wish there would be a better world. We want a world without corruption, summed up Jilukshan.

Melstacorp records Rs 6.25 bn PAT for 2017/18
Melstacorp Plc has recorded profit after tax of Rs. 6.25 billion for the financial year 2017/18. Group turnover reached Rs. 110 billion.
Companys Chairman and Managing Director D. H. S. Jayawardena said the Group contributed Rs. 69 billion in taxes during the financial year for 2017/18.
The beverage sector is the highest contributor to both the top line and the bottom line of the Group. Our main subsidiary DCSL PLCs profitability dropped in the first three quarters managed to recover and record a net profit after tax of Rs. 4.35 billion, Jayawardena told the shareholders in the companys annual report for 2017/18.
Periceyl (Private) Limited, the second liquor company of the Group saw its profitability shrinking when compared with last year. The reduction of beer prices and a simultaneous increase in the hard alcoholic beverage prices have resulted in more consumers shifting to beer and other cheaper beverages, according to the annual report.
The chairman said, the beverage sector of the group was subject to a severe challenge through higher increases in taxation in the last two years. A few years ago the Value Added Tax (VAT) on liquor was removed by adding a corresponding sum to excise duty, he said.
In the pursuing year VAT was re-introduced for liquor without a corresponding adjustment in the excise duty. Reintroduction of VAT together with a huge increase in duty on imports of main ingredient, ethanol and higher excise duty on hard alcoholic beverages resulted in a substantial increase in consumer prices.
As a result there was a notable decline in volumes. For the year under review the beverage sector revenue reached Rs. 97 billion and the net profit for the year was Rs. 4.7 billion, he said.
Commenting on plantation sector performance he said that year 2017 was a better year for the tea industry with an increase in production and auction averages reached all-time high levels. However, despite the ascent witnessed in 2017, the Industry continued to be plagued with geo-political tension in the tea importing countries, policy decisions which affected the production of tea and temperature variability due to climatic changes.
The ban of glyphosate (which was recently eased) that is used for weed control, and curtail of tea imports by Russia, the largest importer from Sri Lanka too, caused much uncertainty towards Industry growth.
The negative impact of a drought and floods in the first and second quarters of the year coupled with high cost of fertilizer were drawbacks in reaching the production levels of the preceding years.
The reluctance to undertake the required level of annual replanting by most of the smallholder farmers and the plantation companies due to the non-affordability of the required inputs, and uncertainty in recovering investments is also a major contributory factor for the declining trend in the production volumes.
In analyzing the global supply scenario, a deficit in production was evident from a few key producer countries mainly of CTC teas and this global shortage in production was a key factor for the prices to sustain at these levels coupled with strengthening of oil prices which favoured some key importing countries of Sri Lankan Teas.

Minister calls for Blue Economy
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said Sri Lanka should be developed as a Blue Economy by taking advantage of the geographic location - a nation surrounded by the ocean, having no conflict with other countries about ownership rights, unlike in some regions in the world.
Sri Lanka is also located near the most frequented sea-routes, he added.
The minister was speaking at a ceremony to open a new building at the Ocean University of Sri Lanka, recently.
The minister identified several economic activities associated with the sea. He highlighted the employment opportunities open to graduates of the Ocean University, including services in the merchant marine. The minister spoke of the international practice of registering ships in foreign countries under flags of convenience for business advantage and said there is a possibility of negotiating permission for ship registration in Sri Lanka on the condition of the employment of a minimum number of trained Sri Lankan personnel on each ship. Referring to the countrys education system, the minister said a radical change in the system is urgently needed. The minister said the traditional school and university education in humanities is unable to produce the type of person required for the present-day workplace.
He added that his ministry has taken up the task of creating an alternative system of education to produce technically and vocationally qualified personnel.
The minister said he issued three directives as soon as he assumed duties. The first was that the intake of students to all training institutions under his ministry should be doubled. The second was that the curricula in these institutions should be upgraded to international standards. The third was that courses of minimal importance should be discarded to concentrate on courses with significant employment potential.
The minister said he also instructed that English and IT be mandatory for all trainees. Dr. Amunugama said the knowledge of an international language is essential at a modern workplace and so was IT.
Hitherto, knowledge in these subjects was mostly confined to children of affluent families. However, the minister said his aim is that all rural children and children from disadvantaged backgrounds gain that knowledge.

Mobot, Olympic dreams as Asian Games close in Jakarta
JAKARTA, Sunday: The 18th Asian Games closed in a glittering ceremony in Jakarta on Sunday as hosts Indonesia dreamed of stepping up to host the Olympics in 2032. Thousands of athletes in ponchos marched in heavy rain at the Gelora Bung Karno stadium at the close of the two-week tournament featuring 40 sports.
You did it! You made the energy of Asia come through, Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, told the packed crowd.
Jakarta has the capability to host any such major international event, added the sheikh, who performed the heart-shaped Mobot by placing both hands on top of his head. It added to the relaxed atmosphere of the ceremony, which was mainly devoted to music acts from Indonesia, India and South Korea while booming fireworks lit up the night sky.
Indonesia has defied expectations to host a smooth Games, which with 17,000 athletes and officials is second in size only to the Olympics.
Despite worries about terrorism and unfinished venues, most problems have been minor -- including a series of hiccups over ticketing, for which Vice-President Jusuf Kalla apologised in his ceremony speech.
Riding high on the Games success, President Joko Widodo on Saturday announced a bid to hold the 2032 Olympics, which would have seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago.
The president addressed the ceremony by video link from an emergency shelter in Lombok, where a string of earthquakes in recent weeks killed 555 people.
Olympics chief Thomas Bach has welcomed Indonesias bid but he warned that the sprawling Southeast Asian country needed to maintain the positive energy generated by the Games.
I think what is important now for Indonesia is to keep the momentum of this Games, he said earlier on Sunday.
So for you now not to fall into a black hole the moment after everybody has left.
BUMPER GAMES FOR INDONESIA
China topped the medals table for the tenth Games in succession, a streak stretching back to New Delhi 1982, with a runaway 132 golds.
They will now look to make a deafening statement by repeating the feat at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, capital of their war-time colonisers and bitter rivals Japan. Japan, who won the Games 465th and final gold medal in Sundays mixed team triathlon, placed a distant second with 75 golds, while South Korea had 49 and hosts Indonesia finished with 31.
Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee, who became the first woman to win six gold medals at a single Games, was named the best athlete or Most Valuable Player.
I still havent won a world title so thats my next goal, she said after a small awards ceremony on Sunday. The 18-year-old, who looks set to be the face of the Tokyo 2020 Games, stole the limelight at the pool from Chinas triple Olympic champion Sun Yang and Singaporean butterfly hero Joseph Schooling. Premier League star Son Heung-mins joyous celebration at winning football gold, a title that earned him an exemption from military service in South Korea, will live long in the memory.
Tobacco and banking billionaire Michael Bambang Hartono, one of Indonesias richest men, was the Games oldest medallist at 78, in the card game bridge.
He is 66 years older than 12-year-old Indonesian skateboarder Bunga Nyimas, whose bronze medal in the street event made her the youngest athlete to mount a podium.
They were part of a bumper Games for Indonesia, whose 31 golds was a record for a Southeast Asian country and who, more importantly, proved the critics wrong by hosting a successful tournament.
Although there were complaints over air pollution, traffic and a pre-Games police crackdown that killed dozens, the venues were ready on time and most events went off smoothly.  AFP

Nadal, Del Potro into US Open last-eight, dad-to-be Isner keeps home hopes alive
NEW YORK, Monday - Defending champion Rafael Nadal on Sunday reached the US Open quarter-finals for the eighth time where he will face Dominic Thiem, one of only three men to defeat him in 2018.
World number one Nadal saw off a battling Nikoloz Basilashvili, the first Georgian in a fourth round in New York, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-4.
It's a big victory for me, said the 32-year-old Nadal, the champion in 2010, 2013 and 2017.
He was hitting the ball very strong and when I thought I was in control of the points, he always came back with strong shots.
It was world number 37 Basilashvili's strength, however, which proved his undoing.
His 56 winners were erased by 59 unforced errors, three times as many as Nadal.
Elsewhere, Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 champion, beat Borna Coric 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 to make the last-eight for a third successive year.
The third seeded Argentine will next face John Isner, the last American man standing, who defeated Milos Raonic 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, taking his tournament aces total past the 100-mark.
Thiem, who beat Nadal on clay in Madrid in the run-up to Paris, booked his place in the quarter-finals for the first time with a 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (7/2) win over 2017 runner-up Kevin Anderson. The ninth-seeded Austrian's three other appearances in the last-eight of a Slam were all on Paris clay in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Nadal leads their head-to-head 7-3 with all of their matches coming on clay courts, including in the final of Roland Garros in June when he captured an 11th French Open.
Thiem is a great opponent, he has the big serve and he had a big win today against Kevin, said Nadal who has made the last-eight of every Slam in the same year for the first time since 2011.
Thiem has unfinished business at the US Open. Last year, he had two match points against del Potro in the fourth round but fell in five sets.
Thiem's progress to the last-eight comes despite choosing to play European clay court events after Wimbledon before then losing his only summer hard court outing in Cincinnati to Stefanos Tsitsipas.
He is the first Austrian in the last-eight at the US Open since Thomas Muster in 1996.
Against Rafa, I've had three very nice experiences and seven horrible experiences, said Thiem who turns 25 on Monday.
On clay, it's one of the biggest challenges in sports to beat this guy. I hope that it's a little bit more comfortable on hard court, but I'm not sure. Third-seeded del Potro made the last-eight for the sixth time against Croatian 20th seed Coric who was playing in his maiden last 16 of a Slam. Coric, 21, saw his challenge undone by a right thigh injury which needed two visits by the trainer as well as general unhappiness with the humidity of the Arther Ashe court.
To win in straight sets in every round is good for the body and physical condition, said del Potro.
But every round is a battle. I just hope to keep my level high against John in the next match.
Isner reached the quarter-finals for the first time in seven years and hailed the patriotic tournament atmosphere as a jungle.
Isner, the 11th seed, is attempting to become the first home winner since Andy Roddick in 2003.
There were a lots of ups and downs in the match. The atmosphere was like a jungle, said Isner of the crowd on the new Louis Armstrong Stadium enjoying a raucous Labor Day weekend.
Isner, 33, who will become a father for the first time in two weeks, said he will not fear del Potro even though he has lost to the Argentine star seven times in 11 meetings.
Their most recent clash saw del Potro triumph in straight sets in the fourth round at Roland Garros this year.
Why not me Let's keep going, said Isner after firing 56 winners past Raonic and 20 aces taking his ace count to a tournament-leading 112.

I can still recall the headlines in one English newspaper in the early sixties, Nihal was opening batting for All Ceylon, David vs Goliath pint sized Nihal Kodituwakku at 4 feet 11 inches facing David Larter of Northampton and England who stood at 6 feet 7 inches, this surely could be a world record of some sorts, which Mahinda Wijesinghe could sort out for us. To be fair by Nihal, he put the record straight by informing me that he stood at 5 feet 2 inches full stretch, when I interviewed him at his Mirihana residence. Harry Pilling also of Northamptonshire stood at 5 feet 3 inches the shortest first class cricketer in England then, piping Nihal by a mere inch.
At the very end of the interview when I broached that subject he quite humbly said that it was a tall order. However luck was on Nihals side and that day at the Oval due to overnight rain the run up was somewhat slippery and Larter after bowling with his long run up fell after the first two deliveries like a ton of bricks and as a result he had to cut down his run up and bowl at medium pace, Nihal breathed a sigh of relief, and was plucky enough to score 30 odd runs in that game.
Nihal and Michael Tissera could be put in the same bracket as far as the good looks were concerned. Nihal used to be a magnificent player off the back foot with a rock solid defence, who opened for Ceylon with many different partners but more of that later.
Nihal played all three grades of junior cricket at Royal, his father who was a Trinitian encouraged him. He played for Royal in1958 and 59, as a middle order bat.
After school cricket Maurice Wanigaratne a cousin of his a Peterite who also opened batting for SSC introduced him to the club. Nihal was a middle order batsman and played well which caught the eye of late R.B. Wijesinghe who wanted him to open and took him straight to the Sara side. This was a surprise elevation from Daily News Trophy. Nihal recalled that he opened with Sarath Silva, who was a very attacking player and never bowed down to any bowler. In his 10 year tenure in club cricket he played with the likes of CI, CH, PI, Polonowita, Crozier et al. Nihal was highly impressed by T.B. Kehelgamuwas pace - he stated Kehel was faster than the rest by a country mile.
In Ceylons second tour to Pakistan, the team was captained by Michael Tissera, in the first Test Nihal went out to open with Sarath Wimalaratne where Nihal had a bad experience, in a hurry he went to bat without a proper thigh pad. Salim Altaf was bowling to a leg trap at full tilt, and he was hit on the hip. He was in considerable pain. In that era Nihal was the best opening bat Ceylon had and the reason being he had so many opening partners who could not hold a permanent place.
Nihal was equally adept at showing his efficiency in the corporate field as well when at J Walter Thomson he managed to climb to the top. At one time when he was at JWT, his boss was none other than speaker of the house of parliament late Anandatissa de Alwis who himself was an ardent cricket fan who used to give ample time off to Nihal to attend cricket practice. During Nihals tenure there, he was in charge of the product portfolio of the Upali Group.
Nihal noted that it was not an easy task to work with late Upali Wijewardene but still he was equal to the task.
Thereafter he focused on his estate at Wariyapola and spent 15 years there. In spite of been far away from Colombo the affinity to cricket never deserted him.
Due to the second JVP insurrection, he came back to Colombo and through the good offices of Kumar Boralessa, he coached S Thomas ML for five years. They beat Royal and his friends got mad with him and he was offered the coaching job at Royal. Nihal stated that he coached Royal for another 5 year stint and then ended up at the Cricket Foundation on the invitation of Mahinda Wijesinghe.
Whilst coaching at Tissamaharamaya, Nihal was impressed by a tall boy who bowled line and length tirelessly, this farmers son was none other than Suranga Lakmal. Lakmal is the spearhead of our pace attack now. Nihal wondered how and why Suranga was not spotted earlier when many district coaches were there!
Nihal insisted that pumping technique in coaching will not do for the youngsters. Among the present set of young players he was impressed by Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella. He insisted that they should put country before self when representing the country.
Nihal is of the opinion that Angelo Mathews should retire. He questioned why Angelo continues to play and he was annoyed when he saw his innings of 90 pushing singles and giving dot balls at that crucial stage of the match. Nihal questioned Mathews captaincy as well and was puzzled as to why nobody is doing anything to get rid of him those were the very words of Nihal. The constitution of SLC has to be changed, he said. There are clubs with voting rights and they play without a ground of their own. There is something wrong somewhere stressed Nihal and he further added that this is going on for the benefit of one man. The Minister is responsible for the change. Arjuna is strong and straight but may be vindictive, that also is not good stressed Nihal.
When Nihal was the CEO of the Foundation the lighting of the indoor nets tenders were called and one guy came and handed his tender and as he went out he said not to worry that there is 10% for Nihal in that. Nihal said that in a disgusted manner. The cheeky guy later told his peon oyage bossa 10% ganne ne. He further added that 10%, is normal to take and everyone takes but this man was adamant not to give in.
Nihal stated that after Michael Tissera left everything has gone haywire. Nihal further noted that if they sorted the constitution right surely people like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Sidath Wettimuny and Roshan Mahanama would be stepping in for the games sake and cricket is the only sport Sri Lanka should be proud of, it would be a calamity if cricket too should go down the drain.

No entrance fee for children at parks, says CMC
The Colombo Municipal Council Engineering Department yesterday dismissed as false a recent news report that children entering the Colombo Viharamahadevi Park and the Crow Island beach park are to be charged Rs. 400 each.
A press release issued by the Councils Director Engineering R.M.D. Jayawardene said that entrance into these two parks will be free as previously. A proposal made by the Standing Committee on Finance for a remote control toy car project as a six-month pilot project by a private firm has been approved by the Council. This will be open for children in the 5-10 year age group.
The firm had proposed a fee of Rs. 100 per 15 minutes of its use. But her department has proposed to the Standing Committee to reduce this charge to Rs. 50.
Moreover, the private sector has been operating three fee-levying projects in the Viharamahadevi Park for a long time. They are on the following basis: bicycle rental  Rs. 100 per hour, pedal boat service  children Rs. 50 per half hour and adults Rs. 100 per hour, 10 rides on baby train - Rs. 50, viewing Min Medura  Rs. 20, pony cart  Rs. 50 per round and pony ride  Rs. 100 per ride.

NSW terrorism suspect nephew of senior Lankan politician
A student of the New South Wales (NSW) University accused of documenting plans in a notebook to assassinate two senior Australian politicians is the nephew of a senior politician in Sri Lanka, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) revealed in an investigative report yesterday.
The ABC in its report said Mohamed Nizamdeen (25), who was on Friday charged with a terrorism-related offence, is also the grandson of a late former chairman of one of Sri Lankas biggest banks  Bank of Ceylon.
Nizamdeen, a PhD student, also worked as a UNSW business systems analyst. He was arrested at the Kensington campus last Thursday.
His arrest came after a colleague found a notebook allegedly containing details of plans to kill former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his deputy Julie Bishop.
The alleged list of targets also included the former speaker Bronwyn Bishop, the Sydney Opera House, major train stations and police stations across the harbour city.
On Friday police told a media conference Nizamdeen appeared to be an Islamic State affiliate.
A friend of Nizamdeens brother, yesterday posted a message on Facebook, describing Nizamdeen as an open minded Muslim who he believed was innocent.
He would have had absolutely no reason to engage in such disgusting, hateful crimes to a city, which has been extremely opening to him for the past six years, he said.
He has not been able to communicate with any one of us back home and we are simply broken and deeply affected by this unnecessary turn of events.
Plain-clothed detectives seized computers, mobile phones and documents from Nizamdeens inner-city apartment at Zetland on Friday before conducting further raids on university grounds.
Police allege that Nizamdeen, who does not have any criminal history in Australia, was operating by himself, but do not believe he was capable of carrying out a terror attack.
The commerce graduate was one of the faces of UNSWs Hero Program and had worked as a business systems analyst since 2016, where he helped develop several projects aimed at stopping identity theft.
While his student visa is due to expire at the end of this month, the Australian Federal Police have applied for a Criminal Justice Stay visa so they can prosecute him in Australia.
If convicted, Nizamdeen could face up to 15 years in prison. Source: ABC

Paddy lands to be surveyed to identify needs
The Agriculture Ministry plans to conduct a survey to identify the extent of land used for paddy cultivation with the assistance of Sri Lanka Air Force, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
It is clear that the extent of paddy cultivated lands has reduced due to the filling up of paddy lands or using paddy lands for purposes other than cultivation, said the minister.
He said the government needs to collect accurate data on the countrys paddy lands to forecast rice production and fertiliser requirement.
Minister Amaraweera had instructed officials to prepare a database on paddy cultivated lands by analysing data on aerial maps collected with the assistance of Sri Lanka Air Force.
According to the data collected several years ago, the total land allocated for paddy is estimated to be about 800,000 hectares at present.
A large number of urbanised paddy lands were used for other purposes legally or illegally. Most paddy landowners initially sought a license to allow them to use the land for commercial purposes. However, in most cases, they had divided it into small blocks and sold to build houses.
The Agrarian Services Department had received about 3,000 applications from the Western Province seeking permission to fill paddy lands during the past few months.

It will propose a mechanism to seek the contribution of the Security Forces, the Police and religious leaders for the programme. It will formulate norms that should be followed when expressing views via social websites and various media networks including the print and electronic media.
It will look into banning the publishing of news which disturbs national amity and how to formulate laws in that regard. The Committee will also be tasked with making recommendations to resolve issues related to the national language policy.
It will also examine and recommend changes to the Police Ordinance and policing in general to ensure better public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police Department.
The members of the Committee are Deputy Speaker J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Thalatha Atukorale, Ruwan Wijewardene, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, D.M.

PM says marked drop in crime rate
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that according to Police reports the recorded crimes in the country have decreased by 35% while the number of cleared cases have increased by 20% during the year 2017.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the 152nd Police Anniversary Celebrations held at Police Park Grounds yesterday .
The Prime Minister, while commending Sri Lanka Police for the achievement, pointed out that of the 35,971 reported incidents of crime, 79% of the cases have been solved in 2017.
He further pointed out that in 2014, the number of crimes reported amounted to 50,962.
He also encouraged IGP Pujith Jayasundara to increase the crime solving rate to an 80% or more in the coming year.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further said that Cabinet approval will soon be granted for the establishment of the Police and Criminal Justice Studies University which was the brainchild of the former Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
The Prime Minister also said that he has already given instructions to Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and the Prime Ministers Secretary to hold a discussion with the respective officers and Police Commission Chairman to solve the remaining issues of Police officers in the service.
He observed that many issues relating to salary and promotions of Police officers have already being addressed by the government.
The Prime Minister observed that the success recorded by the Police should be analytically studied to gain insights to make the service more efficient.
He pointed out that having being able to hold the Local Government Elections without any violent incidents is the most significant achievement recorded in the recent history of keeping law and order in the country.
However, Premier Wickremesinghe noted that he is disappointed over incidents that occurred at Digana.
We have to look into these shortcomings and learn from them. We were able to understand the kind of disturbances that social media and new technology can cause to law and order in a country. We can learn from them and act accordingly, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister also observed that the Police Service has new challenges to meet when fighting crime, with the advancement in technology.
The Police service has become more and more important by the day. Now, there are drug mafia networks and cyber-crimes which the Police have to deal with. The Police is the most important establishment that ensures the security and the stability of a country. Without stability, a country cannot advance or develop. If a government cannot maintain law and order, it wont be able to rule the country either. That is how much important of a service that the Police is engaged in, the Prime Minister observed.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara, Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara, high ranking officials of the Armed Forces and other distinguished guests were present at the event.

BIMSTEC is a regional organisation comprising seven Member States lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal, constituting a contiguous regional unity. They include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.
State leaders extended their best wishes to the President for his new appointment and expressed their confidence that BIMSTEC would move forward under his leadership.
President Sirisena held bilateral discussions with Nepali President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister K.P. Oli. They entered into two agreements to develop economical, social and cultural ties between both nations, to uplift youth affairs and training of government officers.
President Maithripala Sirisena also held discussions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Myanmarese President Win Myint and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, where they promised to provide assistance to economic and social development activities in Sri Lanka.
The President also participated in the Sri Lanka-Nepal Trade and Investment Conference during his visit. A farewell was organised at the Thribhuwan International Airport in Kathmandu, to bid farewell to President Sirisena, where several Nepali ministers and representatives were present.
President Maithripala Sirisnea had helped eradicate Sri Lankas negative image that was portrayed in the past and revived the good image of the motherland in the international arena. Sri Lanka would benefit by enhancing the countrys image in the international arena with its friendly nonaligned foreign policy.

In pursuit of mortality
When 60-year-old Govindarajan, an Alzheimers patient, goes missing from a health care centre, it takes his son on a frantic search for his father.
The trio  Tamil director Radhamohan, writer Viji and actor Prakash Raj  who are fondly remembered for their beautiful stories Abhiyum Naanum, Mozhi and Payanam, return together with their Tamil remake of Kannada film Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu.
Titled 60 (Arubathu) Vayadu Maaniram (Sixty years, medium complexion), this has Parakash Raj reprising Anant Nags character from the original. Vikram Prabhu takes on the role played by Rakshit Shetty in GBSM. Raj said during an interaction with the press that so keen was he in doing the film that he purchased the rights of the film even before the Kannada film released.
The Tamil version is the result of intense research done on Alzheimers and how it effects the patient as well as the care giver.
We visited a health centre in Bengaluru meant exclusively for Alzheimers patients, said director Radhamohan.
The Tamil version takes a more in-depth look at the situation. Its a very thin line that separates one from memory loss.
Indhuja, who was last seen in Tamil film Mercury, plays a doctor working at the health centre. I am the bridge between the father and son, said Indhuja.
Mother-like, she attends to Govindarajan, who is more a child. And with his son, she makes him understand his responsibilities towards his father.

Reasons  you should  never follow  celebrity diets!
There is no one diet that fits all. We all want to look good, cut down inches and see a lower number on the weighing scale. And to achieve that, it is highly likely that you have ended up following a celebritys diet tip or your favourite Instagrammers food diary - for example, starting your day with a green smoothie or munching on paranthas, because Kareena Kapoor Khan swears by it. Heres the truth - you wont look like Kareena Kapoor Khan if you eat like her, and the simple reason behind it is that there is no one diet that fits all.
Varying metabolic rate
Metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories at rest and it varies for different people. Metabolic rate is based on a persons height, weight, gender, activity, muscle mass among other factors. And with this will vary the quantity of protein, carbs or fat you should eat.
Unnecessary restrictions
Chances are that your favourite celebrity is avoiding a food group (or item) because of their food sensitivity but skipping it just because they dont eat it, is a stupid logic. For all you know, the cheese slice that you have been avoiding is actually good for you.
Wont last long
Meal preps are not easy, especially when you dont have dedicated nutritionists or a whole army working on it for you. Since you will be doing it pretty much all by yourself, your schedule (and budget) will sooner or later make you give it up.
Changing too much wont help
Please understand the influencer you follow on IG has been there, done that. Straightaway jumping on their diet wont help you much. Especially if these diets encourage you to steer away from your natural food habits. Change only whats easy to follow.
It may be totally wrong for you
Every body has different needs and requirements. And if there is a lingering health issue that needs your attention, randomly following a celebrity diet wont do you any good. Consult a doctor before including too much protein in your diet or eating unbalanced meal. TNN

A return  to WWE
Dave Bautistas movie career has continued to explode, with his latest film, Final Score, hitting the silver screen. But no matter what he does in Hollywood, to wrestling fans, hell always be Batista. Its been a while since hes entered the squared circle  he hasnt wrestled for WWE since 2014  although if he had his way, that might change soon.
Batista appeared on Good Morning Britain and was asked about whether hed make it back to WWE. He expressed that he wants that to happen someday, and made it a point to mention that hes always in the midst of an ongoing conversation with the promotion.
I hope so, yeah, Batista said. Its always an ongoing conversation with myself and WWE. I never burnt that bridge, intentionally because I never had any reason to. I left for certain reasons. But I love professional wrestling and I love that company.
Its well-documented that WWE has reached out to Batista relatively recently, as he said the company wanted him to return for WrestleMania 34 for a match involving Ronda Rousey. While he said that communication suddenly fell off with WWE about that, the good news is there seems to be mutual interest about Batista doing something somewhere down the line.

Ripper tales of a skinny-dipper!
Skinny-dipping means testing different types of waters without any swimwear. Oh, yes, we young hellions used to do it often, usually after sneaking out of home at night. We used to take off to the suburban Bolgoda Lake or one of its clear flowing tributaries for a nocturnal skinny dipping adventure.
We had no inhibitions wading into the cool water completely starkers, that is buck naked. That was fine, there no girls in sight to ogle. With hindsight I wish I could relive my childhood without gender barriers.
To us even in later years swimming in the wild was therapeutic. It was part of the everyday happiness to our lives. There is a beautiful sense of calm about swimming in nature, unregulated, unobserved and often unthinking. Later when my parents moved to Colombo a good part of my childhood was spent in the happy hunting grounds of Crows Island, which borders the estuary where the Kelani River merges with the sea.
It was then considered among our citys pristine wetlands. In the company of more than a half-dozen cousins, friends and neighbourhood kids we would wander down to the river banks and spend some of the happiest times of our lives in that magical environment.
It stood out as an ideal habitat for wetland biodiversity, and was considered one of the most valuable conservation areas in Colombo. Even decades later we savour those untroubled memories, which still make our hearts throb with nostalgia. Who can forget the happy cries when we splashed and frolicked in the crystal clear aqueducts that flowed, courtesy of the Kelani Ganga.
The rapture of little boys in those bucolic surroundings is easy to understand. To us it was a complete and sheer fantasy world where we played and gambolled to our hearts content. The kirala kelle wetlands were alluring with their trees towering above the marshes making fascinating patches of sun and shadow. They offered an abundance of its delicious fruit, the marsh apple, which could be eaten on the spot or taken home and squeezed to make a delicious and invigorating drink.
Experience soon taught us to steer clear of some inviting clear pools inhabited with the omnivorous kaviyya fish which took painful nips at our fingers, toes or any other tempting visible appendages they mistook for a meal. We suspected soon enough that these denizens of the invigorating pools were closely related to the piranhas of the South American rivers.
Actually, even the harmless freshwater fish can bite - most of them just nibble and suck and are not painful but it depends on the strength of their suck and their teeth. Also some of the little white fish are drawn to skin irritations and things like insect bites.
I do not contend that the schools of shoaling Kavaiyyas pecking at your pinkies or any other vital part of your anatomy could cause as serious damage as their South American counterparts. Yet their nips are unpleasant to say the least.
Nonetheless we were not in their territory seeking a free manicure or pedicure . And neither did we fancy an attempted type of initiatory rite of circumcision in the process. I am reliably given to understand that some enterprising foot therapists are now offering these fishy pedicures in the UK.
Worse, one had also to watch out for mud crabs which could sink their murderous sharp claws into anything they perceived as a dangling morsel to latch onto. They were the nightmare of all skinny-dippers because when they clamped their claws into your fingers or toes or that unmentionable adjunct of ones manhood they refused obdurately to release their hold even if you snapped the claw from their body.
But, let me allay all readers fears that I do not, decidedly do not, go skinny dipping in public. Be aware that I am in no way any kind of exhibitionist. Anyone with the temerity to suggest that I fit the category of flasher, flaunter or pervert will be liable to be sued.
Ok, I admit I have done some daft, school-boyish stunts that could be considered hilariously risqu. But dont try imitating my feat of slipping off my swimming trunks in deep ocean water and waving them at my friends frolicking in the shallows or lounging on the shore. It never fails to raise a good laugh.
All innocent frivolity, no doubt, although there are diverse risks involved. An imitator tourist found out for himself while trying the same lark to amuse his companions lolling on the shore. But I knew the lie of the surf and dived under as a huge wave broke. The copycat was not so fortunate. He had not bargained for the impetuosity of the breakers.
Taken completely unawares he lost his hold on his swimwear and was dragged by the wave with nightmarish rapidity towards the shoreline. Overpowered by the velocity of the wave he was turned over, under, sideways and down the frothy depths.
All too soon he was dragged across the sandy bottom and deposited into calm water and finally the beach itself. The receding surf brought him into the shallows where he dared not stand.
He stumbled to his feet but another foamy wave sent him crashing with prodigious force close to the hordes of sun-tanners on the sandy dunes. To tell the naked truth he was beached and buck naked. He lounged for a while in his birthday suit, bottoms up in the shallows.
His protruding rump began sagging jelly-like with every surge and ebb of the fizzy swell. He was now within point-blank range of scores of stunned beach lollers.
As he staggered to his feet the hapless exhibitionist was exposed to the vulgar gaze of a multitude of amused gawkers. A few flashbulbs popped as some quick-on- the-draw camera buffs took a once in a lifetime snapping opportunity.
The hilarious cameo triggered a raucous, riotous response from the crowd as children rudely pointed and doubled over with merriment. A wave of uproarious laughter exploded across the sandy expanse as our vulnerable hero covered his immodesty with both hands as he made a frenzied scuttle for his towel.

Serena, Stephens reach US Open quarter-finals
NEW YORK, Monday - Six-time champion Serena Williams survived a spirited challenge from unseeded Kaia Kanepi to triumph 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 on Sunday and reach the quarter-finals of the US Open.
The 23-time Grand Slam champion looked set to romp home when she seized the first set from Kanepi in just 18 minutes.
But the hard-hitting Estonian, who took out world number one Simona Halep in the first round, settled down in the second set, shaking off the partisan crowd in a jammed Arthur Ashe Stadium to push Williams the rest of the way.
It wasnt an easy match at all, said Williams, who let out what she called a Serena scream after ripping a backhand cross court to hold serve in the opening game of the third set.
Winning a big game and a very important game and a really tight game, I think it was just a relief, said Williams, who took control with a break in the next game and maintained that advantage until she fired a forehand winner on her first match point.
Williams finished with 18 aces and 47 total winners. A couple of loose points gifted Kanepi a break in the first game of the second set, however, and she couldn't get back on terms. Williams double-faulted on break point to send Kanepi up 5-2. The American would win the next two games, but she couldn't find another break and after fighting off two set points saw Kanepi knot the match on her third chance.
She's had a lot of big wins in her career. I was just happy to get through it to be honest, Williams said. Williams booked a quarter-final date with Karolina Pliskova, the eighth-seeded Czech who beat Australian Ashleigh Barty 6-4, 6-4. Pliskova defeated Williams in the semi-finals in New York in 2016. Defending champion Sloane Stephens, the third seed, eased past Elise Mertens 6-3, 6-3 to book a quarter-final rematch with Latvian Anastasija Sevastova.
Sevastova toppled seventh-seeded Elina Svitolina 6-3, 1-6, 6-0, leaving just two of the top 10 women's seeds remaining. Stephens, runner-up to Halep at the French Open, was looking forward to taking on Sevastova again in her bid to push ahead in her title defense.
Obviously it won't be easy, she said. Quarter-finals of a Grand Slam is always really tough. A big opportunity for both of us. Being defending champion, being able to get to the quarter-finals again, is incredible. I'm just going to try to keep building on that and keep going.
Sevastova, in the quarters for a third straight year, is hoping to turn the tables on Stephens, who is trying to become the first woman to win back-to-back US Open titles since Williams won three straight in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Maybe third time lucky for me, Sevastova said. Stephens could be headed for a semi-final meeting with Williams, although Williams acknowledged that in Pliskova she'll face a player with plenty of weapons in addition to her big serve.
She has a really good forehand. In fact, she doesn't do a lot of things bad, Williams said.
Plislkova's runner-up finish to Kerber in the 2016 US Open remains her best Grand Slam finish, but Williams noted she briefly gained the number one world ranking last year.
She got there for a reason, she has a lot of strong parts to her game, Williams said. It will be an interesting match.
Pliskova was looking forward to it, too.
I know she has a big game, but I have a big game too. I have a good serve. So I have some weapons, too. For sure, there is always a chance for me. Williams heads into the second week at Flushing Meadows tracking two milestones:
A seventh US Open title would see her break out of a tie with Chris Evert for the Open Era record and also equal Australian Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 major titles.
She hasn't won a major since the 2017 Australian Open. After returning to competition in March after the birth of daughter Olympia last September, Williams is trying to avoid her first season since 2011 without a Grand Slam title.  AFP

SL to support Lumbini Master Plan: President
President Maithripala Sirisena concluded a two-day bilateral visit to Nepal, last Sunday and announced that Sri Lanka would support the Lumbini Master Plan, which aimed at conserving the historic site and improving its facilities for pilgrims. The President was in Nepal to attend the fourth BIMSTEC Summit held from August 30 to 31.
He made the announcement during bilateral talks with Nepali President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, which was followed by an official banquet in honour at Shital Nivas, last Saturday. Earlier that day, the President and the delegation visited Lumbini, which was the birthplace of Prince Siddhartha Gautama. Over 50,000 Sri Lankans visit Lumbini, annually. During the meeting, the two leaders reviewed bilateral exchanges that had taken place during the past few years. The Nepali President expressed her gratitude to Sri Lanka for assisting in handling the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake that devastated the country, particularly in reconstruction efforts at the Anand Kutir and the Rato Machindranath temples in Kathmandu. The leaders also discussed the possibility of marketting a Buddhist Circuit as an initiative to boost tourism between the countries, and from outside the region.
President Sirisena congratulated the Government of Nepal on the successful conclusion of the BIMSTEC Summit and as the BIMSTECs new chair, sought the cooperation of Nepal in operationalising the Kathmandu Declaration. During the meeting with the Prime Minister of Nepal K.P. Sharma Oli, the President highlighted the importance of strengthening economic relations between the two countries, and the Nepali Prime Minister said that the Sri Lanka-Nepal Joint Commission would be held early, to carry forward the ideas discussed.
On August 31, President Sirisena also inaugurated a Trade, Tourism and Investment Dialogue organised by the Institute for Strategic and Socio-Economic Research of Nepal. Addressing the gathering, State Foreign Affairs Minister Vasantha Senanayake requested that Sri Lankan companies in construction, education, IT, healthcare, apparel and hospitality be facilitated to invest in Nepal.
During the visit, two Memoranda of Understanding were exchanged between the two governments; the first, between the Institute of Foreign Affairs of Nepal and the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute of Sri Lanka and the second, on Cooperation for Youth Development.
President Maithripala Sirisena also visited the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Secretariat headquartered in Kathmandu.

## Title: Socio Economical Analysis of Real-Estate Values For Middle Class

Socio Economical Analysis of Real-Estate Values For Middle Class
Led by the belief that the strength and immensity of the middle class consumers contributes to a sustained economic growth and development, the middle class consumers have brought into sharp economic focus in recent times.
The size and wealth of the middle class being proportionate to its power over the economy and governance structures, has made these two factors decisive indicators of growth and development of an economy. What is inevitable with the rise of the middle class consumers is the advancement of purchasing power, which  as Homi Kharas and Geoffrey Gertz, senior fellows of Brookings Institution states  in India, by 2030, will reach (PPP) $ 13,000 billion, with the title the top middle class consumer, dragging US to the second place. On the contrary, Sri Lankas capacity to make at least a slight impact on global level consumption patterns is hampered as its GDP is 3% that of Indias in 2010.
Nevertheless, the Sri Lankan global middle class paves way to make enormous and crucial changes in the local markets  in terms of entertainment, travel and, importantly, real-estate markets  which bring in the potential for economic development within the country that can eventually reach a global level.
In the global picture of economy, with only 0.63 million people with the capacity of spending more than (PPP) $ 10 per capita per day by 2002  which had increased only by 30% by 2010, reaching a figure of 0.82 million people  Sri Lanka can barely bring about a substantial influence on global economy.
Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2009/10 reveals that only a portion of 4% of the population is shared by the middle class, of which most spend just above (PPP) $ 2 a day per capita. Interestingly, the global middle class tends to indicate earnings just above (PPP) $ 10 per day per person, with a slightly small proportion in it earning even more than that.
Hence, the Sri Lankan global middle class, as opposed to the local middle class, has the potential of making considerable changes in the internal market, provided that quality and standards of living is maintained and developed. Real-estate market serves well for the prospect of opening the doors for the global middle class consumers.
Real estate products, categorized into residential, commercial, industrial, public, and special purpose, include not only plots of land, buildings and improvements, but also consequential rights signified by such real-estate components. Real-estate carries the characteristic of influencing and manipulating consumer behavior in this market, for the benefit of local economy.
The immovability if real-estate product, unlike other products, makes the real-estate market limited to a certain area. However, one of the fundamental influences on buying real-estate is held by the lifetime of the land; the facts that it is indestructible, permanent for generations, renewable and, most importantly, re-tradable, make a consumer realize the value and advantage of having ownership of real-estate, compared to other commodities such as vehicles, clothing and food. In case of real estates, it is very unlikely that the final product becomes inappropriate or unprofitable, due to problems in choice.
However, determining factors still exist in relation to different aspects of real-estate, since the requirements and proposes of such investment differs from person to person. Cost is one of the primary factors that play a decisive role in real-estate market. Since a Real estate product involves large economic units, financial arrangements, clarity and additional costs influence purchase decisions enormously.
In this regard, the future value of the property is also considered pivotal, as it is significant in determining the monetary value as well as the property value. Where money value is depreciating, as it often does in course of time and with the fluctuations in the economies, purchase of real-estate remains one of the advisable investments and/ savings plans.
Similar precision is required regarding the infrastructure facilities such as water, electricity, accessibility, sanitation, and other features like environment, architectural design, transportation the like. These are indispensable perquisites that often affect, control and shape the market value of real-estate as well as purchase decisions. These features particularly matter in buying residential real-estate property, since family oriented purchases of real-estate presuppose tranquil livable locations, quality and durability of design and construction and neighborhoods that preserve, and sometimes promote, the occupiers dignity and social status.
Percentage share of income received by poorest to richest households by sector has given below and according to the data the basic way to understand the income inequalities is dividing the population into income quintiles and calculated at each quintile. When the poorest 40 percent or the first 2 quintiles are considered, the corresponding figure was 13.9 percent and the middle class is the first highest sector according to the percentage.

Speaker refutes media reports about Parliament chairs
Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas office yesterday dismissed as false and baseless, a report in some sections of the media that Parliament was planning to purchase 232 new chairs for Parliamentarians.
In a press release issued yesterday, the Speaker said that neither has attention been drawn towards changing curtains and other upholstery in Parliament since there was no need to do so.
A press release issued by the Speakers Office emphasised that the seats and other equipment in Parliament are historic and valuable symbols and careful thought should be given if decisions were taken to change them.
If chairs have been damaged, they should be repaired at minimum cost, without replacing them. As such, the Speaker would never allow these historic symbols to be changed.
The release said the Parliament building is the centre of administration visited by heads of state, diplomats and a large number of the public, including schoolchildren.
Therefore keeping it spic and span by repairing it and attending to its daily needs was a major responsibility in maintaining its pride.
However, there was a need to repair the roof and the sewage and toilet complex of the Parliament building. This was done with utmost care and transparency under the supervision of the Speaker. The release said the false news item regarding purchasing of new chairs was a deliberate malicious and mischievous travesty of truth aimed to tarnish the image of all Parliamentarians.
The Speaker has been prudent in spending Parliament funds. He got his predecessors vehicle repaired for his use without purchasing a new vehicle and even got the previous Speakers cloak mended for his use without purchasing a new cloak. His example is being continuously followed in Parliament.

Three-wheelers drivers dismayed by age bar
With the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministrys gazette to issue driving licences to three-wheeler drivers only of age 35 and above, several concerns pertaining to its practicality were raised by three-wheel drivers unions, which expressed their displeasure over the governments decision.
National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the Transport Ministry made the decision following a proposal submitted by him, adding that the decision was made by the Ministry in view of the increasing number of road accidents caused by three-wheelers.
However, the President and Cabinet of Ministers revoked the gazette notification issued. The Cabinet of Ministers had insisted that there should not be a bar on any age group, although the relevant gazette notification was issued by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry. It is also reported that the President was also not in favour of the Ministrys decision. One Cabinet Minister said that the proposal failed as the majority of Cabinet members had opposed it.
Dr Kodagoda said that the President has asked him to review the proposal that was presented to the Minister.
I am still working on the new proposal and it will be presented to the President very soon. Even though the gazette notification has been issued, the final decision would be taken considering the concerns of the President, he said.
He said that accidents caused by three-wheeler drivers are on the rise and they tend to be involved in many unlawful activities. He noted that driving a three-wheeler has turned out to be a job opportunity for youth and they prefer that to becoming skilled labourers.
Dr Kodagoda said that the final decision would be taken before the end of September, that is, before the budget proposals are finalised.
Gazette notification still valid
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva released a gazette in mid July, which allows only those who are 35 and above to obtain a driving licence for three-wheelers.
The proposal to impose an age restriction on three-wheeler drivers was first made by Minister de Silva. Speaking to the media, the Minister said that there were about 1.2 million three-wheelers in the country and new rules and regulations would be introduced regarding the transportation of passengers in three-wheelers.
The Minister said passenger transportation in three-wheelers began at the end of the 1980s and there were no laws to regulate the service.
Dr Kodagoda said that under the Motor Traffic Act, the licences obtained by three-wheeler drivers earlier would not be cancelled.
Those who obtain new three-wheeler driving licences for passenger transport should undergo several examinations and should be 35 or above. Those under the age of 35 would be eligible for three-wheeler driving licences only for home use. When issuing a licence, the Ministry would check whether the applicant was involved in any criminal activities, he said.
He said applicants should undergo a two-week training course as recommended by the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic.
However, Dr. Kodagoda said that with the Cabinet and the Presidents displeasure over the decision, it will be reviewed.
In the meantime, Transport Secretary G.S. Withanage said that the Ministry did not receive any Cabinet decision expressing their objection regarding this matter.
We were not informed about any objection to the move. As the Minister has gazetted the decision, it is valid according to the law, he said.
He said that there were several reasons such as indiscipline, violation of road rules, and road accidents caused by three-wheelers which led the Ministry to take that decision.
Concerns of three-wheeler drivers unions
Three wheeler drivers unions expressed their strong objection to the decision made by the Ministry. They said that it was impractical and would not make any change as expected.
All Island Three-Wheeler Drivers Association Chairman Sudil Jayaruk said that they vehemently condemned the decision. No matter what happens, we will not let them implement it, he said.
He noted that it was a fact that after leaving school, youth opt for driving three-wheelers as a profession. Immediately after leaving school or dropping out of school, they get a three-wheeler on lease and drive it to earn an income.
Jayaruk also accepted that students do not get into skilled jobs these days and do not opt for or hardly have opportunities to get into an industry, adding that if these young people are marginalised, achieving sustainable economic growth would be impossible.
According to Jayaruk, the age limit was important, but the decision taken by the Ministry to address the issue was unfair.
We suggested that the age limit should be 25. So the youth cannot just stay at home. They will have to find some means of earning a living. Those who cannot find any other job will choose to drive three-wheelers. It is true that many are involved in drug trafficking and other unlawful activities. They need to be taught psychology, road rules, the traffic law and the Penal Code. They should be given training for two years. By 27, they would be ready to begin passenger transportation. They also should be given some recognition, he explained.
He noted that in 2017 a gazette was issued to form a regulatory commission to look into the issues and concerns of three-wheeler owners and three-wheeler drivers, but it was never formed. Jayaruk claimed that the Ministry is not concerned about the passengers.
One of the other concerns Jayaruk had was the entry of foreign taxi companies in Sri Lanka and added that it has become a monopoly in the industry.
It is a threat to individual three-wheeler drivers. The passengers also tend to trust them more. There are nearly eight lakhs of three-wheeler drivers. They are a group of people who have the power to effect change in this democratic country, he said.
Jayaruk was of the opinion that no person would wait until the age of 35 to become a three-wheeler driver. I request the government to appoint the regulatory commission and safeguard this transport sector, he said.
Statistics show there are roughly 1.059 million three-wheelers registered with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. A three-wheeler requires at least one driver. Out of the 7.8 million employed population, 1.2 million are estimated to be three wheeler drivers. This is a staggering 15.4 percent of the working population.
However, research suggests that less than 500,000 drivers actually engage in three-wheeler driving full-time and the average income ranges from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 per month. There are many who work as part-timers to supplement their income.
Three-Wheeler Drivers Union President Lalith Dharmasekara said that the gazette was still valid as the Minister has already gazetted it.
We help people
The government is not providing any good form of transportation for the public. When there is a train or bus strike, it is we three-wheeler drivers who help people. During the last Railway strike, we dropped students sitting the A/L exam at school. We are in every junction to help people out. We will not let them implement the age restriction. We are a community of 30 lakhs. We can still make a considerable change. The government should understand the plight of the three-wheeler drivers, he said.
Piyumal Ratnayake, a three-wheeler driver in Pettah said that they have no future and their living is totally dependent on the income derived from driving three-wheelers for hire. There is an increase in three-wheelers. I totally agree with that. But we cannot do anything about it, he said.
He has been in this job for the past 15 years and he used to get a lot of hires previously.
Another three-wheeler driver from Pettah, K. Asanka said people use apps and get their three-wheelers to their location and that has made earning an income difficult for them.
The government should look into that seriously. While three-wheeler drivers already have lot of issues to deal with, the Ministry is coming up with new ones such as the age limit, he said.
He said that they spend most of their time waiting for a customer on the road.
DIG Traffic Ajith Rohana said that there is a necessity to form a special authority to regulate the three-wheeler service by providing proper training and guidance for those involved in the industry.
He said Sri Lanka should adopt international norms and practices in order to reduce the occurrence of accidents. If a person drives passenger vehicles, he needs to have extra qualifications. Completion of 18 years is not a sufficient qualification to carry passengers, he said.

The Little Mermaid
Watered-down version of the  fantasy tale
Disneys animation The Little Mermaid has never ceased to enchant both young and old. Therefore the spell-binding fairy tale is currently in the process of being made into a live-action film. However even before work is complete in the much looked forward to project Conglomerate Media and Kingsway Productions beat them to it by launching their own version of The Little Mermaid.
Thankfully this tale is based on the 1837 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale rather than the 1989 Disney movie. The film follows a young reporter and his niece on a journey of discovery as they encounter a beautiful woman who they believe is the real Little Mermaid. Cam Harrison, the journalist, has his doubts at first and is on hot pursuit of a story related to a healing potion. He visits the circus which sells the medication and is curious to witness the ringmaster displaying the object that is the center of attraction in the circus  a real live mermaid.
Soon Cams niece, Elle, and the mermaid named Elizabeth form a close alliance. Cam discovers a prophecy in which a little girl born on land with the heart of a mermaid. They fight to save Elizabeths soul which is on the possession of the evil ring master. This is what binds Elizabeth to him and his evil deeds. This good versus evil story is told in flashback mode by a grandmother to her little granddaughters.
Though this is no extraordinary tale Blake Harris could have made a tolerable production with what was in hand. However the outcome is an uninteresting storyline full of clichs and loads of bad acting. A fantasy adventure story featuring a mystic creature like a mermaid provides the filmmakers with a wide scope to run wild with their imagination. But what we get is a slow pacing tale which is as dull as ditch water. There is a hardly an interesting moment in the tale which generates laughter or wonder.
Although its a serviceable enough story, the script by Blake Harris, who co-directed with Chris Bouchard, is often too earnest and forced to prove sufficiently fun or wondrous.
William Moseley and Loreto Peralta, both who play the prominent roles of Cam and Elle in the film do not do justice to their roles. The latter overacts her role with wide eyed expressions and bleating out her lines like an excited toddler while the formers acting is lifeless and he hardly utters his words with any feelings.
Armando Gutierrez is not given much room to expand in his role as the villain, Locke. The only silver lining in the project is Poppy Drayton. She manages to add a little charm and beauty to the project.
The visuals do not stand out either. Neither do the camera angles. It all seems like an amateur production done in a hurry. Banking heavily on its title this production might have garnered a majority of its viewers due to the success of the Disney hit rather than its own merits.

Sri Bhakta Hanuman Temple
Windy walk to the peak
The Kandy-bound trip always poses a challenge to any driver: the mission uphill. For the manual gear drivers, it is an acid test of striking a balance between releasing the accelerator pedal and pressing the clutch pedal down. As for auto-gear drivers, they need to have enormous faith in the vehicle performance.
Driving on a straight countryside is quite an easy task although the real driving skills are required when you have to drive along slopes and hills. Things get a bit worse when you decide to drive a bit further towards Nuwara Eliya en route Gampola. Perhaps that explains the ubiquitous eateries and places of worship  to feed and nourish your body as well as the soul.
Driving on the Gampola route through Thavalantenna, you are greeted by the solemn nestling of the Sri Bhakta Hanuman Temple. You have 30 kilometres more to reach Nuwara Eliya so this is a good place to take a good break.
But the drivers challenge is not over yet. The divert route to the temple is even steeper offering the enchanting view of the downhill for the passenger and a heart-throbbing experience for the driver. Following a few bends, you are finally at your destination: Sri Bhakta Hanuman Temple. As the winds waft across your face, you will begin to feel the solemnity of spirituality.
In Sri Lankas melting pot of various cults, the Hanuman is almost an alien concept. The Hanuman God concept is overridden by other deities. The colossal figure God Hanuman offers an awe-inspiring moment.
The temple is built by the Chinmaya Mission of Sri Lanka.
The Chinmaya Mission is a Hindu spiritual organization dedicated to studies of Vedanta, a branch of Hinduism. The studies focus on Upanishads and other Hindu scriptural aspects. The mission was formed in 1953 by the devotees of Swami Chinmayananda.
Once foot set in here, you naturally become a devotee. Perched about 500 metres from the Nuwara-Eliya-Gampola road, the environs soothe your soul with the lush greenery in the surrounding. Walking further, you come across another steep flight of stairs. That leads to the abode of the God with a monkey form admirably named Lord Hanuman. This is one of the most worshipped deities among the Hindus. Wherever a Hindu chooses to live, the presence of a Lord Hanumans statue is quite likely.
This larger-than-life statue glistens in black deep inside the abode. Behind his shoulder is a large pail. The ladder rests close by to reach the pail.
Lord Hanuman, as the legend dictates, was a dedicated bachelor fully committed to his master, Sri Ram. He is considered as a Chiranjeevi which means an immortal and also omnipresent. He is also called Anjani Putra as his mother was Anjani. It is said that he was blessed with Hanuman due to her devotion to Lord Shiva. The place is also believed to be where King Ravana kept Sita in captivity and Lord Hanuman came looking for her.
Unlike most other places of worship, the Sri Bhakta Hanuman temple is blessed with impeccable cleanliness. The Lord Hanuman abode is not overwrought with decorations either. The surrounding garden area is spotless beyond imagination. Made of black granite, the statue is about 16 feet tall.
The abode is surrounded by a 16-room ashram. For the dwellers, the meals will be fully vegetarian.
The Sri Lankan edition of Sri Bhakta Hanuman temple materialised in 1981 when the Chinmayanandan Mission purchased 10 acres of the present land. The temple premise was named as Ramboda, located in the central part of Sri Lanka 3,200 ft above sea level, at a distance of 150 km from Colombo (a three and half hour drive). Swami Tejomayananda consecrated the temple in 2001 by performing Maha Kumbhabhishekam. The premise is now an impressive attraction with the 16-ft tall statue of Lord Hanuman.
****
There is supposed to be a stretch of barren land known as the Chariot Path on which Ravana took Sita to Ashoka Vatika to showcase the beauty of his kingdom to her. There is also said to be a pond - the Sita Tear Pond - here, which was formed from Sitas tears. The temple itself is one of the more enterprising establishments devoted to this legend and contains a granite statue of Lord Hanuman. It is believed that Lord Hanuman was searching for Sitadevi from these hills of Ramboda. The Ramboda area is believed to be an area where Ramas forces were gathered against Ravana. Ram Padai means Ramas Force. The hills of Ramboda is also believed where Hanuman was searching for Sitadevi.
On every full moon day, special poojas are conducted and witnessed by thousands of devotees. Senthooram is being applied to Sri Bhakta Hanuman. Senthooram symbolises victory. Senthooram is only offered at Hanuman temples
Flowers, silk and different coloured wool are also used to make garlands for special occasions. Other items are used for decoration of the temple, especially a brass statue of Sri Bhakta Hanuman. Garlands made of flowers are available for a nominal charge to be offered at the Sri Bhakta Hanuman temple ever since its inception in 1999.
The belief is that Hanuman safeguards whoever believes in Hanuma.
The Chinmaya mission of Sri Lanka has built Sri Bhakta Hanuman Temple with Lord Hanuman as the presiding deity.

Challenging reforms vital for economic growth
The government needs to undertake more difficult and challenging reforms to drive future economic growth and development, says Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera.
This entails improving the competitiveness of the economy, so that the output per employee is higher, and this would be reflected in higher real wages. The challenge remains as to how a government improves the competitiveness of the economy, He told a forum organised by the Postgraduate Institute of Management Alumni Association in Colombo on Friday. Talking about tackling the issue of increasing competitiveness, he said, it is necessary for economic resources to be diverted into activities that optimise output per worker. This requires a shift of economic activity into sectors where Sri Lanka is globally competitive and move out of sectors where we cannot compete.
In agriculture for instance we all know that approximately 30% of the labour force accounts for around 9% of GDP. By protecting uncompetitive agriculture, we are trapping farmers in low wage economic activity. It is clear that we need to gradually shift into higher value agriculture to improve output per farmer, and thus income per farmer.
The Minister emphasised that, to get there we need investment and technology  both FDI and domestic private investment. This same principle applies to all economic sectors; many of which are uncompetitive but have been protected, stifling competition, innovation, and real wage growth, whilst imposing high costs of protection on consumers.
Sri Lanka will have to need a shift of economic activity into sectors where the island would be globally competitive and move out of sectors where we cannot compete.
It is in this context that the government has embarked on a shift in the economic trajectory of Sri Lanka from a protected domestic market driven economy, to a more outward oriented economy.The future of our economic growth must be through exports, entrepreneurship, FDI, and private enterprise, the Minister emphasized.
Sri Lanka needs private investment creating jobs in globally competitive sectors. We have in the past been successful in sectors such as apparel and ICT, but this needs to be expanded in many more sectors.
The government has also designed a Trade Adjustment Programme that will provide the tools to re-skill workers and provide concessionary finance to help firms affected by competition to enhance their competitiveness.

Marking President Maithripala Sirisena's birthday, yesterday
Leader destined for greatness
In a way, it was coincidental as it apparently appeared. Yet, it was not so; it was a momentous incidence controlled or determined by destiny. The birth of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a deeply-rooted peoples political movement, took place on September 2, 1951. At the same auspicious asterism, a lucky child destined to be a man of an era in future, was blessed to a modest farming family of Laksha Uyana in Polonnaruwa.
The blessed one born was President Maithripala Sirisena. No one knew then that the innocent farmer's son would one day be an outstanding political leader who would usher in a revolutionary change in Sri Lankan polity.
Experts in astrology had confirmed that the planetary movement linked to the births of the SLFP and Maithripala Sirisena was identical. The same remarkable political party and the political leader celebrated their 67th birth anniversary, yesterday.
President Sirisena is the pioneering leader who leads the country with a modern vision and mission aimed at wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in every aspect of society. However, his long political career to reach todays heights, was not so beautiful. It was full of challenging hurdles in numerous forms. However, his arduous political journey since its inception, is an exciting tale of success.
Having read and studied books on Marxism at the young age of 16, he first joined the leftist political movement of the country. Nevertheless, owing to his innate political instinct, he chose the correct political stream. On October 1, 1967 young Maithripala joined the SLFP at the residence of the then Polonnaruwa district MP and SLFP organiser for the same electorate, Leelarathne Wijesinghe. At his inaugural meeting of the party, he was unanimously elected the Secretary of the Polonnaruwa SLFP Youth Wing, which marked a remarkable juncture in his long, political journey.
As a responsible and dedicated youth leader of the party, Maithripala Sirisena rendered a noteworthy contribution towards the progress of the party, which was highly acclaimed and recognised by the party leadership. He proved himself to be a promising young leader of the SLFP.
In 1978, he resigned from state service to be more committed to party activities. As a young and energetic youth, he worked hard to defend the party and its cardres amidst severe suppression of the then ruling party to halt the forward march and to discourage party cadres. In recognition of his commitment and potentials as a rising leader in 1981, he was elected the Secretary of the All Island SLFP Youth Federation, with the blessings of the then party leadership. Subsequently, in 1983, he was elected President of the Youth Federation in honour of his honesty and dedication towards party undertakings.
Former leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, having a good understanding and confidence on the emerging leader, appointed him to the Central Committee of the party and thereafter, he was chosen as the SLFP Chief Organiser for the Polonnaruwa electorate.
Following the new appointment, Maithripala Sirisena worked with more dedication, as well as added vigour and confidence, to uplift the party. He rendered a notable contribution and played a leading role in ending the then 17-year UNP regime.
Following the election victory, he was offered the portfolio of Deputy Irrigation Minister. He was not worried over the extent or scope of the deputy ministerial portfolio. Instead, he became more determined to rectify the untold grievances of his fraternal farming community in Raja Rata, and to serve them to the best of his ability.
For the first time in his career, in 1997, he was offered a Cabinet portfolio as the Mahaweli Development Minister, creating history in Polonnaruwa. It was 27 years after the late C.P. de Silva that a politician of Polonnaruwa received a Cabinet Minister post. The SLFP, being more grateful to this emerging new leader from Raja Rata, appointed him as Deputy Secretary of the party in 1997 and afterwards, in 2001, as the Party General Secretary.
It is hardly possible to provide a complete commentary on the great work of Maithripala Sirisena in a brief account. However, he was able to render a massive contribution towards the progress of the party under a host of party leaders. While in the service to the party, even under turbulent political situations of the SLFP, he always upheld and stood for Bandaranaike's vision.
However, owing to the dictatorial developments which progressed in the party, as well as the malicious political, social and economic retrogression within the party and outside, a number of severe political crises erupted in the country which could not be solved.
The qualities of consensus and democracy hereditary to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, were fast lost. The decent and efficient persons of the party, who loved and venerated it, did not receive the due recognition and positions they deserved. The entire nation demanded an enlightened change, to which our adored and buoyant political personality gifted to the nation from the historic Pulathisi Purawara, could lead triumphantly.
Whatever criticisms leveled by critics, the historic decision taken by Maithripala Sirisena in 2015, was politically farsighted and rewarding to the country as well as the party. Despite the painful defeat at the 2015 August Parliamentary election, the SLFP was able to escape a potential political disaster as President Maithripala Sirisena opted to head the distressed party.
Today, we the members of the SLFP have a dignified leader. The country has a truly patriotic President. The epoch-change which he led is historic.
Following the political vision Maitri Palanayak - Stavara Ratak (compassionate Maitri governance - a stable country), the present Good Governance Government had secured a number of victories, nationally and internationally, for the country and people.
Moreover, following the launch of a foreign policy based on national aspirations under the theme International Relations that defend the country, President Sirisena has been able to ensure a dignified foreign service which had been in disarray long after the military victory of 2009.
The President, who cancelled all political appointments and nominations of relatives to the foreign services, reorganised the Foreign Service while detailing professional officials and personnel with required qualifications with nationalistic approaches, ensuring a refined diplomatic service which could earn the respect and recognition of the world.
Neighbouring countries in Asia, including India, China, Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and Korea, have become faithful friends of ours. At present, there are no human rights violation charges against our country. Sri Lanka has won the world through its foreign policy of Non- Aligned tradition.
In place of bogus economic processes, authentic and reliable novel economic strategies are being initiated. Sri Lanka is gradually emerging as an export-oriented economic centre in the Indian Ocean. The economic policy of the Sirisena administration is a visionary strategic approach aimed at assuring sustainable development, touching every fabric of society as an alternative to the so-called spectacular development schemes in the past.
President Maithripala Sirisena has been able to turn the dream he had while he was the Deputy Irrigation Minister into action, by successfully inaugurating the giant Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga project which had been intentionally blocked by previous governments. It is the biggest scheme under the massive Mahaweli Development Project. The main reservoir has a water capacity of 660,000 cubic acres. It is six times bigger than Parakrama Samudraya. The state had spent over US$770 million on the project.
The President, who knows the grievances of the farmer community of the Raja Rata as a grateful son of Polonnaruwa, is committed to fulfil his responsibilities and obligations to his beloved farming ancestry. With the Moragahakanda  Kalu Ganga multipurpose initiative, he has launched a massive irrigation network for the benefit of the people in four provinces. The new irrigation network will irrigate parched dry lands in regions as far as Vanni in the North, Raja Rata, as well as the Wayamba, Central and Eastern provinces. The drinking water problem of the region would be completely rectified. The project would permanently halt the drought in the northern part of North Western province.
Central Bank reports confirm a number of economic triumphs achieved during the past three years by the Good Governance administration of President Maithripala Sirisena. The countrys export income had marked an upsurge by 10.2 percent, recording the highest export income in the recent past. The total export revenue of US$10,310 million in 2016 had been increased to US$11,360 million in 2017.
The GSP+ tax concession re-assured by the European Union, re-adjustment of global demand for our products, expansion of investment in export-related industries, increase in prices for our products in the global market, obtaining strong institutional cooperation through a friendly trade policy, and introduction of a flexible foreign exchange policy, are some of the significant milestones of the long-term development strategy of the government.
However, pessimists intentionally ignore the notable economic, political and social victories during the past three years of the Good Governance Government. Yet, honest and faithful people appreciate and hail the true achievements of the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Great are the many political, economic and social schemes you have accomplished for the long-term prosperity of the country during the comparatively brief period of three years. The pronounced mission you have accomplished would eternally remain in the hearts and souls of grateful people.
You restored the dignity and admiration of the nation which had been locally and globally shamed. President Maithripala Sirisena, I wish you good health, long life, courage and luck in all your endeavours in ushering an era of prosperity to the country.

MAGNETIC NORTH BOOMING AS THE NEW BOI INVESTMENT DESTINATION
The Northern Province has benefited from investment as a result of the efforts of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka.
The BOI opened a dedicated office in Jaffna in 2010 to attract and facilitate investment into the province. Whilst it is correct to say the Northern Province does have considerable potential, many opportunities still remain untapped as a result of the effects of the past conflict affecting that region in particular.
In spite of these challenges the BOI places high priority in investment in the North as this effort is more than just development and part of the process of strengthening inclusiveness and reconciliation in the country.
Among the BOI investments there are currently 6 Apparel manufacturers which represent an investment of Rs. 8,000 million and employ 7,917 workers. Another 15 projects in different sectors are also operational and represent investments of Rs. 16,293 million and provide employment to 837 workers in the Northern Province.
In addition two new projects are awaiting commercial operation, five are awaiting implementation, two have been approved and awaiting the signing of agreement and another five projects are awaiting approval. When all these 35 BOI projects in the North become operational, the total investment will be around Rs. 46,484.08 million, which will result in a cumulative total of 10,142 jobs.
The six operating apparel manufacturing plants are Omega Line Ltd in Rasinthinankulam (Vavuniya), Hirdaramani Fashion (Pvt) Ltd (Vavuniya), Hirdaramani Clothing (Pvt) Ltd Puthukkudiyiruppu (Mullaitivu), Timex Garments (Pvt) Ltd (Mannar), and MAS Active (Pvt) Ltd and MAS Intimates (Pvt) Ltd both in Killinochchi. The apparel manufacturing plants cumulatively employ 7,917 staff and represent an investment of US$ 65 million.
In addition there are 15 other BOI projects that are operational which are involved in the manufacture of ice, fishing nets, mesh products, artificial flowers and concrete products in addition to hotels, health care and power generation. Their total value is Rs. 16,293.30 million and 837 jobs have been created in the Northern Province through these specific projects. The largest in investments terms is the Northern Power Company (Pvt) Ltd with a total value of Rs. 5,600 million. In employment generation terms the Northern Central Hospitals (Pvt) Ltd project has created 278 new job opportunities.
A total of four existing hotel projects were built in the Northern Province as BOI projects. They are the Tilko Jaffna City Hotel, the Yarl Hotels (Jetwing) Pvt Ltd. The Thempa Tourist Hotel (Pvt) Ltd. The interest in tourism to the Northern Province, particularly to the Jaffna Peninsula has spurred the construction of hotels in the province in recent years. Another project that is to be developed in the Mannar district will be involved in aquaculture and most specifically the breeding of prawns. This project is a collaboration between Sri Lankan and New Zealand business interests.
In the area of power generation there are two new projects engaged in wind power, namely Juli-power and Beta Power and one of them in the area of Solar power namely Wydexa Power. There are two more wind power projects to be implemented which will be located in the Jaffna Peninsula. Another company Shakthi Agro Industries, a joint US-Sri Lanka investment is to manufacture coco peat for the export market. This project will be located in the Pallai area of the Jaffna Peninsula. This project is awaiting commercial operation.
There is also new Silk Road Aquaculture, which is a Chinese investment of a total value of Rs. 425 million that will engage in the aquaculture sector. Several projects that are awaiting approval include Build Cement (Pvt) Ltd which will be manufacturing partition sheets out of cement and fiber, whose owners are based in Jaffna. This is a subsidiary of Mascon Sri Lanka Company and the value of investment will be US$ 22 mn.
AMP Ceylon Ltd is manufacturing ornamental items using local natural material for export purpose. There is also another project in Jaffna to construct a Hotel named called Arn Mannai (Kings Palace) in the Jaffna Peninsula. Furthermore a new hospital project in Vavuniya has been approved and is to be built shortly.
Hence there are many opportunities that have been created in the Northern Province and these have contributed significantly in improving the economy as well as social integration of the National Province into the national economy.

Rajapaksas discord on Presidential candidacy
The Opposition fights amongst itself, while the government toils for the development of the country, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He said that although the Rajapaksas wished to topple the government, they still disagreed on who was to contest the Presidential election.
He was addressing the inauguration of a model village called Senehasa gama, in Ratnapura. It was said to be the 113th model village constructed under the recent model village project launched by the Housing and Construction Ministry.
Parliamentarians such as Dinesh Gunawardena and Kumara Welgama do not receive the opportunity to contest due to the power thirst of the Rajapaksas, the minister said.
Minister Premadasa said that Rs.531 million was spent on the Senehasa gama, which consisted of 42 houses.
The minister said the Rajapaksas never provided lands to the public; only to foreign companies.

Aeroflot to resume Colombo flights
Aeroflot, the Russian Airline, will re-launch regular non-stop flights to Colombo from October 28, 2018, the Moscow-based airline announced yesterday.
The airline stopped regular flights to Colombo around a decade ago.
The flights will operate under the winter schedule effective through March 30, 2019. Tickets are now available for purchase online and at travel agents worldwide.
Five weekly flights on state-of-the-art Airbus A330 aircraft will operate on the following schedule: Moscow-Colombo (all times local):  flight SU 0286 will depart Moscow Sheremetyevo (SVO) on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at 22:05, and arrive at the Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) at 9:05.
The return flight SU 0287 will depart Colombo on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at 10:45, and arrive at Sheremetyevo at 17:30.
The nine-hour flights will boost inbound tourism from Russia to Sri Lanka. The Aeroflot flights will be a major boost for tourism and business travel to the island and will also obviate the need for transit in a third country.
Aeroflot, which means Air Fleet is the fourth oldest airline in the world, having started operations in July 1923. A key member of the SkyTeam airline alliance, it flies to 130 domestic and international destinations using a fleet of 243 aircraft with 28 more on firm order from Airbus and Boeing.
Aeroflot, which has several subsidiary airlines and aviation companies, also operates the Russian-made Sukhoi Super Jets. Incidentally, KLM, the worlds oldest commercial airline (since 1919) has also re-started flights to Sri Lanka.
Among the other airlines planning to launch regular services to Sri Lanka in the next two months are Edelweiss (Switzerland) and Vistara (India). Several other major foreign airlines have also expressed an interest in flying to Sri Lanka while many existing operators have added extra capacity via bigger aircraft and/or more flight frequencies.

Asian Games in the bag - but could Indonesia host the Olympics
JAKARTA Sept3: An Indonesian bid to host the 2032 Olympics would have been laughed off just a few weeks ago, but a smooth Asian Games may just have put it in the frame to host the world's biggest multi-sports event.
No Southeast Asian country has talked seriously about holding the Summer Games, meaning that even a bid would be another major step forward for a region enjoying rising economic fortunes.
Indonesia's confidence comes from successfully staging the 2018 Asian Games, a giant event with 40 sports and 17,000 athletes and officials held in the capital Jakarta and Palembang, a port city on Sumatra island.
Despite concerns about infrastructure, terrorism, pollution and traffic, the venues were delivered on time and most events passed off without incident, save some problems with ticketing.
President Joko Widodo probably had one eye on next year's election when he announced his intentions for 2032, but the move has been welcomed in Indonesia -- and by Olympics chief Thomas Bach.
You can see the ingredients are there, you see a young, enthusiastic nation, said Bach in Jakarta, where he held talks with Widodo and attended Sunday's closing ceremony.
Passionate about sports, working with high efficiency in the organisation... so, I think it will be a very strong candidature. Part of Bach's enthusiasm may stem from the fact that the number of candidate cities has been shrinking, mainly because of the Games' multi-billion-dollar price tag.
Last September, Paris and Los Angeles were named as hosts of the 2024 and 2028 Olympics in a double announcement, a move to lock in two high-profile cities while they were still available.
Already Asia's fifth-largest economy, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populated country with about 261 million people spread across a sprawling, tropical archipelago.
But it could face some heavyweight competition: bids for 2032 have also been discussed in Germany, India, China and Australia.
The winner is scheduled to be announced in 2025.
The Olympics is different
Tommy Apriantono, a sport science lecturer at the Institute of Technology Bandung, one of Indonesia's top universities, said the nation would have to pull out all the stops for an Olympic bid.
We have successfully hosted the Asian Games despite all the shortcomings. I think Indonesia is good enough, it's worth (bidding)... but we have to really prepare for it, he told AFP.
Now we have experience with the Asian Games... (but) the Olympics is different, there are more participants and the pressure is bigger. Apriantono said holding the Olympics was a chance for Indonesia to step into a new era in the mould of Tokyo 1964, when Japan unveiled infrastructure including the Shinkansen bullet train.
This is Indonesia's chance to be among the world's top countries, he added.
Budiarto Shambazy, a prominent journalist for the Kompas newspaper, said Indonesia's bid was very realistic.
At the moment this is only the statement of the president but I think it's already enough to lay down the next steps to appoint those who would be responsible in this bidding process, he said.
Indonesia will certainly need its best personnel involved, which could prove a problem in at least one case.
Erick Thohir, the media mogul and Inter Milan president who headed the Asian Games organising committee, has already ruled out playing the same role for 2032, saying he would be retired by then.

Law College incidents
BASL President to present observation paper to CJ
Bar Association of Sri Lanka president U.R. de Silva will present an observation paper to the Chief Justice today on the recent incidents that took place at the Sri Lanka Law College following allegations of election malpractice. He further said that his observation paper will be on the conduct of the Law Students Sinhala Union (LSSU) as he is the vice patron of the LSSU according to the constitution.
He added that Attorney at Law Shehan Perera, a lecturer at the Sri Lanka Law College will submit an observation paper to the Chief Justice on the conduct of the Law Students Union (LSU).
Silva noted that the final decision will be taken by the Council of Legal Education headed by the Chief Justice.
One of the students at the college had voted for both parties while his name was not on the voters list. He was not objected by any of the polling agents when he casted his vote. He had first voted for LSU and then for LSSU. Only after he voted for both the parties, one of his batchmates had raised the issue. The parties objected to the conduct of the election stating it was unfair, he said.
He noted that following the incident the administration had refused to cancel the election because of that single reason and had asked the student unions to report on other malpractices if there were any.
According to the LSUs Constitution, they had made their objection to the Principal, who is the patron of the union. The Principal appointed Attorney at Law Shehan Perera to conduct an inquiry over the incident.
He informed that the election cannot be cancelled based on one incident and that the administration would consider cancelling the election if more incidents were reported,he said.
Silva further said that the unions objected to that decision as well.
The following morning I was called to conduct an inquiry as the Vice Patron of the LSSU. When I visited the college, the students informed me that the polling agents were not present and I cannot conduct an inquiry. By then, the Principal was already held hostage. And they asked me to come at a different time, and when I went again they gave me the same answer and could not conduct the inquiry, he explained.
He said when he went again on Sunday morning (2), the students blocked his path and had refused to let him in. The unions that agreed to an inquiry earlier had expressed their displeasure and said that they do not have faith in him. They had further mentioned that Silva had contested for the elections when he was in Law College and would be biased towards one party.
Silva refuting the allegations said that there were no parties back then and added that they all contested individually. However, with the support of the security officials he had entered the premises.

Bread up by Rs.5
The price of a 450 gm loaf of bread was increased by Rs 5 with effect from midnight yesterday.
President of the All Island Bakery Owners Association N.K. Jayawardana said that many issues and reasons resulted in the increase in the price of a loaf of bread, not just the increase in the price of wheat flour.
He cited the changes in taxes, the decrease in the value of the rupee, increase in the price of flour and increase in the salary of administrative staff as their reasons for increasing the price of a loaf of bread.
If the reason to increase the price of a loaf of bread was due to the increase in the price of flour, only Rs 1.50 should have been increased. But the association decided to increase the price of a loaf of bread by Rs 5 considering the above mentioned reasons, he said.
Jayawardana said that he had written to the Ministry of Finance to provide them tax concessions and added that they received no reply.

Captain Root revels in India series win
SOUTHAMPTON, Sunday: Joe Root believes Englands series victory over world number one-ranked India has been his best campaign yet as a Test captain. England completed a 60-run win over India with more than a day to spare at Southampton on Sunday to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match Specsavers series ahead of next weeks finale at The Oval.
India, set 245 to win in an absorbing contest, were dismissed for 184, with off-spinner Moeen Ali completing an impressive Test return to by taking four for 71, a haul that left him with nine wickets in the match overall.
Root began his reign as England skipper last year with home series wins over South Africa and the West Indies. But the Yorkshireman then saw England suffer away defeats in Australia and New Zealand before escaping with a drawn series at home to Pakistan earlier this season. Root, asked if this had been his best series as captain, replied: Yes, I think it probably has been. I feel like Ive had quite a big input into whats been going on, felt very (much) in control of things -- and Ive got a real clear vision of how I see us improving long term.
This match was in the balance while India captain Virat Kohli (58) and Ajinkya Rahane (51) were adding 101 for the fourth wicket.
But Ali, exploiting a wearing pitch, eventually dismissed both batsmen to swing the game decisively Englands way.
I was fairly confident that if we bowled to our potential... then wed have enough in the bank to get across the line, said Root.
The biggest challenge for us was if we could stay calm and collected and trust that if we stuck to what we wanted to do for long periods of time the wicket would do the rest for us.
This was Alis first Test match of the season after he was dropped in New Zealand
Hes been brilliant, said Root of Worcestershire all-rounder Ali. I couldnt be more pleased for him.
Hes such a big part of this team, and I think thats going to be the case moving forward.
England find themselves 3-1 up with one to play despite a succession of batting collapses that continued at Southampton, where they slumped to 86 for six in their first innings.
But Root, who made 48 in Englands second innings 271 after dropping down the order to number four from number three, said: Youve also got to be realistic about the conditions weve been playing in.
I thought after being 80-odd for six on day one, to then go out and play in different but still difficult conditions in the second innings -- and go about things how we did -- was a start to a really significant improvement, he added.  AFP

Free Ambulance Service, a long-felt need fulfilled!
A big thank you to Premier Modi
I am very happy to see the quick expansion of the Suwaseriya free ambulance service across the island receiving many accolades from the people who have been benefitted by it. I thank the Indian Premier Narendra Modi for his generous gift of US $ 7.5 million initially to start it in the Western and Southern provinces in 2016.The gift included 88 ambulances with training cost and operational expenditure for one year.
Although there were tremendous backlashes against this exemplary and meritorious service its achievements were great helping the suffering patients. Suwaseriya free ambulance service hitherto has serviced 91,547 patients in emergency situations which is a hilarious record, breaking the severe criticism of the JO members of the Mahinda camp.
It should be ludicrous and shameful for the Mahinda cronies that they could not do anything beneficial to the people in health or educational or people oriented programmes during their tenure of office for nearly a decade. At least they could not implement the Senaka Bibile s Drug Policy introduced by President Maithripala Sirisena when he was the Minister of Health which could have brought relief to the poor patients in reduction of the prices of drugs. But now, Mahinda cronies have become the worst braggers holding protests and demonstrations to woo the support of the innocent people to win in elections and try to fool them again.
Hence, I request the people of our country to think twice and refrain from rallying around them. I thank again the Indian Government and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for this worthy and meritorious service and request to provide the service to Kegalle district as soon as possible.

Presidential Commission probing SriLankan learns
Company incurred heavy losses since 2008
It was revealed before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering, and Mihin Lanka, yesterday, that SriLankan Airlines (SLA) had incurred heavy losses since 2008, and its board of directors had not been represented by the Treasury since the same year.
SriLankan Airlines was managed by Emirates on an agreement and SLA Head of Financial Management Yasantha Dissanayake, testifying before the Commission, said that the management agreement between SriLankan and Emirates was not terminated; however, it came to an end on March 31, 2008, after a period of 10 years, in accordance with its conditions.
During the last two financial years of the Emirates management, which was from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007 and from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, the airline had earned profits worth Rs.862 million and Rs.4.89 billion, respectively. But after the government reclaimed management as the main shareholder, it had faced losses continuously, it was revealed. Dr. P.B. Jayasundara was the last Chairman under the Emirates management, and he was succeeded by Nishantha Wickremesinghe in 2008.
The company had faced a loss of Rs.9.99 billion at group level and Rs.9.3 billion at company level from 2008 to 2009, Rs. 6 billion at group level and Rs. 2.69 billion at company level from 2009 to 2010, Rs.202 million at group level and Rs.381 million at company level from 2010 to 2011, Rs.17.17 billion at group level and Rs.19.67 billion at company level from 2011 to 2012.
They had also faced losses of Rs.22.5 billion at group level and Rs.21.7 billion at company level from 2012 to 2013, Rs.32.4 billion from 2013 to 2014, Rs.16.3 billion at group level and Rs.16.49 billion at company level from 2014 to 2015, Rs.12.1 billion at group level and Rs.12.6 billion at company level from 2015 to 2016, and Rs.28.3 at group level and Rs.28.9 billion at company level from 2016 to 2017. Nishantha Wickremesinghe held the chairmanship until February 2015.
According to the witness, half of the total loss incurred during 2016 and 2017, approximately Rs.14.3 billion, was due to the compensation paid for terminating and cancelling the lease agreement on three aircrafts in 2016. It was also revealed that SriLankan had incurred losses due to the closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport for three months due to construction work, which had resulted in the cancellation of 600 flights.

Development Landscape of Sri Lanka 2025
Text of the speech made by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, at the CEOs Forum 2018, organised by the Postgraduate Institute of Management Alumni Association (PIMAA) in Colombo on August 31
I want to share some thoughts with you on the important and timely topic Development Landscape of Sri Lanka 2025.
In fact, had any of you the opportunity to visit the first Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition in Moneragala, you would have had the opportunity to get an overview of the governments Vision 2025.
In recent times in Sri Lanka, the perception of development has become somewhat unclear. Development has become associated with ports, airports, expressways, power plants, and other mega infrastructure initiatives.
If a port is built, which does not generate economic activity or an airport that does not attract any commercial flights, it may increase the GDP but that cannot be considered development.
Development, to define succinctly, is the process by which a nation improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people. I believe for a country to develop the two most important pillars on development that must be achieved are democracy, and for a country like Sri Lanka with a history of ethnic tensions, the pillar of reconciliation.
Whilst there is a lot to be said about the gains in political freedom of citizens, as well as the governments commitment to create a truly multi-ethnic, multi-religious country, united in its diversity, I will focus today only on economic development.
For this purpose, the primary barometers for economic well-being would be real wage growth and full employment.
Infrastructure projects
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera
In todays context, Sri Lanka no longer enjoys labour cost advantages since we have relatively high income levels  this is indeed a good thing. We also no longer have the fiscal space to invest public funds in large infrastructure projects.
To illustrate this fact  in the year 2017, government tax revenue was Rs. 1,670 billion, whilst total debt service payment in 2017 was Rs. 1,603 billion.
In the five years between 2010 and 2014 the average annual debt service payment was Rs. 990 billion. Compared to 2014, the annual debt service payment in 2018 has doubled.
This year records the highest debt repayment since independence: approximately Rs. 1.9 Trillion  nearly 82% from the pre-2015 era.
Therefore, it is clear that the government needs to undertake more difficult and challenging reforms in order to drive future economic growth and development.
This entails improving the competitiveness of the economy, so that output per employee is higher, and this would be reflected in higher real wages. The challenge remains as to how does a government improve the competitiveness of the economy
In order to drive competitiveness, it is necessary for economic resources to be diverted into activities that optimise output per worker. This requires a shift of economic activity into sectors where Sri Lanka is globally competitive and move out of sectors where we cannot compete.
In agriculture for instance we all know that approximately 30% of the labour force accounts for around 9% of GDP.
By protecting uncompetitive agriculture, we are in effect trapping farmers in low wage economic activity. It is clear that we need to gradually shift into higher value agriculture in order to improve output per farmer, and thus income per farmer.
To get there we need investment and technology  both FDI and domestic private investment. This same principle applies to all economic sectors; many of which are uncompetitive but have been protected, stifling competition, innovation, and real wage growth, whilst imposing high costs of protection on consumers.
It is in this context that the government has embarked on a shift in the economic trajectory of Sri Lanka from a protected domestic market driven economy, to a more outward oriented economy.
The future of our economic growth must be through exports, entrepreneurship, FDI, and private enterprise.
Sri Lanka needs private investment creating jobs in globally competitive sectors. We have in the past been successful in sectors such as apparel and ICT, but this needs to be expanded in many more sectors.
In order to unlock the potential of the economy we are implementing an economic programme that includes gradual liberalisation of the economy to attract private investment and instil more competition, but whilst providing a safety net for those adversely affected by competition.
Unfair trade practices
Whilst gradually phasing out para-tariffs to encourage competition and reduce cost of living, we have already passed anti-dumping and safeguards legislation to protect against unfair trade practices.
The government has also designed a Trade Adjustment Programme that will provide the tools to re-skill workers and provide concessionary finance to help firms affected by competition to enhance their competitiveness.
At the same time a series of trade agreements are being negotiated to enhance market access to attract investment into sectors of higher productivity, taking advantage of Sri Lankas strategic geographic location.
The EU GSP + has already provided a major boost to export market access, and the ongoing negotiations with India, and China, will further strengthen our country as an investment destination.
Leveraging the trade-investment nexus will enable Sri Lanka to create high value jobs and attract technology to drive productivity growth and real wage growth for citizens.
In addition to enabling market access, it is also essential to address the supply side bottlenecks for investors. Significant steps have been taken to improve the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka, particularly through the use of technology in administrative processes.
Last week the online construction permit platform was launched, significantly cutting down the time and cost to obtain construction permits. The online company registration platform was implemented to register a company within 24 hours. All of these measures will significantly reduce investment costs.
We have undertaken crucial reforms to entrench long term macroeconomic stability. Fiscal stabilisation has historically been a major challenge for Sri Lanka.
The passage of the Inland Revenue Act and the introduction of market-based fuel pricing are major steps in terms of improving fiscal sustainability. In 2017 we achieved a primary surplus in the budget for the first time in several decades.
The results of this fiscal improvement are already materialising with interest rates beginning to moderate as the 1 year Treasury bill yield has declined by 60 basis points in the last two months.
Our exports hit an all-time high in 2017, as did FDI. Foreign reserves also reached comfortable levels in spite of rising global interest rates, whilst inflation is within the target ranges.
Thus, it is clear that the government has successfully navigated the macro-economy into calm, stable waters, in spite of precarious global conditions and onerous external debt obligations.
Whilst acknowledging our gains, in the short term the clear priority is for the government to take measures to kick start economic growth. It is in this context that we have accelerated two key programmes  Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya, which can have a transformational impact on both rural and urban economies.
Enterprise Sri Lanka
Enterprise Sri Lanka provides a range of targeted interest subsidies to stimulate economic activity through private investment and boosting small business. Gamperaliya will infuse life into the rural economy through a rapid public investment programme for rural infrastructure, which will help the recovery from setbacks in two successive years of drought.
Despite creating a conducive economic environment; a country will never truly develop without investing in its people  our greatest resource. This government has prioritised spending on education and health services.
Expenditure on education, higher education, skills and vocational training reached 2% of GDP in 2017 and will be 2.1% of GDP in 2018. Expenditure on health was 1.55% of GDP in 2017 and will be 1.69% of GDP this year.
Such expenditure on social infrastructure may not be visible like a mega project but it has a meaningful impact on the well-being of people. As a government that strongly believes in international partnerships, not isolation, we have pledged to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development goals by 2030, in order to realise the full potential of our entire population.
Every citizen in this country will become a shareholder of the knowledge based, highly competitive social market economy that has been envisaged in our Vision 2025 policy document.
It is therefore clear that this government has not taken the easy short cuts towards populist economic interventions that can provide short term benefits but leads to long term pain.
We have inherited the adverse effects of such myopic policies implemented in the past but chose not to tread the same path.
A set of well thought out measures are being implemented to provide a sustainable, long term solution to the development needs of Sri Lanka.
The benefits of these reforms may not fully materialize immediately, but with the combined efforts of all stakeholders, we have the opportunity to collectively build a strong, sustainable and equitable economy and society.

Dignified enduring mission
At a time when the entire world is shrinking into a small global village, even the criminals in our country have gained access to the modern technology under globalization and show a tendency to employ modern technology and communication methods to commit crimes. Confronted with the challenge of protecting people from those who commit organised crimes while being members of crime networks, Criminal Investigations Department is taking measures to shoulder their responsibility and all the police stations of the Island are also extending a great support in that regard.
A Cyber Crime Unit has been established in the Criminal Investigation Department to carry out investigations with regard to crimes and fraudulent activities committed using the internet. With the idea of further expanding the service rendered by this Unit, Central Province Sub Unit has also been established. Through this sub unit, an opportunity has been created for the people to expedite the enforcement of laws on Cyber Crimes committed in Central Province using mobile phones and computers.
A new website on Cyber Crimes has been already launched by the Criminal Investigation Department. Measures have been taken to publish this website with the objective of minimizing the inconveniences caused to the public due to their ignorance and to facilitate the process of imparting knowledge to prevent them from falling victim to cyber-crimes.
Furthermore, this website intends to make people aware of new cyber-crimes and strategies, instantly updating the people regarding new crime trends and virus attacks carried out through the internet and social networks, to minimize the damage caused to Government and Non-Governmental Organizations through online scams, phishing and financial malpractices. Since the officers of other police stations are also expected to be informed by studying the information disseminated and awareness programmes carried out through this website, this website has proved to be of great assistance in solving cyber-crimes.
In the same manner, it functioned during the time of war, the Terrorist Investigation Division still takes measures to ensure the safety of the country and the people by collecting intelligence information. With the aid of their knowledge, intelligence, expertise and use of technology, they are dedicated to producing suspects before the law by uncovering organised crimes, homicides, large-scale robberies committed in deceitful ways, fraudulent activities and usurpation of property without letting such crimes sink into oblivion. The officers of the Terrorist Investigation Division are diligently discharging the bounden duty of saving the posterity from any of the harsh memories we shared in the past.
During this period, when our country is rapidly moving towards development, hundreds of thousands of vehicles are being driven in the road system of Sri Lanka that has been broadened and improved. The traffic police officers have dedicated their service during day and night neither making any complaints against the inclement weather conditions nor taking heed of the ill-founded public censure and disdain, to ensure the safe journey of the public including hundreds of thousands of school children, employees of state and private sector who enter the road as a part of their daily routine. No one can trivialize the commitment of the officers of Traffic Division who help cross the road of other parents children while trusting in someone else to take care of their own.
The narcotic problem has a hand in petty thieving committed in a village to acts of terrorism on the global scale and is becoming the major crisis in present Sri Lanka. The tendency towards the creation of such a perilous situation has also become greater since Sri Lanka has become an exchange hub in the eyes of drug racketeers. Narcotics are being brought into the country by the smugglers employing devious methods under the guise of fishermen as the Islands territorial sea is open to fishing industry. By employing its Intelligence Unit, Police Narcotic Division is taking action, at the risk of their own lives, to bring the drug smugglers to justice after eliciting information by building a good rapport with the public. Even the Police Special Task Force is extending a tremendous support towards this worthy cause and by carrying out raids against illicit liquor and narcotics, the Anti-vice Divisions established in all the Police Stations of the island are exerting a strenuous effort to save the future generations from this drug menace.
VIPs security
After carrying out an investigation against abuse, exploitation and crimes against children as well as women of this country, Sri Lanka Police, takes measures to bring criminals and abusers before a court of law for the administration of justice. For this purpose, Sri Lanka Police has established Headquarters of Children & Women Bureau, Special Investigation Unit of the Child Protection Authority, Children & Women Bureaus at Divisional level and Units at Police Station level and due measures are being taken. Furthermore, the duty of protecting the victimized parties is also being carried out in a responsible manner.
In our country, there have been many attacks targeting the VIPs on several occasions. As a country in which the civil administration has been restored, ensuring the security of the VIPs is also one of the major responsibilities among the Sri Lankan Police duties. Accordingly, Presidents Security Division, Prime Ministers Security Division and Ministerial Security Division have been established. The officers serving in those Divisions are offering a commendable service even putting their lives at stake in order to maintain the Civil Administration within the country. Considering some of the attacks that were carried out against the judges, who administer justice, Judicial Security Division has been established to ensure the security of the judges. Thus, the said division provides an admirable service towards maintaining law within the country.
During this era in which Sri Lanka has embarked on a journey towards rapid development, not only the private and state-owned institutions but also the general public have become extremely busy. Sri Lanka Police, as one of the chief institutions which address the day-to-day needs of the public, has established Information Technology Division with the intention of boosting the efficiency of Sri Lanka Police by introducing the use of computers, internet and speedy methods of communication to police officers.
Accordingly, steps have been taken to provide an efficient service by connecting all the Police Divisions and Police Stations by using a VPN system. Furthermore, Sri Lanka Police has launched a CCTV camera system within the city of Colombo and this has been helpful to minimise traffic congestion, identify and arrest suspects in connection with crimes, enabling Sri Lanka Police to take necessary measures to speed up the process of serving the public.
The Tell IGP service has been introduced to the public to contact Inspector General of Police directly through e-mail facility, should there be any injustice caused to people when they are getting their needs fulfilled by police. In addition, Police Headquarters has launched and conducts programmes such as Police Public Day every Friday, IGs Help Desk and 119 Emergency Call Service Unit which function every day giving the opportunity to the public to receive police services without delay.
As a country endowed with a natural environment universally acclaimed for its beauty, Sri Lanka annually earns a large foreign exchange through the tourism industry. Environment Protection Division has been established to create an attractive and clean environment, while taking measures to prevent communicable diseases in densely populated areas, including religious places and other places of natural beauty much frequented by foreign tourists.
This makes a huge contribution towards creating a favourable and agreeable environment for the public. The Tourist Police Division offers a great service to the tourists in terms of ensuring their security and providing assistance for the legal issues found among various other problems that they encounter during their visits.
Police Public Relations Division has been established not only to maintain the relationship between the Police and the public, but also to raise public awareness constantly to prevent children and family members from falling victim to various social crimes, molestation and personal abuse that take place in the society as parents engaged in a competitive daily routine have become too busy to take heed of the social tragedies lurking in the society posing a threat to their children.
This Division raises awareness of schoolchildren, adults and target groups and seminars and workshops are conducted for this purpose. This Division also provides an immense service to the public in finding disappeared people. In addition, it makes the people aware of unidentified corpses and takes action by providing necessary public relations to seek social justice for the deceased and to give corpses a decent burial. Moreover, Public Relations Division has earned love and the trust of all the artists of the country, as this division is making a great contribution towards the production of many creations by providing sets for tale dramas, movies by offering the assistance of police characters.
More than 100 media institutions are actively involved in disseminating information to the general public every day in Sri Lanka, which is one of the leading countries in terms of using communication and media. Police Media Division has been established to circulate accurate information in an efficient manner. Sri Lanka Police has been able to render a great service towards the well-being of the public life by getting information immediately with regard to all the crimes, disappearances, arrests, emergency situations, road obstructions and accidents reported from all the police stations of the island and releasing such information to Media institutions through press conferences.
Police Clearance Branch attached to the Police Headquarters has been established to issue clearance reports which are essential for the Sri Lankans who are leaving the country for foreign employment, academic and other purposes as they make a significant contribution towards the Sri Lankan economy. This branch issues about 100 to 500 clearance reports, daily and despite having a very small staff within the branch, they are dedicated to discharging their duties efficiently by obtaining reports from all the Police Stations island wide, fingerprint branch of the Police Criminal Records Division, Department of Registration of Persons, Department of Immigration and Emigration, Criminal Investigation Department and Intelligence Unit.
Prevent illegal activities
Police Naval Division has been established to prevent illegal activities such as narcotics, illegal goods and other merchandise smuggling and human-trafficking across the territorial waters and they are rendering their invaluable service towards the country around the clock.
Police Life Saving and Swimming Units have been established to prevent deaths caused by drowning at accident prone and precarious coastal areas and inland bodies of water such as rivers and tanks where people usually bathe. So far they have been able to rescue thousands of precious lives and their service can never be underestimated.
Officers attached to Police Intelligence Units are dedicated towards the task of gathering information on crimes and anti-social behaviour and absconding suspects in connection with various crimes within the country. They perform their duties around the clock in this manner for the benefit of the public not because they have any personal gains, but because they wish to perform their duty literally as guardian deities of the nation.
Antiquities Division has been established with the intention of preventing treasure hunters from desecrating and looting the local landscapes with historically significant crafts and structures erected by ancient kings and forefathers to showcase the glory and pride of our heritage to the future generation.
The fact that the police officer is a true protector of the country has been firmly established in society as the police are engaged in the task of protecting the archaeological sites by apprehending and producing the looters and treasure hunters before the law.
Officers attached to Police Fraud Investigation Bureau and Fraud Investigation Units established on a divisional level, diligently and meticulously perform their duties to bring justice to the distressed people who have lost their property and money falling victim to the fraudulent practices and schemes of crooked people in the society.
Police Mounted Division which plays a leading role in displaying the glory of Sri Lanka to the international community, while assisting the traffic management duties in the busy streets of Colombo has also made an enormous contribution towards adding colour to the national ceremonies.
Preserving the cultural identity of traditional dance, Police Cultural Unit together with Sri Lanka Police Western Band, which has been marked in history as the first western band in Sri Lanka, perform, entertain and extend a warm welcome whenever the foreign delegates visit this country. Further, by taking part in foreign visits they have also been able to display the elegance of the traditional dancing to the international community.
Sri Lanka Police has reached the Community Policing Era after moving forward through Colonial Police Ear and Military Era of Police. Police services functioning in all countries have evolved after employing and experimenting with various policing methods and have implemented hi-tech as well as community-based methods.
Highly developed countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland, India are implementing the Community Policing Method which is a pragmatic approach combined with the knowledge of Social Sciences, Psychology and scientific methods.
The 152nd Police Day is celebrated, under the theme, A Dignified Enduring Mission with the objective of making Sri Lanka Police, which closely associated with Sri Lankan community for a period of 152 years, the bosom companion of the public with the help of community policing concept. May Sri Lanka Police endure through time executing its legendary mission!

Diva till the end
Aretha Franklins loved ones are keeping the late Queen of Soul looking fresh and fashionable for her public celebration of life by giving her a daily wardrobe change.
A two-day open casket viewing began on August 28, when fans lined up to pay their last respects to the music icon at the Charles H. Wright African American Museum in her adopted city of Detroit, Michigan.
On the first day of the viewing, Arethas body had been dressed head to toe in red, wearing a lacy ruby gown with Christian Louboutin heels, complete with matching nails and lipstick.
However, as other mourners filed in on Wednesday, they discovered the singer had been given a makeover, this time donning a pastel blue dress with matching stilettos.
Franklins body was moved to the New Bethel Baptist Church, where her father was once the pastor, for a private visitation on Thursday, before a funeral service on Friday at the Greater Grace Temple.
Officials from the local Swanson Funeral Home were responsible for Wednesdays change of outfit, and boss Linda Swanson tells the Detroit Free Press fans can expect two more new looks for Aretha, as chosen by her family, to ensure she is resplendent in repose, as a queen should be.
The musician, who was known for her love of furs and lavish jewels, will also be saluted at an all-star memorial concert at Chene Park Amphitheatre, where her friend Gladys Knight, The Four Tops, and Angie Stone will be among the performers.
Franklin died from pancreatic cancer earlier last month, aged 76.

Englands Cook to retire from intl cricket after India series
London, Monday: Alastair Cook announced on Monday he would retire from international cricket after the fifth Test against India, with England's leading Test run-scorer saying he had "nothing left in the tank".
The 33-year-old Essex left-hander has amassed 12,254 runs at 44.88 including 32 hundreds, while his run of 158 consecutive Test appearances is a world record.
But the former England captain, who has played in 160 Tests in total, has struggled for runs recently and averages a meagre 18.62 from nine Tests this year.
"After much thought and deliberation over the last few months I have decided to announce my retirement from international cricket at the end of this Test series against India," said Cook in an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
"Although it is a sad day, I can do so with a big smile on my face knowing I have given everything and there is nothing left in the tank," the four-time Ashes-winner added.
"I have achieved more than I could have ever imagined and feel very privileged to have played for such a long time alongside some of the greats of the English game. "
Cook said it would be tough to walk away but that the timing was right.
"I have loved cricket my whole life, from playing in the garden as a child, and will never underestimate how special it is to pull on an England shirt," he said.
"So I know it is the right time to give the next generation of young cricketers their turn to entertain us and feel the immense pride that comes with representing your country."
England took an unassailable 3-1 lead in their five-match series against India with a 60-run win in the fourth Test at Southampton on Sunday.
But Cook, who scored a century on Test debut against India at Nagpur in 2006, has managed just 109 runs from his seven innings in the series at 15.57.
'Sounding board' Gooch
He is sixth in the all-time list of leading Test run-scorers, having surpassed mentor Graham Gooch's previous England record of 8,900 runs three years ago.
Gooch was also a predecessor of Cook's as an Essex and England opener, as well as Test skipper.
"There are too many people to thank individually, but a special mention must go to Graham Gooch," said Cook, who is to continue playing for Essex.
"As a seven-year-old I queued for his autograph outside Essex County Cricket Club and years later was so fortunate to have him mentoring me," he said.
"Graham was my sounding board, especially in the early years of my career, spending hour after hour throwing balls at me with his dog stick. He made me realise you always need to keep improving whatever you are trying to achieve."
Former England captain Nasser Hussain described Cook -- about to become a father for the third time -- as a "truly remarkable cricketer".
Speaking to Sky Sports he said: "To carry on this long... You'd think somewhere along the line you'd lose form or fitness. Huge credit to the lad. He's been England's best player."
Alec Stewart, another former England skipper, paid tribute to his robustness, telling BBC radio: "That record of over 12,000 runs, if someone breaks it they're very, very good players, but it will take a long, long time to get there."
England have yet to announce their squad for the fifth Test at The Oval, which starts on Friday, but it would be a major surprise if Cook were omitted.
