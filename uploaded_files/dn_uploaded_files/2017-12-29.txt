ANCIENT BRIDGES  EVIDENCE OF A PROUD HISTORY
National Road Network of Sri Lanka comprised of more than 4,800 bridges across major rivers, streams, reservoirs and canals all over the country. Some of the brides built during colonial era, more than 120 years old still stand as giants remembering us the comprehensive transportation systems Sri Lanka has owned. The main objective of this article is to elaborate a few salient features of some of these bridges giving due recognition to their significant architectural or technological aspects.
Also, this article attempts to highlight the need of preserving these national treasures for the benefit of future generations with the assistance of proper management systems while reviewing some of the findings of the bridge study recently concluded with the assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Historically valuable bridges
There are some existing ancient bridges which have been identified as landmarks of good planning taken place in ancient Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). The British Colonial era was a very significant period for bridge construction in Sri Lanka since most of them are still being used by people without any trouble. The history of bridge construction by British goes back to 1820s built mainly for military purposes. But soon after they were utilized for commercial traffic specially to transport goods and services to plantations run by British entrepreneurs and to carry economic produces and agricultural products back to Colombo.
The construction of first trunk road, Colombo - Kandy Road (A1) took approximately 10 years. Dowsons Tower near Kadugannawa Railway Station is a tribute to the British garrison engineer who steered the construction work in a difficult terrain, under trying conditions and succumbed to death after stung by a poisonous snake. During this period some unique bridges were constructed by British rulers. The Bridge of Boats over Kalani River, Mawanella Bridge and Peradeniya Bridge are some of the bridges with unique features. A brief introduction of these are given below.
The regular mail coach service between Colombo-Kandy was inaugurated in 1833. The Colombo-Galle mail coach commenced in 1838. But it was used not only for delivery of mail but for normal passenger transportation as well. The regular connection between towns were enhanced day-by-day. The mail coach from Colombo took 14 hours to reach Kandy due to steepness of the road and difficult climb. Also, it has taken 12 hours to return to Colombo at the beginning.
There are many old and historically valuable bridges which have been used for many generations and they have become a part of peoples day to day life in Sri Lanka. Historically valuable bridges are important in attracting tourist as well. They are national assets for the promotion of cultural-tourism harmony and should be preserved for future generations.
Historically valuable bridges are not only attracting foreign tourists, but local travellers and nearby people too. All the bridges, including the ones located in your area are very important and taking care of them is considered as everyones responsibility.
Evolution of the bridge over Kelani River
Bridge of Boats, Victoria Bridge and Friendship Bridge (1822, 1895, and 2000)
The Kelani River is the widest river in Sri Lanka. Therefore, a unique structural design has to be selected to construct a bridge to cross the river. The first Kelani Bridge was a pontoon bridge. In 1822 the Bridge of Boats was constructed by placing a timber deck on 21 boats to make 150 m span. Each boat located 7m distance from each other.
The advantage of this structure is no deep foundation required for the bridge. The disadvantage is the instability of the bridge. It could be washed away in a heavy flood situation or easily damaged, resulting in high maintenance costs. Part of this bridge was opened to traffic across the river daily. In 1895 the bridge was replaced by then Victoria Bridge which was an iron Bridge. The original location of the Bridge of Boats was near Thotalanga Market, 150 m up Stream of Victoria Bridge.
Then Victoria Bridge also deteriorated due to the movement of increased traffic. Subsequently, a new bridge was constructed in 1994-2000 under JICA funding assistance considering the increase in demand. It is called Sri Lanka - Japan Friendship Bridge.
Two spans of Victoria Bridge have been re-used to construct the Borupona Bridge connecting two important sub-urban areas.
Borupana Bridge
Today we can see more than 120 years old bridge in Borupana, Ratmalana.
Mawanella Bridge (1832)
This bridge is very popular due to its appearance with fine brick arches. The bridge was built in 1832 over Maa Oya. It consists of 4 spans and each arch is 15 m in length. This is an orthodox type of structure.
Bridge of Boats in Kelaniya (1822) and Peradeniya Bridge (1833) couldnt survive for more than 74 years. But Mawanalla Bridge is still standing for more than 185 years.
Peradeniya Bridge (1833, 1905)
The Peradeniya Bridge is one of the important bridges on Colombo - Kandy road and it was constructed over Mahawelli River in 1833. The bridge was built by timber and no single nail used for assembling. Arch consists of 62 m span and width of 6.7 m. The 62 m long single span completely made of timber and it held the total strength of the bridge. Therefore, this design and construction became unique among other bridges. Main part of the structure was prefabricated in Colombo and brought to the site. The Construction of the bridge has taken more than 6 years.
This bridge was lasted for 72 years and then replaced by current steel arch bridge in 1905.
There are 3 steel bridge spans with 22 m length and the steel span is shorter than the original timber bridge span. 22 m to 30 m is the standard span length of steel arch at that time.
Keisho Bridge (1847) and Ulapane Bridge (1903)
Keisho Bridge is located in Gurudeniya on Kandy-Hanguranketha road. Beautiful Keishou Bridge is still standing in the village. It is a two-span brick, arch bridge constructed with the support of natural rock besides. Top of the parapet and parapet wall is formed by special kind of round shape bricks. The year 1847 has been mentioned as the construction year at the middle of the bridge.
Ulapane Bridge is impressive of its unique shape. The span length of this bridge is 52 m and the width is 3 m.
This is an inverted bowstring lattice truss type bridge. This kind of iron bridges were assembled in a government factory established in 1849 in Colombo.
Since the existing concrete bridge was constructed parallel to the old bridge, the iron bridge has not been utilized. But still the mirror image of this unique structure remains unfading on the Mahaweli River.
Bridges  Under JICA project
During last 20 years JICA has been involved in bridge construction projects in Sri Lanka. These bridges were subjected from planning stage to the maintenance of the bridges. The condition of the most of the bridges is still good. Even though some damages to surface of decks, sidewalks and drainage are observed. Regular inspection and repairs help to keep bridges in good condition. We expect these bridges to be in use for a long period of time.
Review of bridge maintenance and management
(1) Maintenance budget
The bridge maintenance required a separate budget. The stock of bridges in Sri Lanka is rapidly increasing. Accordingly, maintenance cost shall be increased.
It is essential to assure the quality of construction from the very beginning. Because making low quality structures will result in severe safety issues to the users and also will lead to inconveniences and unnecessary maintenance cost. We must consider the initial cost of construction as well as the maintenance cost of the bridge throughout its life span. It is called Life Cycle Cost (LCC). The life span such as 50 years or 120 years and the life span cost should be estimated according to the function of the Bridge. If the initial cost is higher we should choose lower maintenance cost plan.
Through the proper inspections we can assess the condition of bridges and based on the accurate inspection data we can make a proper maintenance plan. It will support to reduce the excessive maintenance cost.
It is evident that the problem is most of the public utilities do not have proper maintenance plan or a schedule due to budgetary constraints.
Importance of maintenance of structures
In Colombo there are some old, yet significant buildings. For an example, Caves building in Kompannaveediya (Slave Island) is an attractive structure. The building has not been maintained for a long time. Likewise there are a large number of bridges all over the country with historical values and technological importance, but neglected over the years without any maintenance.
The large sign boards erected in the surroundings of many structures are obstructing its appearance. Beautiful sights of some have been subdued due to high grown trees on the streets/roads. These situations occur due to the lack of interest and knowledge of the significance of the relevant structures. Therefore, the concerned government agencies and community should understand the value of such assets, as these are part of a nations history and cultural heritage.
Undertaking necessary improvements to such structures will enhance its attraction and enhance the beauty of the living environment of the citizens of the near vicinity while minimizing the unnecessary maintenance costs.
Haphazard garbage dumping problem
Dumping of garbage haphazardly has become a major environmental problem in Sri Lanka. The severity of the problem is indicative by the progressive spread of dengue and resultant deaths year after year. Dumping of garbage underneath the bridges is another issue which directly contributes to the deterioration of bridges and constraint to regular inspection of bridges as huge garbage piles obstruct close inspections.
We have cleaned some bridge sites in Colombo area as an additional public relation activity under our project. More than 100 volunteers participated to clean the bridge sites on every Saturday in August 2017 and more than 250 garbage bags were filled each day with the debris (Plastic and Polyethylene) collected from the sites.
Even though cleaning bridges is a task of the local administrative authorities and RDA, the public awareness should be raised regarding the consequences of the garbage dumping at the bridge surroundings.
Bridge engineer
The proper maintenance can be carried out by a crew of professional and skilled engineers. The problem in Sri Lanka is lack of professionals in the respective discipline. Sri Lanka needs more bridge engineers.
The regular site visits are included in the usual site policy followed even by chief engineers in Japan. Its called Genba-syugi in Japanese.
Sri Lankan engineers should understand that the problems are not arising in the office, but at the site. Therefore, visiting site is a must to identify and acknowledge the problems.
Relating to this I think number of engineering graduates passing out from universities is not sufficient. And majority of graduates are from arts and related streams, science graduates too are small in number. The most of these graduates cannot contribute much to the economic development of the country in the current global context.
Future of bridge maintenance
There are 4,800 bridges under the management of RDA. The inspection of all those bridges will be completed within 2017. So, the first hurdle of identifying all the bridges managed by RDA in Sri Lanka has been achieved. Then the next target is how to maintain the bridges in a sustainable manner. Development of a conducive environment and appropriate mechanisms is very important to put a proper maintenance system in place.
The area surrounding a bridge should not be polluted by dumping garbage. The vicinity of a bridge should be maintained as a beautiful site for recreational activities of the residents of the area close to the bridge.
There are some bridges which are historically valuable and enhance the aesthetic value of the environment where the bridge is located. The value of those bridges should be appreciated and protected by the local people who live nearby. It is our responsibility as public to protect and care for such structures. Starting there, you can develop Sri Lanka.

Ape Gama in Anuradhapura  to recreate ancient Sinhala kingdom
Baladurage Chandrasiri, winner of several global awards for creativity, sustainability and leadership, for creating Forest Rock Garden Resort Hotel in Andarawewa, is to build a third hotel. 
Chandrasiri clinched the Gold at the 19 International Star for Leadership in Quality Awards, held at a gala ceremony in Madrid, Spain. Chandrasiri beat competitors from over 137 countries to win this much-coveted global accolade. 
This award inspired me to build a third hotel - Ape Gama - in Anuradhapura, investing nearly Rs. 300 million. 
He said that he was based in Italy for over two decades studying architecture and working and developed a liking for tourism. I wanted to create a landmark and leave a lasting image in everything and first built Palm Garden Village in Puttalam to have the largest swimming pool and banquet hall in the area. 
"The three star hotel is situated on a 50-acre plot of land that was originally used for chena cultivation. The land was devoid of trees and completely abandoned at the time of purchase on the early 1990s. Since then, a new forest has been created through hard work and patience. For the landscaping of the hotel, more than 500 big trees were planted." 
"The success of this 62-room hotel prompted me to build my second hotel, Forest Rock Garden Resort Hotel in Anuradapura which resembles an ancient kingdom, just seven kilometres away from Palm Garden Village. 
"The hotel stands 20 feet above ground level to ensure that the surrounding beauty is not disrupted and the entire property links seamlessly with the natural beauty of the landscape. The entire resort has been built atop concrete pillars providing ultra-luxury rooms to pamper and relax guests. In order to ensure the continuance of the natural landscape, nearly 100,000 rare herbal plants have been planted on the premises." 
The resort will also give guests an insight into the cultural interests of the region, through the 50-acre resort premises which is moulded after the Anuradhapura Kingdom. 
Chandrasiri said the demand for the hotel from guests and travel agents prompted him to build another hotel on similar values and this is how his third hotel Ape Gama is being built. This would be a fully eco-concept hotel depicting the ancient Sinahla traditions. 
"Staff would wear traditional uniforms and even guests would be encouraged to wear sarongs. The guests would be picked up in bullock carts at the reception and taken to their villas which would also be built with traditional Sri Lankan architecture using clay." 
I will also build a mini kuttan pokuna (swimming pool) and other similar ancient monuments too. A typical village pola, fish market and tea kiosk too would be created along with other traditional themes to take guests back to the ancient era. We hope to open the hotel by end 2018. (SS)

Bhutanese prince, family here
His Holiness Vairotsana Truklu Jigme Jigten Wangchuck accompanied by his mother Her Royal Highness Ashi Sonam Dechan Wangchuck and his grandmother Her Majesty the Queen Mother Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck of Bhutan visited the Gangaramaya Temple yesterday to pay their respects to the Sacred Bodhi tree.
The foundation stone for the retaining wall built of the tree was laid by His Holinesss grandfather, the Fourth King of Bhutan, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1976.
The four year old Vairotsana Tulku, is believed to be the reincarnation of the Lotsawa; translator Vairotsana of Tibet, one of the 25 main disciples of Guru Rinpoche.
I am very moved today and very grateful to you for having blessed my family and the people of Bhutan, said the Queen Mother who participated in a ceremony to invoke blessings at the Temple. This was the familys first visit to the Temple, said the Queen Mother addressing the gathering at the religious ceremony.
When His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck came here in 1976 and inaugurated the foundation stone for this very sacred Bodhi tree here it was a significant event which bound Bhutan and Sri Lanka in one common goal of spirituality, she continued.
Gangaramaya Temple, Chief Incumbent Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera who also spoke at the ceremony explained how the decision to build a retaining wall and revive the tree was made at a time when the Bodhi tree was almost dying,
This sacred tree was in a dilapidated state, its roots were rotting and many experts said the tree could not be saved. After the King of Bhutan laid the foundation stone, we expanded the retaining wall, a merchant and a local benefactor call Andrisappu came forward to help.
Thereafter we brought rich soil from Anuradhapura and Kataragama to tend to the tree and the tree once again bloomed, said Ven Gnanissara Thera.
The Bhutanese Royal family visited the Temple having come to the country on a personal visit.

## Title: A blow to corruption

A blow to corruption
There is understandably a simmering wave of frustration over the slow progress of investigations into some of the most brazen acts of corruption committed in recent memory. The public has every right to expect faster results since it is their money that has been swindled by these corrupt individuals.
But what is even more lamentable - and alarming  is the belief that corruption is a fact of life in Sri Lanka, that one cannot get anything done without greasing a palm or two. This is seen as normal behaviour or par for the course. This paves the way for corruption at all levels, from the hospital gate attendant who wants something to let a visitor in outside the normal visiting hours to the crooked politician who demands a kings ransom to pass a tender. Rampant corruption has a massive and adverse effect on the economy.
Corruption will continue as long as we lack the constitutional, institutional and legal frameworks to curb it at every level. We do have multiple agencies to probe acts of corruption, but they are hampered by a lack of a cohesive policy on tackling runaway corruption.
This lacuna will be filled next year when the new National Action Plan on Anti-Corruption gets off the ground. The proposal made by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala to compile an action plan for empowering anti-corruption agencies in controlling corruption and creating awareness on the negative impact of corruption, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers recently.
Since it is useless to close the stable door after the horse has bolted, the action plan mainly focuses on preventive measures against corruption. The action plan includes coherence and coordination, implementation of the convention against corruption, enhancement of the independence of the Bribery or Corruption Investigation Commission, education, awareness creation, capacity building, and technical assistance that will form a total package against corruption. This envisages a collective effort among stakeholder agencies to tackle bribery and corruption. In the absence of a strong framework to combat bribery and corruption, the National Action Plan will become a road map outlining the guidelines in the fight against bribery and corruption.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) together with the Presidential Secretariat and the Foreign Ministry and other key stakeholders such as the Ministry of Public Administration, Law and order, Judiciary and Education will present a general framework for the National Action Plan on anti-corruption as the initial step within the setting up of the National Action Plan. Public views will apparently be welcome on this initiative.
This does not mean that investigations should play second fiddle but prevention is always better than the cure. However, the Government plans to bring in amendments to the Bribery and Corruption Act by early next year to strengthen the CIABOC which is a multi tasking organisation that investigates, prosecutes, and corroborates internationally on matters regarding bribery and corruption in the country. The so-called adversarial approach to bribery and corruption is essential but giving equal attention to corruption prevention is also very important.
This is also significant from the perspective of foreign investment. Investors are generally reluctant to take the plunge if a given country has an endemic culture of corruption. However, this move will project Sri Lanka as a progressive country that has the political and institutional will to fight corruption at all levels.
The authorities have also taken cognizance of the role of education in fighting corruption. Parents should first set an example by never ever bribing anyone, especially in front of their children, lest they think it is quite normal to do so. It will be beneficial to include corruption prevention topics into the school curricula so that children will be exposed to the idea of fighting corruption from a young age. This could ultimately pave the way for a corruption free society in the future.
In the meantime, the Government should do everything in its power to swiftly investigate the many pending cases of bribery and corruption where plenty of evidence is available. Any slowdown could send the wrong message to the investor and international communities that we are soft on corruption. There is a suggestion to form special courts to speed up the justice process with regard to acts of mega corruption, which must be implemented without delay. A Presidential Commission is already investigating the bond issue while another will be appointed to probe SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka Airline, both of which have recorded massive losses. Several countries are also helping us to boost anti-corruption and justice mechanisms.
It is a fallacy that corruption cannot be reduced and eliminated. Many countries have succeeded in successfully eradicating 99 percent of acts of corruption and malpractices. But it is a task that the Government alone cannot do  the society must back it fully. We should be determined not to give or take bribes (both categories are equally harmful to society). This should be inculcated in both children and adults. A society that frees itself from the scourge of corruption can go further and higher.

Can Airmen turn tables on Havies
A closely fought out battle can be expected between Air Force against Havelock Sports Club when they lock horns in their second round Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby encounter at the Air Force grounds in Ratmalana today at 4.00pm.
The Airmen are packed with some outstanding players of the caliber of towering flanker Radeesha Seneviratne, scrum half Gayantha Iddamalgoda, fly half Nuwan Perera, Pabasara Hewage, winger Ranindu Padmasanka, ex Anthonian centre Jehan Seelagama and full back Rumesh Ramdas.
But they should get their act together if they are to pull off a win against the formidable Havies outfit and to achieve that the several experienced players who are in their ranks have to give off their best under the leadership of their play maker and former national centre Charith Seneviratne.
Meanwhile the young Havies outfit at present are in a team rebuilding stage and under the watchful eyes of their dedicated and committed head coach Sanath Martis. Captain and second row forward Jason Meldor will know that losing this game could mean somewhat of a setback for them in the league tournament to achieve glory as they have already lost two games unexpectedly to Navy SC and Kandy SC.
Hence they will come out with their best game plan for this match and will go out with all guns blazing to topple the Air Force team and make a bonus point win.
Teams:
Air Force (Probable XV): Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Parakrama Ratnayake or Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranuka Medagedara, Dinesh Weeraratne, Radeesha Seneviratne, Saraka Waralla, Gayantha Iddamalgoda and Nuwan Perera, Kaushal Manupriya, Sooriya Crishan, Charith Seneviratne, Ranindu Padmasanka Ishara Madushan or Rumesh Ramdas
Havelocks SC (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Prasad Madusanka, Liston Flatney, Jason Melder, Sithum Peiris or Shehan Dias, Shenal Deelaka, Sharo Fernando, Lasindu Ishan karunathilake, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando or Dulaj Perera, Ramesh De Silva or Chamara Dabare, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Sadun Herath, Reeza Mubarak.

CB refutes media reports  of cover up over CIFL
Central Bank (CB) Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday emphasized that the CB was still looking for a credible investor with proof of funds to bail out troubled Central Investment and Finance PLC depositors.
The Governor also refuted recent media reports which said that the Central Bank is planning to close down CIFL and its group companies to cover up the irregular and possibly illegal conduct of Central Bank officials regulating these companies.
We have been looking for a potential investor to resurrect the company since 2014, but unfortunately, we havent been able to find a credible investor with poof of funds so far.
Our lives will be so much easier if an investor comes clean with proof of money. In this regard, the Bank is still encouraging prospective investors to resolve the matter. Were happy to have an investor, but we cant let this drag on for a long period.
The Governor further added that the Central Bank conduced a forensic audit way back in September 2013 on the issue of CIFL and findings of the audit have been shared with the Auditor Generals department and CID.
Meanwhile, the Central Bank has requested Paypal to consider starting inward remittance services to Sri Lanka.
According to Central Bank Senior Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, Sri Lanka invited Paypal to start services in Sri Lanka three years ago. However, Paypal has noted that there werent sufficient volumes to commence operations in Sri Lanka during that time.
Paypal is a private company; it is their business decision whether to enter Sri Lanka or not, Weerasinghe said.
Dr Coomaraswamy also said that the CB is willing to provide necessary regulatory support for Paypal to start inward remittance services to Sri Lanka and there is no restriction for them to conduct operations even under the existing regulations.

China to overtake the US as worlds  most powerful economy
CHINA is set to dominate the global economy as it becomes the richest country in the world by 2032, experts have revealed.
The United States will be overtaken as the most powerful economy in the world as Chinas strong growth continues, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
World Bank lead economist John Litwack said: China has maintained its growth resilience and gained reform momentum.
The UK-based think tank revealed what they expect to be the worlds 10 biggest economies in 2032, with the USA sitting in second behind the communist superpower.
India, Japan, Germany and Brazil make up the rest of the top six ahead of the UK in seventh.
Chinas growth has been partly driven by the new economy with internet firms succeeding with massive growth of 16 per cent in the last decade, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said. The report claimed that President Donald Trumps isolationist trade agenda will contribute to its downfall as the world biggest economy.
The UK think tank said: The impact of President Trump on trade has been less severe than expected, the USA will retain its global crown a year longer than we anticipated in the last report.
South Korea and India will both climb four places, with Seoul making its first appearance in the top 10 and eighth.
The rise of Asian economies is reflected in the gloomy fortunes of the former global powers of Europe.
Benefits for most other taxpayers would be smaller, but the President attempted to sell the bill as a Christmas present for middle-class Americans in part because it would trigger job growth.
President Trump told reporters on the White House lawn before travelling to Camp David for the weekend: Itll be fantastic for the middle-income people and for jobs, most of all.
He also predicted the legislation would cause the economy to soar beyond its current 3 per cent rate of growth. Many economists believe that attaining that would be challenging  the nation last topped 5 per cent in 1984.
The Republican plan is the widest-ranging reshaping of the tax code in three decades and is expected to add to the nations $20trillion (15trillion) debt. The tax cuts are projected to add $1.46trillion over a decade.

There does not seem to be any solution the hazard of sleep dearth. Hence, a healthy nation in the foreseeable future is just a dream! Even the present laws against sound pollution are not effectively implemented. It is a real shame that all authorities continue to be deaf to this deadly menace, to children and adults alike. Horning is permitted even at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. disturbing those in deep slumber causing many health problems. Heavy vehicles like containers and trucks carrying empty containers continue to rattle causing disturbances to those asleep. Also use of electronic equipment including loud radios cause havoc to ones sleep at all hours of the night.
When will those in authority effectively ban all offenders even with a stiff fine as a deterrent So far, zero has been done.

CR-Army match should be a thriller
The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between Army Sports Club and the CR and FC in the Dialog A Division league rugby match at Havelock Park should turn out to be a thriller today.
A mammoth crowd is expected at 4:00 pm to witness this grand game in the 2017/18 League Rugby Tournament.
Todays match should turn out to be a battle between Armys power-packed forwards and CR & FCs speedy three quarters.
CRs forwards especially seasoned campaigner and rolling maul expert Supun Warnakulasooriya, who is an excellent player in the loose along with Shemal Weerasekara, Charana Chamikara, Sashika Ashan, Udara Gayan and Omalka Gunaratne have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy.
In the set scrums CRs hooker Warnakulasooriya will have the edge against Army hooker Sameera Wickramanayaka while the line outs should be shared between Armys Nalaka Maduranga, Sampath Rosa and the CR duo of Shemal Weerasekara and Sashika Ashan.
CR have a fine set of speedy three quarters but their halves combination have to hit it off smoothly as they are playing together their second match for the season.
Also they should punch holes in the Army SC defence and to do that their full back Chanaka Chandimal should join the line to form the overlap.
The biggest threat to Army will be posed by winger cum captain Kavindu Perera with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Red Shirts have to make the maximum use of the good ball that comes their way through their halves combination of Avishka Heenpella and Tharinda Ratwatte and they must not delay their passes for their two hard running centres in strongly built Kushan Indunil and Rehan Silva to hit the gaps without being nailed by their opposite numbers.
They should also come up with a much better display than their first round game against Army as they have two strong runners in winger Reeza Rafaideen while on the open side wing they will have the services of diminutive captain Kavindhu Perera who has impressed with his sizzling runs in addition to an attacking full back in Chandimal.
Army SC beat CR by 24 points to 10 in the first round game at Longden Place and another thriller is on the cards today.
Teams:
CR & FC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Charana Chamikara, Gayan Jayamanna, Shemal Weerasekara , Shashika Ashan, Omalka Gunaratne, Avishka Heenpella and Tarinda Ratwatte , Reeza Rafaideen, Rehan Silva, Kushan Indunil , Kavindu Perera, Chanaka Chandimal

Fairfirst Insurance partners with All-Island  School Children Transport Association
Fairfirst Insurance's latest partnership was with the All-Island School Children Transport Association, an independent body of school van drivers whose objective is to raise awareness on the yellow colour school van concept and ensure the safety of the children travelling in them.
As a first step towards co-creating safer transport for children, Fairfirst Insurance recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the All-Island School Children Transport Association.
As part of this agreement, Fairfirst Insurance will provide the Association an exclusive Motor Insurance policy that protects their vehicle and most importantly provides financial assistance to the children, driver and the attendant travelling in the van in the event of an accident.
Niranjan Nagendra, General Manager Sales and Marketing at Fairfirst said, This is another milestone for us and a partnership that goes beyond just business. It serves as an opportunity for us to be a support system for self-employed van drivers and amplify efforts into creating safer school rides for kids and give their parents a peace of mind
Children are the most important segment in our society. With this initiative Fairfirst is planning to drive the message of road safety among society and inculcate the same message among members of the School Van Association, whilst protecting their self-employed lifestyle, said Nelum Weragoda, National Head Affinity Account Management.
Subsequent to the MoU signing, Fairfirst Insurance conducted a workshop on Saturday with 100 regional officers from the All-Island School Children Transport Association and Sales Agents from various Fairfirst Insurance branches island-wide. The program was structured to connect the regional officers from the Association with the respective regional Fairfirst Sales Agents from across the island.
The All-Island School Children Transport Association was formed back in 2000 and now has a membership of 27,000 school van drivers from all across Sri Lanka. The President of the Association Malshi De Silva said, We are very happy to be able to partner with Fairfirst Insurance. Thanks to them, not only is our source of livelihood given financial protection but so are the kids, which is the most important thing

On a forgotten Memorandum
There is a popular belief that Sri Lankans have short memories. We were reminded of it when in perusing some past documentation our attention was drawn by chance to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which rightfully claimed to be of historic significance. Judging by the contents of the MoU we observed that some of those who were bound by it have forgotten what it prescribed. Let us take some examples.
According to the MoU signed on August 21, 2015 the two parties agreed to form a Government which would undertake inter alia the following: the formulation of a new Constitution which would:
*reinforce regional representation*eliminate regional inequalities and reinforce*achieve rapid economic development*consolidate Sri Lankan identity*achieve national and religious reconciliation*safeguard inherent diversity of different nationalities and*further strengthen democracy and human rights.
Having agreed thus, it is strange that the SLFP leaders, including a signatory to the MoU General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake publicly saying that they are against the formulation of a new Constitution. This was also in spite of their agreement to constitute the entire Parliament as a Constitutional Assembly for the drafting of the new Constitution. It is a moot point whether there is a word other than Opportunism to describe this strange behaviour.
The period of the MOU has already expired. Yet nothing much has been achieved with respect to the above targets. Leaving aside rapid development the economy is without a strategic orientation. The contours of the so-called social market economy does not look any different from the neoliberal model introduced by President J R Jayewardene in 1977 and continued by successive administrations. Governments declared objectives of doubling foreign direct investments as well as the GDP in the short-term remain elusive dreams with declining foreign exchange remittances by expatriate workers, devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, worsening of the balance of payments etc. Shortage of labour and capital is bleeding the economy dry and low productivity makes our goods less competitive.
Presidential or Parliamentary elections
As far as national and religious reconciliation is concerned what is discernible is deterioration and not an improvement of the situation that existed at the time of the Presidential or Parliamentary elections. Communal forces, mainly supported by the so-called Joint Opposition with ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the helm have made headway among the population. Ethno-religious fundamentalist groups have sprung up and are growing in numbers, even receiving blessings and recognition from some official quarters. Untoward developments in Galle recently as well as the orchestrated attacks on places of religious worship of Muslims and certain Christian sects few months ago testify to this deterioration.
On the other hand, much remains to be done by way of providing transitional justice to those affected by the three decade-old fratricidal war. As far as reinforcing democracy is concerned draconian legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Regulations are still in force. The Government has also shown a tendency to resort to repressive measures to meet strikes as was shown during the strike of petroleum workers.
Despite the emphasis placed in the MoU on elimination of bribery and corruption the Government has not only failed to punish miscreants. What is worse is that the new government itself is tainted with large-scale corruption as evidenced by the Central Bank Bond scam. The much promised Audit Commission is yet to see the light of day.
The experience of the operation of the MoU clearly shows that the cohabitation of the SLFP and the UNP in the Government seems more a marriage of convenience rather than a principled union. Indiscipline inside the Cabinet of Ministers and in the Government Parliamentary Group in which the members of the SLFP and the UNP openly cross swords should have been nipped in the bud. How could a ruling dispensation which is unable to discipline its members ensure the rule of law in the country at large Failure to do so has by its own logic led to the present impasse when both parties are at their throats during the local government elections.
Independence of judiciary
The MoU speaks of enhancing democracy. However, in the composition of the Yahapalana Cabinet of Ministers, even persons who were defeated at the polls were given portfolios after appointing them as nationalist MPs contrary to the popular mandate. The situation was worse confounded when President Maithripala Sirisena accepted the SLFP presidency and began his own experiment of its democratic transformation sans any inner party discipline.
Though independence of the judiciary has improved under the Yahapalana rule, much remains to be done still. An environment in which judicial officers could independently perform their duties requires a better environment in which vested interest groups as well as those in high positions of power cannot even indirectly intimidate them. It is no secret that demonstrations by communal forces against the operation of transitional justice mechanisms such as the Office of Missing Persons, threats of street demonstrations in case of arrest of War heroes or high officials of the past regime could have an effect on the judiciary. It must be mentioned that of late the class bias of certain judicial decisions has become more conspicuous. Different persons charged with similar offences have been treated differently in a manner that smacks of class bias.
The MoU is open for review now. Its signatories will be deciding to continue or end it. Ending it would be much more honourable than extending and continuing the present acrimonious politics. Time has come for the ruling party/parties to get down to the serious business of governing instead of being engulfed in inter-party and intra-party feuds. Even an end to the MoU does not absolve the President or the UNP for abandoning the January 8th mandate.

French loan to uplift dairy industry
France has agreed to provide Sri Lanka with a 13.9 million Euro (Rs. 2514 million) soft loan towards the implementation of a milk processing project covering six processing centres.
This symbolises the the long-standing and cordial relations spanning nearly 45 years that exists between the two countries, the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media said in a press release yesterday.
This loan would facilitate the full refurbishment and renovation of six small scale milk processing cooperatives and organisations with the ability to pasteurize and sterilize nearly 4,500 Litres of milk per day, the release said.
The new equipment would enable the production of high quality milk through the process of computerised observation. It would boost the governments target of achieving self sufficiency in milk products by bridging the gap between demand and supply, drastically.
The MoU in this regard was signed by the Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge and Deputy French Ambassador Mrs. Isabelle Miscot at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry recently.

HR has active role to play in strategy - N*Able CEO
One of Sri Lankas most prominent technology services companies - N*Able hosted an HR talk, organised by SLASSCOM, on November 20, with CEO Peter DAlmeida addressing the audience.
The forum, organised for HR professionals of member organisations, zoned in on the critical role HR plays in todays knowledge industry, not only as a traditional function but also as a business partner.
In recent times, HR has grown and developed to become a standard business function, although there is much to be done in terms of using HR to drive business growth. As opposed to mere operational matters, HR has more of an active role to play in strategy as demonstrated by DAlmeida, including motivating and mobilising staff within a company and initiating a few, purposeful, high impact actions.
As DAlmeida pointed out in his speech, people companies in particular need to embody HR, not simply have a division segregated under the name. Merely establishing a department and personnel to run it is not all there is to it.
DAlmeida also stressed on the importance of focusing on the big picture in order to re-centre oneself for better company performance. For instance, it is necessary for HR to facilitate the leaders within companies to take time to interact with their team members, to resolve discord and confusion before chasing profit targets.
Interacting with and talking to the team regularly allows you to have a personal insight into the health of your human capital within the company, perhaps even diffusing any potentially disruptive situations before they have a chance to erupt.
HR also needs to lead the conversation with the shareholders and employees, understand their expectations to align talent strategy to the companys goals. This was illustrated in the example of Juniper Networks, where a potential risk was mitigated because the company decided to obtain input from all 900 employees working with the customer in question. This means that HR would have to constantly look at the big picture and align its efforts accordingly, instead of a conducting a series of events that would involve more check-box ticking and being an operational executor for company trips, engagement activities, leadership programmes, etc; instead, it needs to focus on initiatives that would create the biggest impact.
Perhaps the next most important thing is to change HRs approach to problem solving. Common practice is a knee-jerk reaction, solving issues with just past experiences. DAlmeidas suggestion was to love the problem, embrace the problem, study it, dissect it, and when you solve it, look at how you can prevent it from rearing its head again in the near or distant future. This is invaluable not just in the short-term, but also long-term.
In his closing remarks, DAlmeida concluded that this is how HR remains to be a very relevant part of the business. As businesses change with their own actions disrupting themselves especially in the technology sector, we should all aim to be relevant.

IDB Lakkam trade centre  celebrates 10th year
The Lakkam Trade Centre at Katubedde at the premises of the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon (IDB) which runs under supervision of Director Marketing and Media Sarath Udayasiri, completed 10 years on December 10.
The celebrations connected with establishment of the Trade Centre commenced with religious ceremonies including all night pirith ceremony.
The objective of Lakkam Trade Centre is to identify and promote marketable products of small and medium producers and provide the opportunity to market them in one place at an affordable price.
The IDB, a statutory body set up as the premier state organization is empowered by the Industrial Development Act No. 36 of 1969 to see to the improvement of the small and medium local industries.
The IDB comes under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
IDB came to the assistance of cottage industrialists who had no means of selling their products, by sourcing markets for them. It is also the responsibility of the IDB to see to the development of small and medium local industrial sector in Sri Lanka in line with the national policy on industries drawn and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
Lakkam was the answer and it commenced operation on December 11, 2007, in the present premises as the strong arm of the IDB.
Lakkam was entrusted with the responsibility of creating an affordable market for both customers and local industrialists and also assisting local industrialists to come up
to the position of winning a place not only in the domestic market but also in the export market.
Now, traditional Sri Lankan products come under 'Lakkam' logo to reach local and international markets.
A salient point is the direct dealing between the industrialist and Lakkam. We are not looking for high profit for the trade centre, but to give what is just and fair to the manufacturer and let customers too purchase what they want at an affordable price, said Lakkam Manager Indrani Palahiarchchi.
We also make it a point to inform the industrialists what the customers look for and the kind of products that have a demand in the market, depending on times and seasons. We push them to manufacture what is in demand. This would help profit
making easy. We make it a point to sell our goods at an affordable price to the customer without causing harm or injustice to the labour. Our purpose is not to make huge profit for the trade centre, but ensure to our small and medium entrepreneurs have access to market the goods they manufacture."

Interest rates intact
The Central Bank (CB) yesterday announced that the CB has decided to maintain policy interest rates at their present levels.
However, the CB will continue to cautiously monitor the developments in the economy and take necessary policy actions, if warranted, the Bank said.
The Sri Lankan economy grew moderately by 3.7% during the first nine months of 2017. Agriculture activities were adversely affected by both drought and flood conditions while Industry activities were driven by construction (2.6%), and manufacturing (2.4%). Services activities were supported by financial services (19.6%), telecommunication (19.5%) and insurance activities (10.9%).
The Central Bank said Sri Lankas inflation is expected to return to its desired level towards the end of the first quarter of 2018.
Speaking at the eighth monetary policy review media conference held at the Central Bank yesterday, Dr Coomaraswamy said that Sri Lankas economy continues to stabilize in broad terms and the ongoing stabilization process is being endorsed by the fact that the IMF Executive Board approved the third review of the Extended Fund Facility this year.
All this means there is a degree of confidence in the Sri Lankan economy and it seems to be improving as far as international capital markets, rating agencies and investors are concerned. There seems to be increasing confidence in the Sri Lankan economy around the world and the economy is in a reasonably good place at the end of this year.
The country is making progress on the stabilization process, the Governor said, adding that Sri Lanka needs to get growth up through economic reforms, not by artificially stimulating it, but by introducing appropriate macroeconomic policies.
On a number of fronts, things have improved in terms of private sector credit, imports, etc. But there are two other data points we will keep looking at, which are wages and inflation expectations. Going forward, we need to balance things out. In addition, we are beginning to see some recovery in oil prices, which should have a positive impact on remittance.
The monetary policy review further revealed that Sri Lankas headline inflation continued to remain at high levels due to high food prices, while core inflation decelerated in November 2017.
The Central Bank also noted that growth of credit to the private sector continued to decelerate in November 2017 as expected and y-o-y credit growth to the private sector further declined to 15.4% in November 2017 from 16.2% in October 2017.
The cumulative expansion in credit during the first 11 months of 2017 was Rs. 557.5 billion compared to Rs. 676.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2016.
The rupee depreciated by 1.9% against the US dollar during the year up to December 27.
The Central Bank purchased around US$ 1.7 bn (on a net basis) from the forex market. Cumulative net foreign inflows to the government securities market amounted to US$ 452.1 million (up to December 26) while foreign investments in the CSE (secondary market) recorded an net inflow of US$ 120.1 million up to December 27.
In October 2017, the deficit in the trade account contracted to US$ 752 million from US$ 868 million in October 2016.
During the first 10 months of 2017, cumulative trade deficit increased to US$ 7,591 million from US$ 6,994 million during the corresponding period of 2016.
Export earnings increased by 14.1 % (y-o-y) to US$ 976 million in October 2017. This was largely due to higher earnings from textiles and garments (7.9%), tea (26.1%), spices (47.9%), food, beverages and tobacco (48.2%), rubber products (15.4%) and petroleum products (28.4%).
Import expenditure increased marginally by 0.2 % (y-o-y) to US$ 1,727 million in October 2017. This low growth was mainly led by lower imports in sugar (-75.3%), crude oil (-44.5%), and machinery and equipment (-12.7%).
Workers remittances decreased by 7.9% to US$ 5,518.2 million during the year up to October 2017 compared to the increase of 3.5% observed in the corresponding period in 2016.

Japan grants Rs 90 mn for de-mining
Japans Amabassador in Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma said Sri Lanka is keen to achieve its target as a landmine free country by 2020.
He praised government for efforts taken to make Sri Lanka a landmine free nation.
The Ambassador said ample opportunities have been provided for the people in conflict affected areas to start a new life.
Japan extended Rs 90 million (US$ 604,731), in grant aid for humanitarian demining in Northern Sri Lanka, under its Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP).
The project for demining in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka in Assistance of Peace Building, rehabilitation and reconciliation will be implemented by Devlon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) and the grant was signed between Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma and DASH Programme Manager Ananda Chandrasiri at the Embassy in Colombo.
It is expected that this project will contribute to facilitating the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to make mine contaminated areas safe lands for internally displaced people to return and resume their livelihood activities.
Japan, welcoming Sri Lankas accession to the mine - ban treaty, has decided to extend this grant to contribute to its effort for being mine-impact free by the year 2020. Being the sole donor supporting all demining NGOs in Sri Lanka, the government of Japan has provided US$ 32 million for demining activities in the North and the East under its Grant Assistance schemes since 2003.
Chandrasiri appreciated the assistance extended by Japan to Sri Lankan mine action program MW, where DASH has been continuously funded by Japan since 2010.
Our government has further consolidated its commitment to the interminable peace in our country and in the entire world by having recently acceded to the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines, he said.
He further said that the Sri Lankan programmer is one of the most successful mine action stories in the world. Chandrasiri noted that DASH believes that the most important factor contributing to the peace building process of our country is the availability of livelihood opportunities to the young people, who were directly or indirectly affected by the conflict, for them to have not only a source of income but most importantly the recognition in our society is vital.

Lake Hotel Polonnaruwa expands to meet growing demand
The Lake Hotel Polonnaruwa, built at the end of the Parakrama Samudraya, will be expanding their facilities to meet the growing demands of both local and foreign guests due to rapid development taking place in Polonnaruwa.
Deputy General Manger Operations, Nihal Muhandiram, GFH Management Co. Pvt. Ltd, said that they first started with the expansion of their restaurant adding more covers. This would be completed by mid 2018.
In addition, the management is also looking at introducing a spa to add more facilities to the hotel.
Recalling the history, he said that the hotel was built in the 1960s and was earlier known as Hotel Seruwa and was then given to the Galle Face Hotels Group.
Since then, the 40 air-conditioned deluxe rooms with all modern amenities have undergone extensive renovation that respects both the unique location and historical significance in elegant simplicity, style and comfort.
There are 18 bedrooms on the ground floor that open out to the front lawn which is located in front of the Parakrama Samudraya, while 22 rooms are located on the first floor offering beautiful views across the lake and beyond. We have made the upstair rooms bigger by taking space from the balconies, he said.
Spread over three acres of landscaped garden, two swimming pools and large deck area, the hotel is a ten-minute walk to the beautiful Lake House, the second hotel of the group.
Muhandiram, an industry veteran having been in the industry for over 22 years and serving in the Maldives for two decades, said that one of the main plus points to the hotel is its location. You can see wild elephants 80% of the year and the scenery is much praised by the guest comments. Our boat tours and other excursions too are a major draw to the hotel.
He said that their main market is foreigners (80%) and they maintain around 70% of occupancy year on year.
Meanwhile, Senior Vice President at Galle Face Hotel Management Co. Ltd and Director of the The Gardiner Foundation (GF) of Sri Lanka, Chandra Mohotti said that as a commitment for this project they will allocate six rooms from the hotel for researchers who come to visit the project.(ss)

Mahanayake Theras call for peaceful election campaign
The various political parties and candidates are responsible in assisting the Elections Commission to hold a peaceful election devoid of violence, the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera said.
The candidates should also conduct a campaign which respects election laws and does not pollute the environment, the Asgiriya Chief Prelate said.
The Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera was speaking when former Kandy Mayor Raja Pushpakumara visited the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters yesterday.
Both Mahanayakes pointed out that since the elections are being held under the First Past the Post System, it gives a candidate a limited area to campaign in. They could go house to house campaigning or conduct small meetings instead of pasting posters all over and polluting the environment.
The Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter Venerable Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said the two main parties had shown by example how they can work together at the national level and thus party supporters and candidates should not create problems and fight each other at the local elections.
The Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera further observed that election violence not only impacted political candidates but also the public.
Therefore, party leaders should take the responsibility to ensure that their candidates contest a peaceful and fair election without violence and intimidation.

Making the elderly computer literate
Sri Lanka is facing a huge challenge to make its older generation computer literate, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said recently. Provisional statistics available at the Registrar Generals Department show that 43.476 percent of Sri Lankas present population of 21.444 million people are over the age of 35 years, while statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics show that only 15.45 percent (1.440 million) of them are computer literate.
Even the figures I have received from the ICT division of Parliament indicate that more than 80 percent of the MPs do not use laptop computers or ICT facilities available in Parliament. It is difficult to influence the older generation to adapt to new technology and that is why we launched the Tablet Project for schoolchildren, because we want to start young, the minister said.
With the increasing use of smart phones and launch of the Tablet Project for students, over ten thousand free Wi-Fi zones would be established and internet accessibility would be available island wide. As a result the Computer Literacy Rate (CLR) is expected to reach over 60 percent by 2020.
Children below 9 are more computer literate than adults over 50.
The data available shows that CLR is at its highest among youth in the 15 to 19 age group and lowest among elders in the 60 to 69 age group. It is a fact that there are more children in the 5 to 9 year age group who are more computer literate than elders above 50 years!
The graphs below tabulated with statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics presents the percentage breakdown of the CLR with respect to different age groups.
Graph-1
Figures released by the Department of Census and Statistics for the first half of 2017 confirm that the CLR in the island is rising as it has surpassed that of 2016. The figures released give the CLR in 2016 as 27.6 percent and the CLR in the first half of 2017 as 28.3 percent.
Definitions of Computer Literate Person (CLP) and Computer Literacy Rate (CLR)
As defined by the Department of Census and Statistics, a Computer Literate Person isa person aged between 5 and 69 years is considered as a computer literate person if he/she could use a computer on his/her own. (As an example if a five year old child can play a computer game on his/her own, then he/she is considered computer literate). The Computer Literacy Rate (CLR) isthe computer literate population (aged between 5 and 69) as a percentage within the respective domain.
The Computer Literacy Rate in Sri Lanka has improved through the years (from 2004 to the first half of 2017)
Graph - 2
Minister Harin Fernando also said that only people in the urban areas had access to computers initially, but after the last government introduced the Nenasala programme, people in the rural areas were able to make use of a computer. More people will have access to a computer and internet once the Tablet Project is launched. Under this project more than 200,000 A/L students will be provided with a tablet and internet connectivity next year (2018).
Under the same scheme, tablets will be provided to students from grade five to eleven with every three or four students having to share a tablet. In addition, under the Lanka Government Network (LGN) project 7,000 of the 14,000 Grama Sevaka Niladharis who were selected on a lottery basis will be provided with tablets within the coming weeks. These projects would have got off the ground earlier if those who were not selected through the lottery hadnt filed objections in court, the minister added
According to Minister Fernando, the people were not able to make the best use of the facilities available at the Nenasalas because they were not conveniently located and also, being a community based program, those who were tasked to maintain them had lost interest.
He also said that the government had established 60 percent of the free Wi-Fi zones promised but under the Tablet Project another 8,500 Wi-Fi zones will be set up in schools. Of the approximately 10,000 schools in Sri Lanka, 2,851 schools that have Advanced Level classes are to be provided with internet connectivity and three Wi-Fi zones each by April 2018. Each Wi-Fi zone would be covering a radius of over 300 meters.

People are using more smartphones and tablets than desktop computers
People are using more smartphones and tablets to access the internet rather than desk top computers, reiterated the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Technology. The statement is affirmed by figures released by the Department of Census and Statistics showing that more and more people accessed the internet using mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and mobiles rather than using the conventional desktop computer.
 Figures clearly show that although the urban population relied more on desktops and laptops to connect to the internet, the estate sector relied more on their smartphones and mobiles.

Neil Jayasekara who was the Manager (Refinery), assumed duty as the new Managing Director of CPC (acting) yesterday at the CPC premises in the presence of Minister Arjuna Ranatunga. Secretary to the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry, Upali Marasingha and CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga were also present on this occasion.
Jayasekara was the Manager (Refinery) for 7 years and he graduated as a mechanical engineer from the Peradeniya University. He was appointed as an engineer (A division) of the CPC on 03rd August, 1981, who later appointed as the Manager (Refinery) in 2010.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that they always allow their workers to rise to higher positions for the betterment of the CPC.
There should be a procedure in every institution, which allows their workers to rise to higher positions. Earlier, this procedure was not followed at the CPC, but we changed it.The Vision of the Yahapalanaya government is to make governmental institutions profitable. We were able to make Rs. 11billion as profits during my period I was the minister, because we allowed talented workers to rise to higher positions in the Ports Authority. We introduced this system to the CPC as well. We dont require popular workers. We require talented workers who are not only concerned about the position, but the betterment of the institution, Ranatunga added.
Secretary Upali Marasingha stated that the future responsibility of the CPC is to satisfy customers and it will be done successfully under the new managing director. Several dignitaries including the Additional Secretary Siripala Hettiarachchi also graced this occasion.

The Neonatal Transport Project of Sri Lanka won the Healthcare Innovation of the Year of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) South Asia Award 2107, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
He said 75 percent of infants die before five years. Another one-third underweight and premature babies die during the first month. Considering this, the Health Ministry introduced a safe transport mode for such vulnerable infants.
Medical officers and nurses with specialized training are appointed to carry out this service, which contributes immensely to reduce infant mortality. Sri Lanka records South Asia's lowest infant and maternal mortality rates at the moment, he said.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed health officials to expand this service to other parts of the country soon.
The service is now available in Colombo, he added.

Theres lots of talent in the squad I am 100 percent sure we can get better:
New coach Hathurusingha means business
The Sri Lankan cricketers got a taste of what lay ahead of them if they dont fall in line with Chandika Hathurusingha at the inaugural practice session they had with their new head coach at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Hathurusinghas no-nonsense approach has made him one of the most successful, respected and most sought after cricket coaches in the world today and he believes he has arrived at the right time to put Sri Lanka cricket back on the right track to success.
I am very satisfied to come back. I think it is the right time. I am really keen to come at this point and share my knowledge, Hathurusingha told the media at the end of practice yesterday.
I am pretty confident that we can do better. Theres lots of talent in this squad and that excites me. That is what encouraged me to take up this position. I am one hundred percent sure that we can get better, he said.
Kusal Mendis is one of the cricketers that have excited Hathurusingha because of the exceptional talent he possesses.
The 176 he scored against Australia was a stunning knock. Then again to score that 190 against Bangladesh he showed that he is capable of playing big knocks and batting for long hours, said Hathurusingha. Not just Kusal, there are many other talented players that excites me. That is why I said that taking this assignment was because of the talent they have.
Looking at the teams performances from the outside Hathurusingha said, There are quite a few things we are not doing right and that is why we are in this situation today. No doubt about the skill. There are so many cricketers that I can see who can be one of the top five players in the world. If they are not doing justice to their talent that means that a lot of things are going wrong.
I want to change the way they are approaching training. That is somewhere we can make a big impact. To build their confidence, we need to change the environment, how we train and how we communicate the amount of information going in and out. Those are the things that we need to work on quickly. I am really impressed with the enthusiasm they have shown. They are open for the suggestions that I am making. They were showing a lot of keenness, he said.
When it was pointed out by one of the media men that some players were not focused enough in their game, Hathurusingha replied, In future it is not going to happen. If someone wants to listen to music during training, he can pack his bags and go home. I cant talk on what happened in the past, I dont want to assume things. But I will get a first hand feel of what is going on. I have told them that preparation is the key. If we prepare well we are giving ourselves a good chance to do well.
FOCUSSING ON BASICS
Explaining the first days training Hathurusingha said, We were really focussing on our basics. We had four stations. One area we worked on playing spin, fast bowlers were doing spot bowling today and working on their stock ball. I was working with the batsmen trying to hit boundaries and trying to find out what their strengths are and giving them the freedom to express themselves. That is what we were doing and we will continue to do that over the next two days.
Prior to the practice session Hathurusingha had a chat with the players and he asked them whether they knew what they were doing We need to know what we are doing to get better. We need to do things consciously. Have a plan whats to be done and getting the best out every day. That is what I told that I am trying to do the basics first and then improve. There are a lot of positives and negatives. This is not the right forum to talk about it. I dont talk of negatives to the media.
Hathurusinghas first assignment as coach is taking the team to Bangladesh, the team he last coached, for a tri-one-day series, a series of two Tests and two T20 internationals.
It generates a lot of interest as I am going back to Bangladesh. Its going to be a challenge. We are not performing to our capabilities and Bangladesh is strong at home the last two years. Its a massive challenge for us. Zimbabwe the other team is on the way up. I know those two coaches who were under me. They are very capable. I expect a good competition, said Hathurusingha.
My challenge is not only Bangladesh, but we have to look at the larger picture. My challenge is to make most of the talent of this team. My target is the World Cup in white ball cricket. In red ball cricket my challenge is the next series. We pick sides accordingly. We need to identify players for the World Cup.
Explaining why he didnt want the Sri Lanka ODI squad to play in the ongoing Premier league cricket, Hathurusingha said, The only reason is that our domestic cricket at the moment is three days and we are playing with a red ball. I have only 12 days before we go on tour. Preparation is the key and when you train with red ball it is not ideal for white ball cricket.
MALINGAS PRESENCE AT PRACTICE
Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga was a surprise visitor to the practice sessions yesterday. Malinga who has not been selected in preliminary ODI squad to Bangladesh was seen bowling at practice.
You need to ask the selectors why he is there. He showed up today because there were no matches for NCC. He is coming tomorrow too. Anyone can come. He showed a lot of enthusiasm. I am happy with that. That is a good sign and sends a good message to other players as well, said Hathurusingha who intends using the knowledge and skills of past Lankan cricketers to fine tune the players.
Sangakkara has been a fine cricketer. His comments helped me when I went to Australia to get my footing. I will continue to get his expertise. I will invite him to help us. If I dont get him in I am doing a disservice. Not only him, I will also get Mahela (Jayawardene) and Murali to work with me on different occasions. We will see whether they have the time, Hathurusingha said.

## Title: No coal is clean coal

No coal is clean coal
Cabinet recently vetoed plans to build two new coal power plants in Sampur and Norochcholai but in reality the project has simply been shelved for the moment.
The resurfacing of coal, back into the energy mix however, has caused concern among environmental organizations in Sri Lanka and the following article looks at the implications of the controversial cabinet paper put forward by the Power and Renewable Energy Minister, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
We note inherent issues and contradictions in the recent joint cabinet paper (63/2017/PE) outlining the diversification of the energy mix in Sri Lankas long-term generation plan (LTGP).
Firstly, as per Government policy, the already approved LTGP for 2017-2038 currently in force cannot be changed until 2019; should the ministry need to introduce new proposals, it must wait until 2019 to do so and seek public comments on all such new proposals. The public, being an energy consumer, has a right to comment on the nature of what they are supplied with for consumption; therefore, giving public opinion prior to the tabling of changes is moreover a consumer right.
Strategic diversification of Sri Lankas energy mix
The cabinet paper notes in its Background section (1.0) that minimizing environmental impacts in the generation of energy is a priority for the country and reiterates that when deciding on the generation mix, protecting the environment is of utmost priority. As environmental organizations, we would like to note that this point is aligned with the assurances Sri Lanka made to the global community as party to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April 2016, including in the country position paper that, Sri Lanka will place her development agenda on a fossil fuel free target.
Nevertheless, later on, the cabinet paper contradicts its previous point, when it allocates 1,200 MW of new power generation to two new proposed coal power plants, ostensibly for the purpose of strategic diversification of the energy mix in order to ensure energy security.
Environmental organizations believe that using strategic diversification as a justification for the development of coal power generation in Sri Lanka is heinously damaging to the countrys pledges to the world and takes Sri Lanka a long step back in a world fast progressing past coal. In fact, the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which is part of the Conference of Parties, aims to grow its country membership to 50 by the next UN Climate Summit in 2018, in recognition of coals role as the biggest source of carbon emissions in the world.
Clean coal myth and the empty promise of carbon sinks
Regrettably, the said cabinet paper uses the term clean coal, a misnomer without a scientific definition. The term clean coal implies higher technologies in coal processing that removes carbon emissions, although in reality the term is merely subterfuge created and popularized by the coal industry itself, in response to anti-coal litigation. To the best of available knowledge and scientific research, CCS and other technologies that clean coal implies are still underdeveloped and this seriously undermines the possibility that coal power plants in Sri Lanka will be clean. SO2, NO, Lead, Mercury and Cadmium are some of the non-carbon pollutants of coal power and the technology for containing these is also at a nascent stage. Furthermore, highly efficient coal plants will still have higher carbon emissions than more environmentally friendly generation methods that the energy mix could include. Including new coal in our future energy mix for the sake of diversification is unjustified and only further reinforces our climate change risks and threatens our national climate action programme.
The last point of the cabinet paper, which purports to plan carbon sequestration through the creation of new carbon-sink forests, raises grave concerns, particularly in the current atmosphere of rapid deforestation raging through Sri Lanka and the lack of enforcement of environmental laws to mitigate it.
It would require planting approximately 36,000 hectares of new forest to sequester the carbon annually emitted by the two power plants. This fact is not mentioned in the cabinet paper. The clear lack of consideration for the feasibility of such a task casts doubt on the true intentions of the cabinet paper: as to whether the ministrys intention was to sequester carbon or to greenwash the coal power plants via an impractical promise to sequester their carbon emissions.
An intention to reclaim approximately 36,000 hectares of arable land for reforesting, if a genuine intention, should involve some thought into its location (in fact, in the recent past, the government of Sri Lanka claimed to target increasing forest cover by 3 percent, but in fact has lost 1% since then, according to our calculations). Moreover, a newly planted forest takes decades to mature into a carbon sink, and by that time, the world would have largely phased out coal altogether. In the interim period until the forest is ready, all carbon emissions from the two proposed coal power plants would contribute to climate change and to localized environmental damage. The cabinet paper does not touch on these problems. This solidifies our assumption that the proposal for sequestering carbon is merely a greenwash and the so-called clean coal would not be as clean as purported.
Environmental impact
It is evident that coal power plants have wreaked havoc on the environment and the people living around them, as can be seen by the many petitions filed by affected citizens against the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. Further, there is an ongoing court case against the Norochcholai coal power plant. Most importantly, the Central Environmental Authority has delayed issuing its environmental clearance. In addition, litigation was filed against the Sampur coal power plant in 2016 and the government decided to cancel the project due to the environmental and procedural concerns raised in this court case.
Coals unit-cost failure
The reason for coal power plants to be excluded from the current approved Least Cost LTGP is that its unit cost fails to meet the required standard. According to data from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the unit cost of the Norochcholai coal plant is Rs. 19. When environmental costs are added, it can be much higher than Rs. 20 per unit. Based on recent tenders received, the unit cost of a natural gas power plant is just Rs. 15. Therefore, it is clearly evident that coal power plants have lost their cost advantage.
Soorya Bala Sangramaya and renewables
The Cabinet paper undermines the Presidents recent initiative Soorya Bala Sangramaya which aims to promote non-conventional renewable energy that does not destroy our environment and sensitive eco-systems and this is essential towards preserving and enhancing Sri Lankas agriculture and tourism based economy. This new proposal for coal power will derail the governments policy on clean energy, which is already approved and is currently being implemented.
According to National Policy, Sri Lanka has set the goal of generating all its energy needs through renewable and local sources by 2030. In 2015, 50 percent of all energy was generated through renewable and local sources and the figure was well underway to push past 60 percent by 2020. At such a time, this said cabinet paper proposes to backtrack these achievements. Additionally, Sri Lanka has targeted producing its own natural gas by 2020, enabling it to achieve its energy needs without the need for imported coal.
Sri Lankas goal of generating all its energy via renewable and local sources by 2030 is already in progress and is an achievable goal. Therefore, pushing the goal a further 20 years into 2050 is pushing the country and its economy in reverse.
Sri Lanka has potential to generate 2,000 MW via renewable energy such as wind, dendro power and unlimited solar power. However, the CEB has blocked signing small power purchase agreements during the past 18 months. Further, the Sustainable Energy Authority has been unable to approve (due to CEB blocks) 1,200MW power generation by solar producers over the past two years.
According to the carbon budget estimate, all developed countries should stop burning fossil fuel by 2030 and developing countries have to stop burning fossil fuel by 2050. Therefore, this investment is climate unfriendly and against the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) we have submitted to the UNFCCC, which plans to reduce energy-sector emissions by 4 percent (9,173Gg; unconditional reduction) and 16 percent (30,210Gg; conditional reduction). The said cabinet paper clearly reneges on that promise.
Energy self-sufficiency
The governments goal is to become self-sufficient in energy by 2030. Pushing the dependence on coal towards 30 percent will derail this achievable goal as well and this goes against the authorities energy policies. Constructing expensive 1,200 MW coal power plants instead of natural gas plants will cost the economy Rs. 30.3 billion annually. Moreover, they will create a long-term coal import dependency, costing the country recurrent expenses in the billions. The pragmatism of such a move is seriously under question, especially given the alternatives available (e.g. solar power), which do not create such massive dependencies.
Hypocrisy of parallel development of coal power and carbon taxes
In its most recent budget, the Sri Lankan government introduced a carbon tax for motor cycles, cars and public buses, aiming to discourage carbon emissions by the public. For the government to also propose two new coal power plants and to thereby considerably raise its own emissions is hypocritical to say the least. Such contradictions gravely undermine the countrys official stance on carbon emission management and the mitigation of climate change, both in the eyes of the local public and the global community.
At a time when Sri Lanka is working towards the Sustainable Development Goals; when the president has already officially promised to aim for a fossil fuel free economy in its development agenda; and when the Sri Lankan public has mandated that achievement through this government, as Sri Lankas environmental organizations, we find this proposal for two new coal power plants surprising and strongly believe that they should not be allowed.

Public awareness on civil aviation sector dull - DG
Although there is a general awareness on most sectors among the public, there is a hardly any awareness on the civil aviation sector, Civil Aviation Authority Director General H. M. C. Nimalasiri said.
He said there should be more public awareness on the civil aviation sector for it to be popular among the public.
Prizes to the winners of the art competition organised by the Civil Aviation Authority celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Civil Aviation Authority were distributed at a ceremony.
The Authority has recorded a net profit of Rs. 900 million annually of which Rs.400 million is expenditure and the balance Rs.600 million deposited with the Treasury.
The Authority has sent Rs.3100 million to the Treasury since inception. The Authority had played an active role for the development of the sector. Plans are drawn to take over properties vested with the Authority in the future. Accordingly, taking over of the Batticaloa domestic airport is significant. We will take over all other domestic airports in the future as well, he added.

Raigam Group looking at listing
The diversified Raigam Group will look at a Colombo Stock Exchange listing soon, said its Chairman Dr. Ravi Liyanage.
He said that they have several companies and would look at one of them to be listed. We also want to rest and give more administrative powers to new people who would get involved in the company.
He said that Raigam Wayamba Salterns PLC (RWSL) is already listed and they were planning a rights issue. However due to delays which I do not want to go into detail, we have now decided to fold up this.
The Chairman recalled that over a decade ago salt was imported despite Sri Lanka being an island. We requested the government for protection and tax for salt imports and when this guarantee was given, we invested in salterns and today we are proud to say Sri Lanka is self sufficient in salt. We are also happy that we were one of the pioneers to lead Sri Lanka towards self sufficiency in salt.
He said that today over 10,000 are dependent on the industry as there are also several individuals who manufacture salt as a cottage industry.
Asked if they were looking at exports, he answered in the negative and said that they cannot compete with India. Their labour is cheap and most importantly their climate is ideal to produce salt.
He however said that today chlorine, chemicals to manufacture soap and HCL are being imported and since there will soon be a surplus of salt they will look at manufacturing these in Sri Lanka.
He also predicted that soon the country will move in to use of powered salt and move away from crystal salt like in European countries as it is more hygienic.
Raigam Group is the countrys second largest salt producer after the state among the seven major players. It was a pioneer to begin production of Pure Vacuum Dried (PVD) salt at their plant in Palavi in Puttalam.
CEO Ganaka Amarasinghe said that the company profits too are on the increase and their turnover was around Rs. 340 million.
Director Dr. Sampath Amaratunga said they will also look at diversifying to the tourism sector and try to introduce tourism near salterns which have unique scenic locations especially in the Eastern Province.

Sri Lanka head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said that he intends using a renowned psychologist to work with the Sri Lanka team at different intervals of time to identify the players.
As a first step towards obtaining his services a questionnaire comprising 40 questions prepared by the psychologist Dr Phil Jauncey was handed to the players to reply. Dr Jauncey is widely regarded as Australias foremost Performance Psychologist.
I have worked with him for the last four years. He is coming on January 3 and spend ten days with us. I intend to bring him from time to time. Ideally bring him down four times a year depending on his availability. The questionnaire was prepared by him to understand players and profiling of players, explained Hathurusingha.
Dr. Phil Jauncey is from Brisbane, Australia. I met him for the first time with Sydney Thunder. Mike Hussey introduced me to him. He had been using him as a personal psychologist. He may be on some tours as well. It will help me to identify players. He has been with Australian Olympic team and worked with Cricket Australia when John Buchanan was their coach, he said.
Hathurusingha said that although he has been given the freedom to choose his own support staff for the time being he intends to go with the present lot. At the moment, I am going to work with what I have. If I feel that I need some additions, I have the opportunity to add someone.  ST

Rubber-Rice Pact an 'agreement  of friendship
The 65th anniversary of the signing of historic Rubber-Rice Pact between the then Ceylon and China in 1952 was celebrated on a grand scale under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Embassy of the People's Republic of China, Charge dAffaires Pang Chunxue, recently.
At the outset it was brought to the attention of invitees that this historic Rubber-Rice Pact was signed 65 years ago by the then Sri Lankan Minister of Commerce, the late R.G. Senanayake and the then Chinese Commerce Minister, the late Lie Renmin.
The participation of the grandchildren and great grandchildren of both former Sri Lankan and Chinese commerce ministers were the significant moment at the event. Speaker Jayasuriya praised the family members of the former Chinese Commerce Minister for visiting Sri Lanka all the way from China to grace the occasion
Making the welcome address Speaker Jayasuriya highly valued the signing of this Rubber-Rice Pact at a time when there was a severe shortage of rice in Ceylon while the Chinese government too needed good quality rubber to help their industrialists.
He mentioned that during the period our country depended on rubber, while China had a surplus of rice and this situation encouraged the former Minister R.G. Senanayake to sign this historic Rubber-Rice agreement between the two countries.
He said this agreement could be regarded as the longest trade agreement and therefore this could be recognized as an 'agreement of friendship. He also highlighted this historic Rubber-Rice Pact not only helped both nations to fulfill their economic aspirations but also strengthened the long-lasting friendship between two nations and proudly said this friendship will be last long in the years to come.
Speaker Jayasuriya said, Going back to the history, our ancient Ceylon had a close rapport with China for a record period of over 1,000 years from the time the great Phahian Thera stepped into our historical Land and since then the unbroken friendship among Sinhalese and Chinese prospered to a greater extent.
He also reminded that in addition to the Rubber-Rice Pact these two countries have now focused attention towards importing and exporting various other goods.
Speaker Jayasuriya also highlighted various other projects carried out with the assistance of Chinese government such as the Veyangoda and Pugoda textile mills, Ginganga project, the Colombo Port City, highways, Nelum Pokuna, etc.
He also commended the Chinese government for gifting the BMICH auditorium.
Embassy of the People's Republic of China, Charge dAffaires Pang Chunxue also valued the Rubber-Rice Pact and said China had over 1,000-year friendship with Sri Lanka. The ceremony ended with the exchanging of plaques between Speaker Jayasuriya and Charge dAffaires Pang Chunxue.

Sand mining on the rise in Dambulla District
Illegal sand mining have increased along the channels in Galewela and Dambulla areas, causing severe damage to the environment. But the relevant authorities have been observing a stoic silence, the public alleged.
Malawaoya, Kalugaloya, Beligamuwaoya and Welamitiyawaoya in the Galewela area too are facing a similar state, while Mirisgoniyawa and Dambuluoya channels were also undergoing the same problem.
According to the public, certain government officials are said to be involved in this racket, which has turned to be their main income. Therefore, illegal sand mining is unable to be curbed.
A few persons have been able to obtain permits for this purpose. But the majority of those involved in saand mining, have no permission.
They further said that the officers take action to implement rules when a poor person seeks permission to obtain sand for his domestic activities, but maintain silence to those who are involved in illicit sand mining, the public complain
So then, the government should take strict action against this for the benefit of the poor.

Due to the introduction of a new starting light system (Tree), lack of coordination, lethargy of competitors in responding to the marshals call, spectators risking their safety by lining the tire walls, canines on the track and a controversy between riders and officials compelled the organizers to stop the racing at 7pm.
Only Sithara Peiris champion of the cars 1001 up to 1300cc event had the honor of receiving his award from Anoma Jayampathi, Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Air Force Seva Vanitha Unit at Katukurunda while the other winners and runner-ups were awarded their trophies at a ceremony held in Colombo.

Tea sector trailblazer Eranda wins 'National Young Entrepreneur of the Year
Starting a business is always a daunting task for any entrepreneur. For Eranda Aberathna, Managing Director, U.H.E. Exports (Pvt) Ltd, success comes from the courage to dream big.
Launching the company just three and a half years ago with only himself and a graduate-assistant, he was eager to prove the potential he saw in a niche tea market. Today with over 30 employees, Eranda has, through innovation, hard work, dedication and an unflagging entrepreneurial spirit. built a successful and thriving business that has become a leading light nationally, challenging the status quo.
Celebrating his achievements and inspirational entrepreneurial journey, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka recently presented Eranda the prestigious Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2017  National Winner, as well as the Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2017 for the Uva Province.
Reminiscing on the early days, Eranda said, Despite having the opportunity to join the family-owned business I decided to start my own company. Venturing into an industry which has reached maturity, we felt like a teardrop in the ocean but soon realised focusing on large quantities would not bring us success especially for a start-up. After continuous research and hard work we found a niche market and focused all our efforts to grow this opportunity.
Today as a result, the company has grown exponentially from a small start up to a large scale company within three and a half years  even when the market for Ceylon tea has witnessed a decline. Additionally, we have been able to strategically create new opportunities in a highly competitive environment while achieving patents and industrial design certifications, he added.
Today, Halp Tea, under the guidance and leadership of Eranda, is among the very few manufacturer-exporter entities in Sri Lanka, who produces and directly exports premium factory-fresh single origin teas.
In 2016, Halp Tea won an impressive five National Gold awards at the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) Awards and one Silver for Most Innovative Exporter earning the mantle as the most awarded Ceylon tea company for the year.
Commenting on this exceptional achievement Eranda said, We continue to trail blaze in the tea export arena, seeking new opportunities within the Ceylon tea industry. We are strongly committed towards research and development and have been able to accomplish several patents and industrial design certifications within a very short time. Our hard work was appreciated when we were presented the overall Silver award for the Most Innovative Exporter in Sri Lanka and five national exports awards showcasing our continued commitment.
UHE Exportss Halp Tea is distributed to major world tea markets in the Middle East, Japan, South Korea, China, France and other European countries. The company has an office in Kuwait focusing on the Gulf and Middle Eastern markets.
Despite having a deep-rooted involvement in the industry as a result of his family-owned tea and leisure businesses, Eranda has not rested on his family's laurels.
The company has also expanded its operations through a Halp Tea airport outlet.
This achievement showcases his entrepreneurial character as only six tea companies can represent Ceylon tea in the airport.
Additionally, the launch of the Ceylon Tea Supermarket in the heart of Colombo catering to local and overseas visitors who seek a unique tea experience in another significant milestone.
Tea lovers and connoisseurs can also experience the brand through the Halp Tea Center in Kandy, the Halp Tea Center and Restaurant in Ella and other islandwide outlets including the more renowned ones such as the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Odel Ward Place, Legends, etc,.
While forging ahead, Eranda is conscious of the importance of giving back to the community. Since the company was founded, an annual event has been the provision of dry rations to needy communities in rural areas of the country.
Many communities have benefited and grown along with the companys success through the provision of jobs for employees, providing assistance to needy families, the construction of homes, contributing to flood affected families countrywide, etc.
We started as a small scale company and have now grown to over Rs 100 million turnover within three and a half years. Our suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders in our value chain have also grown and achieved success together with us. The nation too benefits as we continue onward in our entrepreneurial journey, Eranda said.

Tillerson defends foreign policy record
US: The United States top diplomat defended his countrys foreign policy record on Wednesday, saying progress had been made in the last year to rein in North Koreas nuclear ambitions and to counter the immense challenges posed by Russia, China and Iran.
In an opinion piece in the New York Times, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said some 90 percent of Pyongyangs export earnings had been cut off by a series of international sanctions after the Trump administration abandoned the failed policy of strategic patience.
Tensions have escalated dramatically on the Korean peninsula this year after the isolated but nuclear-armed regime staged a series of atomic and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests -- and as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un traded personal insults.
Washington wants North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and has spearheaded three rounds of UN sanctions against the isolated regime, restricting crucial exports of coal, iron, seafood and textiles from the cash-starved state.
Pyongyang has hit out at those sanctions, calling the latest round an act of war, and has vowed to never give up its nuclear programme.
In his piece Tillerson said a door to dialogue remains open for Pyongyang but warned until denuclearization occurs, the pressure will continue.
At the same time he called on China -- Pyongyangs only major ally -- to do more to pressure North Korea.
Trumps administration has been dogged by allegations his campaign team colluded with Russia to help him win last years election.
Addressing relations with Moscow, Tillerson said the Trump administration had no illusions about the regime we are dealing with and that they were on guard against Russian aggression.
But he added that Washington needed to recongize the need to work with Russia where mutual interests intersect citing Syria civil war where the two countries have backed opposing sides but pushed for peace talks.
On Iran he struck a less conciliatory tone.
The flawed nuclear deal is no longer the focal point of our policy toward Iran, he warned. We are now confronting the totality of Iranian threats. He also defended his cuts to the State Department and USAID budget, saying they were designed to address root problems that lead to inefficiencies and frustrations.
Critics say Tillersons first year in office has seen scores of key diplomatic posts go unfilled, embassies hampered by cuts and many veteran staff leave the foreign service altogether.- AFP

UNP's 'evil period' over: State Minister Senasinghe
The evil period encountered by the UNP and the country is now over. This evil period was brought about by the miserable person known as Prabhakaran who destroyed the economic nerve centres of the country during a 30-year war, Development Strategies and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
He was addressing a UNP rally held at Kurunduwatta in support of UNP candidates led by Anuradha Ratnayake contesting the local council elections in the Nawalapitiya electorate, recently.
Prabhakaran took the precious lives of nine national leaders including Ranjan Wijeratne, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali. The country was deprived of its national leadership so much so that the UNP did not have a male candidate to contest the 1993 Presidential election, he said.
State Minister Senasinghe said Sri Lanka was only second to Japan with regard to economic strength at the time it gained Independence in 1948. Prabhakaran who realised this, thought that the best way to win the war was to undermine the country's economy by destroying its economic nerve centres. Apart from this tragic downfall encountered by the UNP, it continued until its victory at the 2015 General Election. Now the UNP is on a winning trail and it is certain to obtain a convincing victory at the forthcoming local council election, he added.
He said the country is in a severe debt trap when the UNP-led Yahapalanaya government took office in 2015. But in spite of this, a series of steps were taken to grant economic relief to the people.
The price of petrol was reduced from Rs. 175 to Rs. 125 per litre while kerosene oil price was decreased from Rs. 100 to Rs. 49 per litre. LP gas was reduced from Rs. 2,650 to Rs. 1,400 per cylinder. Public servants were granted a Rs. 10,000 salary increase with a corresponding increase to private sector employees. Pension anomalies had also been corrected. Although benefits of the economic development programs launched by the government would take time to bring dividends to the people, all possible steps had been taken to uplift and strengthen the private sector.
Parliamentarian Ananda Aluthgamage, former Provincial Council member Peter Gahalagedara and UNP candidates contesting the local elections were also present.

West Indies Pollard out of  T20s for personal reasons
WELLINGTON: The West Indies have suffered a further setback on their New Zealand tour Thursday with team officials confirming premier all-rounder Kieron Pollard had pulled out of the Twenty20 matches for personal reasons.
It is the second change for the tourists, who have already had to replace the injured Ronsford Beaton.
The West Indies have yet to win a match in New Zealand, having lost both Tests inside four days and been comprehensively outplayed in the three one-day internationals.
Left-handed batsman Shimron Hetmyer will replace all-rounder Kieron Pollard, who is unavailable due to personal reasons, Cricket West Indies said in a statement.
Left-arm fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell will replace pacer Ronsford Beaton, who has been forced to return home with a side strain. However, despite New Zealand dominating the Tests and ODIs, coach Mike Hesson expected the West Indies to provide tough opposition in the Twenty20s, the format in which they are world champions.
Theyre certainly an exciting batting line-up, some middle order players whove obviously done pretty well in the IPL and the likes of (Samuel) Badree coming to the T20 gives plenty of experience in that bowling group, Hesson said.
Theyre certainly a challenge for us. Tim Southee will captain the New Zealand side in place of Kane Williamson who is being rested for the first game of the three-match series on Friday. AFP
