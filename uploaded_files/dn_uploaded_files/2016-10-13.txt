Building harmony and reconciliation

Mahinda College, Galle and Nittambuwa Girls won the Championship at the Murali Harmony Cup held in the North for the fifth time. Nittambuwa girls won the Championship for the second time which would eliminate them automatically from the Championship.
The Murali Harmony Cup started with a bang with former Sri Lankan skipper and star batsman Kumar Sangakkara opening the ceremony in style with a flowing speech commending the organisers of the tournament for the successful manner in which they have attracted over 24 teams (16 boys teams and 8 girls teams) with increasing interest in the tournament where the organisers have gone out of their way in helping the rural cricketer come to the fore and display his talent which has increased the popularity of the tournament.
This initiative started by the Foundation of Goodness in collaboration with past greats Muthiah Muralitharan, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara has grown from strength to strength and increased by leaps and bounds. Coach of St. Josephs Roger Wijesuriya was thrilled with the manner in which the tournament has helped those at the grass root level.
One problem with the tournament is that the Sri Lanka Cricket was not sanctioning the tournament and this was a hindrance. Sangakkara said that there is too much politics in sports and that one would be amazed at the manner in which Sri Lankans have a culture of belittling others where each one thinks that he is better than the other. He also said that there is so much of social media being used to throw mud at each other but this doesnt apply to the Murali Harmony Cup of course where one is overwhelmed by the manner in which teams have a sense of camaraderie and oneness and also the very unusual manner in which the matches are played is something to behold as the teams play with a sense of dedication and purpose coached by the best in the island.
This tournament was started by the Foundation of Goodness and was initiated in the South by Muthiah Muralitharan and subsequently was shifted to the North as the tournament grew in size and was sponsored by more companies. The organisers were of the opinion that taking the tournament to the North augurs well for the game and gave the teams more exposure and the chance to overcome the fears that lesser teams have with the teams of the so called elite sides that they fear at times. It is rather sad that the lesser teams seem to undergo when they face the stronger sides.
Sangakkara is very much involved with the promotion of the game and is a livewire along with cricketers of the caliber of Muralitharan and Jawawardene and having a corporate sense he is an inspiration to the young folk in the game. Being a national treasure he is an instant draw with the juniors.
At the press conference Jayawardene said that Nalanda would probably go on and win the tournament but they did not.
It is a rare opportunity, emphasized the media manager. The Colombo schools think that they are elite and the final objective is to respect each other. This tournament had one team from the South, a Seenigama team and a team from Jaffna. the matches were limited to two venues and Matale. Most of the cricketing talent was from the South and since there was a lack of exposure it is now five venues in four towns.
The geographical location is not a barrier. The theme is to be United in the Spirit of cricket. And this has been strongly emphasized. More than that it should take something out of them and create inter-rivalry. It is a rare opportunity, emphasised the media manager.
Former Sri Lankan skipper Michael Tissera is of the opinion that this is a fantastic tournament. He was enjoying the matches and the tournament has grown from strength to strength.
How do you think that we could improve the tournament It is nice to see teams from all the over the country.
He was last here two years ago.

Dayasiri backs  SLC performance  evaluation

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara was of the view that the decision SLC has taken to pay national cricketers according to their performance is very appropriate. During a discussion with BBCs Colombo reporter, the minister expressed surprise over some payments to national cricketers by SLC. There is a player who has earned Rs 57 million last year. When calculated, SLC has payed Rs 57,000 for a single run he scored in the year. Another player got Rs 73 million which amounting Rs 26,000 for a single run. he further said.
Jayasekara said that the SLC officials are also members of cricket clubs and they always try to include maximum number of players from their clubs in the national side. This has happened in the past as well. If the new mechanism serves unfair to national players, I will attend to their grievances, he said.
Performances of some players are way behind the expected level. But irrespective of their performance they earn big money from SLC. Players must have the attitude that they must do their job well to earn big money. There will be an inquiry into the allegations leveled against contracted players.
The minister also revealed that a person is managing few cricketers in the national side and a player who did not wish to take him as his manager was pulled out from the team.

Pink-hot favourites Pakistan play their 400th Test: Asias first day-night Test starts today

DUBAI, Wednesday: In-form Pakistan are ready to launch a pink-ball spin assault on struggling West Indies when they do battle in Asia`s first day-night Test from Thursday in Dubai.
Pakistan have been on a roll since their 2-2 series draw in England in August, which briefly lifted them to number one position in world cricket`s Test rankings for the first time.
Arch-rivals India relegated Pakistan to number two with recent victory over New Zealand but Misbah-ul-Haq`s men have a prime opportunity to close the gap in the three-match series against the West Indies and are strong favourites.
Pakistan captain Misbah said he was relishing the prospect of a day-night Test, where play will be from 3:30 pm to 10:30 pm (1130 GMT to 1830 GMT) with two breaks of 30 minutes, in what is nominally a "home" series for Pakistan.
"It`s exciting because I think the future belongs to day-night Tests," said Misbah, whose team will be missing senior batsman Younis Khan, recovering from dengue fever.
Pakistan have included in-form batsman Babar Azam, 21, for his first Test after he racked up 360 runs during the one-day series against the West Indies.
But misfiring openers Mohammad Hafeez and Shan Masood have been axed from the squad which levelled the four-match Test series against England.
The West Indies, routed by Pakistan 3-0 in both Twenty20 and one-day series preceding the Tests, come in as clear underdogs.
Coach Phil Simmons, who guided them to the World Twenty20 title in April this year, was sacked prior to this tour after the team lost 2-0 to India in a four-match series in August.
But captain Jason Holder said the West Indies -- down in eighth in the Test rankings -- are ready to bounce back.
"We have some new faces in Tests so we will do our best," said Holder.
Experts, however, see Pakistan`s spin duo of Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar proving too much for the spin-wary West Indian batsmen, especially in the unfamiliar day-night format with the pink ball and under lights. Australia staged the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in Adelaide last November -- the first in Test cricket`s 140-year history.
The innovation has been brought in to address the dwindling crowds in Test cricket -- floodlit matches encourage those at work during the day to attend -- and has met with initial success.
The Adelaide Test attracted 123,000 spectators and an average television audience of two million.
But players from both sides complained about the pink balls movement and durability, as well as the difficulty batsmen faced seeing it under lights.
Pakistan have accumulated more experience than the West Indies under lights, adopting the coloured ball concept six years ago for the final of their domestic premier first-class tournament.
Pakistan have more than one reason to do well in Dubai -- as well as grabbing a slice of Test history the match is their 400th Test since playing their first in India in 1952.
A win will not only cap a historic occasion but will also give Pakistan momentum for their pink-ball Tests in Australia in December.
The remaining two Tests against the West Indies will be in Abu Dhabi (October 21-25) and Sharjah (October 30-November 3).
Teams (from): Pakistan: Misbah-ul-Haq (captain), Azhar Ali, Sami Aslam, Asad Shafiq, Babar Azam, Sarfraz Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Rahat Ali, Sohail Khan, Imran Khan
West Indies: Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite (vice captain), Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Shai Hope, Leon Johnson, Alzarri Joseph, Marlon Samuels, Jomel Warrican
