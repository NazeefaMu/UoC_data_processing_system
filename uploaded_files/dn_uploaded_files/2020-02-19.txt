India's bird population 'going down sharply'
Much of India's bird population has sharply declined in the past few decades, according to a major study.The State of India's Birds report relied on the observations of more than 15,000 birdwatchers who helped assess the status of 867 birds.It found the greatest decline in the numbers of eagles, vultures, warblers and migrating shorebirds.But the population of peafowl, the national bird, has increased significantly.Hunting and habitat loss are the two main reasons behind the decline. "Collision" with electricity lines, according to the study, is a "prime current threat" to birds.The report, the first comprehensive study of its kind, made two assessments: the drop in bird population over the last 25 years, and over the last five years.(Source: BBC News)

Oppositions voter base will drop at General  Election
The United National Party-led Opposition will see a sharp drop in its voter base, from its current 5,500,000 to 2,800,000, at the upcoming General Election, Roads and Highways Minister Johnston Fernando said. Moreover, it has grown even weaker over the past few months owing to internal rifts, he added. He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the project to renovate 100,000 kilometres of roads in the country, which was held today in Galaha. The renovation of the Peradeniya  Galaha  Delthota  Rikillagaskada road in the Kandy District was commenced under the patronage of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, today. The Opposition is still trying to choose a symbol for the upcoming election and its Leader, Sajith Premadasa, is even willing to accept Premiership under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but that will not come to pass. Mahinda Rajapaksa will continue to be the Prime Minister, even after the next election, Minister Fernando said. The public believes that Sri Lanka will become a developed country within the next five years, he said. The minister also said that once the roads from Peradeniya to Rikillagaskada are renovated, residents in the surrounding areas, especially farmers, will be able to reach Kandy in less than an hour. At present, the journey takes 2.5 hours.
