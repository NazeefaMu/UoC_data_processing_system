Govt will abide by SAITM Court Judgment
The government and other litigants will abide by the Court Judgment on the SAITM university issue, that is to be delivered on January 30, Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday. He said the government would accept the judgment on the SAITM that was set up by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government even with a loan of Rs. 600 million granted by the government for its construction.
The minister made these observations yesterday in response to two questions raised by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake during round of questions for oral answers.
He said the government accepts the fact that there is a shortage of lecturers of the permanent academic staff in the University of Moratuwa and the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, but cover up lectures with the support of visiting lecturers.

Alma mater, the sacred seat
The alma mater is defined in the OXFORD ADVANCED LEARNERS DICTIONARY as the university, school or college that somebody attended. In the highly literate modern society everyone has his own alma mater to be proud of. As illiteracy is a thing of the past and the schoolmaster is abroad, alma mater is synonymous with everyones life. In other words, if anyone has a sacred bond to be honoured and respected that is his or her alma mater. Alumni is another word in the same family and it denotes male or female former stu dents, as a whole, of an institution. Alumnus means a male former student of a school, college or university while his female counterpart is alumna. The few words given above envelope the whole human world and they make the people inescapable from their sacred obligations towards them. The alma mater is a sacred cow, in a nutshell.
It is very great that some alumni hold their alma mater in high esteem. They remember OXFORD, CAMBRIDGE , HARWARD ,SOBOURNE, MONASH, and some other higher seats of learning with utmost respect . In our own soil, great gentlemen and sterling ladies of yesteryear spoke high of their places of study such as ROYAL,ANANDA ,NALANDA,RICHMOND ,MAHINDA, RAHULA ,TRINITY ,MALIYADEWA, HINDU COLLEGE and also a lot of other reputed schools, the list could go to several pages.
For all of them their alma mater was a sacred cow. In this day and age, it seems nothing is sacred. The bounden duty of the past pupils towards their place of study has been eroded and this piece f writing is a clarion call to the nation to nip it in the bud. We are duty-bound to arrest this downward trend.
As the world in general and Sri Lanka in particular are passing through an unprecedented period of moral paralysis , these institutions are threatened with an insurmountable threat in their existence. The very same institutions that did the icing of the gentlemen in the calibre of the late S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake, Rajan kadiragarmer , Lalith Athulathmudali , Karaka of India of I GO WEST fame at the international level are also confronted with the latest syndrome of ill decorum of some alumnus. Politics and international liberal trade together with war crimes and cyber attacks are
Connected with other global phenomenon have brought these sacred institutions irreparable damage.
The writers concern here is to focus the attention of the rational minded general public how the past students of the institutions are bringing disgrace to their sacred cows. The decorum of the parliamentarians of the yesteryear deserves our encomium not in uncertain terms. The HANSARD is their history.
The HANSARD was our resource book for learning refined English during our school career. Our great teachers respectfully recommended the Hansard for us to learn English.
In todays context if by misfortune a teacher recommends todays Hansard it would be a hazard. The irony is that the modern English teacher might not know whether such a document is available. Ignorance is bliss.
The million dollar question is that why on earth these parliamentarians dont think of their alma mater when they open their foul mouths to sling mud on their colleagues at the very precincts of the sacred portals. They spoil the sanctity of the august assembly and the sacred well and fill their stomaches at the parliament canteen together showing their back to the taxpayer who maintain them. If my memory serves me correct , honourable prime minister who is regarded as a voracious reader reminded them to use the library to improve their knowledge.
They themselves passed a huge slice of the annual budget for the parliamentary library. Their alma mater might have not inculcated the reading habit in them. They have become merely dried pumpkins.

Among the outlawed
A recent conversation with a former Vice Chancellor invited back to institutionalize gender equity with our University system led to this article. The conversation extended to the menace of ragging including sexual overtones directed at victims.
Ragging becomes news randomly though an ever present phenomenon in seats of higher learning. Bullying in school is the seed that germinates into ragging in colleges. Some schools have rightly outlawed bullying with severe consequences for offenders.
During the financial year 2015-16, Ministry of HRD allocated a sum of Rs. 5 crore for Media Campaign to UGC for undertaking a publicity campaign against ragging in Higher Educational Institutions in the country on various activities, including preparing and broadcasting of TVCs on Anti-Ragging by Doordarshan, making of films by NFDC, coverage through FM Radio and printing and mailing of posters by DAVP and broadcasting on All India Radio by Prasar Bharati.
The UGC had also announced a competition for students, teachers and general public for wide publicity and promotion of anti-ragging measures which include poster designing, logo/icon/slogan designing and essay competition. Three hundred and ninety cases of ragging, including death or maiming of students, were reported in different colleges of the country during the last year, including the States of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh which have reported higher number of cases.
Report of the Supreme Court
The Raghvan Committee constituted by the Indian Supreme Court has, mentioned the following types of ragging :-psychological, social, political, economic, cultural, and academic dimensions; acts that prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of a student; acts of financial extortion or forceful expenditure burden put on a junior student; physical abuse; act or abuse by spoken words, emails, snail-mails; incidents of ragging are low in institutions which promote democratic participation of students in representation and provide an identity to students to participate in governance and decision making within the Institute bodies.
Order of the Supreme Court
Primary responsibility for curbing ragging rests with academic institutions themselves since this impacts the standards of higher education, incentives should be available to institutions for curbing the menace and there should be disincentives for failure to do so, enrolment in academic pursuits should not immunize any adult citizen from penal provisions of the laws of the land.
Ragging needs to be perceived as failure to inculcate human values from the schooling stage, behavioural patterns among students, particularly potential raggers, need to be identified, measures must deter its recurrence, media and the civil society should be involved in this exercise.
Recommendations to implement without delay
Punishment to be exemplary, justifiably harsh to act as a deterrent against recurrence. Any failure on the part of the institutional authority or negligence or deliberate delay in lodging the FIR with the local police shall be construed to be an act of culpable negligence on the part of the institutional authority. If any victim or his parent/guardian of ragging intends to file FIR directly with the police, that will not absolve the institutional authority from the requirement of filing the FIR.
Courts should make an effort to ensure that cases involving ragging are taken up on a priority basis to send the correct message that ragging is not only to be discouraged but also to be dealt with sternness.
In the prospectus to be issued for admission by educational institutions, it shall be clearly stipulated that in case the applicant for admission is found to have indulged in ragging in the past or if it is noticed later that he has indulged in ragging, admission may be refused or he shall be expelled from the educational institution. The committee constituted pursuant to the order of this court shall continue to monitor the functioning of the anti-ragging committees and the squads to be formed. They shall also monitor the implementation of the recommendations to which reference has been made above.
Status in Sri Lanka
Since 1975 so far nine deaths of students have been reported due to the ragging cases in universities. The Act No. 20 of 1998 (Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act) has given the legal powers for the relevant authorities to take actions against cases of ragging. It classifies ragging as, Any act which causes or is likely to cause physical or psychological injury or mental pain or fear to a student or a member of the staff of an educational institution.
The Act specifies the relevant Higher Educational Institutions coming under the Act and that includes all the Higher Educational Institutions established under the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. In addition to this, in 2010, the University Grants Commission issued Circular No. 919 in 2010 as Guidelines to be introduced to curb the menace of ragging in universities or higher educational institutes.
Our Universities must be sued by victims in instances of failure to prevent resultant torture and breaches of acts prohibiting criminal acts. Waiting for complaints to act should not be an alibi. It is incumbent on the UGC and its subsidiary bodies to act in terms of the law to protect the students in their custody. In every institution of higher learning this menace survives in different avatars. The current chairman of the UGC must be applauded for bringing an active focus and strengthening the institutional resolve of the administrators.
The context must also be understood where greater number of girls enter than boys. If sexual predators were to be active the issue is compounded further though it seems Universities are still male chauvinistic bastions with very few women in Councils of administration or heads of units. We have much to learn from the Order and actions of the Indian UGC which I believe is ongoing.

Bangladesh plants million trees to cut lightning toll
BANGLADESH: Bangladesh has begun planting one million palm trees nationwide to help prevent hundreds of people being killed by lightning strikes every year, a top official said Tuesday.
Authorities last year declared lightning a natural disaster as official tallies recorded more than 200 deaths in 2016, with 82 people dying on a single day in May.
Experts say the real number was actually much higher, with one independent monitor saying 349 people were killed by lightning strikes in 2016. Many people living in rural areas do not report deaths to the police.
Disaster officials have spent several months looking at ways to reduce the toll and the tree planting programme is likely to be the first of several measures brought in by the government.
Weve already started planting palm trees in rural areas in an effort to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning, Shah Kamal, the governments disaster management secretary, told AFP.
Well plant one million palm trees by June this year.
Experts say the high death toll stems in part from a lack of trees whose branches can absorb the impact of lightning.
While the trees are damaged, it means the electric charge does not course through the earth.
Kamal said a similar programme in Thailand had already yielded results, adding that a team of Bangladeshi officials had also travelled to Vietnam to study how authorities there protect farmers along the Mekong delta.
A top meteorologist who has conducted some research on lightning said the tree planting should help ultimately help reduce the number of deaths, but the benefits would only be felt some way down the line.
Palm trees take years to grow. But definitely, this is a good move by the government. It will reduce deaths, Shah Alam, a former head of Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told AFP.
Alam said the number of lightning strikes has increased in Bangladesh amid increased deforestation in rural areas where farmers often chop down trees so they can grow more rice and other crops.- AFP

Book Review: HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!
Title: Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars
Author: Lakshman Ratnapala
He has done it again! Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars the second book to be published in the year 2016, by author Lakshman Ratnapala, is as interesting and evocative as his first book Flickering Fortunes, published in February of the same year
This second book contains primarily pen portraits of fourteen men who have had a significant impact on the authors life. Among them are a number of the authors colleagues from PATA and the world of Tourism who have chapters of their own. It is an eclectic collection of subjects that Mr Ratnapala has dealt with, here.
The novelist Joseph Conrad has written that the task of a writer is, by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel - it is, before all, to make you see. That - and no more - and it is everything. Mr Ratnapalas biographical writings have done just this. Just as his first book helped the reader not just to engage with the life of the subject but also of the subjects times and seasons, so this second book will also serve this purpose.
The great British Historian G. M. Trevelyan in his Autobiography of an Historian from An Autobiography and Other Essays writes The dead were and are not. Their place knows them no more and is ours today...The poetry of history lies in the quasi-miraculous fact that once, on this earth, once, on this familiar spot of ground, walked other men and women, as actual as we are today, thinking their own thoughts, swayed by their own passions, but now all gone, one generation vanishing into another, gone as utterly as we ourselves shall shortly be gone, like ghosts at cockcrow. A study of the lives and times of men and women of the past help us to realize that we are all part of a grand design; that we will get some things right as did our forebears and we will definitely get some things wrong just as they did.
Although characteristically, as in his first book, Lakshman R does not pull his punches, he treats his subjects with respect and with a sense of humour that is by no means irreverent. However, he is guilty of betraying his loyalties to his heroes! But then most biographers do tend to treat their subjects subjectively! There is perhaps a fine line between biography and hagiography that is the uncritical and even reverential description of a subjects life. Trevelyan has identified that bias is very much a part of the historical biographers weakness. And so, Mr Ratnapalas pen portraits of some of his heroes can be described as having been written in similar vein.
Reading through Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars I have been struck by the fact that the author has remembered so many details about people, places and events. It is obvious that he paid attention to the little things and made a note of the details. In a fast-moving world like ours we would benefit by remembering the small things and the little details for at the end of the day it is perhaps these things that matter.
Mr Ratnapala shows us also the value of remembering, the value of respect for people both great and small. This shows us that we all need mentors, people we can look up to and respect and seek to emulate and be inspired by for our own journey through life. It shows us the value of heroes  men and women who stood for the right kind of public opinion and principles whose courage, integrity and lifestyle continue to inspire. Someone has said Next to doing things that deserve to be written, nothing gets a man more credit, or gives him more pleasure than to write things that deserve to be read. These pen portraits deserved to have been written and certainly deserve to be read!

CB Governor requests IGP to probe criminal liability of Treasury Bonds auction
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy has made a complaint to the IGP asking to probe the criminal liability of the Treasury Bonds auction on February 27, 2015, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva said.
Speaking at the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on CB Treasury Bonds investigation, the Deputy Minister said the Attorney General has already instructed the CID to expedite the probe into this complaint.
He further said the AG has had a discussion with the CB Governor on the COPE report.
MP Namal Rajapaksa challenged the Government to arrest Arjun Aloysius in connection to this issue. The Governor in fact made the Police complaint asking to arrest whoever responsible if there had been a crime. The CB has also sought the AGs advice over the possibility of filing a civil case to recover certain amount of money. The monetary board led by the CB Governor has taken steps to take the profits of Perpetual Treasuries back to the State if proven guilty at a civil case the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister also pointed out that it was him who was first vocal about the misuse of EPF money and the conduct of Perpetual Treasuries when he was an Opposition MP. However nobody took notice then. No action was taken. It was under this good governance rule a fair inquiry was possible and this was our achievement he said.
Referring to a World Bank letter sent as a reply to an inquiry by the Sri Lankan Government on the bond auction, the Deputy ,inister pointed out the WB had stated the potential loss could not be accurately calculated in the case of the past bond auction. In our view, that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an ex post basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date the Deputy Minister quoted the WB letter.

Certain forces trying to fan the flames of racism: Sally
Former Central Provincial Councillor Azad Sally yesterday said that certain elements are trying to fan the flames of racism regarding the Wilpattu resettlement issue.
We would like to request President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Committee with regard to this issue to examine the land deeds owned by the people since after 1948, who are to be resettled in the Wilpattu area, Sally said.
The GA of the area has assured the land deeds of these people will be kept safely and that it proves that these people have ownership to these lands, Sally said.
If there are any other claimants to these lands, other than the owners,we are totally against it, he further said.
Namal Rajapaksa allegedly established a Namal-village in the middle of Wilpattuwa, after allegedly cutting down the best Karuwala trees in the Wilpattu. There was no environmentalist to question this, Sally alleged.Then, the Sri Lankan Navy claimed 5000 acres of Wilpattu for Cashew plantation. No environmentalist questioned it either, Sally pointed out.
Now when the Muslim people are to be resettled in this area, they are trying to interpret it with a racist approach,Sally further pointed out.
We would like the government to be impartial regarding this matter, Sally added.

Construction Expo to promote new  trends, technology developments
Green building will be the core message of Construction Expo 2017, Sri Lanka's premier trade exhibition in the construction sector. Construction Expo 2017 showcasing every aspect related to the construction and building industry will be held on June 2, 3 and 4, at the BMICH.
Towards a Green Sri Lanka, will be our theme of this time around and Lean Construction methodology that sheds light on eliminating wastage of resources in construction processes will be introduced parallel to this, said Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) Chairman, Dr. Rohan Karunaratne at a press conference held in Colombo.
Construction sector has weathered storms to revive. Construction Expo 2017 would promote new trends and technology developments in the sector. We introduce green and sustainable construction methodology and trade related material via this exhibition, Dr. Karunaratne added.
He said CIOB has contributed to major projects in the country such as Megapolis, China Harbour and also towards entities such as NSBM University.
State Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeyawardena gracing the occasion as the chief guest said that CIOB is an entity brought innovation to the country's construction sphere.
Construction sphere in the Asian region is thriving now and our experts are playing a significant role in this international arena. Green oriented and sustainable lean constructions are the need of the day. Thus an integrated approach is being adapted locally to add value to the sphere, said the minister.
Contribution from the construction sphere towards the GDP was 7.2 percent in 2014. It was dropped to 6.8 percent in 2015 due to changing political scenario. Yet it has grown to 6.9 percent by the third quarter of 2016 and is on an upward trend now. We have forecast a GDP contribution of 12 percent from the construction sphere in 2017, he added.
Construction Expo 2017 would attract around 15,000 to 20,000 visitors and benefit contractors, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers and other related parties in the sector.

Court fixes bail application of former Narahenpita Crimes OIC for February 16
The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for to consider the bail revision application filed by former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera who was arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder.
When the revision application came up before High Court Court, the Attorney General raised objections to release the suspect on bail citing police were yet to conclude their investigations into Thajudeens murder case.
Through the revision application, former Crimes OIC sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder. The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he was not involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail. The former Crimes OIC said he had acted in accordance with the instructions given by higher ranking police officers and did not commit anything wrong.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had been involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeens death as a fatal road accident.
Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana with Harin Hettiarachchi appeared for the petitioner. Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appeared for the Attorney General.

Dedicated SriLankan staff creep through barbed wire fence to get to Madurai Airport
SriLankan Airlines caused controversy yesterday when a viral video showed the operating crew of a SriLankan Airlines flight from Madurai to Colombo creeping through a barbed wire fence in order to get into the Madurai Airport became public.The incident which had taken place last Saturday took place as a result of the entrances to the Madurai Airport being blocked due to student protests against the banning of Jallikattu raging throughout Tamil Nadu.
The crew led by Captain R.De Alwis were blocked from entering the airport and thus had resorted to creeping through a barbed wire fence bordering the airport.
SriLankan Airlines Spokesperson Deepal Perera explaining the incidents which took place said that with the crew stranded, the Madurai authorities themselves had suggested the route through the barbed wire.
They had no alternative given that all routes were blocked. They had suggested it and the crew had volunteered to try it,Perera said.
He added that the company was proud of the crew for having gone the extra mile to ensure that the flight that day took off as planned.
They have taken every precaution to avoid a delay and we are grateful,Perera said.
SriLankan Airlines this week was also rated the most punctual among carriers in the OneWorld global alliance, during the fourth quarter of 2016. The airline achieved a punctuality rating of 90.5 percent for its arrivals and departures being on time during the fourth quarter.

Demonstrations blocking roads violate human rights: Speaker
When a small group of people stage demonstrations blocking roads according to their whims and fancies, it amounts to a grave injustice towards the general public. Such demonstrations violate human rights. Therefore, special attention has to be made to such incidents in future, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said at Pallewela on January 23.
He was addressing a meeting after opening the new police station at Pallewela, Mirigama. This is the 474th Police station in the country.
Speaker Jayasuriya said Pallewela had only one police checkpoint in 2011. When they requested it to be upgraded to a police station, former IGP Ilangakoon commenced the upgrading programme. It was completed by the incumbent IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
The speaker said the government set up nine independent commissions including the Police Commission to ensure a transparent administration. This had enabled police officers to perform their duties protecting the honour and prestige of their uniform. As people's representatives, they are duty bound to offer recognition to the indefatigable service rendered by police personnel to safeguard law and order.
He said the Police Department should change according to the changing times and modern developments. The Police service should not be a dreaded task. They work in close co-operation with the public.
He said people in Pallewela and its surroundings were very peaceful, and they lived in unity and a sense of co-existence.
Rs. 50 million was allocated for development work in Pallewela. He said the father of the nation the late Prime Minister, D.S. Senanayake, was a product of Mirigama. Therefore, they were duty bound to develop the region. The area has no political divisions either because the chief organisers of the two main political parties were cooperating with each other to develop the region.
Every one should have the right to lead a free life under democracy. Everyone should be able to use the road to the airport and back as he or she pleases anytime of the day. If a handful of people held a demonstration blocking the road, it would amount to usurping other people's rights. They would have to think twice and act if such obstructions were caused to people's just rights in future.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara also spoke. Gampaha SSP Muditha Pussella delivered the welcome address. Provincial council member Udena Wijeratne and former provincial council member Sanjaya Siriwardena were present.

Depot to store 10,000 metric tons of grain to be opened in Mannar next week
Another proposal in Budget 2017 will become a reality when a new store house in Mannar is opened with the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and with the participation of several other ministers on January 26.
The 21,586 square feet storehouse built at a cost of Rs.264 million at Nanattan in Mannar, has the capacity to store 10,000 metric tons of grain. World Bank provided grants to build this store house which would benefit over 1,000 farmers in the area.
Under the governments policy to make the country self-sufficient, new grain depots will be constructed to store buffer stocks. Bumper harvests of several grains including paddy, is in a danger in the absence of sufficient storage facilities to preserve them for future use.
Store houses of the kind are already in operation at Buttala and Galenbindunuwewa, while Mannar is the third one of a series of store houses to be built in the future. Plans are afoot to build similar store houses in Kilinochchi and Embilipitiya in the near future. Rs.600 million has been allocated for this project by Budget 2017.
In addition, the Budget has proposed to introduce another variety of storehouses with 5,000 metric tons capacity. Medium size rice millers have been invited to invest in this project and the millers who have 50 metric tons of minimum capacity per day, will be granted loans under a concessionary loan system.
Rs. 400 million has been allocated by Budget 2017 for this purpose.

Today we are in the process of uniting the two sections of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) through discussions. Our aim is saving the party, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
There is a clear division in the SLFP trade unions. If the SLFP is to face the next election separately, the benefit of the division would directly go to the UNP. Members of the SLFP trade unions still face difficulties in some State institutions. Since this is a National Government, such acts of discrimination should not be tolerated hereafter, said Minister Seneviratne, addressing the Executive Committee meeting of the SLFP trade unions held in Colombo recently.
According to Minister Seneviratne, since this is not a 100 percent SLFP Government, the acts of discrimination take place where UNP Ministers hold portfolios. The issue should be brought to the notice of President Maithripala Sirisena in order to arrive at a solution.
Trade unionists pointed out that the members of SLFP trade unions where the Cabinet ministerial post is held by a SLFP Minister, also face discrimination.

Do not allow bureaucrats, politicians to disrupt development drive: Ravi
Professionals should not allow bureaucrats and inefficient politicians to disrupt ongoing development drive, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said many public officials and even certain politicians keep silence in the face of such bureaucracy consequently suppressing the innocent people of this country.
The minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Diploma in Public Procumbent and Contract Administration Training Course held at the Miloda Financial Academy in Colombo on January 23.
Procumbent Specialist and Fraud Investigator Dr. Colin Cram of the Charted Institute of Purchasing and Supply in Britain delivered the keynote address.
Minister Karunanayake said professionals today need not to fear to challenge bureaucrats and inefficient politicians.
He pointed out that professionals should come forward to implement the development drive introduced by the government.
The minister said it is no point if it is unable to prove walk the talk.
He said many public servants are reluctant to challenge inefficient politicians. They just keep silent and get accustomed to the entrapping system, he said.
The minister, explaining how public funds are lost due to inefficiency and corruption in the procurement process, said that money could be saved by improving efficiency in the part of public servants.
He said drastic changes need to be made in the Procurement Commission and in its Appeal Board; therefore, the President and the Prime Minister have appointed a Special Cabinet Subcommittee intending to correct this situation. Many powerful countries now show their keen interest in Sri Lanka, and it was proved during the World Economic Forum concluded recently at Davos in Switzerland, the minister said.
He said a large number of foreign investors met him in Davos and evinced their interest to invest in Sri Lanka and all these developments are clear evidence that our country passed a gloomy era and has reached to an optimistic turning point.
Minister Karunanayake pointed out that the country should have a smooth business friendly supportive system to provide necessary facilities to prospective foreigners when they reach here to invest.
He said the entire world is facing economic turbulence today and the reason for top world investors to eye on Sri Lanka is the disciplined and coherent economic foundation built in the country during the current regime.
The minister said the duty of all professionals is to forget the past and make commitments to enable this efficient government to reach its set goals and face impending global challenges.

## Section: Features

Filter out the noise
It can seem like our lives are filled with busyness, noise, distractions, and often meaningless activities.
What if we could filter out all that noise, and focus on the meaningful
What if we could find stillness instead of constant distraction
I believe that most of us have that power. In my experience, most of the noise is there by choice, but weve fallen into patterns over the years and it can seem like were not able to change them.
Lets talk about ways to filter out the noise, then how to find stillness and meaning.
Ways to Filter the Noise
Take the rest of today to notice what noise you find in your life. Even take a little time to make a list, whenever you find distraction or busyness.
For example, noise in my life comes from: email, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, blogs and other sites I like to read, text messages, Slack, and watching Netflix. You might have other sources: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, news, cable TV.
Once were aware of the noise, how can we filter it out We have to decide that we want more quiet and meaning in our lives. That its important enough to miss out on some things in those noisy channels.
Then we can take action:
=Turn off notifications as much as possible. Including the unread messages count by each app on your phone.
= Decide to check on some things (like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) just once a day. Others you can check twice a day, or three times if needed (like email or Slack). But set a limit.
= Delete accounts or delete apps that arent giving you real meaning (I deleted my Facebook account years ago).
= Unsubscribe from everything possible in your email account. And from Twitter or any other app where youre following people or blogs/websites. If you use an RSS reader, unsubscribe from as many feeds as possible. Leave only a handful that give you meaning.
= Tell people that you are only checking your messages once a day, to set expectations. Dont use an autoresponder  I find those annoying. Instead, just send a message to the people who matter most, and ask that they be understanding.
= Set a time each day when you watch TV or movies (if at all). Set a time of day when you read news or blogs (if at all). If you say, I only watch TV after 7 p.m., then youve limited how much space this takes up in your life.
= If there are some things (like email, for example) where you need to stay connected because of work, try to negotiate with your boss or team so that you can find periods of disconnection. For example, ask if you can take a couple hours in the morning and a couple in the afternoon to be disconnected, to focus on more important work.
If you take these actions, youll filter out most of the noise.
Whats left Time for quiet, stillness, focus and meaning.
Once youve filtered out the noise, you are left with a few interesting problems:
= Changing your habits of busyness and constant movement.
= Figuring out whats meaningful.
= Learning to stop and stay still.
I think those are wonderful problems to be faced with. Most people never even consider them. Find gratitude that you can work on this at all.
Take some time to notice your constant need for busyness or distraction. For example, if you have a moment where youre not doing anything  youre waiting in line, youre alone at your restaurant table while your friend goes to the bathroom, youre sitting on your couch  what do you try to do out of habit This is your pattern of busyness and movement.
Now see if you can let go of those patterns. Catch yourself, and instead opt for stillness and quiet. Try to just sit there and notice your surroundings. Soak it all in. Savor the moment. Meditate on your breath. Reflect on your day. Ask yourself what youre grateful for right now.
Start building new patterns of stillness. For example, try morning meditation on your breath, even if just for a few minutes every day. Try going for a morning or evening walk, without your phone. Try turning the phone and computer off and just journal.
Start finding activities that are more meaningful to you. This doesnt have to be done in one day  you can slowly experiment to figure out whats meaningful to you. You might start writing a book or screenplay, for example, or taking photos or drawing or making music. You might decide to start a business or charity that changes the world. You might start to learn something thats meaningful, or teach others. Find ways to help others and make the world a better place. Journal, meditate, exercise, make healthy food, declutter, make dates with people who are important to you.
When you notice yourself running to busyness and distraction, pause. Turn instead towards stillness and your meaningful activities.
Build a life around stillness and meaning, and notice the difference it makes in you.

It has been eight years since Lasantha Wickrematunga was killed and seven years since Pradeep Ekneligoda disappeared, but even the incumbent government has not taken steps to deliver justice,she said as the Free Media Movement held a candle light vigil under the theme of Two years since Yahapalanaya but January is still black, at Independence Square.
Ranjani further explained that it has been several years since Sirasa studios and Lanka E-news were attacked in addition to several Tamil journalists in Jaffna having disappeared and these issues still persisted even though the government had promised to resolve them prior to coming into power. She hoped that at least next year, the government would be able to bring some light into the darkness of January.

Ford launches auto parts to fix competitors vehicles
Ford Motor Co (F.N), in a bid for a piece of the rapidly growing global auto parts market, is launching a new brand called Omnicraft to sell parts to Ford dealers and independent repair shops to fix competitors vehicles.
Omnicraft joins Ford's established Motorcraft which makes parts for Ford vehicles.
Frederiek Toney, president of Ford's customer service division, said the global business for automotive parts, which is now estimated at more than $500 billion, and service will expand by 70 percent in the next six years or so.
Toney would not say how much of the global market Ford wants to capture, but said that in 10 years the company would be pleased if 10 percent to 15 percent of its parts sales were from Omnicraft.
Suppliers will make the parts, and Ford will sell them at a profit, but says they will be competitively priced, in part to attract independent repair shops as well as its own dealers.
Having the parts for non-Ford vehicles will allow dealers to increase repair and service business, as well as offer an opportunity to convince owners to look over new Ford cars and trucks while they are at the dealership.
At first, Omnicraft parts will be sold at Ford and Lincoln dealerships, of which there are 3,200 in the United States and 10,500 globally. Omnicraft will be active in Ford's major markets around the world, Toney said.
As the average age of vehicles increases, especially in mature markets like the United States and Europe, there is more of a need for auto parts, said Toney, which is no secret. It behooves us to try to compete for the life cycle of ownership and not to focus as Ford has on the early years of that cycle.
In the U.S. market, the average age of a vehicle on the road is more than 11 years. BBC

He made these remarks at the centenary celebrations of the Visakha Vidyalaya at the school premises on Monday.
The President was warmly received by the schoolchildren as he arrived at the venue.
The President addressing the gathering commended the great journey of 100 years of the Visakha Vidyalaya.
President Sirisena said the challenges of new technology, commercialisation and competitiveness, as well as the powerful social evils, pose great challenges for the future and in that context, our children should be ready to move forward while protecting our values and culture.
In 1917, Jeremias Dias founded the Visakha Vidyalaya. It is the oldest Buddhist Girls College in Sri Lanka. The commemorative coin was presented to the President by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, the staff of the Visakha Vidyalaya, including its Principal Sandamali Aviruppola, parents and past pupils participated.

A Commemorative Coin of Rs. 2,000 denomination was issued to mark the Centenary of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo on January 23.
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy presented the first coin to President Maithripala Sirisena during a ceremony at the school premises.
The obverse of the coin depicts the portrait of the founder Jeremias Dias with the words 1917 Visakha Vidyalaya Centenary 2017 in English on the periphery and Selestina Jeremias Dias at the bottom edge. The reverse of the coin depicts a lamp in gold at the centre. The face value of Rs. 2,000 in large numerals with the words of Sri Lanka currency name in Sinhala, Tamil and English and Year 2017 appear just below the words. The words Pannaya Parisujjhati in English on the periphery at the top edge of the coin and the country name in Sinhala, Tamil, and English are depicted at the bottom edge of the coin.
Visakha Vidyalaya is the first girls school to launch a Commemorative Coin - a significant achievement for the school.
The school was founded on January 16, 1917 by Jeremias Dias as an institution of learning for Buddhist girls at a time when such institutions were rare. It was initially called Buddhist Girls College established at a house called The Firs at Turret Road, Colombo. It later moved to its present premises at Vajira Road on November 21, 1927 and renamed Visakha Vidyalaya by the spouse of then Governor Sir Herbert J. Stanley.
From humble beginnings, it has risen to the position of the most sought-after school for girls in the country.

GAME OF THRONES
While the government was preparing for the Local Government election, seven Provincial Chief Ministers  stalwarts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)  held a discussion with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday, at the latters residence in Colombo 07.
The objective of the meeting was to ensure party unity before the announcement of the Local Government election.
The Chief Ministers first held a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena and informed him that they intended to meet former President Rajapaksa to discuss measures to strengthen the party unity. The President said he had no objection to any such meeting. This laid the foundation for the meeting between the former President and the Chief Ministers.
The Chief Ministers represented the moderate bloc of the SLFP which believe the former President should work under the SLFP umbrella, accepting the leadership of President Sirisena. They are of the view that such an arrangement will prevent a split in the party and give the SLFP camp an edge at the Local Government election.
All the Chief Ministers representing the SLFP, except North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, attended the discussion. Jayaratne left the Rajapaksa camp before the last Presidential election and became an ardent supporter of President Sirisena.
Former Ministers Gamini Lokuge, Bandula Guanwardena and Prof. G.L. Peiris attended the discussion representing Rajapaksas group.
We joined the discussion as intermediaries. We will convey the matters discussed at the meeting to the party leadership and the Central Committee. We were not here to make final decisions on contentious matters, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva told reporters after the meeting.
The meeting ended inconclusively. But, we still believe there is some opening for a meaningful dialogue, he added.
Outcome of the meeting
Chief Ministers meeting with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said there were certain arguments during the meeting.
Despite the arguments and counter-arguments, the meeting was friendly.
Although there were positive sentiments from the Chief Ministers, the former Presidents group seemed displeased with the outcome of the meeting.
The main problem was that the Chief Ministers who came to meet the former President did not have decision making powers in the party. Without decision-making powers, they cant offer solutions to critical issues. Thats why these discussions do not go anywhere, UPFA MP and Rajapaksa group stalwart Gamini Lokuge said.
He said he was uncertain whether the two groups would meet again.
The former Presidents position remained unchanged during the meeting. He said he would not support the national unity government in which the UNP is a main stakeholder.
He said he was ready to work with anyone who is against the UNP and its political agenda.
But, the majority of Chief Ministers defended the SLFPs move to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UNP to form a unity government. They said an arrangement of that nature was needed to ensure political reforms and national policies. This was the key policy difference between the two groups attending the meeting.
The Rajapaksa group is also adamant that the former President should be given key decision-making responsibilities in the party before the Local Government election. They constantly threaten to form a separate political front - a breakaway party  if the President turns down their demands.
This pound-of-flesh policy also stands in the way of SLFPs unity, at the moment.
While working hard to resolve the power struggle within the party, the SLFP also has to battle with the UNP and other stakeholders of the yahapalanaya government over its position on the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
General Secretary of SLFP and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake
The SLFP has made a policy decision to back the Executive Presidency, taking a 180 degree turn from the principles of good governance upon which the present government was formed two years ago.
President Sirisena, however, is yet to make his opinion public on the matter.
The SLFPs position on the Executive Presidency has irked sections of the UNP and other stakeholders of the government who campaigned for President Sirisena at the last Presidential election.
They firmly believed that President Sirisenas rise to power would bring an end to the Executive Presidency  a constitutional demon in the eyes of some.
Many who opposed the Executive Presidency backed President Sirisenas election campaign in January, 2015 as comprehensive constitutional reforms were a top priority of the rainbow coalitions political agenda.
They are now confused with the SLFPs reluctance to abolish the Executive Presidency, a key element in the constitutional reform process.
The UNP, as a policy, supports the total abolition of the Executive Presidency. As a result, the two main stakeholders of the government find themselves at the opposite ends of the debate.
UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera, speaking to the media in Kandy, a few days ago, said his party was determined to abolish the Executive Presidency.
He said the leaders of the government had no ethical right to continue with the Executive Presidency.
Meanwhile, a section of the SLFP and the members of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) have also stressed the need for the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
Among them is former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a Patron of the SLFP and a member of its Central Committee.
Kumaratunga, addressing a public event recently, said the Central Committee, the supreme decision making body of the party, had not made a decision to retain the Executive Presidency. It shows that the key figures of the SLFP are still not on the same page about the matter.
Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne, a member of the UNFGG, also expressed similar views when he addressed the Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department two weeks ago.
Revealing President Sirisenas position on the matter, Senaratne said the President wanted to abolish the Executive Presidency.
A section of the SLFP has made a request to retain the Executive Presidency; but the President has still not agreed, he said.
Since 1994, all Presidents had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and used that very promised to get into power, but due to various practical or personal constraints, failed to fulfill the promises.
Either they didnt have two thirds majority or didnt want to do it. And given the war, there were practical issues of whether it was a wise decision to make. But after 2010, there has been no excuse to keep it. On January 8, we promised to abolish it. That is the mandate upon which is the government was formed, the Minister explained.
It is against this backdrop that the civil society activists who were involved in President Sirisenas election campaign in 2015 met several representatives of the government to discuss the progress of constitutional reforms.
Ministers Dr Rajitha Senaratne, Mangala Samaraweera, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Duminda Dissanayake, Mano Ganesan, Deputy Ministers Dr Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Constitutional Lawyer MP Dr Jayampathi Wickremaratne attended the meeting representing the government.
The civil society was represented by Prof Sarath Wijesuriya, Gamini Viyangoda, Saman Rathnapriya and Ven Dambara Amila thera.
The meeting lasted for about two and half hours took place at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla, on Sunday evening.
The civil society representatives, addressing the meeting, stressed the need for a referendum on the proposed Constitutional reforms.
Speaking to the Daily News on Sunday, Puravesi Balaya Co-convenor Gamini Viyangoda said there was a general agreement that the executive presidency should be abolished.
He said the civil society forwarded a road map to the Government on how to approach the people on the new Constitution and devolution of power.
We believe if all political parties, the SLFP, UNP, JVP, TNA and SLMC come together we can win the referendum with no difficulty Viyangoda said.
Interestingly, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, who attended the meeting, did not explicitly voice his opinion at the meeting.
He did not say that they were against the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He spoke about certain difficulties they have faced in that regard in the party. He did not say either yes or no to it. However, we decided to continue this dialogue with the political leaders and civil society even in the future Minister of National Dialogue Mano Ganesan told the Daily News on Sunday.
The minister said he brought out the concerns of the minority parties on the electoral reforms during the meeting.
However, it is now clear that the SLFPs take on the Executive Presidency and the Presidential candidacy in 2020 will make life hard for those involved in the formulation of a new constitution.
They are aware that without the SLFPs support the government cannot proceed with the constitutional reform process promised before the last Presidential election.
This calls for an agreement between the President and the Prime Ministers  the leaders of the two main parties in the government  on the ruling alliances future course of action on constitutional reforms.
India - China
The Sri Lankan government is now on the threshold of a crucial agreement with China on the Hambanthota port development project.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama has told media that the final agreement in this regard will be signed before the end of January. However, the government is still in the process of finalizing some clauses in the agreement which has caused ripples across the political circles.
At the same time, China is likely to be given a long-term lease on 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota for an industrial zone worth $1.4 billion. Despite some politically motivated resistance from villagers in the area, the Sri Lankan government is ready to move forward with the comprehensive development plan.
This is aside from the Colombo Port City, built by the Chinese with their own money, at the heart of the Colombo city. It seemed like China was consolidating its position in Sri Lanka  especially on the investment front  under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration. It was against this backdrop that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, a Cabinet Minister, revealed that the Sri Lankan government would offer the Trincomalee harbour to India, for development purposes.
The plan is to develop Trincomalee harbour into a major deep sea port in a region that is currently in need of them, and a 175 square kilometre luxury tourism zone - for which Sri Lanka needs financial support from overseas.
On the surface, it looked as if the Sri Lankan government was trying to counterbalance its activities with China by offering the Trincomalee harbour to India.
The New Indian Express, a Chennai based newspaper. reported last week that India was not inclined to proceed with the deal as it is not going to yield an income for a long time. According to the report, India does not see it as a commercially viable venture. However, the Indian government is yet to make an official comment in this regard.
Indias only interest is in seeing that any foreign presence in Sri Lanka is not a security threat to India, sources said. It does have a fear that the current deal with the Chinese company on Hambatota port could at some point be a security threat to India as the port will be in de-facto if not de-jure control of the Chinese government for the next 99 years, the New Indian Express report said.
This indicates that Sri Lankas successful relations with India relies on Colombos ability to convince the Indian government that the Chinese economic activities in Sri Lanka do not pose a threat to Indias security interests in the region. Indias main concern  in the context of Sri Lanka - is her security interests, more than anything else.
As long as the Sri Lankan government manages to effectively communicate to the Indian government that Sri Lankas decisions will not jeopardize Indias security interests, New Delhi  Colombo relations will remain intact, irrespective of economic partnerships between Sri Lanka and China.

Gemunu requests for Rs.5,000 fine on beggars,traders in buses
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijeratne has asked that a minimum fine of Rs.5,000 be imposed on those begging and selling goods in buses.
Wijeratne in a letter addressed to the Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva asked that the Motor Traffic Act of 1951 which is currently in the process of being amended also include a clause of imposing a fine to the ban of begging and doing business inside buses.
The Act specifies begging and selling goods inside buses to be a crime but it has not prescribed a punishment for it. The Act thus cannot be implemented,he explained.
We receive many complaints of these beggars and sellers harassing commuters. At time these sellers pick pocket the passengers while selling their goods, he added.

The Government is paying Rs 1.9 billion as consultancy fees to a foreign firm contracted to operate the State machinery in this country, alleged former Minister Prof G L Peiris, addressing a press conference organized by the Joint Opposition Economic Research Committee at the Sri Vajirashrama in Punchi Borella.
Prof. Peiris said the government had an attitudinal problem of treating everything local as anathema. The government's policy was to seek foreign solutions to our local problems.
He said the government had contracted a US firm in Maryland to restructure the State administrative machinery at a cost of Rs 1.9 billion.
This particular US company had a questionable and notorious history and its past record had been inimical to democracy.

Japan flash manufacturing PMI  shows fastest expansion in 3 years
Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in January at the fastest pace in almost three years as export orders surged, suggesting that overseas demand is not as weak as some economists and business leaders had feared.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.8 in January from a final 52.4 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the third consecutive month and showed that activity expanded at the fastest since March 2014.
"The Japanese manufacturing sector started the New Year on a strong footing," said Amy Brownbill, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
"The rise in total incoming new orders was driven in part by a sharp increase in international demand, as new export orders rose at the quickest rate in over a year."
The preliminary index for new export orders rose to 53.2 from a final 51.1 in December, indicating the fastest gain in 14 months. The flash index for new orders, which measures both domestic and external demand, rose to 54.1 from 53.2 in the previous month, the highest in 13 months.
Some economists have expressed concern about Japan's economic outlook because its exports could suffer if U.S. President Donald Trump adopts protectionist trade policies. Trump took office only last week, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about the specific economic policies he will pursue. CNBC News

Justice Minister wants Dowbiggin Pavilion converted to Henry Pedris Pavilion
Minister of Justice and Buddhist Affairs Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has requested that the name of Dowbiggin Pavilion at the Police Departments Havelock Grounds be renamed as Henry Pedris Pavilion. The request sent to the President and Prime Minister, explained that Herbert Dowbiggin who acted as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) during the British era actively orchestrated ethnic tension between the different communities and tortured many Sinhalese and Tamils. He also was involved in opening several taverns in a bid to sabotage the Temperance Movement. Hence Rajapakshe pointed out that it was an insult to continue with his name and instead asked that the pavilion be renamed with the name of Pedris who sacrificed his life for the independence of the country.
Dowbiggin had been held responsible for stirring up trouble between the Sinhalese and Muslims during the ethnic riots of May 1915 through the Perahera from Gampola to Kandy. As the Sinhala-Muslim riots flared, the British IGP would bring down Marati and Gurka soldiers from India to quell the riots. Many were tortured and raped in the process. Dowbiggin has also been accused of imprisoning freedom fighters D. S. Senanayake, F. R. Senanayake, Braun Jayathilake, A.E. Gunasinghe, Piyadasa Sirisena and the brothers of Anagarika Dharmapala; Edmond Hewavitharana, C.A. Hewavitharana, Charles Batuwanthudawe and Ven. Battaramulle Subhitha. He had fabricated evidence and shot Captain Henry Pedris to set an example for the rest. During his tenure as IGP, Dowbiggin executed 69 and sentence 83 to life imprisonment.

JVP Leader urges Speaker to take over investigation
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake while thanking President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a Presidential Commission to investigate into the Central Bank bond issue yesterday urged the Speaker to take this decisive matter to his hand and directly order to proceed on to take legal action against the perpetrators.
He was of the view that the Speaeker should intervene to supervise this process.
It is proved beyond doubt that Perpetual Treasuries has earned undue profits from the bond issue.The loss of the day of the bond issue on February 27, 2015 alone is Rs 1,674 million,Dissanayake said. Perpetual Treasuries Limited had recorded an excessive profit of over Rs.13 billion during the 21 months from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016,he said.
He was moving an adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation. He said the Perpetual Treasuries had purchased bonds worth of Rs.227 billion during the 14 months from February 28, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Out of that Rs.141 billion worth bonds had been purchased directly while Rs.86 billion worth bonds had been purchased through other institutions such as state banks.
He pointed out 95 percent of those bonds had been sold back to the Employees Provident Fund (EFP) at the secondary market. He said according to a monetary board report that came out last November, the EPF had suffered a loss of Rs 14.9 billion during the above mentioned 14 months.
The assets of Perpetual Treasuries grew by 1853 percent during the last two years while the asset growth of other primary dealers had been only 31 percent. The number of staff of this company is only 14. It is proved beyond doubt that this company has earned undue profits from the bond scam. The loss of the day of the bond scam on February 27, 2015 alone is Rs 1,674 million. Yet, the Government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is hesitant to take any action against the culprits involved in this scam he stated.
MP Dissanayake urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take this decisive matter to his hand and directly order to proceed on to take legal action against the perpetrators while supervising the process. The MP, thanking the President for appointing a Presidential Commission in this regard, questioned why that action was delayed for two long years.

Let MR spill the beans
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has dropped a bombshell. He says he knows who killed Sunday Leader founder Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga. Not only that, he has invited the CID to question him if it wants to know who killed Lasantha. Rajapaksas revelation is serious indeed if not shocking. Lasantha was assassinated in January 2009, in a high security zone swarming with military personnel and in a previous editorial we made the point that no such incident could have occurred at such a guarded location unless with the full knowledge of the high ups in the defence establishment.
Rajapaksa was the commander-in-chief and his brother Gotabhaya the Defence Secretary. They certainly would, at least, have had an inkling of what indeed happened on that fateful day. Rajapaksa, one may recall, told the elder brother of the slain journalist at a media gathering at Temple Trees, shortly after the assassination, that if he (the brother) was able to provide any information on the identity of the assassin, he (Rajapaksa) would do the needful. This, after Lasanthas elder brother directly inquired from Rajapaksa on the progress of the investigation. In other words, the former President, as implied, was not aware of anyone connected to the assassination. Hence, his request for information in this regard.
Now, a full eight years after the incident, Rajapaksa is confessing that he knew who was behind the assassination, and, not only that, is asking the CID to obtain all the details from him. In other words, the former President had been sitting tight on all the information pertaining to those behind the assassination for eight long years and is only now prepared to spill the beans.
Why didnt he go to the CID at the time and expose the identity of those behind the killing After all Lasantha was said to have been a good friend of his. Hasnt the former President, by his silence on the matter, set himself up as an accessory to murder
The CID now has the opportunity to question the former President following the latters invitation to be questioned. As the former head of state, the evidence of Rajapaksa has necessarily got to carry a lot of weight. It also has to be noted that Rajapaksa maintained a stoic silence all these years even when suspects connected to the assassination were being questioned. He did not drop the bombshell, as he has done today, at the time. Had he done so the investigation would have been long concluded and the culprits brought to book.
It must be said that the whole affair came to the fore with the grilling of former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Is Rajapaksas display of alacrity to name the assassin at this stage anything to do with revenge, jealousy or personal animosity If not, why bring the matter up at this stage Whoever was responsible, it was the bounden duty of Rajapaksa to come out with identity of the individuals responsible for the foul deed at the time. What made Rajapaksa come out of the woodwork now with his precious information, knowing his credibility is bound to be put to the test
Be that as it may, with Rajapaksa now coming out with this explosive revelation, the law enforcement authorities should not lose time in getting to the bottom of the whole affair. The slain journalists wife, soon after the new government took office, wrote a letter to those who mattered to reopen the investigation that had been stalled. The journalist fraternity too is clamouring to speed up investigations, not only into the Lasantha assassination, but all members of the fourth estate who went the same way as Lasantha.
The Yahapalanaya government promised an end to the culture of impunity, that was the hallmark of the Rajapaksa regime. The dark pall that hung over the journalist tribe has been lifted over the last two years, although some media institutions have taken the liberty of criticising the government with impunity. They dont have to fear white vans anymore.
Lasantha, no doubt, was a controversial scribe and in certain instances crossed that red line that got under the skins of both the Chandrika and Mahinda regimes. But by no stretch of the imagination can one justify the fate that ultimately visited the Sunday Leader editor and there can be no justification for what in the end befell Lasantha, whatever flaws he may have had, professionally speaking.
This foul murder even brought Sri Lanka under the international microscope and served to alienate the countries of the civilized world from Sri Lanka. It is time that the Lasantha murder stop being made a political football by interested parties and that the whole matter be gone into in depth before the real culprits, both who committed the actual crime and those who masterminded it, brought to justice. This, while dousing the anguish of the Wickremetunga family, would no doubt be justice done to all journalists who went the same route as Lasantha and a victory for those scribes who were subjected to state sponsored violence.

The living years
The Givantha Arthasad story:
His first encounter as such had been with Dissanayake Studios. Leenus Dissanayake, who headed it, had earlier produced Siri Gunasinghes Sath Samudura. Givantha managed to borrow a camera through him, after which (in 1971) he directed his first film, a hilarious and animated take on the story of Andare. The Film Critics and Journalists Association nominated it for their annual Short Film Festival in Colombo. I remember contending against the likes of Sunil Ariyaratne (Sara Gee) and Dharmasena Pathiraja (Sathuro) and I remember meeting D. B. Nihalsinghe, whod later wind up as the Chairman of the Film Corporation.
Not long afterwards, Givantha was taken from the Science section, with Jayantha Premachandra winding up as his third important figure of destiny at Wesley. After Wickramage, Marasinghe, and Premachandra, Givantha counts in another such figure: Felix Premawardhana, who taught literature.
By the time young Givantha completed his O Levels, his father, who had envisioned a life as a parson for him, abandoned the idea and let him continue with what he wanted, something he highlights for me in our conversation. The problem for me, however, was that there was no real institute or University for me to go and study what I wanted. The closest that came to such a place was Heywood, which taught music, but I felt soon enough that it would limit me. So I decided to venture out on my own and teach myself.
His first encounter as such had been with Dissanayake Studios. Leenus Dissanayake, who headed it, had earlier produced Siri Gunasinghes Sath Samudura. Givantha managed to borrow a camera through him, after which (in 1971) he directed his first film, a hilarious and animated take on the story of Andare. The Film Critics and Journalists Association nominated it for their annual Short Film Festival in Colombo. I remember contending against the likes of Sunil Ariyaratne (Sara Gee) and Dharmasena Pathiraja (Sathuro) and I remember meeting D. B. Nihalsinghe, whod later wind up as the Chairman of the Film Corporation.
Ever the inquisitive dabbler, this hadnt prevented Givantha from pursuing other fields. His next interest had been in makeup. Through Freddie Silva, a personal friend and a veritable star at the time, he had gone to Ceylon Studios, where after being introduced to the formidable but kindly Derrick Fernando had met up with Titus Thotawatte. He taught me a lot about films and filmmaking, Givantha reflects, and through him, I ended up learning about cinematography with his most frequently opted for cameraman, Andrew Jayamanne. The end-result was that thanks to these encounters, he was able to clinch awards for his third cartoon film, made at the age of 20.
Technical proficiency
Given that I more or less know his film credits, I ask him as to how cartoon films were made at the time. Not through digital means, of course! he chortles, explaining that as a virtual one-man team he had to insert India ink on every frame he was provided with. Given that over a thousand such frames were used in his first two cartoons, the process would doubtless have been lengthy, time-consuming, arduous, and demanding of a high technical proficiency. Needless to say, Givantha was able to put up with all three. I was told later that a man in Canada called Normal McLaren did a similar thing with his cartoons. You can imagine how surprised I was when I was also told that this process was considered an art there!
In the meantime, the awards kept on rolling, including one in 1976 for Best Makeup given at a Catholic Festival held at the Palm Grove in Galle Face Hotel. This was of course three years before he released his first feature-length film, Dutugemunu, but before that there are two other personal landmarks Givantha recounts for me.
The first was his foray into screen-printing after making his own camera. The second was his making the first optical printer in Sri Lankan upon the request of Lester James Peries (the latter machine, incidentally, would be used by Titus Thotawatte for his Maruwa Samaga Wasaya). In addition to this, he began a separate career as a cartoonist in 1971, working at Aththa, as well as a stamp designer (I notice his work on display at his humble abode, among them a stamp released on eve of the opening of the Victoria Dam).
The eighties proved to be a tumultuous decade (it generally was, for reasons that warrant another article) for Givantha. Before delving into that, however, I must delve into Dutugemunu.
A novel take on a key chapter of our history, Dutugemunu was nevertheless not a strictly historical retelling. I think the man describes it best: It had to do with a cat which takes its kittens to Anuradhapura after telling them that, in a past life, it was Dutugemunus purohithaya. The story itself was loosely based on The Magnificent Seven, charting the attempts of the king to find the yodayas for his Army. That was what appealed to children and that was what I opted for, more than just the history. His two gurus from Wesley had been taken to provide their voices, furthermore: Cyril Wickramage as Dutugemunu and Felix Premawardhana as Nandimitra. In addition, Henry Jayasena had voiced Kavantissa while Givantha himself had voiced several other characters.
Ultimate triumph
Given the huge success such an endeavour would have pulled off, why was it banned In 1977 the UNP came to power promising ethnic harmony and coexistence. Certain educationists thought that the story of Dutugemunu, with his ultimate triumph over Elara, was not amenable to that ethnic harmony. That is why the Education Ministry eventually put a ban on propagating the Dutugemunu legend in whatever form, and that is why I was forced to take out my film from theatres. I was not of course born at the time, so I cant comment on the wisdom of the ban, but I wonder: wouldnt we have had an opportunity to view our history in caricature, enough for our children to enjoy it
Not wont to anger or sadness in the face of such obstacles though, Givantha gradually waded on to the eighties. In 1980, two years before Rupavahini was begun, he was sent to Berlin to study television.
Upon his return, he was initially put into the Animation Division of the SLRC but, upon a personal request by Anandatissa de Alwis and Sarath Amunugama, was engaged in three other Divisions as well. In 1982 he was selected as one of 10 top outstanding personalities in the film industry, while five years later the OCIC bestowed him and 18 other people with awards in recognition for their technical contributions to the cinema.
Between those two years, however, tragedy had struck the man. In 1985 hed organised an exhibition titled Tricks and Effects where, long before the advent of computers, he manipulated and (for the lack of a better word) photoshopped everyday images. While being engaged in the exhibition, he had begun seeing black patches with whatever he was looking at. Diagnosing it as having to do with his retina, he admitted himself to the Eye Hospital and, after convincing his doctors and nurses that something was wrong, discovered that he was slowly but surely going blind.
Givantha explains what happened next. I was immediately sent to meet Dr Upali Mendis, the then Head of the Eye Hospital. He performed a surgery on my left eye and told me that I would quite possibly not see properly for some time. Praying to God, I let him take off the bandages for me to see for myself whether the treatment had worked. When the bandages were finally taken away, I opened my eyes. What did I see The same black patches Id seen before.
Needless to say, the operation had not been a success, which compelled an ominous but sad comment from Dr Mendis: He basically told me that they had done everything they could for me, using what was available in the country. Because it had not worked, he said, I would have to live with God for the rest of my life. What he meant there, of course, was that he would have to let his life be governed by God and, if push came to shove, accept being blind.
Understated illustrators
How did he take to the news I immediately tendered my resignation from Rupavahini. M. J. Perera asked me why and told me to stay. I explained what had happened. That is when he accepted my resignation. Before going away though, I helped Henry Jayasena with a TV adaptation of Hermann Hesses book on Siddhartha Gautama.
A quirk of destiny perhaps, because with it he received an award that, in later months, compelled him to do something about the state of photo journalists and cartoon journalists.
While I felt that my time for reckoning with God had come, I also felt that I had to start an awards ceremony for these maligned, understated illustrators. So I began the Jathika Janamadya Madyarupa Sammana (or the National Media Graphics Awards), which I funded for about five years before letting it go. And his health Given his state today, I can surmise that Dr Mendis had not been entirely correct about how hed turn out eventually. Thankfully for us, the diagnosis had been wrong. I still see those black patches, and my eyesight is still not 100% well. I dont complain.
Today, Givantha Arthasad teaches. He lectures Media at Sri Jayewardenepura University and teaches the same subject thrice a week at St Sebastians College, Moratuwa. While he is not entirely happy about the way children are being brought up to appreciate his subject (We have sacrificed quality for commercialism, reflected in the kind of TV shows they watch), he has much room for optimism (We still have a bunch of dedicated youngsters clamouring for more). While I am not a doomsday predictor to say that things are all going downhill, I do agree with his view that children are being forced to study subjects which are artificially cordoned off from each other.
I mentioned last week that the man has specialised in eight aesthetic fields. I assume that, having read my piece on him, youd know what they are. For purposes of clarification though, I will conclude by listing them out: graphic designing, painting, photography, drama, cinema, television, broadcasting, and journalism.

Loss calculation imaginary: Kiriella
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday maintained that the calculation of the loss incurred from the Central Bank Treasury Bonds sales was imaginary. The minister, participating in the adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on the CB Treasury Bonds investigation said the Supreme Court dismissed a petition on this matter ruling that the alleged loss in this instance was based on assumption.
The minister also argued the purpose of COPE is naming and shaming and not to institute legal action. Today the role of the COPE has been misunderstood. Last year there was a four day seminar conducted by four senior UK Parliamentarians on oversight committees. I asked them whether they have any experience on filling a case against a person based on a revelation before the COPE. They said court cases are never filed for any issue exposed at the COPE he said. However, the Minister said the COPE report had been forwarded to the Attorney General adding that his advice on this matter would be respected. We have nothing to hide. About 40 COPE reports came out during the time of the previous Government, but none of them was referred to the AG. We referred the first COPE report under our Government to the AG, he said.
The minister also said the Government, after it took office ,opted for public auctions instead of private placement system, adding that bond deals were made under the table during the previous regime. The wrong doers should be punished, but Parliament cannot do it. It is the duty of the judiciary. The Supreme Court in its ruling stated the petitioners were unable to point out any violation of the rules when it comes to the bond issue, he added.

In love with Brecht
The story or the enthralling experience narrated by Jewish Cabaret Singer in Weimar Berlin, named as Freida Bloom, began a love affair with young Bertolt Brecht, only to find that she is one of the several women whose skills and emotions fuel Brechts creative energy.
Quite recently, I was invited to one of the most interesting narratives that deal on the life and works of Brecht as seen by one of his close female associates. The book in the form of a biographical novel centres round the trails and tribulations in the life of Brecht. The work too deals with the frank revelation of some of his lovelorn episodes and romances during the course of ideology based on sources culled from history, folklore and epics in various countries inclusive of India, China Germany and Italy. He left Nazi Germany in 1933, returning to East Berlin in 1948 to found the Berliner Ensemble. The plays which he wrote and at times directed include The Three Penny Opera, The life of Galileo, Mother Courage and The Caucasian Chalk Circle.
Quite a lot has been written about the dramatist and poet Bertolt Brecht (1898  1956). Among the treaties that had sprung up in English, the most remarkable work is by Martin Esslin titled as The Choice of Evils with a short biography of Brecht. The intention is to exemplify his short and long works that had come to be translated from German into English. Brechts contribution to the theatre seems to stem up from his introduction of socio-political. The narrative which runs to five minor episodes, containing about five chapters in each is titled as Loving Brecht (1993) written by an English authoress named Alaine Feisntein about whom a little is known.
She happens to be a researcher into the life and works of Bertolt Brecht. In a short note on the author Elaine Feinstein it is stated that he has long been admired as the author of novels which crystalise the European drama of the century.
She is a poet and the translator of the selected poems of the Russian poetess, Marina Tsvetayeva. She has gained experience in writing radio plays and tele plays. All these experiences have culminated in her becoming a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1980. She was awarded the Cholmondeley Prize for poetry in 1990, and made an honourary Doctor Letters at the University of Leicester.
The intention of the writer Feinstein is to make the reader feel that Brecht had been an admirable image in the life of his admirers to the point that he is shown as a super sensitive creator who does not feel that passage of time. He is shown as a person who not only neglected his personal health but indulges in a commitment unforeseen. His addiction to Brandy and smoking cigars is as indivisible from his dedication to the creative task. The narrator Friech Bloom is made to spend most of her time with him both in the capacity of a secretary and a performer cum associate who helps in his writing. But it looks rather a strange human relationship as Brecht shown as married. At the same time, he is aloof from that marital life. He is shown as individual who faces challenges boldly.
Through the eyes of Frieda, the author of Loving Brecht depicts dramatic episodes on how Brecht faces some of the so far unwritten interrogations, trials and entry interviews than enable him to escape from the war torn countries in order to settle down with a peace of mind which he so desired. From Berlin he comes over to Russia and from Russia to New York, and from there to London. The narrative pinpoints the moment of his last days nearing death.
But he wants to rise up and work. Frieda looks on by his side thinking of her days with Brecht, which culminates as follows in the words as altered by Brecht.
I dont regret the shape of my own life. My work has brought me joy. I never feel lonely now, and rarely sad. In some ways, I have been very fortunate.
Loving Brecht happens to be an extraordinary exploration into the works of Brecht as seen by a loving woman. Quite a number of dramatic situations is created in the narrative showing the incomparable nature of Brecht as a human being, who deals meticulously both as a play directed and a writer. One such situation shows how he goes about when he is frustrated and self-effaced when a slight failure arises in theatre craft. Brecht is depicted as a person who becomes silent when such a situation arises. His death is also depicted not as a permanent disappearance from the point of view of the narrator Bloom but as a sad farewell.
I look forward for his arrival at a given moment, she says, making the reader feel as if he will one day make a comeback in a new guise.

Speaker to probe information leak
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would look into as to how public officers provide documents pertaining to bond issues without providing them to the Finance Minister, despite his repeated requests for several months.
The Speaker made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to demands of government members during the adjournment debate moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the treasury bond issue, following the revelations by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Minister Karunanayake said the Auditor General had provided some documents to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake, which he had failed to procure, despite his repeated requests for four months.
MP Bimal Rathnayake placed the document in Parliament stating that it was given to him by the Auditor General as a copy of what the Auditor General provided the Finance Minister. But I was not given such a document, the Finance Minister said.
MP Hector Appuhami and Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said an investigation should be held in this regard to which the Speaker responded positively.
I had asked the Auditor General in writing on October 19, 2016 for details as to what was the total loss incurred by the government owing to private placements since 2009 to 2015, Minister Karunanayake said.
But he said he could not answer since the Central Bank had not provided the details to him, he said.
The minister said the Auditor General had given these details to a Weekend newspaper.
Arjuna Mahendran not adviser to PM
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran has not been appointed as an adviser to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
He made this observation yesterday in response to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake.
When MP Rathnayake said former Central Bank Governor had been appointed as an adviser to the Prime Minister, Minister Samarawickrama said Mahendran has not been appointed to any government position after he was removed from the position of the Central Bank Governor.

Treasury bond scam should not be concealed: Amaraweera
No body should attempt to conceal what seems to be a fraud at the Treasury bond issue, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in Parliament yesterday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena is seeking possibilities to acquire money or assets of Perpetual Treasuries if it is found guilty by the Presidential Commission appointed to probe into the bond issue.
He said that if the allegations were proved, possibilities would be sought to confiscate any assets of the Perpetual Treasuries that had bought with the money gained allegedly by way of the fraud.
Minister Amaraweera made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the Treasury Bond Issue.
Minister Amaraweera said he went before the Bribery Commission as he was of the opinion that there had been a fraud committed in the treasury bond issue. He said as a public opinion was created over the issue, the President cancelled the extension of the Central Bank Governors term. The President will closely monitor the shortcomings of the government just as he was alert on the bond issue, the minister said.
He said whoever in the previous government or the incumbent government does a fraud, it is a crime. He said the country is indebted around Rs. 90,000 billion. The UNP, SLFP and the JVP have been in power and all are responsible for them.
The previous regime engaged in large scale frauds. The present government is also engaged in some corruption. Both are equally wrong, the minister said.
The Opposition has the right to highlight the shortcomings of the government, but it should not put the development of the country in jeopardy. The minister said the Opposition has said that the Country was becoming a colony of India, then a Colony of China.
He said when the ambulances were granted, the Opposition said the RAW was coming to Sri Lanka and the Hanuman bridge was to be reconstructed. However, the Opposition creates lies one after the other when one is proved otherwise. They hold press conferences to tell lies.
JVP overlooked Rajapaksaregimes corruptions: Kabir Hashim
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) should inquire their own conscience as to why they did not move a motion when the COPE report by Wijedasa Rajapaksa during the previous regime revealed that Rs. 15,500 million had been misappropriated by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
The minister said he did not know if the JVP had deals with Mahinda Rajapaksa or was afraid of the dictatorship of the then President that they did not speak about it or did not move a motion on the revelations of the COPE reports.
But today they speak without fear, Minister Hashim said. The biggest fraud of the Provident Fund was committed in 2014 by the Entrust Securities Company. It should be investigated, he said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the treasury bond issue.
Minister Hashim said the point of the JVP was that there could have been a conflict of interests as the treasury bonds had been issued through a relative of former Central bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
This is not a novel situation. Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Kabrals sister was a director of the Perpetual Treasuries Company during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, Minister Hashim said.
If an investigation is held on this matter, all those transactions during the previous regime should be investigated, he said.
The minister said the government issued treasury bonds on February 27, 2015.
The process had been operated transparently at an open auction following the law. But some Opposition members speak like infants, he said.
The minister said this was the first time that a government allowed a COPE report being debated in Parliament. He said the COPE report would be directed to the Attorney General without delay.
If the President appoints a Presidential Commission on the issue, we agree with it. The report of the commission would be directed to the Attorney General too, Minister Hashim said.
The government did not object when it was proposed to present the COPE report to Parliament.
He said the UNP government brought the Financial Management Act in 2002 bringing about financial discipline. But former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Nivaard Kabral acted in violation of the Act and many frauds had been committed during that period. Those incidents have to be investigated too, Minister Hashim said.
The first COPE report of Wijedasa Rajapaksa revealed many frauds, including acting against the tender procedures too. His second COPE report revealed that the loss incurred by the SriLankan Airlines in 2009 was Rs 9,300 million whereas the profit earned by it in 2004 was Rs 4,400 million.
The SriLankan Air Lines Chairman during the period was former President Mahinda Rajapaksas brother-in-law Nishantha Wickramasinghe, he said.
Minister Hashim said the JVP spoke of the loss of the Provident Fund, but what were the corruptions committed during the previous regime.
During that period, the Provident Fund had to buy shares of companies at a high rate through the Perpetual Company and sell them at a low rate. Presidential Commissions should be appointed on these incidents too, Hashim said.
The biggest financial fraud was committed in 2014. During the period, the directors of the Entrust Securities Company were Isira Dasanayake and Chanuka Ratwatte. It was taken over by the Monetary Board as a massive scale fraud of Rs. 1,200 billion out of the provident fund was committed. The same Company fraudulently obtained Rs. 250 million from Central Bank pensioners. Rs. 600 million was obtained from the Multi Purpose Cooperative Society, he said.
The minister said it was the responsibility of COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti to investigate into the issues and direct the reports to the CID and a Presidential Commission.
The Entrust Company supported the Rugby Sport. It sponsored one team of the Carlton Rugby Tournament, Minister Hashim said.
Team captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa was bought at an auction at a rate of Rs 1.1 million. Wasnt it the money that was robbed from government, while Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Finance Minister. There should be an investigation into the incident, he said.
Some Central Bankers disrupt govts progressive path
A few senior officers in the Central Bank who were henchmen of the former Governor, who dont need corruption being terminated have provided false details on the treasury bond matter to the Opposition to move an adjournment motion against the government, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said a few officers, including one Deputy Governor and a Board Secretary of the Central Bank and henchmen of former Governor Ajith Nivaard Cabral had provided these baseless details to the Opposition concealing the positive points of the new changes and corruptions of the losses incurred during the previous government.
He said he would reveal the names of those officers who attempt to disrupt the governments programmes to reveal the previous governments corruptions and those attempt to damage the image of the President, Prime Minister and the Finance Minister and the government.
The minister said those officers attempt to prevent investments ready to come to the country.
He said those officers, including the Auditor General are independent not to provide the details to others, but to Parliament and the government.
UNP and SLFP on equal footing on corruption: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday in Parliament accused that both the UNP and SLFP are hand in glove when it comes to matters of corruption.
The Opposition Leader making a case against corruption said he fears that if corruption continues at the present rate, it might be the cause for the end of democracy.
He was taking part in the adjournment debate on the COPE report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation.
For many decades, we have been talking about corruption, but not a single person has been convicted in the court for corruption. You are fooling the people and this House. The people are getting sick of you all. People feel all of you should be packed off, he said.
I am not saying either Ranil Wickremesinghe or Maithripala Sirisena is corrupt, but corruption is rampant. There were many talks about corruptions of the previous government, but what have you done for the last two years with regard to those charges Nobody has been indicted or convicted by the court. Is it because you are protecting them or is it because your charges are unfounded that you cannot substantiate he questioned.
Corruption is endemic in the country. Every successive government has to be held responsible for this. When elections are held, one party attacks the other on the base of corruption, yet after that, corruption continues as usual, he said.
Sampanthan called on the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to go into the question of bond sales and ascertain the truth.
The country has suffered immensely from the bond sales issue. You have no right to swindle the public money, he said.
The Central Bank has lost its prestige and status. The CBs misconduct did not start yesterday or day before. It started a long time ago. During the last regime, the CB was accused for engaging in political propaganda on behalf of the government, he said.
Action needed if allegedfraud proven: Patali
Action should be taken against those responsible for the treasury bond issue if a fraud has been committed, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister said the Perpetual Treasuries Company has amassed profits unheard in a short period.
He said a large amount of profits gained that no other company of the same industry could earn, leads to suspicions in a short period.
It is advisable to investigate the issue, Minister Ranawaka said. This government came to power not to protect thieves, but to punish them,he said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the COPE report on the treasury bond issue.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakim appreciated the appointment of the Presidential Commission on the issue.
The move to appoint a Presidential Commission should be appreciated, Minister Hakeem said. That commission could look into all the deals in detail. If there is anything wrong, those responsible should be punished,he said.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva joining the debate on the adjournment motion said SLFP members are of the opinion that the wrong doers of the treasury bond issue should be brought to book. We agree with the findings of the COPE, Minister Silva said.
We do not challenge the content of the COPE report. Some officials of the Central Bank have been accused of working against the interests of the country by the COPE report. It is the opinion of the SLFP that if found guilty for the treasury bond sale, anyone should be punished irrespective of their positions, he said.
Handunnetti thanks MPs
COPE Committee Chairman and JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti yesterday thanked Parliamentarians stating that none denied the fact that a fraud had been committed in the treasury bond issue. MP Handunnetti thanked the members joining the adjournment debate moved by MP Anura Jumara Dissanayake.
None of the members in the Parliament said the government had not incurred a loss through the questioned treasury bond issue or a fraud had not been committed, Dissanayake said.
All had come to a common view over the treasury bond issue. They said that culprits should be punished. Such crimes should not be allowed to repeat, he said.
Supplementary estimate on Presidents expenses
A supplementary estimate was presented in Parliament yesterday seeking the approval of the House to provide additional Rs. 1.8 billion to cover the expenses of the President.
The estimate was presented to Parliament by Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
Rs. 200,000,000 has been sought to implement the Pubudamu Polonnaruwa programme, Rs. 1,540,000,000 to make accounting records of the loans disbursed with regard to the construction of the Nelum Pokuna National Performing Art Theatre, Rs. 100,000,000 to meet the shortfall of provision for rents and local taxes and others, Rs. 250,000 to meet the expenditure for the newly established Delimitation Commission, Rs. 3,000,000 to meet the recurrent expenditure of the newly established Right to Information Commission and Rs. 30,000,000 to meet the shortfall of provision for acquisition of capital assets plant and machinery and equipment.
A note submitted along with the estimate said the supplementary provision does not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate by Parliament. The allocation of such purposes has been been made under the Project of Budgetary Support Services and Contingent Liabilities of the Department of National Budget. It is under the limit of the Approved Annual Budget. Either the borrowing limit or the maximum limit of total expenditure will not be increased due to granting of these supplementary provisions. The purpose of the provision is to facilitate the smooth conduct of public finance management in a more efficient and effective manner.
Govt. should hold majority stake of Colombo PortEast Container Terminal
The majority stake of the Colombo Port East Container Terminal should be retained by the government, Port and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday in Parliament.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa. The minister said the government called for Expressions of Interests to invest in the East Terminal, but added the mechanism for that has not been decided.
He said even though a Cabinet paper was presented to lease out the East Terminal retaining a minimum of 15 percent to the Ports Authority, the government can increase its stake by negotiating with the investor.
Responding to a supplementary question by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, the minister said he stands by his initial position that 51 percent of the stake of the East Terminal should be held by the government.
The East Terminal is important to the Ports Authority as it is a deep water terminal to which deep-draught ships can enter. We presented a Cabinet paper last week to purchase cranes to it. The proposal was referred to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management. We hope to start operations in the first 400m in the terminal using these cranes, Minister Ranatunga said.
MP Dissanayake said Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) handle 34 percent of container operations of the Colombo Harbour, while South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) handle 28 percent.
He said the share of container operations of the Ports Authority has dropped from 86 percent in 2001 to 38 percent.

A portrait conversation
This exhibition comes as part of a process that involved training the graduates, who have an ambition to choose art for self expression, through methods of mentoring and facilitation. A similar exhibition, titled Seven Conversations was jointly curated by Sharmini Pereira and T.Shanaathanan in July 2015, with the support of Saskia Fernando Gallery, Colombo
This exhibition, curated by Thamotharampillai Shanaathanan of visual arts by three Jaffna University graduates marks stage on a journey that was started in late 2015. This exhibition comes as part of a process that involved training the graduates, who have an ambition to choose art for self expression, through methods of mentoring and facilitation. A similar exhibition, titled Seven Conversations was jointly curated by Sharmini Pereira and T.Shanaathanan in July 2015, with the support of Saskia Fernando Gallery, Colombo.
The title of this exhibition emerged from the commonalities shared by works of these three individuals. Dharshiyas works reveal the politics of identity from her gendered position. She uses embroidery both as medium as well as meaning in her art. Here embroidery is a medium that, being identified as feminine and associated with the hobby of elite women or livelihood of the economically poor, becomes a political weapon to question the social control of women. Similarly Nilanis series of pen and ink drawings of fences  by mapping the shifting modes of fencing during war, pre-war and post-war northern Sri Lanka unpacks the idea of boundaries. In a way, her works try to understand her positioning beyond binary categories such as history /memory, personal /public, special/ temporal and actual/virtual. Her drawings portray fences not only as borders but also as symbols of ownership, power, belonging, and as sites of contestation and conflict. Inkarn was, like many others, caught in the last phase of the Vanni war and went through the cruelest experiences. His sculptures present the artist as a victim as well as a witness. By using the materials and techniques that are employed in treating wounds and healing pain, he tries to portray his wounded self.
The exhibition opens on January 26 and will continue until February 9. Saskia Fernando Gallery is open to the public daily from 10am to 6pm.

Prof. Hausmann delves on need to reaccelerate Sri Lanka's economy
A highly informative lecture seeking ways in which countries such as Sri Lanka could achieve higher development by identifying bottlenecks and creating a timeline to achieve high economic growth was held recently at the BMICH where the guest speaker was the eminent Prof. Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
Prof. Hausmann visited Sri Lanka to follow-up on a programme to build capacity among senior officials at the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, the Export Development Board and Tourism Authority.
Prof. Hausmann began by stating that Sri Lanka does have strengths, for example in the Human Development Index, having achieved a massive reduction of poverty levels. However, the country has suffered in the last four years from slow economic growth rates which are below 4%.
This is contrast to many of our Asian neighbours whose economies have grown at rates of about 7% or even more. Hence there was a need to reaccelerate the Sri Lankan economy.
One explanation that can be provided for the shortcoming was that Sri Lanka's exports have not really experienced growth when compared to the growth of exports of many Asian countries. One of the main reasons for this, according to Prof. Hausmann, was that other Asian countries have diligently developed new types of businesses and have therefore successfully diversified their export base.
For example in recent years China has added 70 new products for exports while Sri Lanka has only achieved 7 products. The importance of the new products to the economy is that they contribute towards boosting the GDP of the country.
In the case of China the economy has also become technologically more advanced with a planned move from the production of garments to that of electronics and from there on, to producing machinery. Hence the addition of these new products has boosted China's exports and contributed to enriching the population.
In the case of Thailand there is also a movement to go into the production of machinery. Tunisia on the other hand has not achieved this transformation and Sri Lanka is still largely depended on the export of apparel.
Where Sri Lanka has achieved some successes in diversifying her exports, is in areas such as logistics, finances and tourism. Sri Lanka is also not a competitor of some of the low end countries in the area of manufacture. Hence this middle position does place the island nation in an ambiguous situation where it is imperative that it moves to a higher levels of production of exportable goods.
Prof. Hausman also addressed the question of how countries become wealthier. Drawing on Adam Smith's classic work "the Wealth of Nations", Hausmann stated that in the 18th Century the Netherlands was considered the richest country in the world and others were more or less equivalent.
However, in today's global economy there are enormous disparities between states with Malawi being considered the world poorest country. In the Western atmosphere that position is held by Haiti.
Furthermore there are enormous discrepancies that exist even within individual countries, with an enormous diversity between regions. In Mexico for example the poorest state Guerrero has a GDP of US$ 5,000 while the state of Nuevo Leon, the GDP is at $42,000, which is comparable to that of the Republic of Korea.
Hence there is a factor of eight just between regions of Mexico and this divergence exists in many countries in the world.
The assimilation of technology has an important part to play in these differences and the Prof. Hausmann elaborated as to what really does constitute "technology". "Technology" is in fact a successful assimilation achieved by having the right tools, the right codes or procedures, but more importantly the necessary know how to make development possible.
In order to acquire successfully the necessary technology, a country should have heterogeneous teams that work together to achieve the necessary requirements needed for technology to exist.
Hausman also examined the case of two individuals, the former being an Inuit living by catching fish, building his own igloo and travelling by dog sleigh and then comparing him to a modern office worker using a computer. He added that whilst the latter may seem technologically more advanced, he would be totally incapable of surviving in a hostile environment like the Arctic. Hence the question of what really does constitute technology remains a highly debatable subject.
The technological complexity of many products manufactured today such as a Boeing airliner is often more than what a single country can hope to produce. Hence in today's globalized economy, technology is not confined within the borders of a single country but often scattered in many parts of the world. Successful production is therefore based on the ability to work together to build complex products, such as commercial aircraft.
Generally speaking, rich countries make complex goods while poor countries are forced to produce relatively few goods that almost every other country is quite capable of making.
Sri Lanka's position is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum of nations. However, this analysis is somewhat complex since within countries such as Turkey and Mexico there are considerable differences with regards to the type of goods produced.
Hausmann said that a country like India endowed with advanced technology and therefore has what it takes to be a rich country. However, that is not a case. By the same token Greece which has relatively little technology and knowhow does in fact enjoy comparative wealth.
First for Sri Lanka to achieve greater wealth she would need to add more letters to her portfolio under so called "scrabbles theory". Sri Lanka would need to achieve greater complexity in production capability and achieve a higher quantum of knowhow.
What is also needed is a clear understanding of industries and particularly acquire the ability to moving to clusters of industries. A country is in fact a collection of technologies and these determine the extent to which development takes place.
Hausmann cites the case of examples of Ghana and Thailand to show how development can take shape.
In 1962 the two countries were in fact similar in terms of GDP per capital and in fact Ghana may have even been advantaged, having invested more in education and benefiting from being an English speaking country. But Thailand moved from the production of agricultural products and built new exports such as electronics and later machinery. Today Thailand manufactures electronics, cars and trucks while Ghana is still dependent on cocoa and manganese exports. The case of Sri Lanka is in fact similar. Some decades back Vietnam and Sri Lanka were in fact comparable in economic terms. Sri Lanka exports today apparel, tea and rubber. But the country faces the challenge of finding a way to diversify its basket of exports. Vietnam on the other hand has succeeded in considerably widening the number of exports having initially started at a similar level to Sri Lanka.
In the future Sri Lanka will produce products such as medical equipment particularly those where textile and rubber (both leading exports at present) can be combined to manufacture specific medical products. Harvard University is currently working with the BOI and the Ministry of Development Strategy and International Trade to develop a new products space for the country.
Sri Lanka's success in the long term will be determined by the extent to which the country can develop a great diversity of skills which in term will be the catalysts for manufacturing a wide range of advanced products.
Hausmann also raised the issue of how knowhow is a highly mobile force in the global economy. This mobility can take place between firms, through immigration, by the existence of a large overseas diaspora, through business travel and finally Foreign Direct Investment.
These are factors which Sri Lanka can in fact exploit effectively particularly when it comes to the overseas diaspora.
The case of China is very apparent: there is considerable evidence that overseas Chinese returned to China when Deng Xiaoping came to power. Those overseas Chinese brought in skill and knowhow that jump started the new liberalised Chinese economy. A similar scenario could be considered possible in the case of Sri Lanka where a large overseas population could play a role in bringing in knowhow.
Hausmann also spoke of the need to understand better the dynamics of business travel to ascertain whether it could lead to greater investment and exports.
In addition it is imperative that FDI as a percentage of the GDP be increased if Sri Lanka is to achieve greater wealth. Today FDI is just 1% of the country's GDP, which contrasts with Albania where FDI is already 10% of the GDP, while in Singapore's case it has achieved a staggering 15% of the GDP.
It is therefore clear that there is a strong connection between the level of technology that a country has succeeded in achieving and investment inflows and wealth of the said country. Prof. Hausmann's lecture created awareness on the need to create a diversified Sri Lanka economy with a high level of technology and knowhow where FDI will play a leading part.

Professionals  should not allow  politicians to disrupt  development - FM
Professionals should not allow bureaucrats and inefficient politicians to disrupt ongoing development drive, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said. He said many public officials and even certain politicians keep silence in the face of such bureaucracy consequently suppressing the innocent people of this country. The minister expressed these views at the inaugural ceremony of the Diploma in Public Procumbent and Contract Administration Training Course held at the Miloda Financial Academy in Colombo this morning (January 23). A Procurement Specialist and Fraud Investigator Dr. Colin Cram of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in Britain delivered the keynote address.
Karunanayake said professionals today need not to fear to challenge bureaucrats and inefficient politicians.
He pointed out that professionals should come forward to implement the development drive introduced by the current government.
The minister said that it is no point if it is unable to prove walk the talk. He said many public servants are reluctant to challenge inefficient politicians therefore they just keep silent and get accustomed to the entrapping system.
Karunanayake who explained how public funds are lost due to inefficiency and corruption in the procurement process pointed out that such large sums of money could be saved by improving efficiency in the part of public servants.
He said drastic changes need to be made in the Procurement Commission and in its Appeal Board; therefore the President and the Prime Minister have appointed a Special Cabinet Subcommittee intending to correct this situation.
He said the entire world is facing economic turbulences today and the reason for top world investors to eye on Sri Lanka is the disciplined and coherent economic foundation that we built in the country during the current regime.
The minister reiterated that the duty of all professionals is to forget the past and make commitments to enable this efficient government to reach its set goals and face impending global challenges.

Red tape forcing exporters out of industry
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and targets to increase exports may come to naught as a recent study conducted by Verite Research which shows that administrative procedures and bureaucratic red tape were forcing exporters to leave the industry all together.
The government has set a 30 billion target for exports in the 2017 Budget, but the question is how are we going to meet it questioned 2nd Vice Chairman of the Lanka Fruit and Vegetable Producers, Processors and Exporters Association, Suresh Ellawala.
He pointed out that the members of his own association had faced grave issues within our own domestic borders when exporting perishable items.
According to Doing Business Index 2017 of the World Bank, it takes 76 hours on an average to comply with the export documentary requirements in Sri Lanka, compared to just 11 hours in Thailand.
Given these persistent issues, the Exporters Association had requested that think tank Verite Research conduct a study on the issue and arrive at a solution to the problem.
Agriculture which accounts for 10 percent of GDP, employs 30 percent of the population and makes up 23 percent of the total exports in the country. Over the years however, we have come to dependent on certain exports lacking diversification, but our potential to do so had been limited by barriers within our own shores, explained Head of Economics at Verite Research Subhashini Abeysinghe, as she presented their findings last week.
At present, 13 percent of our agricultural exports are in spices, 20 percent in coconuts, 50 percent go to tea and all other exports make up 17 percent.
There is potential in increasing the share of this 17 percent, Abeysinghe said.
However, even if many exporters wished to increase or diversify their exports, Verite Researchs analysis showed that bureaucratic red tape, taxes, policy or the lack of it, infrastructure, regulations, lack of access to information, bribery and corruption, imposed major barriers to the desire for expansion.
Importers also complain that it was difficult to get quality products throughout the year from Sri Lanka, Abeysinghe said.
Barriers to trade
Abeysinghe added that these barriers to trade meant that Sri Lanka at 103 in the Enabling Trade Index, had dropped down to 19th place in the last two years.
Subhashini Abeysinghe and Nishan De Mel from Verite
As Executive Director of Verite Research, Nishan De Mel explained that falling behind in the index may not necessarily be because the government in the last two years did unusually badly, but because other exporting countries had managed to fare much better.
The rest have moved forward, while we havent moved at all, he said, explaining that countries such as Bangladesh, had introduced online systems such as the Bangladesh Trade Portal, which provided all the information an exporter would need in one place. The portal was also regularly updated to keep track with any new policy or regulation changes.
In Sri Lanka in the meantime, information was often hard to find, costly or unreliable.
The Fish exporters website have some information, but it had not been updated since 2009, De Mel pointed out adding, Often exporters have complained that they travel to the airport to find that the rules have changed.
An analysis of the seven government agencies: National Plant Quarantine Service, Forest Department, Department of Fisheries, Seed Certification and Plant Protection Centre, National Fertilizer Secretariat, Registrar of the Pesticides and Department of Import and Export Control, showed that only two (Forest Department and Department of Import and Export Control) out of the seven agencies, had an updated contact point and only the Department of Import and Export Control, had a list of restricted/prohibited items. The National Fertilizer Secretariat performed the worst out of the lot with no information available for an updated point of contact, up-to-date application form, information on the time limit the procedure would take, fees, restricted or prohibited list and list of relevant procedures.
We need to make more information available online and at present, there is no official to be held accountable for not providing information, Abeysinghe said.
The government however, has promised that with the Right to Information Act coming into effect from February 3, the government would be made more transparent.
More checks
Once an exporter does manage to receive the information needed, the next major roadblock in his/her way is getting the produce out of the country.
The goods are checked by the Air Force, Quarantine, Sri Lanka Customs and Sri Lanka Cargo. In the process, boxes are opened several times, explained De Mel, adding,
Goods which needed to be exported under pre-cooled conditions are being checked under hot-open environments, while the products get exposed.
Products such as ornamental fish which need to be exported in a dark and cool environment, are checked several times under light and hot conditions, thus disturbing the fish, while many die in the process, De Mel said.
Though the fish die at the Bandaranaike International Airport, the government continues to encourage ornamental fish exporters to increase their exports. In 2015, the government earned Rs. 2,392 million in export earnings as a result of exports.
Ellawala pointed out that more fish could be exported, if the time taken to export was cut down.
The team at Verite Research, suggested that the officials either pay a visit to the warehouse where the produce is stored under strict conditions to conduct inspections or have adequate facilities and adopt proper procedures if they are to carry out inspections at the airport.
With goods being checked in four places, the checks themselves have become redundant and many exporters have pointed out that it was not even necessary to have the Air Force check the goods, eight years since the end of the war.
Such procedures lead to increased time and costs, while reducing the quality of the products. We need to cut down on checking time and train those who check, explained De Mel.
In addition, Sri Lanka Cargo faces further delays due to increased loading times.
Sri Lanka has requested that producers bring their products to the Airport six hours ahead of departure, while many other major export countries request between 4-1.5 hours. Thai Cargo, which is one of the biggest exporters only expect the products between 1.5-2 hours, De Mel said.
Abeysinghe pointed out that countries such as Turkey which identified that exporters were spending too much time tied up in unnecessary procedure, introduced a system based on risk assessments to minimize physical checking. This had cut down the time spent waiting by more than half.
Dwindling exports
As exporters spend countless hours trying to get their perishable items out of the country, Verite Researchs study revealed many exporters to have said that they decided to simply drop the business or diversify into other areas.
In year 2000, exports made up 33 percent of the countrys GDP, but by 2015, it had dropped to 12.7 percent GDP.
Associations according to our research, dont see new exporters coming in, said Abeysinghe.
The solutions however are clear and could be controlled by our own government, she added.
Successive government she said, have stated that agriculture was an important factor in their policy but have done very little to ease trade barriers for agricultural exports.
Government sectors often work in isolation and lack communication. They also lack a broader view of what they do and the impact of their actions have on the economy, added Abeysinghe.
This time around too, the Prime Minister has indicated that he wants to make Sri Lanka an important hub for agricultural exports.
The President and the Prime Minister, have focused their attention on formulating a new agricultural policy. Our policy is anchored on the requirement to make the country self-sufficient in maize, soya beans, chilies, onions and potatoes by 2018 through crop diversification and productivity improvements and graduate into an agri-business from subsistence economy, whereby we would access export markets by 2020, as stated by Budget 2017.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in this years Budget not only called for an increase in exports, but explained that the government would create specialized agricultural and fishery export zones in the country. The Ministry of Primary Industries will be allocated Rs. 2,000 million for the establishment of the proposed agricultural and fishery export zones, stated the Budget.
In a bid to ease procedural barriers, the government also promised to, Restructure the BOI, the Export Development Board and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, with a view to improve operational efficiency and to facilitate investments. Until the restructuring process is completed, an organization under the name Agency for Development will be established.
Furthermore, the 2017 Budget also stated that, A high level body who could take policy decisions and clear bottlenecks will be formed to ensure successful implementation and effective monitoring of the export strategy of the country. Therefore, an Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM) chaired by the President, as mandated by Statute and comprising the Prime Minister and other relevant Ministers, will be appointed. This would synergize the strength of all stakeholders involved in export promotion, development and facilitation, by removing the duplication of work among institutions, ensuring regular monitoring of the progress, taking corrective action and effectively moving towards the achievement of medium to long term export targets.
The Minister also touched on making information available for all as he proposed to, make it mandatory for commercial sections of Sri Lankan Diplomatic missions to provide a market guide on products and services of interest to local businesses periodically, which would be made available on websites of the Department of Commerce and Export Development Board (EDB).
In addition, he stated that the, EDB would be strengthened to enhance export promotional activities and I also propose that the EDB should actively be engaged in exploring new markets for Sri Lankan exports and carry out extensive brand promotions, particularly for IT, Spices, Gem and Jewelry and to find new markets.
Amidst these lofty ideals, exporters continue to complain that the main problem lay in getting the goods they have out of the country.
We dont advocate the removal of regulations. There should be regulations but they have to be effective, efficient and information has to be clearly communicated, De Mel said.
Ellawala in the meantime, pointed out that exporters were wasting time by trying solve the bottlenecks, instead of concentrating on exporting more produce.
Some of these regulations could be taken out, but are you ready to do that Are you ready to play ball, he questioned the government.

Samsung Q4  operating profit up 50% on-year
Samsung's profits jumped 50 percent on-year in the fourth-quarter, as a diverse business portfolio helped cushion the fallout from a massive product recall of its Galaxy Note 7 handsets and investigations of its senior executives in an on-going corruption scandal. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Samsung Electronics - the flagship of South Korea's biggest conglomerate - said consolidated operating profit for the October-December 2016 quarter came in at 9.22 trillion Korean won ($7.9 billion), up 50.16 percent from 6.14 trillion won from a year earlier. The earning was in line with expectations, based on guidance provided previously.
The outlook is less positive for the January-March 2017 quarter, where Samsung expects a drop in earnings from higher marketing expenses for its mobile division and a drop in sales of TVs due to weak seasonal demand.
Investors had a positive response to the earnings report, with Samsung shares up 0.26 percent at 1,908,000, beating the broader Kospi index which slipped 0.20 percent.
Samsung also said it planned to buy back 9.3 trillion won worth of shares this year, which is about 3.14 percent of its total market value, adding that the plan aims to reduce the total number of outstanding shares.
The standout performer was the semiconductor business, which supplies memory chips to other companies including Apple, Samsung's main rival in the smartphone business.
Operating profit in that division climbed 76.78 percent on-year to 4.95 trillion won for the quarter, and overall it accounted for nearly 47 percent of Samsung's annual profit numbers. The company expects stable demand for memory storage from smartphones and servers in 2017.
Still, some pointed to limits on how long the unit may bolster Samsung's earnings as continued price rises are eventually expected to curb demand.
"We expect memory prices to peak by the September quarter, so you are looking at a situation where there are two more quarters of sequential increase," said Mehdi Hosseini, senior vice president for semiconductors at Susquehanna Financial Group, told CNBC's "Street Signs."
Samsung's display business, which makes OLED panels used on a variety of devices, saw quarterly operating profit jump from 300 billion won to about 1.34 trillion won on-year. The mobile business also showed signs of recovery, with operating profit up 12 percent on-year to 2.5 trillion won, helped by strong sales of the existing flagship models - the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge - and "improved profitability" in the mid-to-low end models, Samsung said. For the full financial year, overall operating profit climbed 10.7 percent at 29.24 trillion won on-year, after the mobile business took a massive 96 percent hit in the July-September quarter from the discontinuation of the fire-prone Note 7 handsets.

SL migrant workers should be given protection and welfare: Ranil
Foreign employment has become one of our major incomes. As the government, we are responsible to look at how the selections for employments are made, how our migrant workers get themselves registered and find employment, and most importantly what happens when they return, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said
Sri Lanka focuses on social protection and welfare of its foreign employees as a key pointer in promoting migrant employments in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Migrant employment is one economic arrangement to determine a better life standard in Sri Lankan society. It partly has paved way to extend the middle class of the country, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the 4th Ministerial Consultation of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue (ADD) held yesterday at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo. The ADD is a mechanism that strengthen the network of cooperation related to the foreign employment.
Wickremesinghe said the very reason Sri Lanka has a separate ministry to handle foreign employment promotion and welfare is because migrant employment is a pillar in Sri Lanka's economic success, especially with regard to foreign exchange.
The Prime Minister said several key issues are related to foreign employments when they come to Sri Lanka.
First, how are we to treat the migrant workers who contributed much to the foreign exchange of Sri Lanka on their return. Secondly, in what ways are we looking into the issue of their families, he said.
The Premier said the government was concerned over the social cost for some of the families whose members have migrated for work.
When both parent migrate for work, who are going to take care of their children and the rest of their family he questioned.
Wickremesinghe said that more than any other issues regarding to migrant employments, the fact that most of the Sri Lankan migrant workers being females, is something that the government has to pay much concern to.
How do we safeguard these women, is the enormous issue we have. A forum such as the ADD that gathers all stakeholders in foreign employment should address grave questions as these, he said.
Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is not only a beneficiary but also a benefactor of foreign employments.
Thus, the Sri Lankan government is also concerned on a social effort designed to hand out ownership of land to the plantation community, which is an extension of early migrant workers settlements in Sri Lanka, he said.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka is the only country which was able to have an amicable settlement with the migrant workers brought in for plantation work in the colonial time.
Sri Lanka gave these migrant workers citizenship. We have taken over all the welfare services, and we are now engaged in other issues faced by this community. The government has encouraged them to work in sectors other than in plantation, he said.
The government is now promoting science education in the plantation community, so that they will be able to find work in different sectors, the Prime Minister said.
With the Plantation and Community Housing Minister, the government is now going to ensure that we provide seven perch of land to every family of the plantation community, Wickremesinghe said.
Sri Lanka is looking forward to exploit the Asia centered rapid development to become an economic hub of the Indian ocean, the Premier said.
Sri Lanka will become a center for logistics, business, and we ourselves are developing our own corridors for economic development. In this goal, foreign employment is a pillar, he said.

Smoking claims three lives every hour
Today ,even though a lot of people talk about the number of deaths due to dengue, three smoking related deaths occur every hour, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the awards presentation held at the BMICH, Colombo recently for the winners of the literary competition held among schools to mark World Diabetes Day, Minister Dr. Senaratne said that annually the Government spends Rs. 142 billion to treat patients with Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and Rs. 72 billion spend on treating patients falling sick as a result of smoking. According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, 70 percent of hospital deaths occur in Sri Lanka today due to NCDs and people spend money to fall sick.
To address this issue steps were taken to increase tax on tobacco up to 90 percent. Today a Sri Lankan needs to spend Rs. 1000 to smoke a packet of cigarettes .
The Sri Lankan Government receives Rs. 100 billion as tax from tobacco but spends Rs 142 billion to treat people falling sick with NCDs.
The loss is Rs. 42 billion. Even if we calculate the difference between tobacco tax income and the money spent on treating patients with smoking related diseases, the difference (profit) is only Rs. 28 billion, he said.
No new liquor licenses had been issued and strict laws have been implemented on liquor.
All liquor shops have to close down with the expiration of their time because no new liquor licenses will be issued hereafter, he added.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya urged both the Government and Opposition members to be considerate and not to resort to character assassination during the course of debate yesterday. Parliament took up a full days adjournment debate on the COPE report on Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation yesterday.
The Speaker making a special request at the outset of the debate asked members of both sides to stick to the matter before the House and help him conduct an admirable and respectful session of Parliament.
He reminded them that the full session would go on live yesterday. Defying this request, MPs of both sides resorted to hurl abuse and make direct accusations against each other and officials.
A stormy debate ensued with crossfire between the MPs often in un-Parliamentary language forcing the Speaker to expunge certain sections of speeches from the Hanzard. The Speaker repeatedly warned the Parliamentarians to be mindful about their language and not to disturb the members as they take the floor.
At one point, the Speaker severely warned UPFA MP Lohan Ratwatte asking him not to disturb the proceedings.
I have been watching you since morning, and this is my third warning to you. If you continue to disturb the other members, I will be forced to take action, he said. The Speaker also warned UNP backbencher Nalin Bandara to be mindful of his language reminding him that, All members in this House are honourable MPs. Give that respect when addressing your fellow members.

Spicy aroma
Cinnamon which has become a precious money- spinner in present day Sri Lanka was originally grown wild in the forested locations of the hill country in Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Haputale and Siharaja Range.
Cinnamon trees found stil growing in wild in these areas could be considered as a clear proof of the origin of this unique spice scientifically known as  Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume indigenous to Sri Lanka.
On comparison to Cinnamon, no other spice in the world is shrouded in myths, legends and folktales encompassing even to distant ancient lands of Greece, Rome and Egypt. Reference had been made in the Holy Bible and other ancient chronicles of Greece, Rome and Egypt Relevant to cinnamon as a kind of precious and holy spice.
Cinnamon was also used in funeral pyres in the ancient Rome due to its inherent fragrance. The Emperor Nero was known to have burnt a huge stock of an annual collection of Cinnamon in the funeral pyre of his Queen Poppaea Sabina.
In ancient Egypt, cinnamon had been used in the preservation of mummies.
Cinnamon was used as a chief ingredient of producing perfumes in the ancient Rome. The Moorish merchants renown across the ancient world having the monopoly of Cinnamon had resorted to numerous cunning devices to hide the origin of Cinnamon to the rest of the world.
They concocted fairy tales and narrated them to the European buyers in convincing the hazardous manner of obtaining this precious spice of cinnamon. Herodotus the Greek historian referring to how people obtained Cinnamon had stated Eagles who make their nests on inaccessible rocks and tall mountain cliffs out of Cinnamon trees grown in wild.
As a device to bring down the cinnamon sticks people keep huge pieces of meat in close proximity to the rocks and trees where the eagles had built their nests out of Cinnamon sticks. The piece of meat was a kind of a bait and when the bird flew to its nest carrying the huge piece of meat due to its weight the nest was broken down and the cinnamon sticks thus fallen were collected by the people.
Roman Philosopher Pliny the Elder had believed that cinnamon originated in Ethiopia and carried in rafts without oars or sails and operated by man himself with his undaunted courage. Another myth relevant to the origin of cinnamon was that Cinnamon was found in  deep canyons Guarded by poisonous serpents.
Due to ever expanding demand in ancient West for the precious indigenous Sri Lankan Cinnamon known as  Cinnamomum zeylanicum, several European Explorers undertook numerous painstaking ventures to trace the origin of cinnamon. Christopher Columbus and Gonzalo Pizzaro were two well known explorers who sought after Cinnamon.
In order to keep the origin of cinnamon as a top secret , the Moorish merchants had sent Sri Lankan cinnamon through circuitous land routes first to Indonesia from there to East Africa and later transported from East Africa to the rest of the countries in Europe. But the Portuguese fleet led by Lorenzo de Almeida had blown off course and reached Galle Port on Novemcer 15th 1505. Their arrival in Sri Lanka could completely changed the political landscape of the country.
The Portuguese had a big trade competition with the Arabian traders who held the monopoly of spice trade in the Asian region and later the Portuguese undertook the Cinnamon trade of the country. After the Dutch invasion, an agreement was signed between the Dutch Administrators and King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe on 14th February 1767. In return to the military support provided to King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe in defeating the Portuguese , the Dutch had been allowed to cut and produce cinnamon in certain areas of the country.
In 1796 the British acquired the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka along with the Cinnamon industry dominated by the Dutch. By the year 1850 nearly 50,000 acres of cinnamon cultivations were found across Sri Lanka but since the introduction of coconut cultivation people tuned towards coconut culvation ignoring the cinnamon.
Major cinnamon cultivations are found in Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Rathnapura , and in the hinterlands of Ambalangoda, Karandeniya, Uragaha, Batapola, Meetiyagoda and several other villages of the Southern province.
According to the latest statistics In the Galle district there are 10,644 hectares under Cinnamon cultivation, Matara 7,926 hectares Hambantota 2,313 and Kalutara 2,633 hectares are found under Cinnamon cultivation. In Sri Lanka , traditionally cinnamon has been identified as belonged to five varieties of  Pani Misis Kurundu ,  Pani Rasa Kurundu ,  Sevala Kurundu  Kahata Kurundu and  Thitha Kurundu according to the taste and strength of the inner bark and the leaves.
All those who are engaged in the cinnamon industry in the cinnamon growing areas of Sri Lanka now a days earn a good income.
Local prices vary from Rs. 2100 to Rs. 3000 per kilo of produced Cinnamon. In the past it was considered as a cottage industry and less attention was paid for the quality by those who are engaged in cinnamon products at grassroot levels.

Sri Lanka should not expand use of coal for power generation: Robert Watson
Professor Robert Tony Watson yesterday said that Sri Lanka should not expand the use in coal for power generation anymore, since coal burning impacts immensely on environment pollution on to climatic change. Professor Watson added that there was no need to bend on coal-powered electricity generation, as Sri Lanka is rich in renewable energy resources. In the power market in the world context, solar and wind powers are crushing fossil energy, he said, saying that fossil power is replaced by solar and wind power in the present day context. He made these remarks yesterday, while delivering the keynote address at a forum organised by the American Chamber of Commerce under the theme Climatic Change: Opportunities and Challenges for Business, at the Gall Face Hotel in Colombo.
Professor Watson is chair of the Intergovernmental Assessment Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. Previously he has chaired or co-chaired several international scientific, technical and economic assessments. Professor Watson noted that Sri Lanka is rich in natural and renewable resources, which could be utilised for satisfying the demand for power rather than relying on coal power. Wind power and solar power could easily be utilised for power generation. He added that fossil fuel burning both for power generation and transportation, causes a severe impact on environment pollution. Speaking on the global threats caused by the environment pollution, he said that it had been noticed that there was a rise in global mean sea level. Besides, ocean acidification is also another threat to the entire world.
He said that deforestation would undermine Sri Lankas tourism industry. Speaking on carbon dioxide emission, he added that Sri Lankan carbon dioxide emission rate is 0.8 compared with certain countries. He urged that Sri Lanka should have a sustainable development strategy. Attending on these issues is critically important for Sri Lanka to move forward, he said.He further said that it is vital to increase energy efficiency methods while bending on utilizing sustainable energy resources. Businesses globally are seeing challenges, but also opportunities in responding to climate change.
Investment in low carbon technology, both energy efficiency and generation, are at an all-time high. Companies may face additional challenges if buyers impose limits on the carbon intensity of products.
Sri Lankan businesses have a significant opportunities to leapfrog to a new energy paradigm to achieve its goals, while mitigating climate change and adapting to the grave risks posed by climate change.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest at the event.

SriLankan Airlines clarifying recent news reports on returning the three A350 aircraft said the total penalty paid was US$ 98 mn or Rs 14.7 bn and not Rs 150 bn as reported,the airline said in a press release yesterday.
Among the many challenges inherited by the present management of the national carrier, was the decision to order eight A350 aircraft by the previous management of SriLankan Airlines.
There was no existing business plan that supported the acquisition of this, or any other new long-range aircraft. A study commissioned by a consultant for the airline, compared the A350 vs B787, but at no stage were the economics of a new long range aircraft ever considered.
The A350 is an extra wide-body aircraft that is specifically designed for long haul routes. The main customer airlines utilize the aircraft on routes such as the Gulf to North America and Australia. Singapore Airlines uses the A350 on the worlds longest non-stop flight between Singapore and New York.
Continuing with the pragmatic approach to returning the national carrier to profitability, the decisions was made to withdraw from some of the European destinations. With this difficult decision, the A350 aircraft became an unnecessary type for the airline. It was decided to negotiate with the owner and lessor Aercap to enable the cancellation of these aircraft. The previous management had also ordered seven A330-300 aircraft as replacement for the ageing A340 aircraft for operations on our European Routes.
These which attracts a lease cost of approx. US$ 1 Mn. per aircraft, incurred losses of US$29,640Mn in 2015/16 and had we taken and operated the A350 aircraft at a monthly lease cost of US$1,425,000 per aircraft, the losses would have been significantly higher. We would also have a contingent liability of US$800 Mn. over the 12 year period and also an operating loss of US$50 Mn a year or US$600 Mn over the same period. As such SriLankan averted payment of US$100Mn a year by returning these four A350 aircrafts and the termination fee will be recovered in 14 months.
The termination agreement and charges were discussed and approved by all the relevant ministries, the CCEM and the Cabinet.
The suggestion of purchasing these aircraft from the lessor to sell these off in the secondary market was rejected by Aercap, who clearly informed that they are not in the business of selling aircraft but only leasing them.
The market value of a new A350 is in the range of US$170-200Mn and it was highly unlikely that the airline would have been able to sell these aircraft anywhere close to this price.

Starry confession
Its the stars. Millions of miles away, staying at the dim abyss of the universe, they keep on staring (glaring may be). I knew it. There were moments, when I felt the unbearable weight of their stare upon me, sometimes like a prickling thorn, going deep and deep into the core of me, piercing the layers of my skin, deeply perforating my flesh, an aching journey through my veins towards the bones and finally it was in.
I was always afraid of the one who slept at the dark depth of me, a creature longed to break the manacles and to tear down the neat boundaries around. I knew its power, if unleashed, the destruction and turmoil it can create in the story of life, disarraying the orderly chapters. At times, when it came out, unbolting the locked doors, I remember, how greedily it sucked the raw air around. When realized that its high time not to let it overwhelm my conscience, it was sent back to the same old corner, sometimes by force, whipping it mercilessly until it subdues or sometimes with deception, singing a little lullaby until it tames and agrees to sleep. But I never had the spirit to kill it; the wild, unrefined, pure creature, always conquered by self conscience and the written and unwritten laws of the world we belong to.
But finally it was in, the penetrating stare of the stars above. It didnt halt at the bones, the painful journey continued, piercing and piercing until it reached its destination. It knocked on the locked doors softly and urged the creature who was fast asleep to wake up.
I repeat, its the stars. The conscience and the urge to break free were at a dilemma, an aching sensation to break the doors and a moral plea to impede at the border. But far above the dark universe, it was written, it was written to break free (or maybe it was ruin which was written). So I let it happen and I let the stare of the stars to surmount. Passing the border, now its the expedition through the no mans land, the gravest distance, until I meet the border at the other end.

A total revival of tea, coconut and rubber underway
Supply and demand is the decisive factor for tea, rubber and coconut markets.Two years back tea was priced Rs 300 per kilogram.Now it has marked a stable price of Rs 500 and this is a positive gesture for tea smallholders, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
The Minister said a total revamping is being done as regards planting and selling of the three major crops tea, coconut and rubber and in 2017 new export markets will be developed for these crops. Drought relief and fertilizer concessions will be given to three sectors.
China, Syria and Middle East are potential new markets for Ceylon tea. Russian market has to be secured again. Our global campaign will commence in April, he said.
Around 20 mn kilos of refused tea enter the marketplace.Currently these come to auctions as an off-grade commodity via RPCs (regional plantation companies). We intend to change policy to pave way for private sector to openly enter the selling process. It will be regularized by the ministry and the private sector must obtain ISO 3720 standards to make sure the quality of their tea is never comprised. It will create a win-win situation, Dissanayake said.
Rubber will be cultivated afresh in a 7000 hectare area this year. Rubber price has consolidated and fresh tapping will be commenced in March. For replanting Rs 175,000 is given now. It will be increased to Rs 325,000. An investment of US$ 65 million by IFAD will be used for replanting especially in areas such as Moneragala.
The tyre factory commissioned in Horana is a good investment that will add value to the economy and secure a new market for small rubber estate owners.
As regards coconut, currently there is a scarcity for nuts. The total current demand for local consumption and exports is 3500 million nuts.Yet the current supply is 3000 million nuts.
Hence we intend to plant 500 million coconut seedlings in 2017.Treasury has granted Rs 750,000 million for replanting.We have targeted to do plantations in North and East to increase the volume of nuts. This year we will emphasize on developing the Northern coconut triangle,the Minister said.

Trump orders pull out of TPP trade deal
President Donald Trump has fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
The 12-nation trade deal was a linchpin of former President Barack Obamas Asia policy.
Great thing for the American worker what we just did, said Trump as he dumped the pact with a stroke of a pen.He also cut funding for international groups that provide abortions, and froze hiring of some federal workers.
Trumps executive order on TPP was largely symbolic since the deal has not been ratified by a divided US Congress.During his presidential campaign, he criticised the accord as a potential disaster for our country, arguing it harmed US manufacturing.
His action won some plaudits from the left as well as the right.Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders told the BBC he backed it because trade deals like this have been a disaster and cost millions of jobs.
The trade deal, which covered 40% of the worlds economy, was negotiated in 2015 by nations including the US, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico.
TPPs stated aim was to strengthen economic ties and boost growth, including by reducing tariffs
It included measures to enforce labour and environmental standards, copyrights, patents and other legal protections.
The agreement, backed heavily by US business, was designed to potentially create a new single market likened to the EU.
Critics argued it was a not-so-secret gambit to box in China, which is not part of the agreement.

Trump vows to build Mexico wall

President Donald Trump will take executive action Wednesday directing federal resources toward building a border wall, a White House official confirmed to CNN.
The move begins a multi-day roll out of immigration actions that's also expected to include moves related to refugees and visas.
Trump will make the announcement during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security at 1:25 p.m. ET.
Trump himself hinted at Wednesday's move on Twitter, writing: Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!

Trump plans to issue two executive orders Wednesday during his visit to the Department of Homeland Security, according to a person familiar with the President's plan.
The first will direct the agency to begin construction of the border wall, as well as take steps to repair existing areas of fencing along the frontier between the US and Mexico.
The order will also include a mandate to increase staff at Customs and Border Protection by 5,000 and alleviate the flood of migrants fleeing violence in Central America.
According to the person familiar with the plans, Trump's executive order will require DHS to publicly detail what aid is currently directed to Mexico, an indication of an eventual move toward redirecting some of that money to fund the wall's construction  and giving cover for a longstanding campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the structure.
A second order will work to eliminate so-called sanctuary cities, where municipal governments refuse to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. That order will triple resources for Immigration and Custom Enforcement and direct the federal government to identify criminal aliens in the US.
Officials said Trump would wait until later in the week to take action on visas and refugees, potentially as early as Thursday.
An order being prepared for Trump's signature includes the drastic measure of suspending the entire refugee programme for four months in an attempt to gauge which country's migrants pose the least risk for US national security.
A programme for admitting Syrian refugees, who are fleeing civil war and a humanitarian crisis, would be ended indefinitely.
The measure being drafted specifies that migrants who engage in bigotry, so-called honor killings by males of their female relatives, and violence against women shouldn't be admitted.
It caps the total number of refugees admitted in the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000 and it directs the Pentagon and US State Department to plan safe zones inside Syria, which the previous administration rejected as unlikely to alleviate civilian suffering.
Trump launched his campaign on a hardline immigration policy, proposing to build a great, great wall along the US-Mexico border and later to institute a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until the US government could properly vet people coming in.
But as time went on, Trump's rhetoric on immigration began to change and, at times, soften.
His aides eventually walked back the Muslim ban to a ban on immigration from countries with widespread terrorism issues. And while Trump promised to deport all people in the country illegal throughout the campaign, Sean Spicer, his press secretary, said Monday that repealing President Barack Obama's two immigration executive actions were not the President's prime focus.
First and foremost, the President's been very, very clear that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record - a criminal record or poses a threat to the American people, Spicer said. That's where the priorities going to be.

The World Bank(WB) has said that they are not aware of international best practices to accurately calculate the potential loss in the case of past bond auction.
World Bank country Director Idah Pswarayi  Riddihough in a letter to the Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake has stressed that quantifying the loss accurately would require knowledge of the actual cost of the bond placement under non competitive allocation (a necessary counterfactual). In our view that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an expost basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date, she has said in her letter to Ekanayake.
The World Bank hopes to effectively and immediately contribute to the design of auction rules and practices for issuing government debt in the upcoming joint mission with the IMF, the letter said.
The targeted mission will be further complemented with a range of technical assistance activities to support development of the government bond market and the capital market at large including the formulation of Medium Term Debt Management Strategy, the letter added.

As an overview, we can say that between Galaxy A series and Galaxy S series there is one basic difference in the overall features and qualities. The S series are being released for high-end market, whereas the A series are being released mostly for mid-end market. Thus, from the target market alone, the S series are superior in terms of features and overall performance as compared with the A series. The S series will always have the latest features embedded into it, with each feature carrying the highest quality of performance.
2. Design
The two models are designed differently. The S series are designed with the basic design common in Samsung smartphones, with mostly plastic materials for its exterior. The A series, on the other hand, are designed with elegance in mind, since it is mostly used to compete with Apples iPhone in terms of design. Thus, youll see that the A series will have superior design on its exterior and material quality, in which the phone will look more beautiful and elegant when you compare it with the S series.

We will always see that the latest S series have the highest performance when you compare it with all the smartphone models released by Samsung. With the A series, you can see that this model is being fragmented into two parts, with the first part being the models with lower specs, and the second part being the models with higher specs.
4. Price
There is a little bit of gap in the pricing between the Galaxy S series and the high-end part of the Galaxy A series. But overall, the price for the S series will always be higher because these models are released for the high-end market, whereas the A series are released for the middle to high-end market, depending on the model. So, you can always find cheaper price for the A series.
5. Conclusion
If you are looking for a phone with the highest performance and richer features, the Galaxy S series will be the best choice for you. But, if you are looking for a phone with better design, good performance, and cheaper price, the A series might be your best choice.

World's most corrupt countries: Transparency International.

Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea and Syria are perceived to be the most corrupt countries in the world, according to Transparency International's latest annual review that draws on a mix of business and government sources for its rankings.
Somalia has held the undesirable title as the world's most corrupt country for the past ten years, with a score of 10 on the Corruption Perceptions Index 2016, which ranks countries' public sector from zero to 100.
Countries with a lower score are deemed to be more corrupt, and are generally characterized by impunity for corruption, poor governance and weak institutions, the report said.
Second from the bottom is South Sudan, a relatively new country which only gained its independence from Sudan six years ago, with a score of 11. The third most corrupt country is North Korea, followed by Syria, a war-torn country which is presently seeing a massive outflow of refugees.
Countries in the Middle East suffered the worst declines on the corruption index, led by Qatar which fell 10 scores from the previous year due to scandals such as FIFA's decision to host the World Cup 2022 in Qatar amid reports of migrant workers abuse, Transparency International said.
