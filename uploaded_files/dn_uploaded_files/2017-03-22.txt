Border rows vs growing bonds
Chinese Defence Minister Gen.Chang Wanquan, a leading figure in the countrys defense apparatus, and a high profile delegation arrived in Sri Lanka for a hurriedly planned three day visit, earlier this week.
During the visit, the Chinese defence bigwig held crucial discussions with the top brass of the national unity government, including President Maithripala Sirisena.
The visit takes place against a backdrop where China has identified Sri Lanka as an important strategic partner in the light of the One Belt One Road economic programme, which has been greeted with mixed reactions in the South Asian region.
Sri Lanka is about to enter into a comprehensive partnership with China on the development of the Hambanthota harbour. From Chinas point of view, the partnership is directly linked to the One Belt One Route project which aims to ensure Chinas dominance in the maritime sector in this region.
The initial agreement was to give China 80% stake of the harbour for 99 years. This arrangement came under criticism from various groups in the political circles and the government is now in the process of re-negotiating the deal with China. This is why the timing of the Chinese Defence Ministers visit to Sri Lanka is crucial.
Indias concerns
Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanguan
The Chinese Defence Ministers visit to Sri Lanka is a prelude to his visit to Nepal, the nation, which serves as a buffer between traditional rivals India and China.
Wabquan is likely to discuss the OBOR initiative, the Maritime Silk Road, and military cooperation with Nepal, a country with which China is aiming to revive ties, much to the resentment of India.
Indian media says New Delhi has already deployed former General Ashok Mehata to discuss OBOR and the Maritime Silk Road with its neighbors. Gen. Meheta will probably initiate discussions with Indias neighbouring countries following the Chinese Defence Ministers visit to Nepal.
If Indian media reports are something to go by, the Chinese Defence Ministers visit to Sri Lanka, before his visit to Nepal, will give Gen. Mehata a reason to reach out to the Sri Lankan authorities.
Meanwhile, Indias apprehension on the Chinese Defence Ministers visit came under criticism from the Chinese media which, to a great degree, echo the sentiments of the Chinese government.
China hits out at India over SL, Nepal
The Chinese state media article said New Delhi is always unnerved to see exchanges between Beijing and south Asian countries.
China hopes India can understand the pursuit of China and regional countries for common development, and be part of it. However, New Delhi doesnt share this thinking, instead seeking to balance China, the article, written by Ai jun, said.
If such tendencies in India continue, China will have to fight back, because its core interests will have been violated. This is not what we hope for, but the ball is in Indias court.
The tone of a report in the Hindustan Times sounds vigilant and sour. Claiming that Changs visit to Nepal and the first ever China-Nepal joint military drill has made New Delhi nervous, the newspaper also noted that the Nepalese government cannot afford to say no to Beijing as if China is carrying a stick around when interacting with its neighbours.
The truth is, however, it is India that has been treating south Asia and the Indian Ocean as its backyard with a hard-line manner. Its uneasiness toward Beijings growing influence in the region is obvious. For instance, New Delhi is one of the crucial reasons why China and Bhutan, which is controlled by India economically and diplomatically, have not yet established diplomatic relations.
Indias vigilance against China has also affected Sri Lanka and Nepals relations with Beijing. Even if they are trying to balance between the two giant neighbours, New Delhi still regards their neutrality as a pro-Beijing policy.
Ai added, Whenever a top leader from those countries visits China, the Indian media would hype that India is losing them or Chinas emerging weight in south Asia will be New Delhis new threat.
New Delhi should stop being extremely sensitive toward each and every move between China and its neighbours. Sri Lanka and Nepal are actually looking forward to joint projects with China, given their poor infrastructure.
When an increasing number of Chinese companies get established in these countries, it is inevitable that Beijing will boost defence collaboration with them to protect not only Chinas, but also the regions interest.
Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat is expected to fly to Katmandu, immediately after the Chinese Defence Ministers visit to the country.
The government of Nepal will confer an honorary military title to Rawat on March 29 at a special function for his commendable military prowess and immeasurable contribution to fostering Indias long-standing and friendly ties with Nepal and given the special military ties between Nepalese and Indian armies.
On the sidelines of the event, the Indian Army Chief is likely to hold discussions with the top echelons of Katmandu, including the President, the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister of Indias neighbouring state. It is against this backdrop that President Maithripala Sirisena left for Russia on an official visit in a bid to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries. President Sirisena will be the first Sri Lankan head of state to visit Russia in decades, although the two countries have maintained diplomatic relations for nearly 60 years.
During the visit, President Sirisena will hold a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 23.
The two leaders review the progress of longstanding bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Russia, including the way forward to further promote trade and investment.
Several bilateral agreements in the areas of fisheries, tourism, cultural and education cooperation, including cooperation in the science and technology sector, will be signed.
In order to actively promote trade and business linkages between the two countries, a Sri Lanka-Russia Business Forum will be held in Moscow, and Sri Lanka will be represented by a delegation of the Sri LankaRussia Business Council.
Russias game plan with SL
Russian President Vladimir Putin
Russias invitation to President Sirisena is one of many strategic moves by Russia to increase its influence in the South Asian region  especially apparent with its new nexus with Pakistan.
Russias current foreign policy, needless to say, is a sharp shift from the policy it espoused while in the Soviet Union.
Animosity with the United States and its allies during the Cold War of 1947  1991, led the Soviet Union to side with India during the Indo-Pakistan divide, while Pakistan remained a close ally of the United States.
Russia was at this point was the largest arms supplier to India and it can be argued that it was Pakistans alliance with the United States that pushed the Soviet Union in Indias direction.
Even after the Cold War, right until 2010, Russia maintained close ties with India in areas such as defence and nuclear energy. As a result, Russias relations with Pakistan did not pick up and the two countries continued to view each other with mistrust.
However, over the past two years, Russia has adopted significant measures to change its legacy from the past and align itself in the South Asian region: Russia lifted its embargo on supplying arms to Pakistan in 2014 and has since signed an agreement on military technical cooperation.
Russias decision to engage with Pakistan could also be the outcome of India choosing to strengthen ties with the U.S. Indias defence cooperation programmes with the US is cause for Russian concern, doubly so as the U.S. has now replaced Russia as the leading arms supplier to India.
The U.S. militarys covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden has also worked towards nudging Pakistan towards Russia: The US kept Pakistan in the dark about Operation Neptune Spear, implying that the terrorist group had the backing of Pakistan.
On September 29, 2016, a military confrontation between India and Pakistan began once again, with the Indian army conducting surgical strikes against militant launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir.
This tension between India and Pakistan led to a fresh crisis in the region forcing Pakistan to cancel the 19th SAARC summit scheduled for Islamabad in November 15-16.
The Indo-Pakistan power struggle in the region and Russias newfound interests in Pakistan sets the geopolitical background for Russias invitation to the Sri Lankan President.
It can be inferred from this invitation, that Russia intends build strong ties with two of Indias neighbours  Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Hendawitharana in hot water
Lasantha Wickrematunge
Former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematungas murder case made headlines on Tuesday with the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the Police informing the Mt. Lavinia Magistrate that a special unit, operated under former Army Intelligence Chief Maj. General Kapila Hendawitharana, carried out attacks on Wickrematunge.
The CID informed court that it had recorded a statement from the former Army Commander Field Marshal Fonseka on the killing of the late Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and the Field Marshal had told them that he had suspicions about a special unit operating under Hendawitharana to carry out certain attacks in the Colombo area.
Fonseka had also said he was not aware of the functioning of Hendawitharanas unit.
According to the B report filed by the CID, Fonseka had said the security in the capital city of Colombo, at the time of the murder, was handled by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Army intelligence chief Hendawitharana.
Citing the latest findings in its probe on the Wickrematunge killing, CID Inspector Nishantha Silva said former Sunday Leader Editor Wickrematunge had died due to an assault on his head by an unidentified sharp instrument and not by shooting.
The CID Inspector said the inquiries carried out after exhuming Wickrematunges body proved that his brain had been damaged due to the attack. The inquiry was conducted by Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Dr. Ajith Tennakoon.
Silva also said the CID investigation team, when examining evidence of the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge, had identified five phones that had been used by the attackers for their internal communication.
Investigations had revealed that the same phones had been used near Upali Tennakoons residence in Imbulgoda and in the vicinity of the Rivira Media Corporation to which both Upali Tennakoon and Keith Noyahr were attached.
According to the CID, four out of the five mobile phones had been purchased from the same location - a private business institution in Colombo 05.
This establishes the fact that the same group had carried out the attacks on Wickrematunge, Tennakoon and Noyahr within a period of six months.

BSM Germany to manage its  eirst ice class boxships
Germany-based maritime services firm Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) has taken Eilbek, the first of four ice class container feeder vessels, into management.
The remaining three ships, Barmbek, Reinbek and Flottbek, are expected to follow by mid-April, according to BSM.
Eilbek class feeder vessels are the first ships constructed and adapted for operation in ice class conditions to be managed by BSM Germany.
Management of these four ships marks another important milestone in BSM's continuing expansion into more specialist market segments, following entry into service of the highly sophisticated wind energy Service Operation Vessel, Windea La Cour, last June and the recent delivery of her sister vessel, Windea Leibniz, Jan Warmke, Managing Director of BSM Germany, said.
Built in 2004 and 2005 at Meyer-Werft in Papenburg, Germany, each of the ice-class ships has a capacity of 1,600 TEU and a service speed of up to 20 knots.
The move comes on the back of the acquisition of the four ice class container feeder vessels by an investor group represented by the Schulte Group. Following change of ownership, the vessels have been re-flagged from Liberia to Cyprus and will maintain their current time charter employments with Unifeeder, BSM informed.

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will hold a forum on 'How to convince Board to invest in digital to be held on March 24 to be held at the Hilton Colombo Residences.

The speakers are McKinsey and Company (London) Partner Ganaka Herath, John Keells Holdings Deputy Chairman Ajit Gunawardena, Sampath Bank Senior Director Sanjiva Senanayake and Fair First Insurance CEO Sanjeev Jha.
The Immersive Breakout Session titled, Understanding Digital to Invest in Digital and How to Convince Your Board, will focus on how senior executives in technology, finance and strategy can sharpen their decision making on digital investments in their companies, how digital champions of the companies can make a strong case for digital investments, and how they can make Boards of Directors understand the importance of digital investments.
Although, most leading businesses are keen to leverage on digital technologies, many don't know where to start. The C-Suite may be behind the curve and not understand, or they do and find it difficult to convince investors and the Board to agree to go ahead with digitalisation of firms.
Most importantly, speakers will touch on how to align a digital strategy to an overall transformation strategy and how to avoid wasted digital investments.
The event will enable the participants to learn about driving innovation in their organizations, dissect what changes are happening now, what are on the horizon, and how their company can adapt to face the future.

Elevators, a must for multi-storied buildings
Most of the multi-storied buildings (apartments /flats in Maligawatte, Armour Street, Maradana, Bambalapitiya, Princess Gate and several other flats ) constructed in the past do not have lifts.
Most of these have been constructed long ago without any provisions for lifts when people were healthy. Nowadays almost all the people not excluding the young ones are suffering from all sorts of aches and pains  hip ache, knee pain, spine ache, neck pain and whatnot! This makes it extremely difficult, causing a lot of inconvenience to both the inhabitants and the visitors when they have to climb the flight of steps. It is high time the Ministry of Housing and Construction or the National Housing Development Authority in conjunction with the respective Condominium Management Authority in charge of these flats installed lifts. The maintenance cost of these lifts could be borne monthly by the occupants.
Here is some potential for suppliers of lifts / elevators to generate some new business for them and at the same time facilitate easy access to higher floors especially to Level 3 or 4 and above. This will allow even the disabled as well to occupy / visit these multi-storied buildings.

Cruise Segment drives genting Hong Kong's revenue up
Genting Hong Kong, a part of Genting Group, has seen a surge in its revenue from cruise and cruise-related activities by over 39 percent to USD 908.1 million in 2016 from USD 652.8 million reported a year earlier.
The company said that its net revenue in 2016 rose to USD 689.7 million from USD 496.8 million in 2015, mainly due to an increase in capacity days of 18.7 percent and an improvement of 17 percent in net yield.
Capacity days and net yield improvements were in turn driven by the inclusion of full year contribution from Crystal Cruises in 2016, as compared with its post-acquisition contribution since May 2015 in the previous year, and the launch of Dream Cruises Genting Dream in late October 2016.
Although cruise and cruise-related activities recorded a positive EBITDA of USD 62.8 million in 2016, compared to USD 43.4 million in 2015, the group's EBITDA for the year was negative at USD 91 million, compared to USD 6.2 million in 2015.
Earlier in March, Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, hosted the float-out of the second mega block of World Dream, a cruise ship being built for Genting Hong Kong's Dream Cruises.
World Dream, the second cruise ship being built for the company, is expected to join its owner in fall this year.
The 151,300-gross ton cruise ship will be able to accommodate over 3,300 guests and will have a length of 335.4 meters and a width of 37.9 meters.

Curtains raise for Stormy Weather: No storm in a teacup
Mystery, murder and thrillers are the flavor of the season. Leave it to Jehan Aloysius to rekindle a new and improved version of his Gratiaen Prize nominated murder mystery Stormy Weather. The stage play which features both live action as well as filmed scenes is set to go on boards the Lionel Wendt Theater from March 24 to 26 at 7.30 pm.
Stormy Weather will be presented as a black and white movie, set in the late 1940s world of film noir. The plot revolves around the shocking murder of Noel Richards and the subsequent investigation by a rather unorthodox and nameless inspector.
Q: How does this years production differ from the Stormy Weather staged in 2009
A: The new production is has been revised and restaged for the Lionel Wendt. The characters are more larger than life, and the humour is heightened. In fact its quite a different beast to the previous show. The new actors and the portrayal has dramatically altered the rhythm and vitality of the show. Theatre is always alive and organic, never static like movies. The energy is quite palpable and rich.
Q: Why did you think the audience is in the mood for a murder mystery
A: I believe that Stormy Weather is a unique theatrical experience. I believe its something that audiences will appreciate since its change from the usual comedies and musicals. The play is remarkably short, at just 70 minutes, though its packed with emotion, witticisms and engaging characters. I believe the audiences would appreciate the detail and style of the show just as much as the performance and script.
Q: What kind of audience will go for Stormy Weather
A: Theatre lovers over the age of 13 years of age ideally (due to the theme of murder), but also film buffs and those who enjoy detective novels and fiction.
Q: What inspired you in writing the script
A: The script was actually written as a result of a dream I had in 1995. The characters were very different but I wrote this over several days on the old typewriter I used to hammer out my early scripts on.
The script has evolved and the characters have become richer with years (decades) of rewriting and fine tuning. I never dreamt I would be staging it in many forms, including definitive form, 22 years later.
Q: How did you adapt the style of the film noir movies into a stage drama
A: Film Noir, or Dark Cinema, is a genre that was popular in the mid 1940s - 1950s for detective movies produced in Hollywood.
There was a great influence of European styles, but the genre generally included stock characters such as brooding detectives and seductive femme fatales. The films were in black and white, with high contrast, dramatic lighting and shadows. So expect all these elements in our show.
I believe that Stormy Weather is like experiencing a film noir movie in 3D. But its more than merely transplanting the 2D film into the 3D realm of the stage. The stage also allows the audience to discover a third dimension to the characters, since these characters have an opportunity to try and break the archetypal roles they are cast as in the world of film noir.
Q: Does it feature the original cast of the drama Tell us a bit about the cast and the characters that they play.
A: To be honest, the new manifestation of Stormy Weather will feature both the original and new cast of the show, through some magic! You will have to see it to find out. However, Amesh De Silva will be reprising his role as Noel Richards which he originated in 2009. The other roles are played by experienced actors from the English language theatre scene, including young Dino Corera, who was actually a production assistant on the original show. Dmitri Gunatilake, Piorina Fernando, Kavitha Gunesekare and little Atira Bandaranayke play their roles with panache. Its been a challenge to train the cast in the particular genre, but they have achieved my expectations. There is a great deal of style and detail I require for each character as this is a period and genre drama.
Q: You act in as well as direct your productions.
A: I love both acting and directing, but I believe its best not to act in ones own shows. The only reason Ive acted in any of my shows is due to my having to step in to play a role due to some casting issue. I do enjoy playing some roles though. However, its always best to have a clear vision of the play from beyond the stage. Its tough to judge rhythm, staging and the overall big picture while being onstage. Thankfully, this is one show I have never had to step into a role for.
Q: What makes Story Weather academicmaterial
A: The script was included in my collection of plays which was shortlisted for the Gratiaen Prize for literature for the year 2000. The script was also staged by DramSoc of the University of Colombo in 1999 as a very different show that didnt include film. The script has been studied by students and the speeches quoted as well. The shows women tend to take on a feminist stance as well though their interactions with the males in the play. There are many layers to the script which can be unpacked and discussed. However, I would be giving too much of the plot away if I divulge any more.
Q: What has CenterStage Productions been up to and what are your plans for the future after Stormy Weather
A: This is the 16th year for CentreStage Productions. Thats 16 years of creating original, homegrown theatre in Sri Lanka! Im humbled that we have created so many groundbreaking projects that have been featured in the foreign media and travelled the world in that time.
Its also my 21st year as a director for the public stage. To celebrate this, we are staging a revised new edition of Rag - The Musical in November this year. I have already started work on it with my core unit of actors I am training. We are also casting for new young singers, dancers and actors to develop and grow with us, so we would like them to get in touch with us. We can give them an opportunity to join our dance and musical based youth projects planned for the next two years. The Rag project will also be coupled with workshops on bullying and ragging in schools and educational institutions.
An important note though, is that we sadly receive little or no support from corporate entities for our homegrown theatre work or humanitarian projects. We generally fund the shows ourselves now and cover our costs through the reasonable priced tickets. We would encourage audiences to support original theatre and literature so theatre and culture in Sri Lanka can thrive!

To develop communication tools for children with cognitive difficulties: Creative Software in New Partnership
Creative Software has collaborated with the Swedish e-health innovator PictureMyLife to upgrade and evolve their web and mobile app for children with cognitive difficulties.
Some years ago Lisa Lidgren co-founder of PictureMyLife searched for online solutions that could facilitate communication forchildren with Down syndrome, but options were scarce.
Then, over a coffee with her close friends Maria, Lollo and Yvonne, Lisa decided that they should simply create a solution of their own. That is how PictureMyLifes platform for image-based communication for children with cognitive difficultieswas born.
PictureMyLifes platform allows users  usually parents or teachers  to upload images and text via diaries and invite select audiences to view and comment on them. The pictures featured in the diary helpthe childremember and retell stories of their day.
We offer digital communication and planning tools customised for people with cognitive difficulties such as ADHD, Down syndrome, autism and dementia, explained Lisa. After publishing the first version of the digitalcommunication tool, Lisa and her team turned to Creative Software for further development of web and mobile apps. Clearly, this project means a lot to us, so we sought a partner that can share our passion and contribute to further development of new digital tools. That is why we turned to Creative Software, she concluded.
Head of Creative Softwares team Damitha Liyanage thinks it is an honour to be involved in this project.
We are passionate about developing software that matters and are already involved in developing systems that fight online child abuse and a platform that helps the elderly receive and track their medication, said Liyanage.
PictureMyLife gives children with cognitive difficulties a voice and helps integrate them into their communities. This is a really inspiring project and we are excited to be part of it, he concluded.

A disturbing trend
There is an ongoing disturbing trend, if not arrested in time, could develop into an anarchic situation, with grave consequences. We are here referring to the increasing incidents of intimidation of the police by unruly mobs and the unbecoming scenes at several schools, during the recent weeks, where students, together with parents, were seen staging demonstrations, destroying the atmosphere associated with a school.
Mobs surrounded the Moratuwa Police station, the other day, demanding the handing over of the drivers of a bus and a lorry, responsible for the death of a mother and her 13-year-old daughter in an accident. The mobs were seen on Television, threatening the police personnel who were trying to calm the situation, to no avail, necessitating the summoning of police reinforcements from a nearby station. Meanwhile, the day before, in Badulla, yet another mob were seeing besieging the police contingent who had come to settle a dispute over the takeover of a playground. Later the mob who became increasingly unruly were seen hooting at the police.
True, Monday's incident was not the first time that a police station was surrounded by mobs. One recalls a similar instance, not many moons ago, when the Angulana Police station was surrounded by villagers following the death of two youth in police custody. However the recent trend points to rising hostility towards the country's law enforcement, if not contained, could threaten the maintenance of law and order in the country. The Police should assert itself during such situations, not allowing mobs to take the upper hand, lest this conveys the wrong impression to trouble makers that the police could dealt with at their whim. Today, with the Television spotlight focused on all incidents, the tendency could be for mobs to be seen as heroes, with their intimidatory tactics, to browbeat the police into submission. Hence, IGP Pujitha Jayasundera should issue specific instructions to his men not to allow things to get out of hand and for troublemakers to be dealt with severely, without the police getting on the defensive, as we have seen on many an occasion.
The police, as the country's law enforcement authority, cannot be seen to be cowering before a mob. This is not only humiliating to the police service, but also degrading in the eyes of public, considering the awe and respect the khaki uniform commanded in the past. The frequent running battles by the police to control the recent spate of protests, that the public often see on Television, too is a humiliating spectacle that serves to bring down the esteem of the police. Hence, the proposal made by the authorities to confine these protests to designated venues in the city should be seriously considered. The police personnel, by the way, should be given all the incentives to carry out their duties effectively. It goes without saying that only a contented, satisfied, police force will be able to rise to the occasion in the face of any challenge. If not, only halfhearted attempts will be made, not only to control unruly mobs, but also the general duties assigned to them. It is in this light that the proposal to increase the salaries of policemen in certain ranks is to be welcomed. This, while keeping our policemen out of corruptions way, would also make them put their hearts into their jobs, that would see a more efficient law and order machinery.
While our police are being intimidated by unruly mobs, certain schools too are witnessing mob violence, which, incidentally, are not the doings of hired mobs, but carried out, courtesy, the students themselves, and what is more, with the parents too joining the party. The recent incident at Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Kotte, is a case in point. Here, students and parents had banded together, demanding the ouster of a new principal taking office and the form the protest took is something the authorities should sit up and take note. While the students were creating the ruckus, some even lighting crackers within the schools premises, the parents wore black bands across their faces, gesticulating wildly, aiding and abetting the mayhem. In the melee, the principal, who was besieged, and taking refuge in a room, was forced to tender his resignation and leave, amidst the din.
This is hardly the picture one associates with a school, whose chief role is, not only to impart a sound education to the children, but mould their characters and be responsible for their correct formation, to make them worthy citizens of the country. But what the public was made to witness were scenes of anarchy, and what is worse, two teachers of the school were said to be behind the incidents of instigating and inciting the students to oust the principal.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam should initiate a full scale investigation, in order to get to the bottom of the whole incident. The principal concerned came to take up duties as per the Ministry instructions and what eventually took place was an affront to the Minister and the government no less.

D.S. Senanayake's 65th death anniversary : Statesman without equal
The first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka was Don Stephen Senanayake. He was born on October 20, 1883 at a remote village titled Botale, Meerigama. His father was Mudaliya Don Speter Senanayake. Mother's name was Dona Ketherina Elishabath Perera Gunasekara. D S Senanayake had two brothers and a sister. Parents adopted their children according to a Buddhist background. However, Senanayake was educated at St. Thomas Christian College in Colombo. At that time, hostel wardens, both Buck and Stone identified his talents and qualities. Then, they acted to sharpen his talents and qualities. In Senanayake's later years, he was able to win the heart of leading politicians of the world due to his education background.
D S Senanayake served in the Surveyor's General Department for a short period. Then, he resigned his post and joined his father's plantations, as a superintendent of state. This sturdy youth developed the rubber cultivation in his father's lands. With the inception of World War I in 1914, D S Senanayake joined, as a city guard in Colombo town. When Sinhala and Muslims commotion emerged in 1915, Senanayake and his brothers were arrested on bogus charges and imprisoned. Later on, they were released from the Welikada jail. There were no provable evidences against them. F R Senanayake, D S Senanayake, D B Jayatilaka and other leaders determined to gain national freedom from imperialistic rule s in 1915.
D S Senanayake was one of the leaders who led the national independence movement. He rendered an eminent role in the national independence movement. In its inception, D S helped his elder brother, F R Senanayake. Three brothers were engaged on active politics. D C Senanayaka and D S Senanayaka were outstanding members of the Ceylon People's Council. At the initiative age of the national independence movement, D S Senanayake followed D B Jayatilaka and F R Senanayake. However, D S actively joined the freedom struggle after F R Senanayake's untimely death. He directly interfered the political and state affairs.
Minister of Agriculture and Lands
In 1924, this youth entered the Legislative Council. Later in 1931, Senanayake was elected to the State Council. He was sworn in, as the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. This Minister held this post for fifteen years. Effective solutions were given for agricultural problems by him. He was entrusted with formulation of Land Development Ordinance. Senanayake together with his members spent two years to collect correct information.
The Land Development Ordinance was presented and passed in the State Council. He prioritised to renovate ancient tanks and to make our country self-sufficient. In addition, Senanayake did everything to cultivate barren lands. An agricultural policy for solving rice problem was submitted by him. Agricultural innovation was also beefed up for the purpose of enhancement of output. However, he appreciated traditional methods and systems. For example, Senanayake admired the system of ploughing paddy fields by using cattle. He was of the view, cow dung could be used, as fertilizer. Senanayake was a member of Ceylon War Cabinet during the Second World War. At that time, he had to face reduction of foreign rice supply. Therefore, he made arrangement to commence new trades with new countries, such as Brazil and Egypt. Necessary wheat floor was scarce during the terrible Second World War. As an effective solution, importation of wheat was enhanced in ten fold. After Senanayake laying the foundation to co-operative movement, attention was focussed to co-operative development.
Several steps were taken to develop the agricultural field that was recognised, as major income source of rural folks. Senanayake devoted his life to launch major irrigation schemes, such as Galoya scheme. In addition, colonization scheme was started by the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. Hence, he was considered as the symbol of Parakrama Bahu the great. In addition, D S Senanayake was dubbed Jungle John. In the year of 1942, Leader of the State Council, Sir D B Jayatilaka resigned from his posts and left for India to accede the post of Sri Lankan Ambassador to India. Then, D S Senanayake became the leader of State Council. He led the country towards the independence avenue. Senanayake was internationally recognised in the struggle of gaining national independence to his motherland.
First Prime Minister in Ceylon
At the general election held in 1947, United National Party led by Senanayake obtained a majority. As a result of that, a coalition government was set up and Senanayake became the first Prime Minister in Ceylon. This veteran politician rendered a distinct service to the country and its people. From 1947 to 1952, he was able to win the respect of people such as Sinhala, Muslims, Ceylon Tamils and Moors, Sinhalese and Muslims loved him very much. However, Indian Tamils had a resentment with him. The Citizenship Bill was passed in parliament. Indian Tamils were deprived the universal franchise due to the Citizenship Act.
Senanayake acceded the past of Minister of Defence and Foreign Affairs in addition to Prime Ministership. He was fortunate enough to maintain an excellent relationship with British rulers.
This leader became a member of Privy Council. Hence, English rulers appreciated his abilities and got ready to confer a knighthood. But, Senanayake rejected it. He was a capable horseman. In his free time, he used to ride his horse fast. Senanayake passed away on March 22, 1952 in Colombo because he fell from the horse. His untimely death was an irreparable loss to Sri Lanka.

Echoes of the Past
The only thing more abundant in Anuradhapuras Sacred City than monkeys, is ruins. Pools, prayer halls, refectories, temples, residences; ruins great and small, in varying states of decay. These vestiges of the past serve as silent testaments to the former glory of Anuradhapura.
The former capital of Sri Lanka was defined by three great Buddhist monasteries. The Mahavihara was the first and sits in the center of the Sacred City, around the Sri Maha Bodhi tree. Just to the north is the Jetavana, founded in a petulant rage during the 2nd century BC after the king fell out with the monks of Mahavihara. Further north is the Abhayagiri, founded in 88BC and known as a liberal center for new Buddhist ideas  a stance which earned it the ire of the other, conservative monasteries. All three were home to thousands of monks, who needed buildings in which to live, eat and worship.
The traces of those buildings are what we see today when touring Anuradhapura. Most of the walls have crumbled and many of the ruins are nothing more than scattered stones, outlines of the foundations, or an odd column planted crookedly in the ground. But an amazing amount has survived the passage of two millennia in excellent shape. Guardstones with serpent kings, or moonstones which depict the levels of human existence in exquisitely carved patterns. Long troughs which were once filled with rice for the resident monks. Ancient baths now inhabited by turtles, and key-shaped wells used for fresh water.
Roughly situated in the middle of Anuradhapuras three great monasteries is The Citadel, a large secular area, protected by a moat. Here, we found the Royal Palace and the ruins of the first Temple of the Tooth  nowhere near as large as the relics current house in Kandy. A large tent covered an archaeological dig, at least six meters deep, which revealed buried roads and layers of construction. And, blending into the scenery, an innumerable number of ruins lend the Citadel an ancient, romantic atmosphere.
Wandering through the forests spotted with decayed temples, while water buffalo are grazing to your left, monkeys are playing to your right, and shimmering paddy fields stretch off in front of you its hard to remain unmoved. One can only envy the British explorers who first discovered the Sacred City. But when there are no other tourists around, and youre pushing through shrubbery to arrive at an ancient temple half-covered in plants, its not hard to imagine that youre the intrepid adventurer whos discovered it. - www.srilanka.for91days.com

Founder & President Hanif Yusoof said that the anniversary was an opportunity to reassess the companys global presence as a freight and logistics solutions provider, especially in the face of a global realignment towards Asia as the hub of business activity. This was a good time to take stock of our performance so far, to really evaluate what it means to be a logistics service provider in a very competitive business environment, he said. We have focused our business and core strengths on fast fashion, and really minimising lead times to ensure that deliveries are made from warehouse to door in no time. We strongly believe that this is the future of logistics.

Eye-opening agonies and ecstasies
If I remember correct, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru once said that history of a country is nothing but the changing aspects of the humans who live in it. On writing his most celebrated work, The Discovery of India, Nehru depends more on his own memorable moments gone through in the understanding of the changing aspects of India, which he knew intimately and affectionately.
It was Sir Winston Churchill who said that history is nothing but a series of events and trends as jotted down by those who traced them. The American poet and biographer noted that history is a seris of human biographies. All these go to the understanding of what hisotyr means to us today. All subject areas are linked to history of a country.
The history of a particular country is as such written and studied in various points of view. The work of the writer cum poet S B Karalliyadda titled in Sinhala as Man Naya Na (I am not indebted) reached me at a time when I was busy collecting material fo the changing nature of the man in a given context.
Karalliyedda who has written four books in Sinhala and one book in English, all dead on the aspects of history of Sri Lanka. They basically centre round the Kandyan kingdm and bout kings who ruled from time to time. In chapter 27, in varying forms of narration of reminiscences with personal experiences ranging from childhood days nad far back as 1940s, the period of first war in the country.
This reaches a climax as he traces the passage of time devoted to his multi-faceted activities culminating in late 1980s, as a dedicated public servant cum political figure who contests a seat, winning with a big majority. The writer traces initially his family background where he is being influenced by his scholarly father who was also a friend of the scholar and anthropologist Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy. With the good background of education, S B Karalliyedde gets the opportunity to be a discerning government servant who is fearless and energetic although he changes his social positions from time to time in keeping with the public services needs, he whose keen sense of integrity needed for public relationships and administration.
The narrator states that he was swayed by narrow political pressures that come as social hindrances. Instead, he via his learnings under wilful administration and scholars gain the circumstantial wisdom known to the oriental scholars as stanochita pragna. He too goes to the extent of showing how some of the trips abroad had widened his skills in public relationships. In the manner, quite a number of human episodes are laid down.
While being engaged in activities related to public administrative factions, Karaliyedd shows a keen interest in religious studies and folklore studies. Both subject areas have provided him to be a creative writer as well in his own way. As suh from time to time, he had composed several poems.
In the area f religious studies he seems to believe in the right actions which eventually lead to ones misery or happiness. He rescues himself from the pangs of disaster at times as a result of his good actions. Then he denotes as karma or the actions, which should be understood from various perspectives.
Karalliyedda has been working in various clerical and administrative positions ranging from teaching in a provincial school, to health service, up from there to World Health Organisation and agrarian services.
Transferring from the Health Sector he he had been engaged in Defence Ministry of Rehabilitation Services. As a sensitive observer of social events, he had jotted down macabre and gruesome events of the two main uprisings in the country in 1970s and late 1980s. He rereads some of the death threats he had had received. But he had a firm belief in his interest as a spiritualist. This has paved the way for his sanctity.
While in China, once he had seen how a certain dinner table had been arranged with non-vegetarian dishes which some others relished while he had been plainly aloof from others, which had eventually added the vision of being in groups with likes and dislikes understood well, via his background learning.
Mention too is made of some significant profiles whom he associated. They include such persons as Venerable Dimbulagala THera, Minister Gamini Disanayaka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Denzil Kobbekadua. The work of Karalliyadda is well written and readable. Needless to say, the work as a whole is a study in positive thinking.

Area residents were temporarily asked to evacuate the area to avoid breathing in fumes rising from the fire.
The garbage dump has been a site of protest for the past few years with area residents protesting over it while authorities have taken few measures to contain the growth of the landfill site that accommodates all the garbage from Colombo.
In 2015, an oil pipeline leak led to a fire erupting and damaging four houses in the Meethotamulla-Orugodawatte area.

Former MP Sarath Weerasekera never sought meeting with UNHRC Chief
Former Parliamentarian Rear Admiral (Retd.) Sarath Weerasekera or any of his representatives has not sought any meeting with the United Nations Human Rights Commissioners Office, informed sources from Geneva confirmed.
Although Weerasekeras supporters told the local media that Weerasekera will present a special report to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, a spokesperson from the UNHRC Chiefs office said no one requested a meeting with the High Commissioner. Addressing a UNHRC side event in Geneva, the former UPFA Parliamentarian urged the United Nations General Assembly to appoint a Special Rapporteur into the alleged war crimes committed by the LTTE during the Eelam war.
Weerasekera spoke at a side event titled Truth and Justice organised by the International Buddhist Relief Organization (IBRO), a non-governmental organisation with UN accreditation. Weerasekeras request internationalises Sri Lankas issue. It is a 180 degree turn from the governments stance which suggests a Sri Lanka-led process for reconciliation and accountability. Weerasekera clearly calls for a foreign intervention, a highly placed government source said, on Tuesday.
Speaking at the side event, Weerasekera said the Sri Lankan armed forces did not commit any war crimes during the final phase of Eelam war. This statement was challenged by a representative from the TGTE who said over 300000 Tamils were killed during the governments military operation. The representative urged the Swiss government to arrest Weerasekera stating the latter was responsible for the matter.

Four step guide to letting go of the past
Were constantly struggling with the past, in so many ways:
* Mistakes weve made that we regret or that make us feel bad about ourselves
*Anger about something someone did to us
* Frustration about how things have progressed up until now
* A wish that things turned out differently
* Stories about what happened that make us sad, depressed, angry, hurt
* An argument that we had that keeps spinning around in our heads
* Something someone just did (a minute ago) that were still stuck on
What if we could just let go of things have have happened, and be present with the unfolding moment instead
What if we could let the past remain in the past, and unburden ourselves
What is we could see that our holding onto the past is actually hurting us right now  and look at letting go as a loving act of not hurting ourselves anymore
It can be done, though it isnt always easy. Heres the practice I recommend, in four steps.
Step 1: See the Story Thats Hurting You
In the present moment, you have some kind of pain or difficulty: anger, frustration, disappointment, regret, sadness, hurt.
Notice this difficulty, and see that its all caused by whatever story you have in your head about what happened (either recently or in the more distant past). You might insist that the difficulty or pain is caused by what happened (not by the story in your head), but what happened isnt happening right now. Its gone. The pain is still happening right now, and its caused by whatever story you have about the situation.
Note that story doesnt mean false story. It also doesnt mean true story. The word story in this context doesnt imply good or bad, false or true, or any other kind of judgment. Its simply a process thats happening inside your head:
*Youre remembering what happened.
* You have a perspective about what happened, a judgment, a way of seeing it that has you as the injured party.
* This causes an emotion in you.
So just notice what story you have, without judgment of the story or of yourself. Its natural to have a story, but just see that its there. And see that its causing you difficulty, frustration or pain.
Step 2: Stay with the Physical Feeling
Next, you want to turn from the story in your head  to the feeling thats in your body. This is the physical feeling: it could be tightness in your chest, a hollowness, a shooting pain, an energy that radiates in all directions from your solar plexus, an ache in your heart, or many more variations.
The practice is to turn and face this physical feeling, dropping your attention out of the story your head and into your body.
Stay and face this feeling with courage  we usually try to avoid the feeling.
Stay and explore it with curiosity: what does it feel like Where is it located Does it change
If this becomes unbearable, do it in small doses, in a way that feels manageable for you. It can get intense if the feelings have been intense. But for most feelings, we see that it is not the end of the world, that we can bear it. In fact, its just a bit of unpleasantness, not all-consuming or anything to panic about.
Stay with it and be gentle, friendly, welcoming. Embrace the feeling like you would a good friend. Youre becoming comfortable with discomfort, and it is the path of bravery.
Step 3: Breathe Out, Letting Go
Breathe in your difficulty, and breathe out compassion.
Its a Tibetan Buddhist practice called Tonglen: breathe in whatever difficult feeling youre feeling, and breathe out the feeling of relief from that difficulty.
You breathe in not only your own pain, but the pain of others.
For example:
* If youre feeling frustration, breathe in all the frustration of the world  then breathe out peace.
* If youre feeling sadness, breathe in all the sadness of the world  then breathe out happiness.
* If youre feeling regret, breathe in all the regret of the world  then breathe out joy and gratitude.
Do this for a minute or so, imagining all the frustration of those around you coming in with each breath, and then a feeling of peace radiating out to all of those who are frustrated as you breathe out.
You can practice this every day, and it is amazing. Instead of running from your difficult feeling, youre embracing it, letting yourself absorb it. And youre doing it for others as well, which gets us out of a self-centered mode and into an other-focused mode.
As you do this, youre starting to let go of your pain or difficulty.
Step 4: Turn with Gratitude
Toward the Present
As you feel that youve let go, instead of getting caught up in your story again, turn and see whats right here, right now.
What do you see
Can you appreciate all or some of it Can you be grateful for something in front of you right now
Why is this step important Because when were stuck on something that happened in the past, were not paying attention to right now. Were not appreciating the moment in front of us. We cant  our minds are filled up with the past.
So when we start to let go of the past, we have emptied our cups and allowed them to be filled up with the present.
We should then turn to the present and find gratitude for whats here, instead of worrying about what isnt.
As we do that, weve transformed our struggle into a moment of joy.

Garbage issue main focus at JDS Development Committee meeting
Attempts to dump Colombo garbage at the Ekala Othe-Onagama land, took centre stage at the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat(JDS) Development Committee monthly meeting at the JDS Auditorium presided over by the Joint Chairmen former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera and former Minister Felix Perera.
The Divisional Secretary, Ja-Ela E.M.S.B. Jayasundara coordinated the proceedings.
Western Province Provincial Council Members Srinath Perera, Siri kamal felicial de Silva and Nirosha Athukorale also attended the Meeting.
At the meeting it was disclosed that the efforts made by the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala has not been given up despite the assurance given by President Maithripala Sirisena to both His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo and to Most Ven. Kosgoda Dhammawasa Thero, the Prelate of the Amarapura Chapter, that no steps would be taken to move the Meethotamulla garbage, to Ekala.
When the issue of attempts to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala by the CMC, came up at the Ja-Ela Development Committee meeting, Gampaha district UNP MP, Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene underscored the importance of acting as one body opposing every move to dump garbage at Ekala, observing that it would cause an unprecedented health hazard.
Not only are the people living around that area, prone to suffer from floods during heavy rain, but would drastically affected the lives of the people in the whole district of Gampaha. When it was pointed out that a letter alleged to have been issued by the then Ja-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, the current Western Province Provincial Council Member Shirantha Aramasekera, as evidence to show that one particular party concerned had received the approval to dump garbage to cover the marshy land at Ekala, Amarasekara totally denied the allegation and said that it was untrue.
He said if one analyses the letter, the party concerned had used a letter head which was not the type used when he was the Chairman. Further he said his photocopied signature was also used in the letter.
He said the Colombo Municipal Council had made a complaint to the Ja-Ela Police requesting those concerned to open the path leading to the particular land. He pointed out that there was no pathway as claimed by the party to the said land, but had created one after drawing plans to the land based on the alleged letter claimed to have his signature.
I just went to the Ja-Ela Police Station to say what I have no hand in this matter, he told the state officials of the Divisional Secretariat present at the meeting.
Those present at the meeting unanimously opposed any move to dump garbage in any part of the Ja-Ela Divisional Secretariat area. The views were also expressed questioning the parties concerned why they insist on filling the marshy land at Ekala, when there is a suitable land in Wattala that was willing to get the garbage to fill the land.
The Development Committee warned the participants to be extra vigilant about the danger of drugs in the area targeting schoolchildren and youth.
Former Minister Felix Perera explaining the situation in Kalpitiya with regard to the drug menace requested the state officials and police to pay greater attention to this issue that affects the lives of children. The official present also expressed their views on steps taken on povery reduction, the progress of the Divineguma project and the state of the widows and women abandoned by their husbands and facing grave difficulties.

Geotech Testing Services awarded ISO 9001:2008 certification
Geotech Testing Services which has introduced state of the art electronic pile testing techniques to Sri Lanka from 1996 was awarded the ISO 9001:2008 certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution.
This is the first company involved in electronic pile testing in Sri Lanka to be so recognised.
A pile is a post like foundation member of timber, steel or concrete driven into the ground to support a structure. It is an indispensable building support on unstable soils and is also used on stable ground to support large structural loads.
They are driven to the ground by machines which drop heavy weights on the pile. However, due to this procedure and other factors some piles do become faulty.
Traditional methods to check the condition of a driven pile were expensive and not very effective. Electronic pile testing has been responsible for upgrading the quality of piling works undertaken in Sri Lanka by providing an economical and convenient quality assurance tool.
Geotech Testing Services introduced the increasingly complex and useful electronic pile testing systems from the developers and manufacturers of the equipment as well as the analytical software, Messrs Pile Dynamics Inc. of Ohio USA.
Commencing from the basic Pile Integrity Tester to the Pile Dynamic Analyzer were introduced over the years. The different testing systems provide a wealth of reliable data hitherto unavailable through traditional pile testing methods. Their value as a quality assurance tool and a means of optimizing the foundation designs have been proven without doubt.
Thus, the electronic pile testing technology is now well accepted and adopted in the construction Industry in Sri Lanka.
It is essential that the reliability of the data and results generated by the testing techniques be accurate and reliable in order to maintain the trust and confidence of the stake holders of the construction industry.
The successful certification of the Company and its operations by the ISO 9001:2008 quality assurance system is an assurance to all of the reliability of Geotech Testing Services as a competent and dependable service provider for state of the art electronic pile testing services.
Geotech Testing Services is a member of the Geotech Group with Geotech and Group Engineering Laboratories, laboratory service providers for the geotechnical and construction industry.

Gotabhaya responds to death squads allegation
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa denied Tuesday involvement in war-era death squads, blaming the then army chief for an alleged secretive campaign of extrajudicial murders.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has been accused of giving orders to a shadowy military outfit allegedly involved in murdering journalists and political dissidents during Sri Lankas long-running civil war.
In testimony filed to court on Monday, former army chief Sarath Fonseka said this death squad was run by military intelligence but took orders from Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of Sri Lankas former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said Fonseka -- who led Sri Lankas armed forces between December 2005 and July 2009 -- should answer for the excesses carried out by troops under his command.
I deny any involvement with these killings, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa told AFP. If he (Fonseka) knew there was a secret hit squad, what action did he take as Army Commander
Just hours after submitting its report, police arrested a sixth military officer for alleged involvement in the abduction and assault of an editor in 2008. Five others were arrested last month over the same case.
Police also allege the death squad was behind the 2009 murder of prominent newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunga, whose death sparked an international outcry.Source: AFP

Her story
Women all over the world celebrated the International Womens Day recently  a time to reflect on the endlers value of the mother. Sri Lanka recognises the motherhood as precious. All have realised that the contribution a women to the entire globe is invaluable. All will agree that there is one among the humanity much adored by everybody. The world owes much to her. It is with her the world begins. She gave the universe the unity never known before the world survives with her. She is the finest in the world. Her mission was a great civilizing factor in the world. She is the most noble being the world has yet produced unsurpassed by anyone. Who is this miraculous marvel She is none other than your mother simple woman turned mother.
Next to Buddha the perfect one here is a being, who sacrifices her own comforts in the interests of her family. She is the guiding spirit to the family. The personality of the mother towers above all others. She has a wider appeal, in that she has developed a strong element in human society.
The mother occupied a unique place in Buddhism. Sakyamni Siddhartha Gautama the world teacher, throughout his life and in many of his previous births (Bosath0 created an important place for women in society  specially the mother. Many of the Jataka stories are a unique reflection of religious tradition depicting the pride of place given to the mother.
All human emotions love, sorrow, joy are depicted in the best form in discourses on mother. The stories of mother portray no ill-will anger or disgust. Each presents of narration of good qualities, virtue and moral values. Matu Poshaka Jathaka is the best example. It relates how Bosath kept his mother on his back and swam across the mighty ocean, getting her blessings for future Boddhahood. Another best known story among the Buddhists is Vessantara Jatakaya in which the life of Madri Devi, the mother of Jaliya and Krishnajina is an outstang example for helping boast to fulfill his Dana Paramita'. Amazing stories such as Thiththira Jatakaya taught them how the elders should be treated and revered with due care and respect.
The great master throughout his teachings placed the mother in very high esteem in the Suttas too. He has enumerated this in Prabawa Sutta. Buddha taught a young man how to adjust himself to his parents, wife, friends and Master in Singalowada Sutta. Buddha said, the mother is the friend at home. According to Magala Sutta, supporting one's parents Mata Pitu Upattanam is the highest blessing that are can achieve. Mother has been a topic of discussion in the Buddhist legend and tradition. Here the mothers love is confined not only to her own children, but to the others as well, which is evident from the infancy of Prince Siddhartha. Seven days after his birth when Queen Mahamaya passed away, it was Maha Prajapathy Gothami, who looked after the babe giving preference to him. Over her two children. In his attempt to find the gem of truth, as an ascetic Prince Siddhartha suffering for six long years (Dushkarakriya) he was reduced to skin and bone. Queen Mother Mahamaya who was in heaven (Thavuthisa) as Marthru Divyaraja descended on the earth to support him in his quest to relieve universal suffering. After the supreme enlightenment the Buddha visited Thavathimsa to preach Abhidhamma to Marthru in heaven to show his gratitude.
In Buddhist society the mother is admired as the Buddha at home Gedara Budun Amma There is a national flow of mettah form the mother when she dedicates herself to the well-being and happiness of her children with no envy or jealousy what so ever. It is the mother who makes the child creative, innovative and enterprising with emphasis on discipline, in his or her formative years. Hence the mother is there throughout one's life, even after her demise. It is the woman who becomes the mother. Woman is a product of the mother and vice versa. Both ones are held in high esteem. Mother in perticular accomplish many things and perform her duties within her span of life. Mothers in it's entirety deserve the praise of the entire globe.

Hollywood screenwriter claims Disney 'copied' ideas for Zootopia

Disney is being sued by a Hollywood producer and screenwriter who claims to have come up with the idea for hit film Zootopia 17 years ago.
Gary L Goldman filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing the animation giant of stealing his ideas for the Oscar-winning animated blockbuster.
The producer and screenwriter, who has credits in big budget films such as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall and Tom Cruise's Minority Report, says he pitched a similar idea to Disney in 2000 and 2009.
He claims there are substantial similarities between his project and Zootopia, released last year.
"The Disney Zootopia is substantially similar to the Goldman Zootopia," says the complaint filed by Mr Goldman's Esplanade Productions.
"They copied Goldman's themes, settings, plot, characters, and dialogue - some virtually verbatim," says the 37-page lawsuit.
The lawsuit says that Mr Goldman's idea saw the film pitched as a way to explore life in America through a civilised society of animals.
Zootopia was nominated for a number of awards this year, and went on to win best animated film at the Oscars.
The story explores prejudice and contemporary race issues through different types of animals.
In response to the lawsuit, Disney told Deadline that "Mr Goldman's lawsuit is riddled with patently false allegations".
"It is an unprincipled attempt to lay claim to a successful film he didn't create, and we will vigorously defend against it in court."
Zootopia has grossed more than $1bn to date.

How money made us modern
About 9,500 years ago in the Mesopotamian region of Sumer, ancient accountants kept track of farmers crops and livestock by stacking small pieces of baked clay, almost like the tokens used in board games today. One piece might signify a bushel of grain, while another with a different shape might represent a farm animal or a jar of olive oil.
Those humble little ceramic shapes might not seem have much in common with todays $100 bill, whose high-tech anti-counterfeiting features include a special security thread designed to turn pink when illuminated by ultraviolet light, let alone with credit-card swipes and online transactions that for many Americans are rapidly taking the place of cash.
But the roots of those modern modes of payment may lie in the Sumerians tokens. Such early accounting tools ultimately evolved into a system of finance and money itself a symbolic representation of value, which can be transferred from one person to another as a payment for goods or services.
Civilization existed before money, but probably wouldnt have gotten very far without it. Ancient humans invention of money was a revolutionary milestone. It helped to drive the development of civilization, by making it easier not just to buy and sell goods, but to pay workers in an increasing number of specialized tradescraftsmen, artists, merchants, and soldiers, to name a few. It also helped connect the world, by enabling traders to roam across continents and oceans to buy and sell goods, and investors to amass wealth.
Over the centuries, money continued to evolve in form and function. The ancient worlds stones and shells gave way to coins, and eventually to paper currency and checks drawn upon bank accounts. Those physical tokens, in turn, gradually are being superseded by electronic ones, ranging from credit card transactions to new forms of digital currency designed for transferring and amassing wealth on the Internet.
Even as money has enabled humans to survive and thrive, its also harmed them. The greed for riches has enticed nations to launch bloody wars of conquest, and driven some humans to exploit or cheat others. And as a sort of language that we all speak, money and our continual need for it exert a powerful behavioral influence upon all of us, from the humblest shop clerk to Wall Street financiers.
Since ancient times, humans have utilized all sorts of items to represent value, from large stones to cakes of salt, squirrel pelts and whale teeth. In the ancient world, people often relied upon symbols that also had some tangible value in their own right. The ancient Chinese were among those who used cowrie shells, which were prized for their beauty as materials for jewelry, to make payments.
Even today, many characters in Chinese writing that relate to money include the ancient symbol for the cowrie shell. They were used as money in other parts of the world as well. As Glyn Davies noted in his book A History of Money from Ancient Times to the Present Day, cowries are durable, easily cleaned and counted, and defy imitation or counterfeiting.
But gold gradually became a universal currency. The gleaming precious metal was stable, yet also could be combined at high temperatures with other metals to create alloys, and was easy to melt and hammer into shapes. It became the raw material for the first coins, which were created in Lydia, a kingdom in what is now Turkey, around 2,700 years ago. Lydian coins didnt look much like todays coinage. They were irregular in shape and size and didnt have denominations inscribed on them, but instead used a stamped image to indicate their weight and value.
In the centuries that followed, trade routes forged more cultural connections between nations and regions. Besides exchanging money and goods, traders also spread religious beliefs, knowledge and new inventions, creating cross-pollination among far-flung cultures.
The hazards of moving money and goods over distanceswhether it was from storms at sea or bandits and piratesled humans to develop increasingly complex economic organizations. In the 1600s, for example, investors who gathered in London coffeehouses began buying underwriting traders and colonists venturing across the ocean to the New World, financing their voyages in exchange for a share of the crops or goods they brought back.
Investors would try to reduce their risk by buying shares of multiple ventures. It was the start of a modern global economy in which vast quantities of products and money flow across borders in the search for profits.

New research shows that even sad music can lift your mood, while other studies suggest music can boost happiness and reduce anxiety.
Researchers have pondered the possible therapeutic and mood boosting benefits of music for centuries.
Even sad music brings most listeners pleasure and comfort, according to recent research from Durham University in the United Kingdom and the University of Jyvskyl in Finland, published in PLOS ONE.
Conversely, the study found that for some people, sad music can cause negative feelings of profound grief.
The research involved three surveys of more than 2,400 people in the United Kingdom and Finland, focusing on the emotions and memorable experiences associated with listening to sad songs.
The majority of experiences reported by participants were positive.
The results help us to pinpoint the ways people regulate their mood with the help of music, as well as how music rehabilitation and music therapy might tap into these processes of comfort, relief, and enjoyment, said lead author, Tuomas Eerola, Ph.D., a professor of music cognition at Durham University, in a press release.
He also said the study may help find reasons for both listening to and avoiding sad music.
An earlier study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that people tend to prefer sad music when they are experiencing a deep interpersonal loss, like the end of a relationship.
The authors of that study suggested that sad music provides a substitute for the lost relationship. They compared it to the preference most people have for an empathic friend  someone who truly understands what youre going through.
Other research has focused on the joy upbeat music can bring.
A 2013 study in the Journal of Positive Psychology found that people who listened to upbeat music could improve their moods and boost their happiness in just two weeks.
In the study, participants were instructed to try to improve their mood, but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of Copland as opposed to the sadder tunes of Stravinsky.
And a happier mood brings benefits beyond feeling good. In a press release, lead study author, Yuna Ferguson, noted that happiness has been linked to better physical health, higher income, and greater relationship satisfaction.

How Victorian era survived with a few medicines
In 1837 as industrial cities cropped up in Britain the people started to move from country to town side for jobs. That caused health hazards during the early Victorian era. Houses were built very close depriving light or ventilation. Rubbish was thrown into streets and rivers. Drinking water collected from streams and rivers into which sewers drained.
For the first time, Cholera came up in the town Clerkenwell, London. Cholera spread fast due to unhealthy condition in mid 18th Century, toilets were not flushed off and maintained. Cesspits were emptied near houses to dung heaps. Also the illnesses such as typhus, tuberculosis, measles and whooping cough arose.
Even the doctors never knew about germs. They attended to surgery without sterilizing their instruments.
The drug called opium made from poppies was often used to stop pain. Dr Simpson (1847) discovered chloroform for anesthesia. In this era a mask like one soaked in chloroform was put over the patients face. The patient breathed in the chloroform and went to sleep. Queen Victoria used chloroform to kill the pain of childbirth when her son was born in 1853, When her ninth baby was due in 1857, she had said we are having this baby and we are having chloroform. After that, the use of anesthetics was widely accepted. Even with new inventions, people died of germs. Two out of every five, patients died of infections after operations.
In 1864 a French Chemist called Louis Pasteur proved that infections were caused by germs. A surgeon in Glasgow called Joseph Lister in end of the 18th century used this to invent a spray. This killed germs during operations performed. Also Lister soaked his hands and instruments in carbolic acid before operations In 1880s it was believed that an operation is successful if the germs have been killed.
In 19th century tuberculosis was a common disease that killed people Aspirator (new invention) was used to drain off the liquid from lungs. By 1900 laws were passed to keep towns cleaner and healthier and by 1900 Cholera no longer existed in Britain.
In 1858 a law was passed that only qualified people can work as Doctors. Training of nurses commenced. A writer called Edward Harrison found that in three small towns in Britain sixty nine persons had practiced as doctors for money without proper education. A law called the Medical Act was passed in 1858.
Florence Nightingale (1820  1910) from a rick family entered into the nursing stream in Germany. She with the support of 38 nurses assisted the soldiers in their wounds and sicknesses. She kept the hospitals clean. She started training schools for nurses. They were taught even languages to read the medicines written in different languages. By 1890 nursing was seen as a suitable job for women.
The first successful removal of an appendix was done in 1880 with the assistance of new inventions. Aspirin was fist sold in shops in 1899.
Many hospitals were built in England. During the later stages of Victorian times, the ophthalmoscope was invented. The respirator too was invented to inhale oxygen for breathing difficulties.
This was assisted to four patients to use at once. During this time all patients of all sources of illnesses in all ages were treated in one ward. But, in 1852, Dr West opened the London Hospital for sick children separately in Great Ormond Street, thereafter this was followed up by other countries. In 1838 ENT Hospital was opened in London and in 1837 Skin Hospital was opened.
This helped doctors to follow one route of illness. In 1900 paid hospitals were introduced for the rich. Asylums and Dentist hospitals were put up. In 1895 a German Scientist called Wilhelm Rontgen found X-rays. In 1898 radium was discovered by Marie Curie who died of radium burns.

The Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A.Karunaratne yesterday said that he was unfairly removed from his post in the Monetary Board by former Governor Arjun Mahendran in June, 2016.
Karunaratne said he felt his removal was a compulsory expulsion.

Karunaratne said he received a letter from the former CBSL Governor Mahendran calling for an explanation for attempting to distribute a letter issued by the Sri Lankas Central Bank Executive Officers Union at a Monetary Board meeting.
Karunaratne explained to the Commission that the said Union had formally requested him to distribute the said letter at the meeting.
Karunaratne said to the Commission that he then sought the permission of Governor Mahendran to distribute the letter.
Since Governor Mahendran did not agree with the suggestion, I did not distribute the letter among the Monetary Board members, he said.
Karunaratne said when he received a circular relocating his duties he was both shocked and surprised.
Asked if there had been any other disagreements between himself and former Governor Mahendran, Karunaratne said to his knowledge they do not.
The Commission pointed out it is not interested in the personal problems between the mentioned two individuals. Karunaratne was testifying before the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond Issue. State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie led the evidence.

Inflation increases to 8.2% in February
Year on Year inflation based on the National Consumer Price Index NCPI has increased to 8.2% in February 2017 from 6.5% in January 2017.
Census and Statistics Director General Dr. Amara Satharasinghe said the reason for increase in inflation was due to the comparatively lower price levels that prevailed in February 2016.
In February 2016 contribution to the inflation from food group was -0.3% and non-food group was 2.0%. Nevertheless, in February 2017 contribution to the inflation from food group and non-food group are 4.5% and 3.8% respectively.
The Department of Census and Statistics has released the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) for February 2017. NCPI has been calculated as 119.9 for February 2017. This shows an increase of 0.6 index points or a percentage of 0.5 compared to the previous months (January) index of 119.3. This monthly change was due to the increases of expenditure value of food items by 0.31% and non-food items by 0.23% respectively.
The increase in expenditure value of food commodity group in February 2017 compared to that of January 2017 was due to the price increases in coconuts, vegetables, coconut oil, fresh fish, green chilies, banana, mangoes, garlic and red onions. However, decreases in expenditure value in index were reported for rice, limes, potatoes, mysore dhal, chicken, dried chilies and chilly powder.
The increase in expenditure value of non food commodity group in February 2017 compared to the preceding month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of Transport, Education, Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other fuels, Furnishing, Household equipment and Routine household maintenance and Miscellaneous Goods and Services.
However, expenditure value decreases were observed for groups of Alcoholic beverages, Tobacco and Narcotics and Recreation and Culture.
Further, very slight increases in expenditure value were reported for groups of Restaurant and Hotels, Clothing and Footwear and very slight expenditure value decrease was reported for group of Health compared to the previous month.

IRA fighter turned peacemaker Martin McGuinness dies
Northern Ireland: Northern Irelands former deputy First Minister and one-time IRA commander Martin McGuinness has died aged 66, his Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said on Tuesday.
McGuinness had resigned from politics in January, citing a serious illness and a breakdown in relations with the rival Democratic Unionist Party.
It is with deep regret and sadness that we have learnt of the death of our friend and comrade Martin McGuinness who passed away in Derry during the night, Sinn Fein said in a statement.
The BBC said he had died of a rare heart condition.
Sinn Fein refused to appoint a replacement for McGuinness in January due to a row with the DUP, its partner in a power-sharing government set up to bring peace to the province.
That triggered local elections in which Sinn Fein made major gains against the pro-British DUP and the two parties are currently deadlocked, meaning that the British government could impose direct rule of Northern Ireland from London.
Ten years ago in May McGuinness had made history by entering a government with his once bitter foe, Ian Paisley of the DUP.
The decision to share power was a key part of the peace process in Northern Ireland, which endured three decades of violence in which more than 3,500 people died.
McGuinness was a commander in the IRA paramilitary group that fought for the province to leave Britain and join the Republic of Ireland to the south.
In a memorable gesture that would once have been unimaginable, he shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Belfast in 2012.
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams called his former colleague a passionate republican who worked tirelessly for peace and reconciliation and for the re-unification of his country.
Throughout his life Martin showed great determination, dignity and humility and it was no different during his short illness, he said in a statement.
McGuinness was born in 1950 in Derry, on the provinces northern coast, and grew up in the city when it was riven by sectarian bloodshed.
He became involved in the civil rights movement as a teenager and rapidly rose through the ranks of the IRA.
He was second in command at the time of Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British soldiers shot 26 unarmed republican protesters in Derry, killing 13 of them.
He served prison time for IRA-related activities, but later became a peacemaker as he negotiated a deal with loyalists and the British government.
McGuinness became Northern Irelands deputy first minister in 2007 working alongside former adversary Paisley, who was first minister.
Paisleys son Kyle tweeted that he was very sorry to hear about the passing of Martin McGuinness. Look back with pleasure on the remarkable year he and my father spent in office together. More recently, he served alongside first ministers Peter Robinson and then Arlene Foster until he quit in January over an energy policy scandal.

Landmark pay offer for Australias men and women cricketers
Sydney: Cricket Australia offered what it called Tuesday a ground-breaking remuneration and benefits proposal to the nations elite men and women cricketers in a bid to end a pay impasse.
The head body said the package meant women had the opportunity to pursue a fully professional career at both international and domestic levels, while men would continue to be among the country's best paid sport stars. CA chief James Sutherland said the five-year Memorandum of Understanding contained a number of landmark features.
"We are pleased that the Australian Cricketers Association (players union) agrees with us that women, for the first time, should be part of the MOU, and we have proposed a financial model that has gender equity at its heart," he said.
"Under the proposal, women will receive an immediate average pay increase of more than 125 percent."
This would see international women cricketers' pay jump from Aus$79,000 (US$60,885) to Aus$179,000 as of July 1 this year, with an expectation that it will rise to Aus$210,000 by 2021.
CA said total potential remuneration for all players, including guaranteed and performance elements, would go up from Aus$311 million over the course of the current MOU (2012-17) to Aus $419m over the next five-year period, an increase of 35 percent.
Men who represent Australia at international level would see their average yearly retainer rise to Aus$816,000 by 2021/22.
With match fees and performance bonuses, the expected average income for these players -- including Big Bash League Twenty20 payments -- would soar 25 percent to Aus$1.45m by 2021/22, said Sutherland.
"We have placed the emphasis on increasing the guaranteed amount that the men will receive, rather than rely on any projected increase in revenue," he added.
"This is a landmark agreement. We are now looking forward to sitting down with the ACA to work through the details and we are confident we will be able to announce a completed agreement before June 30." AFP

Lanka Sathosa to open 50 new fully equipped outlets on March 28
Creating history in Sri Lankas FMCG retail market, the countrys state owned large scale retail network will shift its expansion gears to high speed on March 28 and the race starts with the largest number of openings of Lanka Sathosa brand outlets across Sri Lankan market within a 24 hour short period, as announced on 20 March.
I am pleased to announce that on March 28, 50 new and fully equipped Lanka Sathosa outlets across Sri Lanka will be opened by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the Cooperatives Provincial Ministers Summit by his Ministry at BMICH on 20 March joined by many provincial cooperative ministers. When I took over Lanka Sathosa was faced with issues of lack of computerization, and non- availability of latest stock updates for top managers. Accounts too were lagging. As a result we started restructuring work within the system with consultancy by the international firm KPMG. Now we come to final phase of island-wide Lanka Sathosa network computerization and by July 2017, it will be complete.
An ERP system will run on this said Minister Bathiudeen and added: Most importantly, we have decided to speed up Sathosa network expansion.
I am pleased to announce that on March 28, 50 new and fully equipped Lanka Sathosa outlets across Sri Lanka will be opened simultaneously and jointly by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, for which I thank them both.
The total number of Lanka Sathosa outlets planned is 500 and by end of this year, we will activate all 500. Once we complete 500 outlets by end of 2017, we will stop Lanka Sathosa outlet network expansion.
Thereafter, we will expand in a new way. We will be establishing Lanka Sathosa retail franchises with existing private grocery shops and usual retailers. The total number of planned such retail franchises across the country is 8000.
At present, Lanka Sathosa has 325 outlets across Sri Lanka reporting an annual network turnover of Rs. 30 billion.
Among other important projects in its restructuring are installation of 125 new CCTV systems, setting up of five laboratories, and installation of Human Resource Information System to manage its 3500-employee squad island-wide.

## Title: The last laugh is with Hathurusingha

The last laugh is with Hathurusingha
What happened at the P Sara Oval where Sri Lanka were beaten for the first time in a Test match by Bangladesh would never have occurred had Chandika Hathurusingha not been head coach in the oppositions camp.
The events that led to him ending up as coach of Bangladesh instead of Sri Lanka have been well documented in the past and for those who cannot remember how that happened youll have to question the interim administration that was headed by former Sri Lanka cricketer Somachandra de Silva who was running the affairs of Sri Lanka Cricket in 2011. At the time Hathurusingha was being groomed under Trevor Bayliss to take over as head coach of the national team but his innings was rudely cut short by the De Silva administration, so that six years down the line we are facing the consequences.
The way Bangladesh cricket had been improving since Hathurusingha took charge of them in June 2014 it has been an upward curve and it was not long before the youngest Test nation would start hitting the straps.
For those who have not been following Bangladesh cricket of late the result would have been stunning. But those who had watched Bangladeshs gradual rise knew that it was coming. It had to come some day for any nation is not going to remain at the bottom rung for long. The day arrived just five months after Bangladesh had recorded their first Test win against England at Dhaka. What Hathurusingha has done to Bangladesh is what Dav Whatmore did to Sri Lanka in 1995 when he took over as head coach. At the time the Sri Lankan team was oozing with exceptional talent but it had no direction. That was provided by Whatmore who fine tuned that side to become world beaters by winning the World Cup in 1996. Since then Sri Lanka cricket has always been on the up and they have excelled in all three formats qualifying for six World Cup finals.
To reflect back on the two-Test series there seems to be a trend that the Sri Lanka team must address. They have a habit of winning the first Test of a series invariably at Galle and then losing the next Test and with it either the series or being held to a draw.
What happened in the series against Bangladesh is that Sri Lanka won handsomely at Galle only to succumb in the second Test at the P Sara Oval which is not a happy hunting ground for them having lost five of the last seven Tests played there.
The win at the P Sara Oval was not only a historic one for Bangladesh who were playing in their 100th Test match, but it was also the home ground of Hathurusingha who spent most of his time playing domestic first-class cricket representing Tamil Union in the Premier trophy tournament. It was the Tamil Union that found Hathurusingha when he was initially playing cricket for Veluwana College Dematagoda before moving to Ananda College where he created an unprecedented record of representing his country before his alma mater when he toured England with the Sri Lanka Schoolboys team in 1986 while Ananda were dilly-dallying to give him a place in their first team.
Hathurusingha knew the Sara Oval pitch like the back of his hand and how it would behave. Having learnt the lessons from the defeat at Galle, it was only a matter of the players applying themselves and putting things right with Hathurusinghas guidance. In fact it was not only Hathurusingha who was instrumental in Bangladeshs historic win but also two other Sri Lankans whom he had recruited into the coaching staff - former Sri Lanka Test cricketer Thilan Samaraweera who is their batting coach and fast bowler Mario Villavarayen their trainer.
Bangladeshs rise is not the least surprising because since the advent of Hathurusingha they have been on the ascendency especially in 50-over cricket where they have recorded consecutive series wins against such formidable ODI teams like Pakistan, India and South Africa and also Zimbabwe and Afghanistan between March 2015 and October 2016 at home and reached a World Cup quarterfinal for the first time in their history.
As for Sri Lanka they will need to go back to the drawing board and reflect what went wrong for them at the P Sara Oval. Vital dropped catches seems to be their bane and it is still continuing despite the fact that Sri Lanka Cricket has hired a fielding coach Nic Pothas from South Africa, a High Performance Manager Simon Willis and Strength and Conditioning Coach Nick Lee  both from England.
Asanka Gurusinha the newly appointed Cricket Manager whilst admitting that Sri Lanka had not fielded well in the series, said: I dont think we are one of the worst fielding sides. We dropped a few catches which is bad. Working on little things is important. I am observing what we are doing well and what we are not doing well. Fielding will be one area we will focus a lot before the one-day games with coach Graham Ford. Its skill and a lot of repetition. Its not the amount of time you do its the quality of training you do. We need to improve the intensity and not the time. You can do one hour or half hour. Its the intensity we have to concentrate on. We will increase our intensity levels in training.
The current Test squad had nine of the players who figured in Sri Lankas 3-0 whitewash of Australia in their last Test series played at home. Missing from the present side are captain Angelo Mathews who is injured, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Perera, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando and Roshen Silva. Between then and now Sri Lanka won a two-Test series in Zimbabwe 2-0 and was whitewashed 0-3 in South Africa.
So what went wrong against Bangladesh As one critic jokingly put it across, there was a time when Sri Lankan batsmen thought enough is enough and retired themselves out against Bangladesh, but today they wont even go if they are given out, they call for a referral. Thats how much the game has changed since Sri Lanka took on Bangladesh in 2001 and now.
Sri Lanka had four centurions in the series compared to Bangladeshs one and Rangana Herath the stand in captain once again displayed why he is regarded as one of the greatest left-arm spinners in the game when he finished with another rich haul of 16 wickets that made him the most prolific left-arm spinner in Test cricket and also took him past 1,000 first-class wickets, having played a greater part of his career in the shadow of the great Muthiah Muralitharan.
Congrats from Hathurus captain and mentor
My Dear Chandika, WOW is all I can say...and that too at the venue that nurtured you!!
Congratulations. Deservedly its a dream come true for you. As for the rest of us including those who shared those inexplicable months of arrogant stupidity of some cricket board officials, the faith Sanga, Mahela and the entire team of that time had in your coaching skills has certainly not been misplaced. Our loss has been Bangladeshs overwhelming gain indeed!!
I can only reflect on that age old saying that there is no greater leveller than this marvellous game we called cricket......Yes no matter who you are, the game will ALWAYS be above you.
I know you will never forget that.
Warm thoughts and blessings, Skanda

Legal eagles clash at Presidential Commission
A verbal battle erupted at the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday between the Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva.
The heated argument erupted when Romesh de Silva PC made an application in the interest of former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran.
Mahendran was present at the Commission yesterday morning with his panel of legal representatives. As the two lawyers clashed, the Commission pointed out they should be mindful of their language. While de Silva said to de Livera You are barking, de Livera replied that he bites as well.
De Silva then went on to say that you should be chucked from your position to de Livera, the latter replied You should be chucked from where you are.
Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane containing the war of words, requested both de Livera and de Silva not to get caught up in the argument and pointed out ; now both of you are being childish.
Prior to the argument de Silva requested the Commission to let them know on which areas the Commission will have concerns regarding Mahendran with relevance to its mandate.De Silva said ; they can prepare and call for witnesses to meet their case.
The Commission told de Silva that; towards the end of the proceedings, the Commission will call Mahendran to testify and before that we can let you know the areas of e concern. That is only fair. We will not be forwarding a charge sheet.
The argument broke out when de Silva requested to allow access to the evidence and records of proceedings in possession of the Commission, especially the documents, including the Monetary Board minutes.
According to de Silva the CBSL has let Mahendran know, if the Commission permits, he can have access to the minutes of the Monetary Board. De Livera pointed out the difficulty of providing all the documents as some of these evidences are strictly confidential. He further said CBSL should hear about the situation before handing over confidential documents, to a possible witness to the Commission. These are official documents. The CBSL has certain objections in giving these documents, so I am only saying the CBSL should hear about this, if the Commission is giving an order. De Livera said. The AG too is of the same view, he said.
The Commission directed de Livera to consult with the Attorney-General and the CBSL and let the Commission know their response. The Commission assured to let de Silva know the decision on the confidential documents within a week.
De Livera also requested the Commission to be consistent and that its rulings be applied equally when deciding on granting copies of the recorded proceedings.
De Livera then challenged the presence of Arjun Mahendran at the Commission while the proceedings are on, stating it is a matter of natural justice. He pointed out to the Commission that witnesses testifying will be subjected to undue pressure with Mahendrans presence at the proceedings.
The Commission told de Livera that the proceedings of the Commission are similarly to the procedure in a civil court and thus it is fair enough that Mahendran be allowed to sit at the Commission while the proceedings are on.
De Livera also pointed out to the Commission that a witness can shape his testimony in line with the testimonies given at the Commission.
De Livera also said ;the Commission prevented certain witnesses being present at the proceedings when evidence was being given and hence the AGs panel was of the understanding that probable witnesses are not allowed at the sitting of the Commission.
Both legal representatives of Tender Board chairman and the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited were of the same view as that of de Livera.
They have come under section 16 . Anybody who comes under section 16 on the basis that he has implicated concerns and considers it is desirable to be represented he or she has the right to be in the court room. If they do not come under section 16 and only a witness then they are not allowed to be present. We have to allow his presence since it is only normal procedure. Justice P. Jayawardane explained. This should have been said at the outset. De Livera observed.
The Commission told de Livera, not only Mahendran but any possible witness can be present at the proceedings under section 16 as per the rulings on the Presidential Commissions.
This is a fact finding mission. We do not follow an adversarial system. The Commission will only submit a report.Not give a judgment. The Commission pointed out.

Los Angeles only has eyes for 2024 amid deal speculation
Los Angeles: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has insisted that the city remains solely focused on staging the Olympics in 2024 amid speculation of a deal which could see rival bid Paris handed the games.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed last week it will study the possibility of awarding both the 2024 and 2028 Olympics at the same time when the body meets for a crunch vote in Lima in September.
Under one scenario, Paris could be chosen as hosts for the 2024 Olympics -- 100 years after last staging the Games -- with Los Angeles handed the right to host the extravaganza four years later.
LA 2024 officials have consistently played down speculation surrounding a possible joint award, maintaining that the focus remained on a 2024 bid.
And Garcetti, one of the leaders of the Los Angeles bid, reiterated that position in an interview with the insidethegames.biz sports news website.
We are competing for 2024. Full stop, insidethegames quoted him as saying on Monday. I would love to visit my friends in Paris in 2028. We have never contemplated anything else.
Garcetti said the IOC had briefed LA 2024 officials on the ruling to investigate a joint award following its executive board meeting in Pyeongchang last week.
They have kept us abreast of the conversations they are having, which is appropriate, Garcetti said, adding that he was sympathetic to the views of IOC chief Thomas Bach, who is concerned the bidding process creates too many losers.
I support those kind of conversations, Garcetti said. There are too many cities that lose, it costs way too much (to bid).
I support those kind of reforms but that is a bigger question for the future.
We are focused on the present, which is a bid for 2024. We will play by the rules and the rules today say this is a competition for 2024.
Soaring costs have made hosting the Olympics prohibitive, deterring cities from bidding for the four-yearly sporting spectacular.
Budapest last month became the third city to pull out of the bidding for 2024, following public opposition sparked by fears over costs and corruption.
Germanys Hamburg withdrew after a referendum in late 2015, and Rome cancelled its bid last year, with its mayor Virginia Raggi calling it irresponsible for the citys finances. AFP

Manchester City charged with failing to control players : FA
London: Manchester City face a charge of failing to control their players by the Football Association for their surrounding the referee Michael Oliver when he awarded a penalty in the 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Sunday.
Oliver, the same referee who was surrounded by Manchester United players in the fractious FA Cup quarter-final with Chelsea last week and resulted in the club being fined 20,000 (23,000 euros, $24,700), awarded a penalty to Liverpool when he judged Gael Clichy to have fouled Roberto Firmino in the 50th minute.
It is alleged that in or around the 50th minute of the fixture, the club failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion, said an FA statement.
James Milner tucked away the penalty to give the visitors the lead but Sergio Aguero levelled with just over 20 minutes remaining to ensure City salvaged a point in the gripping match at Etihad Stadium.
Oliver booked both Clichy and his Spanish team-mate David Silva -- who was the most forthright in protesting -- after awarding the penalty. City have until 1800GMT on Thursday to respond to the charge. AFP

Measures to control sugar content in sweetmeats
Rules and regulations will be introduced soon in order to control the sugar content in sweetmeats, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, discussions have already been held with biscuits and sweetmeat producers. A Cabinet paper will be presented to increase tax on food items with excessive sugar, salt and fat.
He was addressing the gathering during a health camp held at Malwana recently.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that there will be pressure on him against increasing tax on food with excessive sugar, salt and fat, but he will not give into pressure.
The main objective of reducing the sugar, salt and fat levels in food is to control the rapidly increasing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in the country.
The Traffic Light system has already been implemented to regulate the sugar level in soft drinks and bottled drinks. All soft drinks and other bottled drinks are now compelled indicate the sugar level in them, he added.

BERLIN: Hoffenheims Julian Nagelsmann, 29, the youngest head coach in Bundesliga history, has been named coach of 2016 in Germany.
The German Football Association (DFB) award is just deserts for the work Nagelsmann did by keeping Hoffenheim up last season, then turning them into title challengers.
He joins the likes of Borussia Dortmunds Thomas Tuchel and Bayern Munichs assistant coach Hermann Gerland, who were named Germanys coach of the year in times gone by.
This has come quickly, but thats typical of him, said Horst Hrubesch, the DFBs director of sport.
Julian Nagelsmann is a great example of some of the talented young coaches we have in Germany. Hoffenheim were the last team, in any of Europes top leagues, to be beaten this season and under Nagelsmanns steerage they currently sit fourth and are challenging for a Champions League place for 2017/18.
Eyebrows were raised in February 2016 when Nagelsmann, then aged just 28, was made head coach of Hoffenheim. AFP

MMDA does not need reforms: ACJU Chairman
As community pressure mounts on the Committee appointed to look into reforms to the Muslims Marriages and Divorces Act (MMDA) of 1951, to release its report, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) Chairman and member of the Committee for the last eight years, Ash Sheikh Rizwe Mufthi has declared that the MMDA does not need to be reformed.
Sheikh Mufthi in an interview to a website has stated that the MMDA is perfect in its present state.
In 2009, former Justice Minister Milinda Moragoda appointed a 16 member committee to Consider and Propose Reforms to the Muslim Matrimonial Law and Upgrading of Qazi Courts in Sri Lanka. This Committee headed by former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Saleem Marsoof has been in deliberations over the reforming the law along with the ACJU for last several years with no outcomes to show.
Sources within the committee state that the delay was due to a tug of war between members who want progressive reforms of the law and those who prefer to maintain the status quo. The ACJU, known for its conservative interpretation of Islam and the law has been one of the main objectors for reform.
Call for reform however has been put forward by Muslim women groups for the last 60 years and they have pointed out that: a lack of minimum age of marriage, unequal grounds for divorce between men and women, lack of legal premise to appoint women to the government salaried position of Quazi and insufficient maintenance of women in the event of divorce among
other things have caused great harm and unfair grievance among the Muslim women of Sri Lanka.
In our meeting on March 19, we asked the ACJU how we could use the concept of public interest to develop the law when reforming it, a subject we have been reading on widely and seen several Muslim adopt to their own law making. But the ACJU was unaware of it so they have asked one months time to study it. We are to then meet the Fatwa Committee of the ACJU on April 30 to discuss it,Justice Marsoof said.
Thereafter, the members of the Committee are to meet on May 21 at the Auditorium of Muslim Lawyers to finalize the report, added a determined Justice Marsoof.
As the urgency to release the report grows however, the ACJU has put forward its own set of proposals objecting to all forms of reform. They have thus opposed to imposing a minimum age of marriage, the appointment of female Quazis, restrictions of polygamy and any intervention to make divorce initiated by men or women more equitable.
With such opposition to reform, Justice Marsoof said that those who oppose the Committees report could sign in their dissent with reasons for doing so but the report would go ahead as planned.
The members of the Marsoof committee include; Consultant to the Ministry of Justice; Dilhara Amerasinghe, member of the Right to Information Commission; Justice Abdul Salam, Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court; Justice Mackie Mohamed, Shibly Aziz P.C, Faisz Mustapha P.C, Deshabandu Jezima Ismail, Chairman of the Jamiathul Ulema; Ash Sheikh Rizwe Mufthi,
former Dean of the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo; Prof. Sharya scharenguivel, Attorney-at-law Razmara Abdeen, Attorney-at-law Safana Gul Begum, Attorney-at-law Fazlet Shahabdeen, Secretary of the Jamiathul Ulema; Ash Sheikh M.M. Mubarak, Member of the Mediation Commission; F.B. Juranpathy, former Director of Jamiah Naleemia; Dr. M A M Shukri and Chairman of the Quazi Board of Review Nadvi Bahudeen.

Myths about reading and how to put them to death
In the nearly three years that Ive been blogging through Times Top 100 English-Speaking Novels, Ive had many a discussion about books and reading.
If Ive learned one thing (other than the fact that 101 books is a lot of books!), its that readers have strong opinions. Were extremely passionate about the books we like, the books we hate, and the reasons we choose to read, or not read. And well argue with you to the death about these reasons.
Dont believe me Tell someone whos reading an e-reader that theyre not really reading a book, and see what kind of response you get (protect your face from a blunt attack first).
Sometimes, though, those passionate opinions translate into widely circulated nonsense about reading. I call them myths because, well, they just arent true.
Here are five of the most prevalent myths about reading Ive encountered:
1. I cant learn anything from fiction
I hear this one all the time. It used to bother me. Id get a little angry. But, now, Ive grown so accustomed to hearing it that I usually just nod my head and think, Oh, bless your heart.
If you think you cant learn anything from fiction, then youre reading the wrong fiction.
Sure, the novel can serve as an escape. But to say you cant learn anything from 1984 or To Kill A Mockingbird or Harry Potter, or thousands of other novels, just isnt true.
Jesus taught in parables  in other words, a story, a form of fiction  because its an effective teaching method. So if Jesus thinks you can learn from a story, its safe to say that you can learn a lot from a novel.
2. I dont have time to read
This statement will usually come from non-readers who are passive-aggressively judging you for spending so much time with your head in a book.
Truth is, everyone has time to read. Its just a matter of priorities. If you have time to play golf, then you have time to read.
If you have time to watch American Idol (does anyone even watch that anymore), then you have time to read. Youve just given that time to something else.
3. Reading isnt an activity
Of course it is. Sometimes, readers get labeled as lazy slackers who just sit around on their couch all day and read Star Wars fan fiction. (Not true  its actually Twilight on a rocking chair on the porch.)
In all seriousness, reading is as much an activity as taking a test or writing an article or giving a speech. Reading takes mental energy. Ideally, youre reading books that you can learn from, and youre even taking notes or writing in the margins.
Dont buy into the myth that you arent doing anything if youre reading. Your brain would definitely disagree.
4. My opinion about a book doesnt matter
News alert: Your opinion counts! For some reason, many readers get hesitant about expressing their opinion on a book. I believe a lot of that stems from insecurity.
We think something like, If I tell them I believe that, in this passage, the sun is a metaphor for God, will they laugh at me Will I be ostracized from my reading community for having such a terrible, uneducated, ridiculous opinion Will I live alone the rest of my life
But you know what Everyone else is thinking the same thing, maybe just slightly less exaggerated. So be bold.
Whether its at a book group or a lunch discussion or reviewing a book on Amazon, be honest and confident. You dont have to be a professional book reviewer or critic to have a legitimate opinion.
5. If youre reading a particular genre, thats not really reading
I call these people book snobs. And, believe me, I know. Im a recovering book snob myself.
The book snobs might say your love of the vampire romance genre doesnt count, or the fact that you have Snookis biography on your shelf is embarrassing (okay, maybe thats true).
But you have to read what youre passionate about. If you dont like Faulkner or historical biographies, no amount of prodding by a book snob will change your mind.
Heres the truth: If youre reading anything, youre reading. And thats a lot more than many people can boast these days.
Bottom line: You cant go wrong with reading
Our culture has reached the point that readers  no matter what they choose to read  should be commended for reading.
Instead of turning our nose up at what a friend chooses to read, we should just appreciate that theyre reading in the first place. After all, readers are a rare breed, nowadays.

NDBs international rating affirmed at B with Stable Outlook
Standard & Poors (S&P) has affirmed National Development Banks (NDB) long term and short term issuer credit rating at B with a stable outlook in their report dated March 20 2017.
The affirmation is given on the ratings issued by S&P in December 2016. The affirmation also comes along with S&Ps withdrawal of all ratings on NDB at the Banks request.
NDB engaged the international rater S&P in 2013 for international credit ratings as a part of the then proposed US Dollar bond which the Bank envisaged to issue in the international market. The issuance of the bonds did not materialize due to unfavourable market conditions and rates which prevailed at that point of time.
As such the Bank presently is not in need for an international issuer rating, hence the Banks management decided to discontinue the rating agreement with S&P.
S&Ps report states that the affirmed rating at the time of withdrawal reflected the raters expectation that NDB will maintain its satisfactory business and revenue diversification over the next 12 months.

We have to introduce the policy while preserving the provincial interests as well as the interests of the center, he pointed out.
The Provincial ministries have the most number of cooperative societies. They have the most number of people working in them. Therefore it is of utmost importance that they reflect on its content and contribute to make necessary adjustments, he said.

No Swine Flu in Maldives; Media taken to task
Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundera Bandara yesterday blamed the media for inaccurate reportage pertaining to Influenza AH1N1.
He said: Recently, a media organisation irresponsibly and inaccurately reported that there is Swine Flu in Maldives and one of those affected had arrived in Sri Lanka from Maldives.
There is no truth in it at all. The media should stick to scientific facts when reporting health matters, the acting Director General of Health stated. Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said there is certainly Influenza in Maldives, and, other than that, there is no other disease there. Influenza AH1N1 has been in Sri Lanka for three years now. It is not something new or information to panic. Persons with AH1N1 travel all over the world without any restriction.
According to Dr. Bandara, patients with Influenza AH1N1 were reported from areas such as Kandy, Bibile, Kilinochchi etc in the recent past and immediate steps were taken to control the disease, without letting it to spread to other areas. There is a well-established system at the BIA and other places to control diseases coming into the country through passengers arrival from abroad.
The media should not destroy the booming tourism industry in the country by reporting health issues inaccurately and irresponsibly, without being based on scientific facts, he added.

North Korea missile launch 'fails'

A North Korean missile launch has failed, South Korean defence officials say, but it is unclear how many were fired or what exactly was being tested.
The US military said it detected a missile which appeared to explode within seconds of being launched.
North Korea is banned from any missile or nuclear tests by the United Nations.
However, it has conducted such tests with increasing frequency and experts say this could lead to advances in its missile technology.
Earlier this month, the North fired four missiles that flew about 1,000km (620 miles) landing in Japanese waters.
This test came from the eastern coastal town of Wonsan and will be seen as a response to the ongoing annual US-South Korea military drills that the North sees as preparation for an attack on it.
North Korea is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that could strike the US, and has previously claimed it had successfully miniaturised nuclear warheads so they can fit on missiles.
However, most experts believe the North is still some time away from being able to realise such a goal.
Today's failure indicates that North Korea's space programme still has some way to go before its blood-curdling threats to turn Seoul and Washington into seas of flame are achievable.
Some experts also believe that the salvo of four missiles fired towards Japan two weeks ago may actually have been five, with one launch failing.
In addition to its missile failures, North Korea is not thought to have developed heat-resistant material necessary to launch a truly long-range intercontinental ballistic missile. But progress does seem to be being made
Last weekend, North Korea conducted a rocket engine test that its leader Kim Jong-un claimed was a breakthrough in its rocket technology. This has not been confirmed by independent experts.
It came as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Japan, South Korea and China for talks on North Korea's recent actions, including its two most recent nuclear tests.
Tillerson had said amilitary option was on the tableif the North threatened the South or US forces.

[Parliament (22-03-2017)]
New legislation for flexibility on Treasury Bond limits
The government will bring in new legislation concerning the issue of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds to provide for flexibility in raising higher or lesser amounts than specified in the Order published in the Gazette, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was responding to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He said the same legislation would declare legal all the Treasury Bills and Bonds that have been issued so far including private placements. He said the Legal Draftsman has been asked to draft the legislation while the Attorney General has been asked to look at it. The Treasury Bills are governed by the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance of 1939. Under that, the Finance Minister should specify by Order published in the Gazette as to how much to be raised, the modes of raising, the rates and all the details in respect of each loan. According to the Ordinance, loans can be raised only after the Order is Gazetted. However, it transpired in the Presidential Commission that we have not followed it for some time.
In fact, we have been raising the loans and Gazetting them only at the end of the year. This has started from 1999. I found that the loans that were authorized by former Minister K N Choksy were Gazetted by Dr. Sarath Amunugama as the subject minister in a different government. This is the procedure that has been going on for a long time, he pointed out.
This is not very satisfactory. On the whole, the legislation is also not very satisfactory because it was done in 1939. The flexibility has to be there to raise a larger or lesser amount when the issue is taking place, he added.
Once the minister takes a decision to raise money through Treasury Bills or Bonds, it would be advertised in the papers as of the new procedure to be set up by the new legislation, said the Premier.
He said Parliament could also be informed about these advertisements. The new legislation will give the flexibility of raising the same amounts specified, or lesser or higher amounts than that. The legislation will provide for two other issues. One is declaring legal all the Treasury Bills that have been issued so far. If not, some people may challenge them by saying we raised the money before the Gazette was issued and therefore they were not legal.
The other issue is the private placements. When this government came we made a public commitment not to have private placements but to go for public auctions or use some other transparent system. Nevertheless, private placements have taken place and it came out in the inquiries that there had been no formal decision even on private placements. Therefore the same legislation will make all bonds issued on private placements legal. Otherwise someone might challenge the Central Bank before courts when we go to redeem the bonds, he pointed out.
Cabinet nod for Htota PortJoint Venture andindustrial zone
The Cabinet yesterday unanimously approved the Hambantota Port Joint Venture and setting up of an industrial zone attached to it, Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking at an adjournment debate on the state of economy moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Dr. Amunugama, who was the Chairman of the six-member Ministerial Committee appointed to finalise the agreements related to the Hambantota Port joint venture, said the Hambantota port would be developed as a leading international port in the region.
He said the Cabinet approval in this regard was a historical milestone concerning the economic development of the country. He said the proposed industrial zone in down south would house 400 industries, adding that it would be made the largest industrial zone in South Asia.
He said as per the joint venture agreement, China Merchant will hold 80 percent stake, while the balance 20 percent will be held by the Sri Lankan Government. However, he said after the lapse of five months, 20 percent of equities will be available in the share market.
Within five months, we can reduce 80 percent stake of the China Merchant company to 60 percent. We can up our stake upto 40 percent. The Joint Venture will be operated by a locally registered company. Security related activities in the port will be handled by the Sri Lanka Navy, he said.
The minister said USD 3.5 billion out of USD 7 billion foreign reserves the former Government boasted about belonged to the US based Templeton Fund. The economic development the former Government claimed to have achieved was based on US money, Dr. Amunugama said.
PM questions JO members on opposing govt
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday queried Joint Opposition members as to why they would not sit with the government in Parliament if they agree with President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Prime Minister made this observation yesterday in response to MP Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament who questioned as to how a minister agreed to set up a hybrid Court and appoint foreign judges to courts of Sri Lanka, breaching the Constitution. He said the President had to make a contradictory statement that he would not appoint foreign judges.
Why dont you come and sit with the government if you agree with the President, the Prime Minister said responding to MP Gunawardena.
We have not breached the Constitution and had not agreed to set up a hybrid court or to appoint foreign judges. We have sought experts to participate as observers, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said according to the Constitution, judges should be Sri Lankans.
The people have given us mandate. We assure that we would abide by the Constitution, he said.
Govt will take more loans: PM
The Government will have to obtain more loans given the current state of affairs of the economy. It will make sure that it is in a position to service the debt obtained after 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was making an overview of the countrys debt situation in Parliament yesterday in reply to a question by UPFA MP Ranjith de Zoysa. The Prime Minister said plans have been made to increase income from exports and the tourism industry. He said new investments and regaining of GSP trade concession would be beneficial to this end.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Government strives to uplift the countrys economy to a position that it could service the debt of the former Government by 2020. He said the Government has no plan to sell state owned institutions, but added private sector investments would be sought to generate income from them.
The Government wants Rs. 11,000 billion to service debt from 2017 to 2026. The Government revenue mechanism will be strengthened by systematising the tax collection process. While maintaining government income at expected levels, we would take measures to prevent the increase of recurrent expenditure. We are introducing financial management methods for that purpose. We aim at bringing down the budget deficit to 3.5 percent of the GDP in 2020, he said.
The Prime Minister said the debt of the country stood at Rs. 8503.2 billion as at December 31, 2015. Of that amount, Rs. 4,959.2 billion was local debt, while Rs. 3,544 billion was foreign debt.
The total debt was 77.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The government had spent Rs. 1318 billion as loan resettlement instalments in 2015. That amount was 91 percent of the national income, he said.
During the last 10 years, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Road Development Authority, Shipping Corporation, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, Srilankan Airlines, Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board had obtained direct loans from the Hatton National Bank, Peoples Bank and DFCC Bank. Those loans are not included in the total public debt percentage, he said.
In 2005, the total public debt stood at Rs. 2,222 billion. When the war was over in 2009, the amount had increased to Rs. 4,361 billion. At the end of 2014, the figure had risen to Rs. 7,391 billion. The public debt had increased by Rs. 3,230 billion from 2009 to 2014. None was aware as to how and why the public debt had increased by Rs. 3,230 billion during the post war period because the amount of loans taken at the time of the war was much less than that, the Prime Minister said.
When the new government came to power in 2015, many hidden details pertaining to those loans came to light. We found that information of loans took by the public institutions were not included in the public debt system. The amount excluded from the public debt system was Rs. 960.8 billion - the CPC had taken Rs. 365 billion, Ports Authority Rs. 260 billion, SriLankan Airlines Rs. 212 billion, the list is too long, he said.
The Sri Lanka Transport Board had not sent Rs. 13 billion it should have sent to the EPF and the ETF of its contributions. Departments and Ministries owe further Rs. 58.4 billion. Of that amount, Rs. 24 billion owed by the Highways Ministry, he said.
The Government launched a public awareness campaign through print and electronic media to inform the public of the debt situation of the country. The cost of that campaign was 0.0005 percent of the total loans taken from 2005 to 2014, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said replying to a supplementary question by MP Ranjith de Zoysa.
The previous government never informed Parliament of the loans it had taken, neither it reported of the loans and included them in due records.
It shows the then governments financial management was arbitrary. The previous government by not informing public representatives in Parliament of its financial activities, humiliated Parliaments supremacy over public finance, the Prime Minister said.
Govt rescued country from economic volcano: Ravi
The previous government handed over the country to them with an economy that resembled a volcano. The government has brought the country to a better level even reducing the prices of 22 essential commodities while increasing salaries, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the economic situation of the country.
The minister said the prices of petrol, diesel, milk powder, gas and many other commodities have been reduced. The people have forgotten them. The previous government took loans and pointed them out as foreign investments. We have had to pay those loans, Karunanayake said.
He questioned as to how institutions pay taxes if they face economic difficulties. He said no one is jumping into rivers due to economic difficulties like during previous regimes.
He said Bandula Gunawardena has become a liar before the committee hearing the bond issue. Joint Opposition members are talking without fear because of five star democracy.
Only 11 projects were implemented during Mahinda Rajapaksas period. But during these two years, we have commenced 31 projects. That is the change, Minister Karunanayake said.
He said when the Government is engaged in discussions, it is a problem for Sunil Handunnetti and his party members. When we talk to China, the Opposition worries, the minister said.
We have enough money. But we cant spend them to settle loans, he said.
Anura Kumara queries on defence pact with US
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament demanded to know whether the government intends to extend the defence pact with the US, signed in 2007 for another 10 years.
Raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2), MP Dissanayake said the Acquisition and Cross-Services Agreement signed by then US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Robert O Blake and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was to end on March 5, 2017, and queried whether the government has plans to renew it.
As of the agreement, we are bound to allow the US military to use our land, sea and air space during a war in the region and to provide them with infrastructure facilities. We have no choice but to be a US ally during a war situation, he said.
The MP asked the government to inform the House on the content of the agreement prior to signing it.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the reply to the question would be given today.
Dinesh quizzes govts stanceon hybrid courts
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena queried if the government would continue to agree the UNHRC to set up hybrid courts, violating Constitutional provisions to hunt War Heroes.
He made these observations yesterday making a special statement under standing order 23 (2) querying if the Government had agreed with a proposal to set up a hybrid court comprising foreign judges to probe war crimes and to extend the period for the proposals included in the cosponsored resolution before the UNHRC in 2015.
The UNHRC with the Sri Lankan Government cosponsored resolution in 2015 with a proposal inimical to the latter.
He said it included proposals to set up a hybrid court comprising foreign judges to probe war crimes, violating Constitutional provisions to hunt War Heroes.
I quote from the resolution, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said. Take note with appreciation the oral update presented by the High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council at its 27th session, the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka and the report of its investigation on Sri Lanka requested in Human Rights Council, including its findings and conclusions, and encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations.
He said that the paragraph six of the resolution reads as follows. Independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality; and further affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorised prosecutors and investigators.
Gunawardena questioned if the Prime Minister knew that the Joint Opposition objected this section and even President Maithripala Sirisena had stated that he would not appoint foreign judges and foreign lawyers into a Court.
He asked if the Prime Minister agreed.
The validity period of the 2015 resolution on Sri Lanka before the UNHRC is to be over in March 2017, Gunawardena said.
We want to know if the government would agree the period of the resolution be extended along with the proposals, including those that are against the countrys Constitution, he said.
Country facing monetary crisis: Dinesh
The country is facing an unprecedented monetary crisis, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday. He said measures taken by the unity government to develop the economy have proved a failure.
The only option it had was to sell public institutions. He demanded to know as to what means the government would take to develop the economy of the country. MP Gunawardena made these observations moving an adjournment motion in Parliament.
He said the development rate of the economy is 4.6 percent.
It was 6.5 percent when the country was handed over to the incumbent government in 2015.
The exchange rate of the US dollar was Rs. 132 in 2015 January. It has increased to Rs. 156, Gunawardena said.
He said the government has decided to sell State institutions like the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, Ports Authority.
He said the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank too has warned the government that it would have to face an economic crisis.
He questioned as to what was the governments latest modus operandi to face the crisis.
Non-grant of bail to remanded MPs limits their service
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane yesterday informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that non-grant of bail to Parliamentarians who are in remand custody has become a problem to carry out their duties in the House.
He requested the Speaker to look into the matter.
Although MP Gunawardhane did not mention the name of an MP when he made the request from the Speaker, some members were heard telling the name of MP Weerawansa who is in remand custody.
Speaker Jayasuriya responding to the request said he had begun to discuss the issue with the relevant persons.

Rainwater harvesting : Resource guaranteed for the underprivileged
Today is World Water Day. The Daily News sat down with Executive Director of the Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum Dr. Tanuja Ariyananda to discuss what her organization does to combat water scarcity in Sri Lanka. As the world undergoes climate change, seasonal rainfall is becoming more erratic, further challenging scientists and policymakers who wish to ensure water availability for everyone. One such manner of guaranteeing access to water is through rainwater harvesting, whereby rain is captured in large above-ground tanks. Dr. Ariyanandas organization has set up thousands of these systems to combat drinking water scarcity for people throughout the island.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Can you tell me about the work you do
A: We promote the idea of collecting rainwater, or rainwater harvesting, for domestic use, especially in areas where water is scarce. Sri Lanka is a high-rainfall country, so you might wonder why we need to do this, but it is very important. Although we generally have good rainfall, from 900 millimeters to 5,500 millimeters (mm) in the hilly areas, we have some pockets that barely get enough rainwater. But the water in these areas is not collected efficiently in my opinion.
These areas suffer from lack of water from time to time because rainfall is seasonable and variable. Some areas dont get rain throughout the year, but get it in two seasons. In countries like Sri Lanka, rainwater harvesting is ideal, and the basic concept is collecting rain and using it during the dry season.
We have set up about 7,000 tank systems ourselves, and we have worked with other organizations, including the government, the Water Board, and other NGOs, to set up about 40,000 of these systems.
Q: Sri Lanka just emerged from a serious drought. Is this an effective system for supplying water during droughts
A: Very much so. We get more requests to set up tanks during droughts than during the rainy season, but that is too late, since you should collect rainwater when it is still raining. But I think droughts and floods are now a part of daily life.
The seasons have changed to the drought season and the flood season, rather than the monsoon season, so our systems are ideal for both situations. If you collect water during floods, you reduce the flood level as well, because you are collecting and arresting the water. And then during the drought, you use that water that youve saved.
Q: Where are you concentrating your efforts in Sri Lanka
A: We try to help people all over Sri Lanka, but most of our work happens in the dry zone areas in the North, East, and some parts of the South, like Uva Province.
Q: Can you tell me about the systems you use to collect rainwater
Dr. TanujaAriyananda
A: We mostly set up roof water harvesting systems. We have special gutter systems that deliver the water from the roof to the catchment and into ferrocement tanks. We use chicken mesh as a frame and use cement to build around it. Its a low-cost system that is generally built above ground. Its easy to manage and easy to maintain. Thats the basic system, but the type of tank does not matter as long as it can be closed. An 8,000-litre tank will cost about Rs. 65,000 to build, including labour.
Q: Is there some kindof filtration mechanism
A: Yes, we have what is called a first-flush system where we dont collect the first rain from the roof because it might contain some debris and dust. We let the first rain itself wash the roof.
Then the clean water goes into the tank. Even before that, just before it enters the tank, there is another filter that takes out any debris that might come in with the water. Its a homemade filter made from small pebbles and charcoal, with some cloth or mesh on it as well. Any leaves, debris, or unwanted material also get arrested there.
Also, when we extract water from the tank, we dont take it from the bottom. We allow any sediment that might come in to settle at the bottom of the tank, and then we take water from a little above the bottom so that we dont get any of the sediment. But people wash out the tanks from time to time and get rid of the debris and sediment.
Q: Are there any problemswith this system
A: The only issue is maintenance. The user maintains the rainwater harvesting system. There is no external person coming in to check on it. You have to maintain it yourself. If you dont know how to maintain it or neglect to maintain it, you can have problems. For instance, if you leave the lid open, mosquitoes can go in and breed.
The above ground tanks themselves are very solid. They have lasted for 20 years quite well. Also, plastic tanks last up to 20 years, if not more. We have had some problems with underground tanks, and that is why we dont promote these systems too much now. Roots pierce and crack underground tanks.
Resident maintaining the water tank
Q: How are you funded
A: We have different funders. Thats always a challenge for us. We always have to look for funding. USAID has been funding us for three years for projects in the North and the Uva Province. We have been funded by the Japan Water Forum, the Korean Water Foundation, and the Canadian Development Agency, among others, in the past. But we dont give the whole system for free.
We get some commitment from the beneficiaries themselves. They contribute by building gutters on roofs and providing labour during construction. About 15 percent of the cost is borne by the beneficiaries.
Unfortunately, the system isnt being taken up more because of the initial cost. Rainwater is free, but you need to spend some money at the start. It would be great if a bank or the government could provide that initial investment in the form of a loan, perhaps an interest-free loan.
Q: How do you manage implementationWho goes and builds the tanks
A: We have a skilled group of masons scattered throughout the island for that purpose. Every time we work in a district, we recruit masons from the area, and we train them ourselves.
Then they do future projects in their respective districts. We have been promoting ferrocement tanks because they give some business to local guys as well.
We have trained more than 400 masons so far. I should also add that we rarely build single tanks. We generally provide many for a village. We select the number of beneficiaries, do an awareness program, then provide the supplies. We can construct about 15 to 16 tanks in a weeks time.
Q: Are you involved in any awarenesscampaigns around the island
A: Yes, awareness is a very important aspect of our work. Although this concept is not new in Sri Lanka, its a traditional concept that has been around for centuries. So we have to remind ourselves that this is a possibility. And of course there are a lot of obstacles.
When people first see the tanks, they are not sure whether they are reliable. So, awareness is really important, and we have to do it from top-down and bottom-up. We meet with government agents, and they invite people from that district for an information session on the tanks. We also work at the household level to raise awareness.
When we visit a village, we dont just dish out rainwater harvesting systems for everybody. We tell them what it is first, and ask them to apply for a system. They apply, and we pick who should get one based on our selection criteria. The criteria are based on a households access to water, and anybody who has to go beyond 250 metres to get their drinking water is eligible.
We emphasize helping women-headed households, especially in war-affected areas. We also look to help households that have a lot of children and those that have people with disabilities. Lately, we have targeted people with water-borne diseases, especially those in areas where many suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease.
Q: How have the outcomesbeen for the beneficiaries
A: There is initially some reluctance to adapt it in new areas. Everybody wants pipe water supplies, but it isnt possible for many places in Sri Lanka. If they cant have water pipes, they want wells, but thats not always possible.
Even if it was possible, water in the wells is not good for drinking. We have to convince them that this is another option, so we conduct tests with a few people in a village who are willing to have the system, and find out if they want their own systems. We have a huge demand after the tests.
Q: What do most people useharvested rainwater for
A: They use it for anything you would use water for. But drinking is an especially important one, especially in areas where water is not of high quality. People in areas where there is a lot of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) generally drink rainwater.
But rainwater isnt used for bathing and large-scale washing so much. They can use it during the rainy season for these purposes, but theres not enough water during the dry season for bathing.
Q: How clean is rainwater
A: Rainwater is the purest water. There are only a few places where there is acid rain, but this is limited to areas where there are coal power stations. So far, we dont have a lot of problems with acid rain here. But in urban areas, where there is a lot of vehicle exhaust, the pH of rain can be a little low, say between 4.5 and 5.
In those areas, I wouldnt promote rainwater for drinking, but you dont need to harvest water in those areas because most of them have pipe water supplies. But any other uses, like toilet flushing, gardening, washing cars, you can use rainwater for.
In my opinion, its a crime to use pipe water for any of those purposes because, for instance, in gardening, youre using chlorinated water, which is bad for plants and the country.
Q: Do you think this is the future of self-sufficient water management in Sri Lanka
A: I hope so. Even if you have another water supply, whether its a pipe water or well water supply, having a rainwater harvesting system is not a loss. Its only a gain, because you can use the water for anything.

Raonic back to avenge Queens defeat
LONDON: Canadian tennis ace Milos Raonic warned Tuesday he was determined to avenge last years final defeat to Andy Murray in the key Wimbledon warm-up tournament at Queens Club in June.
The 26-year-old lost to British star Murray in both the Queens and Wimbledon finals last year but said he felt he should have won the former.
World number five Raonic will face a top class field as Murray, Rafael Nadal, US Open champion Stan Wawrinka and 2014 winner Grigor Dimitrov have all said they will play.
Having reached the final of the Championships last year I really want to go one better this time, Raonic told the tournament website.
Its a great tournament with more than a century of history, so to be so close to victory last year was a really special experience.
At the same time I feel like, as well as Andy played in the final, its one that got away from me and I want to try to put that right this year.
It is also a great way to be in the best shape on grass as Andy and I showed last year by reaching the Wimbledon final three weeks after Queens last year. Tournament Director Stephen Farrow said it was terrific Raonic, who lost to Murray for a third time in England last year in a thrilling semi-final in the ATP World Tour finals last November, would be back. Milos won over everyone with his run to the final last year and the grace with which he accepted defeat, said Farrow.
We are delighted that he is going to be back with us this year to try to go one better. AFP

The Banker said Karunanayake secured to avoid a balance of payments crisis, replenish reserves and rebuild confidence among international investors.

Ravindra Deyshappriya, speaks on Sri Lanka - China Economic Relations
Ravindra Deyshappriya, Research Director of the Global Economy programme at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), recently made an invited presentation on Sri Lanka - China Economic Relations in Comparative Context, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The presentation was chaired by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Harsha de Silva and attended by around 40 officers of the Foreign Ministry.
Deyshappriya's presentation was the first contribution to a series of seminars initiated by the Foreign Ministry, which intends to offer new ideas and research on topics relevant to the Ministry's work.
Deyshappriya presented his recent working paper on Sri Lanka - China Economic Relations and highlighted policy priorities to strengthen trade, investment and tourism relations between the two countries.
His presentation noted that flooding imports from China and sluggish exports accounted for 26.4% of Sri Lanka's total trade deficit in 2014. He emphasised, however, that imports from China are crucial sources of raw materials for Sri Lanka's main exports, particularly garments and textiles.
Deyshappriya's presentation highlighted several policy priorities to boost exports, including new export products like medical equipment, products that can be exported to China at zero tariffs, products with growing demand in China such as manioc and leather, and various strategic measures.
These strategies include the expansion of city-to-city and mayor-to-mayor links to address the differentiated market preferences between various cities, rather than targeting the Chinese market as a whole. Deyshappriya observed that China is Sri Lanka's top FDI donor accounting for 24.5% of total FDI inflows to Sri Lanka in 2014. Despite the growth of Chinese FDI, however, no South Asian country - including Sri Lanka - features among even the top 10 recipients of Chinese FDI to Asia and Chinese FDI stock owned by Sri Lanka is only 0.10% of the island's GDP - the least among its South Asian counterparts.
Deyshappriya noted the potential rewards of close relations with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and improved Ease of Doing Business indicators. The presentation called for the streamlining of issuing Chinese business visas and full translation of Sri Lanka's investment-related websites (especially the BOI website) into Chinese.
The increasing numbers of Sri Lankan students in China could be assisted in obtaining internships in high-potential Chinese companies, to build contacts from the ground up and reap better investment and trade relations in the long-term.
The previously un-researched area of tourism relations between Sri Lanka and China was examined by Deyshappriya, who noted that China was Sri Lanka's second largest tourism partner in 2015, accounting for almost 12% of total tourist arrivals.
As he observed, however, Sri Lanka does not rank even among the top 25 tourist destinations of China. Several policy options were suggested to help rectify this, including the introduction of more Chinese-speaking guides and hotel staff in Sri Lanka, development of Chinese travel guide apps for the increasing numbers of tourists traveling outside a tour group, strengthening of air connectivity between the two countries, greater acceptance of Chinese credit cards, and promotion of Sri Lanka on online e-tourism sites frequented by Chinese travellers (like Tuniu, Baidu and Sina) and Chinese social media (especially Weibo).

RCL, Penang Port  getting ready for mega cruise ships
Cruise line operator Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) and Malaysia's Penang Port Sdn Bhd (PPSB) plan to upgrade the Swettenham Pier Cruise Terminal (SPCT) in Georgetown to accommodate berthing of larger cruise ships. Under a joint venture agreement, the parties said they would extend the existing berths to 688 metres from its current length of 400 metres, enabling the terminal to berth two mega cruise liners carrying over 4,900 passengers each.
The 40/60 joint venture, which will be jointly managed by both parties, with the majority stake held by PPSB, informed that the upgrades would also include spaces for tour buses to ease the flow of traffic in the areas around SPCT.
Additionally, the USD 35 million project will further focus on improving accessibility for the aged and physically challenged throughout the terminal from ship to shore, the parties said.
This planned development has received unyielding support from both State and Federal government and associated government agencies including Tourism bodies, and will be a focal part of Malaysian Tourism EPP6 plan to create a Straits and Borneo Cruise Riviera, Royal Caribbean Cruises said.

Russian freighter lists  in Norwegian sea
Russian-flagged cargo ship Mekhanik Fomin developed a heavy portside list while underway in the Norwegian Sea west off Narvik after a reported cargo shift, Norwegian Coast Guard confirmed.
The ship, loaded with timber, was en route to Inverness, the UK when it got in trouble following a cargo shift on March 18th. Namely, some of the cargo is reported to have fallen overboard causing the ship to list.
Once informed of the incident, the Norwegian Coast Guard sent its ships KV Senja and Strulborg to the scene to assist the ship.
As informed, the ship's crew managed to regain control of the vessel and restore power, and the ship was escorted to Sortland where the necessary repairs would follow suit.
The 13 crew members remained on board and there were no reports of injuries.
Speaking to local media, Coast Guard duty officer Jan-Hugo Lassesen, said that it was probably the inclement weather that caused the incident.

Shesha Palihakkara: The father and son
Between Lester James Peries and Dharmasena Pathiraja, between Rekava and Ahas Gawwa, there was a crevice in our cinema. That crevice could only be filled by a set of energetic, conscientious professionals, who worked not for profit but for the love of what they were doing. Their task was to transform the film industry from a business to an art-form. Whether they wrought such a transformation, not even historians and film theorists can tell us. We can, however, guess.
Commercial films
That crevice I alluded to earlier was sustained by a horde of technicians who were more concerned in telling a story than innovating on the medium they were working in. Profit came later, but whether they aimed for it or not, they got back what they invested in. They were the first proponents of parallel cinema, which made use of the tropes inherent in commercial films to moralise, pontificate, and if necessary preach. That this parallel cinema was critically appealed can be inferred by a perusal of the results of the Sarasaviya Film Awards, from its inception in 1964.
Among the pioneers who championed such a cinema here, we can point at Tissa Liyanasuriya, Shesha Palihakkara, Mike Wilson, and (among the actors) Joe Abeywickrama. Of these, only Tissa is still with us. This is not, however, a tribute to Tissa Liyanasuriya, whom I wrote on a year back. This is a tribute to the father of all these pioneers. Shesha Palihakkara.
Shesha was everything. Well, almost everything. He could sing, he could dance, he could act. He could also write. He knew the best of both worlds. Whatever he absorbed, he absorbed it well.
He came under the influence of Chitrasena, travelled to India, came back, and experimented in both theatre and the cinema. He didnt act as much as we wished him to, but that didnt matter.
For the truth is, if we are to locate Tissa Liyanasuriya in the dormant period between 1956 and 1974, we cant leave Shesha out. He was there, helping Tissa unleash the wave that has, for some odd reason, been forgotten and belittled today.
Shesha Palihakkara was born in the village of Ruppagoda in Kadawatha. He was educated at St Benedicts College in Kotahena and St Josephs College in Maradana. In 1943, when he was 14, he happened to see a poster of Chitrasenas ballet Vidura while on his way to Colombo from Ragama. He went to see it at the Vidyalankara Pirivena in Kelaniya. This was soon followed by encounters with the cinema, and soon enough he was there at the Regal, the Olympia, and pretty much every other theatre devouring everything and anything that the Americans and the Indians directed.
Learning dance
His first and foremost figure of destiny, however, was Chitrasena. After learning dance from him for six months, he forewent on his SSC Exams (to the consternation of his parents) and followed his guru to Shantiniketan. After studying there for more than two years, he got himself enrolled at the Kalashethraya in South India, where he befriended Mohan Khokar (later to be an authority on Indian dancing) and enthralled himself by the sights, sounds, and rhythms of the region. In 1948, when we were about to be given our independence, he returned to his country and took part in a ballet Chitrasena conceived to commemorate the handing over of freedom, Pageant of Lanka (where he was Lakshmana, brother to Rama).
After stints at teaching at the Chitrasena Kala Ayathanaya in Kollupitiya, Shesha met up with the indomitable Reggie Candappa, later to be a guru in the advertising industry, who introduced him to a cabaret producer and showman called Donavan Andree. Donavan hired Shesha at his club the Silver Fawn in Colombo, where he was paid handsomely and which eventually got him to go to London. In London, he met up with the Indian dancer Ram Gopal, and tried his hand at the theatre. Barely a year later, though, he felt homesick and returned to Sri Lanka to immerse himself in his craft.
The Sinhala cinema was born out of the opera, the Nadagama, and the Nurthi theatre. Shesha found himself working with Nayagam, one of our film producers who hailed from South India, directing a dance sequence in Ahankala Sthree in 1953. The director of that puerile film got him back to the cinema with his next film, Puduma Leli, after which an audition was held to take him as the leading actor for the landmark Mathalan (shot almost entirely in Madras). As those who have watched and cherished that historical epic would know, Shesha played two roles: the vengeful king and his remorseful son. This was in 1955.
In 1956 he was featured as the stilt-walker (the boru kakul karaya) by Lester James Peries in his debut, Rekava. That was a cameo appearance, which lasted for barely 15 minutes and which, for some bewildering reason, was butchered and cut down in subsequent versions of the film. While working in Rekava, he was called to assist David Lean's crew for his Bridge on the River Kwai, which paired him with Gamini Fonseka and Chandran Rutnam. He rejoined Ram Gopal in London thereafter, was afflicted with an illness, returned to Sri Lanka, and waded into the third and richest phase in his career: as a producer.
Underwater sequences
Ran Muthu Duwa, unlike Getawarayo, Saravita, and the later films of Tissa Liyanasuriya, gives the impression of being made in a hurry, to take advantage of the many underwater sequences which would have enthralled foreign audiences.
Mike Wilson, who directed it, was a flamboyant, almost otherworldly parvenu, shirked by more mainstream directors and producers because he aimed high with the box-office AND the budget. We do know that it cost about 500,000 rupees to make Ran Muthu Duwa (owing in part to his decision to shoot it in colour), and we do know that as a film, it remains a landmark chiefly for its technical merits and ambitious scope than for its narrative.
Despite its many failings as a work of art, however, theres no denying that it set a precedent here. If our cinema had subsisted on the Indian cinema before Rekava, Ran Muthu Duwa proved that it could also subsist on the American cinema. The exoticism this evoked could be inferred from the very name of the production company that Wilson formed: Serendib Films. The target audience were those who preferred the tropical sights of Sri Lanka to a cohesive story. This was echoed even in Getawarayo, a qualitatively better film (which incidentally culminates in a boat race that echoes the chariot race from Ben-Hur), but not in Saravita, which was the brainchild of Liyanasuriya and the main actor, Joe Abeywickrama.
Shesha saw through all this. Between Mike Wilsons fondness for the American cinema and Tissa Liyanasuriyas fondness for Sri Lankan locales, he was the middle-man. He knew how to bargain and how to get the most out of a little, qualities not many were endowed with in the industry. That is why, when he left us for the first time after the sixties, then forever on July 12, 2009, he was mourned.
The vast territory he looked at and walked over, we cannot discount. He was a virtual one-man army: a dancer, a singer, an actor, a showman, and a storyteller. He was not afflicted with arrogance, which explains the many twists, turns, and trials and tribulations he endured to improve his craft. Whether he could have produced more, and whether critics would have cherished him if he continued with the kind of cinema he was comfortable with in the tumultuous seventies, we do not know. What we do know, however, is that he knew many things, and that in the end, he taught them all. To us.

Shipping industry looking for ways to return faster volume growth
The shipping industry is looking for ways to return to faster expansion in volumes as the slowdown in volume growth since the financial crisis focussed the industry's thoughts on potential barriers to healthy long-term trade growth, according to Clarksons.
From 1988 to 2008, growth in world seaborne trade averaged an estimated 4.2% pa, a fairly robust level underpinning long-term demand for ships. The markets at times felt the impact of oversupply but sustained weakness of demand growth wasn't generally the problem.
However, since 2009, the growth rate has slowed, averaging 3.2%, and just 2.8% since 2013. This still equates to significant additional volumes - 1.8% growth in 2015 added 194 million tons - but it's still enough to get market players worrying, Clarksons said. The current cycle certainly feels like it has dragged on as it's now more than eight years since the onset of the financial crisis, Clarksons noted.
However, there are interesting historical comparisons. Between 1929 (the year of the Wall Street Crash) and 1932, the value of global trade dropped by 62% and didn't get back to the same level until the post-war years.
Today perhaps some of the anxiety is amplified by the seemingly wide range of factors that look threatening to seaborne trade's supportive historical record. Protectionist tendencies, whether they be from the Trump presidency or the UK's Brexit vote, slowing growth in China, peak trade, robotics and 3D printing - nobody really knows how things will pan out but everyone's watching closely for anything to allay at least some of the fears, Clarksons explained.
Six months ago, Clarksons reported that seaborne trade appeared to be showing a pick-up and this time round things are still looking positive. The 3-month moving average shows a generally upward trend since autumn 2015 with an average of 4% in the second half of 2016, hinting that the bottom of the demand cycle may finally have been passed. The current projection for overall seaborne trade in 2017 is still less than 3% with plenty of scenarios possible, but both market sentiment and the momentum right now feel a little more positive than that.
While it's quite right to try to assess the range of factors which appear to be lining up against a return to more robust levels of trade growth, it's also far from incorrect to look for signs of a turn in the trend.
Cycles in shipping can be long and sometimes it can take a while to identify them, Clarksons pointed out.

Sixth suspect arrested
The CID arrested a corporal, and the sixth suspect attached to the Army Intelligence Unit, yesterday, in connection with the assault on journalist Keith Noyahr in 2008.
He was arrested for colluding with the team which abducted the journalist. The suspect was remanded until March 30 by the Mt. Lavinia Magistrates Court yesterday. The corporal is attached to the Tripoli Army Camp in Maradana.
The CID which re-opened the case of the abduction and assault on Noyahr, in 2015, have already arrested five army intelligence personnel in connection with the case; the arrests were made early this year. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in his evidence to the CID had earlier stated that a special unit which operated under former Head of Intelligence Services Kapila Hendawitharana carried out several attacks in Colombo. It has also become increasingly clear that the same group which carried out the attack on former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga was connected to the attack on Noyahr.
This crime too has been committed using the army, confirmed CID Inspector Nishantha Silva.
Inspector Silva also explained that technical evidence obtained from the mobile phones of the suspect showed that all of them were in contact with each other when the attack took place . The data from the phones also linked them to the house in Dompe which they had taken Noyahr to.
The group had rented out the house using money from the Army Intelligence Unit, added Silva.
Investigations since 2015 revealed that the Army Intelligence Unit had rented two houses in Dompe; one in Lansiyawatte and the other in Baduwatte Walawwa. They had used Dompe Lansiyawatte from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2008. After vacating it , it had obtained Dompe Baduwatte Walawwa in March 2008 on lease. They had occupied this house from that date to March 2009 for a one-year period. It is believed that this house had been used by a sub-unit of the intelligence unit of the Tripoli Camp of Maradana.
On May 22, 2008, Keith Noyahr was abducted and tortured by unidentified persons over his critical analyses of Sri Lankas security situation during the war in his column which he wrote under a pseudonym.

Sri Lankan arrested in Malaysia for alleged sexual and physical assault

A Sri Lankan national has allegedly assaulted two women sexually and physically in Bandar Baru Uda, Malaysia.
He was later arrested by police on Monday evening.
In the first case, the suspect allegedly assaulted a 51-year-old factory worker, and robbed her of her mobile phone, ATM card, and RM80 cash on March 19 morning.
Johor Baru (North) OCPD Asst Comm Mohd Taib Ahmad said the victim had just got off from a bus and was walking towards her workplace at a food factory in Tampoi here before the suspect attacked her.
The victim, who sustained several injuries, was found lying on the side of the road by the public who alerted the police. She was brought to Hospital Sultanah Aminah in a semiconscious state.
Initial investigation showed that the suspect had punched the victim several times, causing her to suffer bruises on her face, eyes and head, and a split lip.
The victim received two stitches on her forehead, he told The Star.
ACP Mohd Taib said the second victim was a 27-year-old woman who works at an electronics factory in Bandar Baru Uda.
He said the victim was waiting at a bus-stop along Jalan Padi 1 on March 20 morning before being approached by the suspect who tried to force her to sit next to him.
The victim refused to do so and the suspect began strangling her before dragging her to a nearby bush area where he tried to molest her.
She screamed loudly which alerted a male passerby, but the suspect had already fled the scene, he said.
ACP Mohd Taib said that police spotted a man who fit the description made by one of the victims walking along Jalan Padi 1 on March 20.
He said the suspect, in his late 30s, tried to escape but the police successfully arrested him following a scuffle.
The mobile phone that was stolen from the first victim was found on the suspect.
ACP Mohd Taib added the suspect was being remanded to assist in the investigation under Section 394 of the Penal Code and Section 354 of the same Act for robbery and causing hurt as well as for assault on person with the intent of outraging her modesty.

We are especially appreciative that the Council, in recognition of the firm commitment of the National Unity Government to the process of reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, endorsed the proposals made by the Government in 2015, for credible Government of Sri Lanka-led processes embodied in Resolution 30/1.
Mr. President,
We work closely with the High Commissioner and his Office and we are committed to continuing this constructive and meaningful engagement for the benefit of all our people. The views, observations and recommendations of the High Commissioner are useful, as we work to strengthen, promote, and protect human rights, good governance, and the rule of law in Sri Lanka.
This Council knows that no countrys human rights record is perfect. It is always work-in-progress. The people of Sri Lanka have been through extremely difficult and painful times, and although much has been done, there is much still left to do, including strengthening our institutions and achieving economic progress. There are multiple challenges that we face. But, as a responsible and committed Government, under the leadership of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, we are determined to stay the course. We will listen to all, we will study all reports carefully, we will exchange information, share our concerns and comments, engage constructively and meaningfully with our partners, and take the necessary steps required to ensure that Sri Lanka is a nation that is prosperous, united in its diversity, upholding human rights, justice, and the rule of law.
We remain firm in our resolve to enhance the fundamental rights of all citizens as equals in a free and democratic country, where fear and intimidation have no place. We are committed to the reconciliation agenda including truth, reparations, justice and non-recurrence with a victim-centred approach, recognising the impact of conflict on all our citizens, irrespective of their communities of origin, gender, social status, age and other identities.
As we go through the complex process of establishing new mechanisms, we are considering the Report of the Consultation Task Force, and we will continue to consult with all segments of our society. We will also seek international expertise and assistance, as all countries do, when they undertake such responsibilities.
We request the support of all Council Members and Observers to help Sri Lanka succeed in this transformative and challenging agenda that we have undertaken, including economic development, that plays an important role in ensuring the success of the reconciliation agenda.
Thank you.

Vogue Jewellers recognises long standing goldies
Vogue Jewellers held its Employee Recognition Awards 2016 ceremony at Taj Samudra Hotel.
The HR team, with the guidance and support from the Management put together an event of grandeur laced with culture and colour.
This event brought together the large Vogue family spread across Colombo, Kandy, Kurunegala, Nugegoda and Negombo. The prime objective of this distinguished event was to recognize the long-standing service of Vogue employees. We felt so special to be a part of this graceful occasion.
The proceedings began with religious observances followed by singing the National Anthem and honouring the founding Chairman, the late Mr. Sarath Hemachandra and those deceased members of Vogue.
This sequence of rituals is done not only at special events, but also on working days as well and was exemplary of Vogue as a leader in the industry. We felt that such practice certainly helps nurture true Sri Lankan values.
We were warmly welcomed by Madara Hemachandra with a candid speech. Anura Hemachandra, Managing Director of Vogue Jewellers, addressed the gathering. It was both very interesting and enlightening at the same time.
During his speech, Hemachandra shared some vintage photographs of the very first Vogue Employee Recognition held at the same hotel 23 long years ago. He went on to elaborate on the specialization of some the legendary Vogue craftsmen of yesteryears. We must add that it indeed illustrated the manner in which Vogue is committed to value and reward its team members who have contributed to the progress of Vogue over the years.
Hemachandra related the fascinating story of how the Vogue logo, the Vogue Lady was born. It was indeed intriguing to learn that she was born through the pencil of the Late Founder Chairman, Sarath Hemachandra. This followed by Dhammika Kalapuge, one of Sri Lanka's leading customer service and inspirational trainers, who conducts annual training programmes for Team Vogue delivering a truly motivating key note speech.
Subsequent to these, the presentation of the awards began with the segment of 5-year recognition being recognised first. The proceedings then moved on to recognizing a few members who have contributed towards the progress of Vogue in a special way.
This was followed by the 10-year service recognition awards segment and 15-year service recognition award segment respectively. Udara Karunatillake, CEO and Nandana Herath, COO were exclusively recognised for the special leadership skills with which they spear headed operations during their stints spanning over 15 years.
Having awarded those who have served for 20 and 25 years, amidst a standing ovation, two very special awards went out to recognise the loyalty of Kapila Senevirathna and Gnanapala Wijethunga, who had faithfully served Vogue for 25 and 36 years respectively.
Many members of Team Vogue, representing the Design Team, Production Team, Service Team and General staff went down memory lane, sharing interesting anecdotes and unique examples, which conveyed the caring generosity of the management.
The speeches were indeed very motivating for the members of the Vogue family.
The awards were given away by Samantha Hemachandra, Director; Dr. Pujith Hemachandra, Director; Anura Hemachandra Managing Director; and Chandra Hemachandra, Chairperson.
Additionally, the special acknowledgement of the relentless contribution the present Chairperson, Chandra Hemachandra has made over 55 long years from the very inception of Vogue received a standing ovation.

Air India to offer free wi-fi in flights
You can check your e-mails, use social media and even browse the internet when you fly domestically on Air India after July this year.
The Indian carrier is planning to introduce Wi-Fi services in its Airbus A-320 flights which are mostly used for domestic operations, reported The Times of India.
"We are working on having Wi-Fi on our planes. We have issued expression of interest and will take the aircraft manufacturer's nod to install Wi-Fi equipment. Though giving an exact date is difficult, we are aiming to start this by June or July," AI chief Ashwani Lohani said.
Once Air India implements the service, other airlines may follow suit.
However, the company did not mention the speed and amount of data that it is planning on providing.
It is speculated that the services may start with a smaller data package, enough to send and receive mails and communicate through WhatsApp, and later move on to larger packages like other leading International airlines.
Global airlines are known to provide free data packages and allow flyers to pay for additional data once they reach the free limit. (Business Today)

All change as new owners steer F1 into fast lane
Melbourne: Formula One ventures into the unknown zone of a long-awaited revamped and high-speed era under new American ownership this weekend when the engines roar into life at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.
Liberty Medias takeover and the off-season departure of the sports veteran commercial ring-master Bernie Ecclestone have coincided with an overhaul of the technical regulations to usher in a new breed of fatter and faster cars.
The wider new machines with broader tyres make much greater physical demands on the drivers and are expected to provide more noise and spectacle - and hopefully better racing with more passing moves - as Formula One bids to appeal to a younger, global, digital and social media savvy audience.
The retirement of 2016 drivers world champion German Nico Rosberg has also triggered change with Finn Valtteri Bottas switching from Williams to partner three-time champion and pre-season favourite Lewis Hamilton in the champion Mercedes team.
That has been just one of a ripple of moves up and down the pit lane that have added an even greater sense of adventure, and the unknown, to the competition with Ferrari performing well in pre-season testing to suggest they may join Red Bull in mounting a challenge to the dominant German team. AFP

Alustful saga
With great power comes great responsibility. Yet some people in the society abuse power vested in them by the society itself to hamper the smooth sailing process of the social order. Filmmakers are gifted with the power to unfold such stories and more on big screen with a philosophical view, says veteran filmmaker Chandran Rutnam.
According to Mathew, the newest cinematic venture of Chandran Rutnam features world renowned Sri Lankan born singer Alston Koch of Gimme that Banana fame and Sri Lankan born actress Jacquelyn Fernandez who has made it big in Bollywood.
According to Mathew is based on a true incident happened in the late 1970s in the Sri Lankan soil that became the talk of the town.
Sinhala dubbed version of According to Mathew is branded as Anuragini. Both Sinhala and English versions will be released simultaneously on April 7 in the CEL circuit.
Sinhala version will be screened at Regal, Lido, Himali-Kiribathgoda, Amity Lite Maharagama, Odeon Mt Lavinia and 25 other centers, while Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade, Savoy 3D and City Cinema Mt Lavinia are secured for the English versions screening.
Dubbing in Tamil is on the cards.
According to Mathew story revolves around a socially popular and powerful protestant priest in Colombo who was subject to a sex scandal involving a seductive and wealthy married woman.
In a press conference held at the Colombo Golf club to announce the release of the movie Chandran Rutnam revealed many aspects of his latest venture and more.
This story should have been told 25 years ago. Father Mathew was our family friend. He performed exorcism too. There was so much of goodness in him. He once brought a poor child from a village in Sri Lanka all the way to America to get a heart surgery done free-of-charge by the best doctors in the world. When they arrived in Los Angeles, they stayed with me one night before flying to Houston the next day.
Back in Sri Lanka while he was imprisoned I met him near the Welikada prison in prison shorts with a book in his hand, says Rutnam.
He continues, Father Mathew invited me to come and see him in the prison. When I obliged he requested rather demanded me to do a film on his story the way he wanted. When I suggested we feature Gamini Fonseka in the lead role, Father Mathew said he will play it. That project didnt materialize. After decades gone by we revived the project with my screenplay.
Filmmakers can perform magic. This story is already out and is in the internet. I am only giving the visual aspect of it with my viewpoint, he claimed.
When asked whether he has imported foreign technicians for the project Rutnam said, We have technicians, cinematographers and actors whose talents and know-how are on par with world standards. So why import people What we need at this juncture is to have better exposure for our films in the global context. We made According to Mathew to cater to that need. It is a Sri Lankan product going into the worldwide distribution.
He requested resourceful young film directors to do good Sri Lankan stories and project them to the world and commended films like Premaya Nam and Aloko Udapadi as films having original stories.
Professionalism
Rutnam said Jacquelyn Fernandez is a very professional and a great actress and he groomed Alston Koch to fit into the character of Father Mathew.
Koch did a tremendously wonderful performance. This is Jacquelyns first English film. This film will be a stepping stone for her into Hollywood, predicts Rutnam.
Chandran Rutnam did A Common Man with Sir Ben Kingsley prior to making According to Mathew.
He said pinnacle of his film career however is yet to happen. I have a personal liking towards The Road from Elephant Pass that I made some years back. Right now my main focus is on According to Mathew, he commented.
We are in the business called Show-business. Hence we cannot neglect the business aspect of our works. Awards are nicebut those are not the significant thing. To keep this business going we have to give due attention to the economic factor, and must be adhered to.
Commercial is not a dirty word. Even in a commercial film there is art. If we try to separate art from commercial, it is nonsense. My films are commercial-art ones. We have to get out of this shell where we make art house films for awards.
I like to make films that you understand and films that keep you entertained. My job is to entertain you for money, he added.
International exposure
Rutnam commissioned Film Location Services Company in 1980 to bring famed producers and directors in Hollywood into Sri Lanka to make films.
He collaborated with world renowned filmmaker and his close friend Steven Spielberg once as the line-producer of the sequel to the Indiana Jones movie; Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom shot in Sri Lanka. Performance of late D R Nanayakkara as a tribal chieftain in the movie was commended by Spielberg.
Most seen Sri Lankan actor worldwide is D R Nanayakkara and that was due to his performances in this box office movie, Rutnam says.
Chandran Rutnam also did the box office movie Adara Kathawak casting Menik Kurukulasuriya some decades back.

Amaraweera assures LG polls will be held this year
Local Government elections, as well as elections to three provincial councils, will definitely be held this year since the government has no fear to face the hustings, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister gave this assurance addressing a conference of provincial fisheries ministers at the ministry auditorium on March 20. The minister, who dismissed allegations that the government was willfully postponing elections for fear of facing the public, said the delay in holding elections was due to certain shortcomings in the delimitation process. However, the government was prepared to hold all Local Government elections and Provincial Council elections within this year.
Questioned by the media about the so-called Ava Group terrorizing people in several areas, he said the government would never leave room for any such group or terrorism to raise its head again.
Fisheries ministers attached to the Western, Wayamba, Southern, Central and Eastern Provincial Councils, and officials attended the conference.

Arthur gutted over spot-fixing scandal, blames greed
KARACHI: Pakistans head coach Mickey Arthur Tuesday said he felt gutted over a fresh alleged spot-fixing scandal that has engulfed his team, adding any players found guilty only had themselves to blame.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has provisionally suspended Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif, Mohammad Irfan, Shahzaib Hasan and Nasir Jamshed on charges linked to spot-fixing and meetings with bookmakers in the recently concluded Pakistan Super League.
Arthur, who took over as coach in May last year, said players need to take responsibility for their actions.
He added: Players become greedy and thats hurting international cricket in general and the recent case has hurt Pakistan. He singled out the loss ofopener Sharjeel Khan, who scored three consecutive half centuries in the one-day series in Australia in January, as a major blow.
He (Sharjeel) was in the team for all the formats. He had got his name on the map and he got himself fit and he was about to become an explosive player for us and its sad. But he added players could not plead ignorance about a failure to report approaches by would-be fixers because they had been warned repeatedly.
All the boards including the PCB educate the players of the pitfalls, he said. They have gotten reams and reams of lectures from the ICC (International Cricket Council) anti-corruption unit and they are doing a great job in education.
There should be no complacency on the part of the players because losing players to the greed of fixing is hugely disappointing, he added.
Despite the losses of Sharjeel and Irfan, another regular in the limited overs sides, Arthur was upbeat about the teams chances on the upcoming West Indies tour.
I am excited to have a new captain in Sarfraz Ahmed, he said, hailing the wicket-keeper batsman who has replaced Azhar Ali, adding new players would bring more energy.
Pakistan and the West Indies -- currently eighth and ninth in the one-day rankings -- are vying for a direct place in the 2019 World Cup in England.
The worlds top eight teams at the time of the cut off date of September 2017 will qualify for while the rest will feature in a qualifying event in 2018.

Bangladesh hopes Sri Lanka win will bring more Tests
DHAKA, Tuesday  Bangladeshs historic Test victory in Sri Lanka should encourage more teams to find space in their schedules to play the fast-improving minnows, according to the head of the countrys cricket board.
In their 100th Test, Bangladesh beat Rangana Heraths men by four wickets in Colombo on Sunday -- their first victory away from home against top-class opponents.
Bangladeshs only other victories on foreign soil since gaining Test status in 2000 came against fellow strugglers Zimbabwe, and a West Indies side which had been weakened by a strike among their main players.
Sundays win has stoked hopes that Bangladesh are now finally becoming a force to be reckoned with after they beat England for the first time in a five-day match in October.
Their lack of success has been one of the reasons major cricketing nations have been reluctant to schedule matches against Bangladesh, with last months one-off Test in Hyderabad their first ever match in India.
Their only tour of Australia was also way back in 2003, but Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan told reporters that the victory in Colombo could mark a sea-change in attitudes and that more matches with Test teams were already being pencilled in.
There is no doubt that every team will show their keen interest to play with us, way more than it has been in the past, Hassan said late Monday.
They will field their full strength team against us. All the teams will see Bangladesh in a different way.
We have done our groundwork for the next one year, what and how we need to do things. Actually, we will play 10 Test matches within this period.
Weve never got to play so many Tests in the past in one calendar year because the big teams did not take Bangladesh seriously, he said. Bangladesh normally play around six Tests a year.
The BCB president said the victory over Sri Lanka was part of a larger upturn in performances which dated back to Bangladeshs qualification for the quarter-finals of the one-day World Cup in 2015.
Since that tournament, Bangladesh have won bilateral one-day series against Pakistan, India and South Africa, reached the final of Asia Cup Twenty20 tournament and defeated England and Sri Lanka in Tests.
The eagerness and faith for winning developed among the boys, said Hassan.
Sometimes it gets deviated, but it can happen, given we are a young team.  AFP
