North Korea bans foreign tourists as coronavirus spreads
North Korea has shut its borders to foreign tourists in a bid to keep out the mysterious, pneumonia-like coronavirus spreading in China next door.A leading tour operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said its travel partners in North Korea had informed it that they were unable to accept tourists temporarily because of the virus. On its website, it called the move a precaution against the virus that has killed nine people and sickened more than 400 in China. No suspected infections have been reported in North Korea.The move came as the United States on Tuesday confirmed the first case of the coronavirus within its borders, after a traveler returning from Wuhan, the center of the outbreak in China, landed in Washington State.Tourism is one of the few North Korean industries not under international sanctions imposed by the United Nations and Washington, making the sector vital to Pyongyangs embattled economy. Most tourists enter the politically restricted and reclusive country through the border with China and are Chinese nationals.North Korea closed its border to tourists for four months during the height of the Ebola epidemic in Africa in 2014-2015 and also imposed a 21-day quarantine on diplomats and aid workers entering the country.I would assume that North Korea will treat this matter much like Ebola back in 2014-2015 so this will affect all foreigners going to North Korea, Rowan Beard of YPT said in an email, adding that no quarantine has been announced by North Korean customs authorities.When the DPRK prevented foreigners from entering North Korea from the Ebola scare this did take an impact on our business and with most of our competitors closing their business in the DPRK, he added, referring to the countrys official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Were hoping this time it wont last as long as Ebola.Two Chinese travelers infected with coronavirus have been reported in Thailand, officials there said. A man who had traveled from China this month is sick with the disease in Japan, and a Chinese women entering South Korea on Sunday has been isolated after being found to be infected. Australia and the Philippines are investigating suspected cases in their territory.Though experts were puzzled by the border closure in 2014 during an Ebola outbreak halfway across the world, this weeks move was understandable, given the outbreak of a virus in North Koreas neighbor and largest trading partner.The DPRK governments costly decision to suspend all foreign tourists is a reasonable strategy to minimize the risk of domestic spread of the new virus, said Kee Park, a global surgery scholar at Harvard Medical School who has worked extensively in North Korea.(Source: washingtonpost)

Trump impeachment: Senators clash over rules as trial opens
The US Senate has rejected repeated Democratic attempts to secure new evidence in President Donald Trump's impeachment as his trial began.Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell meanwhile backed off on a plan to fast-track the hearings after coming under pressure from fellow Republicans.Democrats said this would have been no less than a cover-up.Trump is charged with abuse of power and obstructing the congressional inquiry. He denies wrongdoing.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Mr Trump dismissed the accusations against him as "just a hoax".Senators have taken oaths to act as impartial jurors, hearing arguments for six hours a day, six days a week in a trial presided over by the US Chief Justice, John Roberts.It is only the third time in US history that a president is facing an impeachment trial and it is unclear how long it will last.Trump was impeached last month by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.But the Senate, which is controlled by his fellow Republicans, is not expected to convict the president and remove him from office.(Source: BBC News )
