A boat carrying Rohingya refugees capsized in the Bay of Bengal, killing at least 12

An overcrowded boat carrying Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar capsized in the confluence of a river and the Bay of Bengal and at least 12 people died, police said Monday. Five of the dead were children.
Up to 35 people were on the boat and eight survived the capsizing, local police official Mainuddin Khan said. He said rescuers have retrieved 12 dead bodies but it was not exactly clear how many were missing. The search was continuing, but the sea remained rough.
The capsizing occurred near the Shah Porir Dwip in Bangladesh's southern coastal district of Cox's Bazar as the boat was moving toward Bangladesh late Sunday.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25 when the military launched a crackdown that had been decried by the United Nations as"ethnic cleansing."Including Sunday's capsizing, boat accidents have killed at least 155 Rohingya trying to reach Bangladesh.
Myanmar's military launched what it described as "clearance operations" after an insurgent group attacked security posts and killed several police and border guards. The U.N. said Myanmar's response was "disproportionate" compared to the insurgents' action. The refugees arriving in Bangladesh have described indiscriminate violence and widespread arson in their home villages in Myanmar's Rakhine state along the Bangladesh border.
Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says her government will continue to support the Rohingya but Myanmar must take them back.

Harvey Weinstein sacked after sexual harassment claims

Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees, has been fired by the board of his company.
One of the biggest producers in Hollywood, Weinstein was behind films including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction.
The Weinstein Company directors said that "in light of new information about misconduct" his employment had been terminated "effective immediately".
Weinstein had been informed.
His sudden departure comes after the New York Times published a report last week about sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades.
The 65-year-old apologised and said he planned to take a leave of absence.
"The way I've behaved with colleagues in the past hascaused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it," Weinstein said.
However, he later disputed the report, which said he had reached at least eight settlements with women, and vowed to take legal action.
Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms.
The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.
The accusers said the film producer forced them to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said.
President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was "not at all surprised" by the revelations about Weinstein, a major backer of Democratic candidates.
Many Democratic lawmakers have since vowed to give their contributions from Weinstein to charity. Trump faced his own sex scandal last year when video emerged of him using lewd language to describe groping women.
Weinstein, who is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman, formed the Miramax production house in the late 1970s with his brother and then sold it to Disney.
The pair went on to create The Weinstein Company and produce such hits as Django Unchained, Lion and The Butler.
The Weinstein Company statement was issued on Sunday by the firm's all-male board, Bob Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar.
His departure leaves control of the company in the hands of his brother, Bob Weinstein, and chief operating officer David Glasser.
Actress Rose McGowan called on the Weinstein board to resign immediately over the allegations.
"Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP," she told The Hollywood Reporter. "Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not."
Last week Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said that he denied many of the allegations made against him as "patently false".
"He has acknowledged mistakes he has made," said Bloom. "He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways."
But on Saturday, Bloomsaid in a tweetthat she was no longer advising Weinstein.
"I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein," the tweet said. "My understanding is that Weinstein and his board are moving to an agreement."

India Supreme Court bans fireworks in Delhi ahead of Diwali

India's Supreme Court has banned fireworks in the capital Delhi, in the run-up to the Hindu festival of Diwali.
The court said it wanted to test if banning fireworks would make a difference to Delhi's air quality, ranked among the worst in the world.
The ban on the sale and distribution of firecrackers will last until 1 November. Diwali falls on 18 October.
Diwali, the most important Hindu festival in north India, celebrates the victory of good over evil.
The Supreme Court order came in response to several petitions, asking for a restoration of the ban it had first ordered in November 2016, before temporarily lifting it in September.
It had said at the time that a complete ban would be an "extreme step".
India's Central Pollution Control Board told the court it also wanted the ban to be restored.
However those who have already bought fireworks will be able to set them off.
Last year's ban on the "possession, stocking and selling" of fireworks was ordered only after Diwali, when the city's air quality had already reached hazardous levels.
Choking smog had even forced the Delhi government toshut all schoolsfor three days.
There have been several campaigns in the past asking people to use fewer fireworks during the festival, but these have not been very successful.

Kim Jong Un promotes sister at key North Korea ruling party summit

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo Jong was promoted Saturday at a key meeting of the country's ruling party, state media reported.
Kim Yo Jong's profile has been rising since 2014, when she was made deputy director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers' Party. She and Kim Jong Un were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui.
Like most members of the Kim clan, little is definitively known about Kim Yo Jong beyond her official rank.According to NK Leadership Watch, she is a close aide of her brother's "and since his accession manages his public events, itineraries and logistical needs, among other tasks."

Kim Yo Jong was selected as an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party at the Second Plenum of the party's 7th Central Committee.

Also in the reshuffle, according to state news agency KCNA, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho was selected as a member of the Politburo and Choe Ryong Hae, vice chairman of the Worker's Party and a close aide to Kim Jong Un, was appointed to the party's Central Military Commission.

The Politburo is the North Korean regime's top decision-making body, led by Kim Jong Un.

According to NK Leadership Watch, a project of The US-Korea Institute, members and alternate members of the politburo can take part in debates and meetings, but only full members can vote.

A recent major decision by the Politburo was the expulsion in December 2013 of Kim's uncle and high-ranking party member Jang Song Thaek,who was later executed for treason.

Born in 1987, Kim Yo Jong studied in Switzerland like her brother and is believed to have attended Kim Il Sung University and a western European school for her higher education.

"Since her brother's accession to the supreme leadership of (North Korea), Kim Yo Jong has been routinely observed attending Kim Jong Un's public appearances," NK Leadership Watch said.

Her position is such that, according to a Seoul-based think tank run by North Korean defectors, Kim Yo Jongbriefly took charge of the countrywhile her brother was reportedly ill with gout or diabetes in late 2014.

The key meeting of the Worker's Party comes amid an ongoing standoff between North Korea and the United States.

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump was critical of past attempts to reign in North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.

"Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid ... hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of US negotiators,"Trump wrote on Twitter. "Sorry, but only one thing will work!"

In a speech Saturday, Kim Jong Un said the country's nuclear weapons "are a precious fruition borne by its people's bloody struggle for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country from the protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists."

North Korea has long defended its nuclear program as essential to defend the country against US aggression, pointing to the experience of countries like Iraq and Libya.

Nuclear weapons, Kim said, are a "powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia and reliably guaranteeing the Korean nation's sovereignty."

October 10 marks the founding anniversary of the Worker's Party. North Korea has in the past marked key dates with missile or nuclear tests.

Last week, Russian lawmaker Anton Morozov, recently returned from Pyongyang,told state mediapreparations were underway for "new tests of a long-range missile."

Despite the pro-nuclear rhetoric, Kim's speech was also heavily focused on the economy, which has proven surprisingly resilientdespite being heavily targeted by US and international sanctions.
According to KCNA, Kim "noted with appreciation that the country's science and technology have developed by leaps and bounds and the national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions of the US imperialists and their vassal forces."

Advocates of dialog with North Korea havepointedto increased economic ties as a potential avenue toward deescalation of tensions and improved relations both between North and South Korea and Pyongyang and Washington.

It was reported to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development that a variety of a Star fish which causes harmful effects to the corals are on the shores of the Eastern Sea.
This variety of Star fish is reported to have emanated a harmful substance in the form of a chemical enzyme which has been causing serious damage to the corals, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera disclosed this at the consultative committee meeting held at the Ministry recently and has issued directives to NARA and NAQDA to conduct a scientific research in this respect and also instructed to get necessary assistance of Sri Lanka Navy.
Prevalence of such Star fish had taken place a few years back in a similar manner and measures were taken to deter their prevalence on that occasion too.

Sri Lanka fold for 96; Pakistan need 317 to level series

Sri Lanka's second-innings collapse continued into day four, as Pakistan dramatically raised their chances of squaring the series.
The visitors now have 317 runs to defend, and will no doubt be haunted by the memory of that epic Pakistan chase in Pallekele two years ago, where 377 runs were almost casually hunted down.
They will also know that Pakistan have the momentum. Though they had bossed the game in the first innings, being skittled for 96 by a Pakistan attack missing Mohammad Amir, and effectively had a three-man frontline attack could give them a few headaches.
Having been the primary architect of Sri Lanka's slide late on day three, it wasWahab Riazwho broke through first on Monday.
Niroshan Dickwella begun his innings with two fours off the first three balls he faced, and as ever, seemed eager to score. He survived a close bat-pad shout off Yasir Shah.
Though he seemed comfortable against Wahab, hitting two offside boundaries in the 19th over, he would fall attempting a third.
Playing a drive to a ball angled across him from around the wicket, he managed only to get an edge to the delivery.
Sarfraz Ahmed took an outstanding one-handed catch, diving to his left. Dilruwan Perera was out soon after, pinned in front of the stumps by a Yasir flipper.
Rangana Herath had brief success with his rapid sweeps and reverse sweeps, and he seemed to be settling into a remedial partnership with Kusal Mendis, but all this was upset by Haris Sohail's arrival to the bowling crease.
Aiming another sweep off Haris' first ball, Herath managed only to top edge it to short fine leg.
Three balls later, Mendis himself was out, also top-edging a sweep. This one went high in the air and was caught by the keeper.
Nuwan Pradeep lasted only two balls, and Sri Lanka only 11.3 in the day.

Taiwan to send team to Sri Lanka in probe of bank hacking case

Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said today that it was preparing to send investigators to Sri Lanka to seek further details on the reported arrest there of two suspects accused of helping hackers stealing millions of US dollars from a Taiwanese bank.
However, due to the fact that Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Sri Lanka or any government representatives stationed there, the CIB told CNA, it would take some time to get everything in order for the investigators to go there.
According to local and regional news reports, Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
Two suspects were arrested last week in Sri Lanka when they tried to withdraw the money, and Police said that they are still looking for a third person, according to the news reports.
 "We are looking at some US$1.3 million that had come into three accounts in Sri Lanka," an unnamed Sri Lankan official involved with the investigation was quoted as saying. "We have taken two people into custody, and we are looking for one more person."
 On Saturday, Far Eastern Bank said it had recovered most of the stolen money and that its losses would amount to no more than US$500,000.
 The bank said it noticed some irregularities in its computerized transaction system on Tuesday and then discovered that some of its computers and servers had been infected with malware.
 The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's (SWIFT) network was also compromised, which allowed the hackers to wire money to international destinations such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the United States, Far Eastern Bank said.
 The bank said that on Thursday it reported the matter to Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the CIB, which in turn informed the International Criminal Police Organization and asked for assistance.
 The FSC said that it was an isolated case in Taiwan and advised that Far Eastern Bank, not its customers, should absorb the losses, the bank said.
 Over the weekend, after Premier Lai Ching-te was informed about the case, he asked the relevant agencies to review Taiwan's information security and to close any loopholes, according to Cabinet spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung.

Turkey and US suspend most visa services
Turkey and the US have become embroiled in a consular row, mutually suspending most visa services.
The Turkish embassy in Washington said it needed to "reassess" the US government's commitment to the security of the mission and personnel.
A very similar statement was earlier made by the US embassy in Ankara.
This comes after a US consulate worker in Istanbul was held last week on suspicion of links to a cleric blamed for last year's failed coup in Turkey.
Washington condemned the move as baseless and damaging to bilateral relations.
The arrested consulate employee was a male Turkish citizen, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.
In its statement on Sunday, the Turkish embassy in Washington said: "Recent events have forced the Turkish government to reassess the commitment of the government of the US to the security of the Turkish mission facilities and personnel.
"In order to minimise the number of the visitors to our diplomatic and consular missions in the US while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all visa services regarding the US citizens at our diplomatic and consular missions in the US.
"This measure will apply to sticker visas as well as e-visas and border visas."
The Turkish statement is virtually the same as the earlier American one, with only country names being replaced.
The American mission said that "all non-immigrant visa services at all US diplomatic facilities in Turkey" had been suspended.
Non-immigrant visas are issued to those travelling to the US for tourism, medical treatment, business, temporary work or study.
Those seeking citizenship or permanent residency apply for US immigrant visas.
Ankara has for months been pressing Washington to extradite US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen over his alleged role in the coup attempt in July 2016.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating the unrest - a charge the cleric denies.
In the aftermath of the coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended.

United States and Turkey mutually suspend visa services

Both the United States and Turkey have suspended all non-immigrant visa services for travel between the two countries, after last week's arrest of a US consulate employee in Istanbul.
With some exceptions, the move effectively blocks Turks from travel to the United States, and vice versa, indefinitely.

"Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of government of Turkey to the security of US mission and personnel," the statement by the US mission in Ankara said.

Just 24 hours after the announcement by the United States, Turkey retaliated through its embassy in Washington, issuing a statement that effectively mirrors the one released by the United States -- only the countries' names were reversed.

"Recent events have forced Turkish Government to reassess the commitment of the Government of the United States to the security of Turkish Mission facilities and personnel."

The Turkish embassy said the measure, effective immediately, would "apply to visas in passports as well as e-Visas and visas acquired at the border."

The US move, meanwhile, means that Turks will not be issued visas to visit the United States unless they plan to move there.

When attempted to access the e-visa process through the Turkish government's visa application website, a message denying eligibility appeared.

"Unfortunately, nationals of the country that you selected are not eligible for e-Visa. Kindly visit the nearest Turkish mission to apply for a visa application."

The message added a link for a list of Turkish embassies and consulates.

More than 37,000 US nationals traveled to Turkey in 2016, down from 88,301 in 2015, according toTurkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

The majority of US nationals visiting Turkey buy their visas at the border, usually at international airports such as Istanbul's Ataturk Airport.

Turkey is not part of the US visa waiver program; Turkish nationals are required to apply for a non-immigrant visa through US missions.

Non-immigrant visas include those for business, tourism and study, as well as more specialist visas, including journalist and diplomatic visas.

The US Department of State had no updated information regarding Turkish visa applications, and appeared to still be offering interviews for visa applicants.

The US' National and Tourist Office doesn't provide a breakdown of the total number of Turkish visitors to the US on its website.

Direct flights to the US from Turkish cities remained purchasable from Turkish airlines; there are no US carriers that fly direct to Turkey.

The US said it was "deeply disturbed" by the consulate employee's arrest,named in Turkish state mediaas locally hired Metin Topuz, after he was charged over alleged links to Pennsylvania-based opposition clericFethullah Gulen.

He was remanded in custody over "terror charges" by an Istanbul court last week, state media Anadolu said. Topuz is the second US government employee in Turkey to be arrested this year.

Turkey, a NATO member, has pushed for the United States to extradite Gulen, who it blames for last summer's failed coup, although Gulen himself denies any involvement.

Turkey's ambassador to Washington, Serdar Kili,told reporters in Julythat he sensed a "willingness" on the part of US officials to move forward on an extradition request against the US-based cleric, one year after the failed coup attempt the Turkish government has accused Gulen of orchestrating.

However Kili also expressed frustration with the slow pace of those proceedings, and suggested the US administration could take further steps outside the extradition process to censure Gulen.

Ankara has previously jailed US citizens it accuses of having Gulenist sympathies. American pastor Andrew Brunson was detained a year ago, following the coup, on charges of trying to
overthrow the Turkish government and its constitution. Brunson denies the charges.

US President Donald Trumpraised the issueof Brunson's imprisonment in Turkey three times during a meeting with the Turkish president in May when the two leaders met for the first time, according to the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ).

The two countries' diplomatic ties have been fraught lately, hitting a low point in May with an incident involving Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan'ssecurity detail assaulting protestors outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington, DC.

The bloody brawl sent nine protestors to the hospital.

The Turkish liraslumped as much as 6.6%against the US dollar on Monday after Sunday's tit-for-tat visa spat intensified, before stabilizing to trade down about 2.8% versus the dollar.

Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah calls for common global maritime domain

Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah called for the establishment of a common global maritime domain to share real time maritime information between the navies of the world.
An information sharing web aiding in detecting and disseminating information from the sea in real time, suggested the Navy Commander would be an effective tool in governing the ocean and maritime boundaries of states.
Real time information, said Sinniah was an important deterrent for terrorist activity and a vital tool in defeating crime in the ocean.
He also advocated for a mechanism for fusing, collecting and analysing information from technical and other sources. This was in addition to the need to combine legacy systems with current and emerging capabilities. 
The Commander delivering the opening remarks at the 8th Galle Dialogue held at Galle Face Hotel yesterday reiterated the call for sharing of maritime information; a contentious and persistent issue in the maritime domain.
This years conference with representations from 51 countries and 12 organizations dealt with the theme of Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security.
Despite greater surveillance and gathering of intelligence, the oceans are still exploited for a plethora of illegal activities by state and non-state actors, said Sinnaih as he explained that this was a result of many gaps and ungoverned spaces remaining unchecked in the global commons.
Sri Lankas Navy which has a tough task of protecting an island state with a territorial sea of 21,500 km2 and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastal line an extent of 517,000 km2, faces many blind spots at sea. The Navy commander thus called for a change in mindset among nations to be more cooperative and collaborative with their information and hoped that negotiations held at a tactical level at the conference would lead to policy level changes.
In todays economy, oceans have a great significance and a peaceful, tranquil and secure Indian ocean is necessary to Sri Lankas prosperity, said Vice Admiral Sinniah
