D. B. Jayatilaka, true friend of India
The history of Sri Lanka is not complete without the special mention of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka. The history of India-Sri Lanka bilateral relations is also not complete without acknowledging the priceless contribution of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka, said Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu.
He was addressing the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Sir Don Baron Jayatilake, recently.
Ceylon turned to India when the food shortage hit the country during the heights of World War II. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was sent as an emissary, and India honoured his request and sent food shipments to the island. He was later appointed as Representative of Government of Ceylon to India. Unfortunately, he fell ill when he was in Delhi. The Viceroy had arranged a special plane for him to return to Ceylon. Unfortunately, he passed away when the plane was over Bangalore. He was later cremated in Borella.
He remained a true son of Ceylon. He would remain forever, a true friend of India. Had destiny allowed him a longer life, who knows, what turn his career would have perhaps taken, he said further.
It might be a strange coincidence but it is true that in 1923, when Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was elected President of Ceylon National Congress, another great educationist, who would later become independent Indias first Education Minister, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, was elected President of Indian National Congress.
Prime Minister Modi in his Vesak Day speech noted that the friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the Great Master. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was a worthy son of the Great Master, and his contributions to strengthening the bonds between our great nations will be remembered forever. As the Buddha has said, even death is not to be feared by those who have lived wisely. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka lived wisely. Let us be his worthy disciples and live wisely, today and every day, the High Commissioner said.

Support President to continue good governance
The Ministers' Former Secretaries' Union yesterday urged all left wing political parties to extend their support to the President to continue his good governance agenda for the betterment of the country.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Library Services Board, Ministers' Former Secretaries' Union General Secretary Ajith Jayasundara charged that most of the politicians having close relationships with the President acted immaturely during the election period and tried to fish in muddy waters.
He said the behaviour of some politicians badly affected the local government election results of the SLFP, they charged.
During former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's era, politicians belonging to Local Government bodies misused their power and engaged in corrupt activities. As a result, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa lost power two years before the end of his term.
Therefore, newly appointed Local Government members should be properly monitored, he added. As a pro-SLFP union, we are satisfied with the votes received by the SLFP. Both the SLFP and SLPP received the votes of leftists. Thus, the increase of the number of leftists votes is a good sign, he added.

'Agro chemical usage destructs fertility of soil'
The fertility of the soil in the Hambantota District has been destroyed with agro chemical usage, former Agriculture Assistant Director Hemantha Amarasinha said.

Anuradhapura paddy harvesting in full swing
The 2017/18 Maha season paddy harvesting is in progress in Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullativu and Jaffna districts in the Anuradhapura district as private paddy traders are busily engaged in purchasing paddy since no Paddy Market Board purchasing centres are open.
Anuradhapura PMB District Manager Nimal Tennakoon said they were equipped with storing capacity for 68,000 mT paddy. Purchasing was at its lowest during the last three cultivation seasons.
"During the Maha seasonal harvesting period, we aim to buy around 15,000 mT paddy and we will discourage private sector dealers who attempt to buy paddy at a lower price than the guaranteed price Rs. 41.00 for Samba and Rs. 38.00 for Nadu varieties," he said.
Kilinochchi PMB District manager Shantha Kumara SAID Kilinochchi, Mullativu and Vavuniya farmers have commenced harvesting and majority of them are drying paddy stocks hoping to sell them to the PMB at the guaranteed price. Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mullathivu and Jaffna farmers have cultivate 75,000 hectares aiming at a yielding of 186,300 mT during the 2017/18 Maha season.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said that only 71,000 ha cultivated with paddy instead of 130,200 hectares as planned were receiving Monsoon rain during the 2017/2018 Maha cultivation.
According to the fertiliser secretariat information, 87,920 farmers were paid fertiliser subsidy amounted to Rs. 964.8 million on the basis of Rs. 25,000 per two hectares the maximum.
Wanninayake said that although the farmers who have faced three consecutive cultivation seasons have sown paddy taking a risk amidst the poor monsoon rainfall under minor and medium irrigation systems in 42,670 ha, there was a threat of crop damages if some rain have not received within the next few weeks.
According to the Government Agent, 60,993 farmers took to paddy cultivation in Anuradhapura and cultivated 50,666 ha in the 2016/2017 Maha season.
The fertilizer subsidy paid was Rs. 633.11 million. In 2017 Yala season, 35,344 farmers have cultivated 24,631 ha with paddy and the fertiliser subsidy paid was Rs. 312 million.

CH has the edge over CR today
A superb game of rugby is on the cards when CR and FC play CH and FC in their Dialog A Division inter-club knock-out quarter final rugby encounter at Race Course grounds in Reid Avenue, Colombo today, kick off will be at 4.15pm.
CR and FC in their last game lost to formidable CH and FC who came from behind 14-17 down at half time to beat them by 25 points to 24 at Longden Place in their final league game last week.
These two experienced rugby clubs in the past have produced unrelenting brand of running rugby whenever they met, same is expected today. It will be interesting to see how both sides play in todays game. Both teams are famous for playing good quality rugby and should give the large crowd something to cheer about. Red shirts will hope to play their best available side as they are hampered and will play without some of the key players who were side lined due to injuries and thus far not recovered, hence will not play in todays match.
This season CRs plus point is their mobile pack, which is about the best equipped with some top class players of the calibre of Omalka Gunaratne, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Udara Gayan, Hafiz Adahan, Shemal Weerasekara, Charana Chamikara and Kokila Hiran, should deliver the goods together with the rest to grab ball position in the set pieces.
In today's game CH and FC will rely more on their speedy three quarters. Their new halves combination of young Avishka Lee and Samuel Maduwantha, who paired off well in the entire second round league games, should give their best.
Maduwantha is an intelligent player, and has class written in his play, as he often draws the opposition defense and finds the gaps with his clever foot movements for the fast moving three quarter line to do the scoring.
Mean while the CH outfit who shocked CR last week in their own den will be fielding the same victorious team which did duty for them and will be at full strength. One can easily expect a thrilling game from their playing fifteen.
CH and FC Western Samoan head coach, Tavita Thulagaese Laga a former Sri Lanka national coach who is a master tactician will be out to guide his side to another win in this match. Laga is confident that his team is determined to deliver the goods today.
But, one should keep in mind the CR side who has a superb three quarter line as well and if they play to their usual brand of rugby they can pierce any team defences as their ball handling is the best seen in some of the games which they won this season against top opponents especially against Navy SC in the first round game.
CR & FC (Probable XV) Udara Gayan or Hafiz Adahan, Supun Warnakulasuriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Charana Chamikara, Gayan Jayamanna, Shemal Weerasekara or Sashika Ashan, Tariq Saleih or Shawqat Laheer, Omalka Gunaratne, Avishka Heenpalke or Harith Bandara and Tharinda Ratwatte, Chamod Fernando, Rehan Silva, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Reeza Rafaideen, Nalin Kumara, Head Coach: Fereti Verabula (Fiji)
CH and FC (Probable XV) Sathya Ranathunga, Nisal Desatha or Pulathisi Bandara, Chathura Dilshan, Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa (Captain), Sajith Saranga, Sasanka Ariyaratne,Yoshitha Rajapaksha, Sudarshana Muthuthanttri, Avishka Lee and Samuel Maduwantha, Heshan Maduranga , Lee Keegal, Warren Weerakoon or Chula susantha, Anuradha Herath, Avantha Lee or Dinushan Ariyapala, Head coach: Tavita Tulagese Laga (Western Samoa)

Diabetes ails Sri Lankan society
Around 15 percent of the Sri Lankan society suffer from diabetes and it was only 10 percent in 2006. The prevalence of diabetes among adults in urban areas is around 20 or 25 percent, Senior Lecturer in Medicine attached to the University of Colombo and Consultant Endocrinologist and Diabetologist Dr. Prasad Katulanda said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday, he said the country should be educated on preventing and controlling diabetes to overcome the high burden of disease. It is not adequate to educate the people once in a while, he said.
Prominent Endocrinologist and Diabetologist. Dr. Noel Somasundaram said diabetes is the biggest health issue in the country in this era and it has become an epidemic due to the way of bringing up children. Parents bring up children just like broiler chicken. The children develop diabetes at age eight, nine or ten.
They have to take drugs to control cholesterol at a very young age. They never play and physically active.
Consultant Endocrinologist and President of the Sri Lanka Collage of Endocrinologists Dr. Manilka Sumanatilleke said the current prevalence of diabetes in Colombo is around 20 to 25 percent and it is around 10 percent in rural areas. All efforts should be made to prevent increasing diabetes in rural areas.
The awareness raising activities should be based on food, exercises and screening.

## Supertitle: Anura Bandaranaikes 69th birth anniversary:
## Section: Features

Anura Bandaranaikes 69th birth anniversary:
A distinguished politician
Anura Bandaranaike was a leader who lent colour to the political scene in Sri Lanka. He was one of those possessed of excellent personal qualities, superior intelligence and a very clear vision. He was an unrivalled orator in Parliament. His level of eloquence in both the Sinhala and English languages was extremely high.
He marshalled his vast vocabulary meaningfully, logically and appropriately, often suing an apt quotation from Shakespeare or other reputed author, to make his point. He as an embodiment of a sharp intellect, ability, honesty, organisational skill and cordiality towards his associates. He acquired an honours degree in history in 1973 from a British university. He had a deep knowledge of western and eastern history, literature, political philosophy, economics, and international relations.
He also had an unquenchable thirst for new knowledge. His personal library lacked nothing in modern local and foreign books. Whenever he could spare the time in Parliament, he had the habit of perusing the valuable books and other documents found in its library. He had the unique ability to make use of the knowledge thus acquired, logically and critically, when required.
A clean leader
The great majority of those in politics in the present day do not have that ability. In fact even a child who observes the present day goings-on in Parliament would realize that the majority in Parliament today are persons with vacant minds. In contrast, the likes of Anura Bandaranaike brought lustre to Parliament.
Anura Bandaranaike had clean hands, unsoiled by corruption, terrorism and man slaughter. He was in the fullest sense of the term, a clean leader. Even his opponents acknowledged that without any hesitation. He received the people's affection and acceptance, in full measure, in the city and the village, from childhood. He had a physical presence which made any one who looked at him once, to look again. He had the good fortune to enjoy the close association of the most powerful world leaders, from his childhood.
Most leaders now have forgotten the priceless service he rendered to the SLFP even from his school days, I.e. from 1965. From that time participated directly in every election campaign and contributed his might to the advancement of the party. Old time party members even now recall with gratitude the way be traversed over hill and dale, meeting the rural folk, all the time advancing the party cause. At the same time the identified talented young people in distant villages, brought them in to the party fold and helped them along to the highest levels of the party hierarchy. Today they shine at the highest levels.
Most people have now forgotten this. In the 1970 General Elections he directed the entire campaign in the Attanagalla electorate single handed, whilst pursuing his university education. He had to do so as both his sisters were abroad. Bandaranaike who as only 21 years of age at the time, secured Attangalla for the SLFP with a majority of 21,000 votes. I would like it to be recalled that Madam Bandaranaike had not up to then secured such a large majority at Attangalla. In addition, Bandaranaike's addressing of campaign meetings all round the country at that election, contributed immensely to the United Front victory at that election. While pursuing university education in Britain during the period 1970-74, he came back to the country at every by-election and conducted the party campaigns.
The fact that Anura Bandaranaike was able to generate a youth wave in favour of the party as a youth leader, since his return to the country in 1974, even in the context of a situation where the party's popularity was in the wane, is testimony to his ability.
At every meeting and every seminar he attended there were huge crowds. The 1976 Ja-ela by-election took place in a back ground where the United Front government had suffered a server setback. Therefore all the powerful ministers evaded taking charge of the campaign. Even so, Anura Bandaranaike directed the campaign single handed. He secured for the SLFP a number of votes that the party had never before polled in that electorate. Thereby he displayed in ample measure his organising ability and his popularity.
In 1977 Anura entered Parliament not through his parental political stronghold of Attanagalla or the Gampaha District, that he was used to, but through the Nuwaraeliya-Maskeliya electorate which has a majority of plantation labour votes. He could spare only six days to campaign in this electorate. During the rest of the campaign period he had to go round the country campaigning for the party. Against all expectations he secured 49,000 votes and was elected 2nd MP, beating the estate Tamil leader Thondaman to third place.
Youngest Leader of the Opposition
His victory in a neck to neck contest with two formidable leaders of the time, Gamini Dissanayake and S. Thondaman, after only six days of campaigning, is a remarkable incident in the parliamentary election history of Sri Lanka. This victory of his was in a background where strong men of the party had fallen like giant trees being uprooted, the party base was being eroded and only 8 party candidates able to enter Parliament.
Anura Bandaranaike became the youngest Leader of the Opposition not only in Sri Lanka but in the entire Commonwealth of Nations. When the office of the Leader of the Opposition fell vacant in 1983 he was appointed to that post with the consent of everyone. Everyone accepts that leading a miniscule SLFP group of 8 MPs, undaunted, against a formidable UNP government side of 148 MPs, he discharged his responsibilities at the highest level of performance. His performance in that office displaying the marks of a mature politician is an excellent model for present day leaders to emulate.
He took the entire burden of the campaign in the 1988 Presidential election contested by Madam Bandaranaike, in the midst of state violence and tiger terrorist threats. He addressed 115 campaign meetings throughout the island and gave leadership to the campaign amidst showers of bombs and bullets, if not for the violence and the bogus votes, that election would have been won by Madam Bandaranaike.
Anura also led the 1989 general election campaign together with his mother. He was also able to raise the consciousness of the people through paadayaathraas and rathayaathraas. Most leaders today do not remember the way people waited with lighted huluathus, to greet Anura coming in those paadayaathraas and rathayaathraas.
It is with the unanimous agreement of all Members of Parliament that Anura Bandaranaike reached the highest office in Parliament, that of Speaker, as well. He added lustre to that office. He gave a historic ruling that the Legislature is supreme. The coalition was born due to his enthusiasm and perseverance. If not for the birth of the coalition, a SLFP led government would not have been born in 2004. There is no one today to write about Anura Bandaranaike and to commemorate his memory.
Those who climbed the steps of the political ladder with his help while he was alive do not appear to be speaking even a word about him today. Sri Lankan politics is immersed in ingratitude today, to such an extent. Our society feels the absence of distinguished politicians of the caliber of Anura Bandaranaike, today more than ever.

After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka has not made sufficient progress in four areas, namely International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea and Iran). As a result, the FATF at its Plenary held at Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML and CFT deficiencies in the FATFs Compliance Document which is more commonly identified as the Grey List. Upon listing, a time bound action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka, they said.
Since the listing in November 2017, Sri Lankan authorities have taken a number of measures to enhance AML and CFT compliance such as issue of Customer Due Diligence Rule No 1 of 2018 for Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), issuance of regulation for North Korea on targeted financial sanctions on proliferations.
Further, several initiatives are being taken by Sri Lanka including, introducing amendments to the Trust ordinance & Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act No 25 of 2002 by the Ministry of Justice, introducing amendments to the Companies Act No 7 of 2007 by the Registrar of Companies, issuance and implementation of regulation on proliferation targeted financial sanctions on Iran by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, implementation of regulation issued on North Korea by the Competent Authority (Ministry of Defence) and introduction of risked based AML and CFT supervision for Designated Non Finance Businesses and Professions by the Financial Intelligence Unit. In addition, measures have been taken to strengthen AML and CFT supervision of the Financial Intelligence Unit by allocating more competent staff to the existing team of supervisors.
There is no doubt on the successful completion of the action plan within the given time frame, Sri Lanka will improve its compliance and improve the countrys rating, the FIU said.

Lasantha Wickrematunge killing :
Former crimes OIC, Senior DIG to turn state witnesses
Former Mt. Lavinia Police Crimes OIC, SI Tissa Sugathapala and retired Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara arrested by the CID over the killing of veteran journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge have agreed to testify as state witnesses, the CID said.
Kalubowila JMO Dr. Sunil Kumara who issued Lasanthas autopsy report stated that the cause of death was due to cranio cerebral injuries following a discharge of a firearm. However, the reports of the Government Analyst and Prof. Mohan Silva who performed an emergency operation on Wickrematunge soon after his admission to the Kalubowila hospital, had stated that there was no trace of any gunshot injuries.
According to the CID, the telephone details of former Kalubowila JMO indicates that he was in touch with former senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara, adding that Dr. Sunil Kumara is also a relative of DIG Nanayakkara.
SI Tissa Sugathapala was taken into custody by the CID on February 2 and retired Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara was arrested on February 13.
A CID source told the Daily News that they are currently trying to determine what information contained in the note book kept by Wickrematunge. He said they had obtained court approval to subject this note book to handwriting tests by the Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD). Several pages of Wickramatunges note book had been removed and replaced, the CID said.
The CID said the Examiner of Questioned Documents will be able to determine if the handwriting on the replaced pages tallies with the rest of the handwriting on the note book.
The former DIG is facing charges of aiding and abetting in destroying vital evidence in the investigations into the killing of Wickrematunge. The former Mount Lavinia Crimes OIC had also admitted that he had acted to conceal the evidence of the killing based on the instructions of senior officials of the police.
Many files similar to those that were reported missing in the investigations related to the murder of Wickramatunge and several forged documents had been discovered hidden in the house of the former Crimes OIC, which was found when CI Sugathapalas house was searched.
Information had also been revealed that Lasanthas diary which had been found in his car at the time of his assassination, containing all his details, his mobile phone and several other items had been given by SI Sugathapala to an SP who had then given it to the DIG and then to the IG and eventually to the high ranking government official. This information had also come to light during the interrogation of SI Sugathapala.
Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed by two assailants who had followed him on a motorcycle at Attidiya on January 8, 2009. But investigations remained stagnant with no promising progress for around nine years.
However, the present government recommenced investigations under the CID and evidence pertaining to this crime has been surfacing gradually.

FORMER STUDENT CONFESSES TO FLORIDA SHOOTING
US: A troubled teen with alleged ties to a white supremacist group confessed on Thursday to murdering 17 people at his former high school in Florida, as the FBI admitted it had received a tip-off about the 19-year-old gunman yet failed to stop him.
As Americans reeled from the country's worst school massacre since the horror at Sandy Hook six years ago, President Donald Trump suggested the root cause of the violence was a crisis of mental health -- and defied calls to address gun control.
Terrified students hid in closets and under desks on Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, texting for help as the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, stalked the school with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle.
Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, appearing Thursday afternoon before a judge who ordered him held without bond.
After being read his legal rights, Cruz stated that he was the gunman who entered the school campus armed with a AR-15 and began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on the school grounds, court documents showed.
Cruz also admitted he discarded his rifle -- which he bought legally in Florida -- and tactical gear in order to blend in with the crowd to flee the campus, the documents showed.
After the shooting, he stopped at a Wal-Mart store and then McDonald's, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters. He was detained 40 minutes later, after police identified him using school security camera footage.
Expelled from school for disciplinary reasons, Cruz was known to be fixated on firearms -- and had reportedly been identified as a potential threat to his classmates.
In a somber televised address to the nation in response to the 18th school shooting so far this year, Trump vowed to make mental health a priority -- after tweeting about the many signs the gunman was mentally disturbed -- while avoiding any talk of gun curbs.
Earlier in the day, Trump had asserted that neighbours and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! But US authorities themselves were under scrutiny, after the FBI confirmed it was alerted last September to a message posted on YouTube, in which a user named Nikolas Cruz vowed: I'm going to be a professional school shooter. In a statement, the FBI said it had carried out database reviews and other checks but was unable to identify the person who made the post.
A mugshot of Cruz depicts an ordinary-looking young man -- cleanly-cut chestnut hair, hazel eyes, his face speckled with freckles.
But the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts.
I met him last year, he was in my class at the beginning of the year and when I first met him, I knew that something was off about him and he was kind of weird, Manolo Alvarez, 17, told AFP.
Fellow students knew he posted violent messages online, and on Thursday the Anti-Defamation League reported he was a member of a white supremacist group and had taken part in military-style training exercises.
Jordan Jereb, believed to lead the shadowy Republic of Florida (ROF), however told the rights group that his organization had not supported Cruz's attack.
Nobody I know told him to do that, he just freaked out, Jereb said in a separate interview with The Daily Beast, adding that Cruz seemed like just a normal, disenfranchised, young white man. I don't know precisely what he believes, he said. I know he knew full well he was joining a white separatist paramilitary proto-fascist organization.
Fifteen people were killed at the high school, and two later died in hospital.
One of those killed was Aaron Feis, a well-loved football coach in Parkland, a city of about 30,000 people located north of Miami where Trump was due to travel to meet the shocked community.
Two of the wounded remained hospitalized in critical but stable condition, while six others were on the way to a full recovery, officials told a news conference.
The school shootings are part of a broader epidemic of gun violence in a country that loses 33,000 people to gun-related deaths each year, two-thirds of them suicides.
While the latest shooting reignited questions about America's gun laws, Trump -- the first president to have addressed the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby -- staunchly opposes any additional controls.
Opponents of gun curbs have sought to steer public debate onto the motives -- and mental health -- of people using the weapons. Former Democratic President Barack Obama issued a new appeal for action Thursday, insisting we have to change and calling for long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want. - AFP

How to build a rugby player
(Part 1 appeared last Saturday)
BEEFING UP, MOVING COMPETENTLY
International rugby is a gladiatorial contest. Since the sport went professional in 1995, players have become bigger, stronger and faster. The forwards in the New Zealand side that won the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 weighed on average 15st 9lb (99.5 kg) a man. The biggest forward at the 2015 World Cup, France's Unini Atonio, topped the scales at 22st 12 lb (145kg).
Compared to the behemoths of today, those playing 30 years ago look like figurines. Players' frames must now withstand one bone-crunching tackle after another. Is there pressure on young players to beef up too rapidly
"It's easier to build strong kids than it is to repair broken men," Eager says.
"They've got to be able to move competently first before we try getting them significantly stronger through lifting heavier weights. It's giving them a coat of armor so they can start to tolerate the demands as they progress.
"It's easy to get people to body build, but they won't be good rugby players. They won't be resilient to the demands of the sport.
"You have to have an element of patience, particularly with some of the second-row forwards. It generally takes them longer, as they tend to be the skinny, lanky kids, so there's coordination issues and, generally, there's 20kg to put on.
"If you want to accelerate it, fine, but you have to understand there are potential pitfalls."
He adds: "Strength and conditioning would be an easy job if we said we've got to get all props to a certain weight or a certain level of fitness.
"But that's not realistic and that's what makes it interesting -- you've got to make decisions all the time based on what's going to make an individual excel in the one or two things which will potentially make him an international player.
"The flip side is, what made an international player five years ago isn't necessarily what's going to make these guys international players in five years' time. Who knows what that looks like, I definitely don't."
INTENSITY AND STRESS - WHAT IT TAKES TO BE GREAT
Refueled after lunch -- the squad will shovel down 40 to 50 chicken breasts a day -- the players head outside to put the morning's theory into practice. Code names are yelled and each player will scuttle into position for a choreographed move. It's a dance of sorts, a bruising ballet.
Steve Bates, the RFU's performance manager and international performance coach, says little on the sidelines, leaving his lieutenants to bellow orders. Communicating with the coaches via ear pieces are the strength and conditioning coaches. There is a set time for each move. This is no place for ambiguity.
As the players go through what is called a "game test" session, the size of this operation is more visible than ever. There's a kit man, two analysts standing on scaffolding filming, four coaches, a media manager, a four-man medical team and two strength and conditioning coaches.
The attention to detail should come as no surprise.
After all, England are the proponents of "earthquake training," exposing academy players to a simulated earthquake to test their ability to think on their feet, communicate and work together.
Another activity conducted was a "Big Brother" weekend where a select group had to perform tasks under the microscope of all-seeing cameras -- an exercise to develop self-awareness and support of others.
The next generation are being taken out of their rugby bubble. English rugby has huge potential, and it wants to fulfill it.
Today's high-intensity session aims to test the players' stress tolerance. It is the ones who can cope with playing under such fire, says Bates, who usually make it through the system.
"What we're looking for from players in this environment is more about their mental application, a resilience to keep bouncing back, a toughness to really fight for their position and when things are tough in training," says Bates, who joined the Under-20s set-up as head coach last August.
"There are a lot of guys who are probably physically in the ball park, there's quite a few guys who can play, but there aren't many guys who are physical and can play under this stress.
"It's our job to develop that playing under stress, with a winning element to it. Some of the best players can cope with that easily. You can spot those characteristics in the very, very good.
"But playing under stress is also something that can be developed by being put under those conditions for longer periods of time consistently."
Bates, a former London Wasps and England scrum-half, is the man credited with unearthing Jonny Wilkinson, arguably his country's greatest player.
The 54-year-old was a player during the beer-swigging amateur era, when international players would train with their compatriots a few days before a Test, combining rugby with full-time jobs. Much has changed since then, admits Bates with a wry smile.
"For me, the thing that stands out in this environment is how much the individual is the focus of attention. The difference is so marked," he says.
"All the analysis, the GPS stuff, the dietary stuff, is all athlete centered. How do we get the best out of our players and use the technology and the resources that are available to improve individuals
"The mentality of everybody in the game is push, push, push. The inquisitiveness, the desire to push the game forward, is as high as I've ever known it."
Bates' three coaches -- Ponton, Richard Blaze and Anthony Allen -- joined the Under-20s in December and are part of England's new coach development programme, an agreement between the RFU and Premiership Rugby which offers young club coaches the experience of working in an international environment.
Bates is the experienced eye and his squad isn't implicitly following a plan devised by Eddie Jones' senior set-up. This is not the rugby equivalent to Barcelona's La Masia.
They have access to Jones' ideas and methods. The Australian, says Bates, is "outstanding" in his attention to detail on the individual. They have also exchanged ideas with coaches from other sports, most recently Britain's boxing team. His aim, says Bates, is to produce players who are adaptable, who can play "for any number of coaches."
CALORIES, CALORIES, CALORIES
It is nearly time to rest completely. Another challenging day is nearing its conclusion and players and coaches are devouring plates of carefully planned carbohydrates and proteins.
Good nutrition, of course, is essential if these players are to blossom. Only with the right fuel can they thrive under pressure and outlast the opposition.
Centre Butler says he is now able to maintain his power, speed and strength in the final 20 minutes of a match, the period where England aim to kill off tiring opponents, thanks to a better understanding of what he needs to eat and when.
At times, he feels he is just endlessly consuming calories. It can be testing, Butler says, but it can also be fun.
"There are protein hits every three hours, having six meals a day," says the 19-year-old.
"The majority of these camps are quite intense so there's a lot of eating going on and the nutritionist does a very good job in keeping everyone happy."
Nutritionist Andres Kasper ensures the players' dietary needs are met, formulating detailed menus for the catering staff to serve up.
A player's intake reads like that of a bear's before hibernation. Protein levels are prescribed on an individual basis, but equates to about 20-40g five to six times a day, dependent on body weight.
After a tough training session, the squad will consume, says Kasper, in the region of 2-2.5kg of cooked pasta at lunch and dinner. There is also Greek yogurt for easy protein hits -- the squad will go through about 8kg tubs of the stuff per day.
As they refill and restore, the players aren't as earnest as they have been on the pitch and in meetings. They have loosened up. They chat, they joke. Reassuringly, they are not in habitual focus.
"There's that expectation that now you're an actual rugby player there's a responsibility of being an athlete and having high standards and not messing about on the training field because we don't have that much time together as a team," explains Butler. After dinner some will play table tennis in the games' room, others will receive treatment on aches and pains and a chosen few will analyze the day's training session and report back. Then it is to bed, to the on-site dormitories, to recover and rest before doing it again tomorrow. It is relentless. It is challenging. It is what it takes to become a great.  CNN

I will abide by the Constitution - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the coalition government will continue to take forward the January 8, 2015 mandate with several political,fiscal and party reforms to follow, while accepting the peoples verdict during last weeks Local Government (LG) elections.
In his first appearance following the LG polls, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the coalition government will work according to the provisions of the constitution and he will continue to carry out duties as the Prime Minister. We have time to correct our situation and plan to restructure the entire development programme of the government with an impending cabinet reshuffle, he said.
He said the mid-term LG polls were a good barometer for the government to check the pulse of the people. It is a warning conveyed by voters and we would initiate reforms accordingly.
Speaking to journalists at Temple Trees last afternoon, he said he had a round of discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena after the election and will have another discussion next week. Working within a coalition government is a difficult task; however, we will work according to the Constitution.
He attributed the political setback at LG polls to economic issues, and delays in taking legal action against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and family and the regime accused of corruption. The food prices escalated as a result of the hampered economic growth-owing to natural disasters, both floods and drought within the last two years.
Explaining the actions taken against the previous regime, he said, We have taken legal action against Mahinda Rajapaksas family and the regime and investigations are continuing; however the people are a bit impatient and they keep asking, What have we done to bring them to book.
But the government has taken measures to strengthen the legal system and to expedite the legal procedure, especially over the last two months. Since the coalition government was formed, the Prime Minister said he or the President have not put any pressure on the officials to save any individual.
Answering a question on his association with Mahinda Rajapaksa, the PM said, he has no barrier to talk to anyone, or any MP and that applies to Rajapaksa as well,admitting that the former President spoke to him over the phone last Monday to clarify some of the political rumours.
Talking about the future of his party, the Prime Minister said his party  UNP - will go through some major changes with an emerging young group of MPs being groomed to take the leadership of the party over the next 20 years.
The leadership should play a major role and those who aspire to be leaders should be able to work in unison. The UNP is the only political party that remains as the single strong party within the political system in the country.
Further he added, the 2018 LG polls was an experiment.
As a result, there are lot of hung councils. We are currently analysing the shortcomings so that we can take corrective measures and improve the system in future elections.

Kandy SC expected to ground Airmen
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will go all out to clip the wings of the Airmen and assert their supremacy when they play in their Clifford Cup quarterfinal fixture at Trinity College rugby grounds, Pallekelle today at 4.00 pm. On current form Kandy SC will not have any difficulty in crash landing the Airmen whom they have twice thrashed in the league matches. Kandy is expected to carry on from where they left off last Sunday and continue their winning streak into the knockouts.
For todays match Kandy SC will include the best young talent they have at their disposal. Kandy SC has been playing cohesive rugby which has unsettled many of their opponents. Another incentive to the Kandy SC side is the encouragement given by their trustee Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema. Kandy SC had their final work out last morning and the coaches Sean Wijesinghe and his assistant Saliya Kumara who put the players through their paces has in consultation with the rugby committee decided to make a few changes from the side that played Havelock SC last Sunday. In the forwards play, Kandy SC should get the better of their opponents and give the Colombo lads a torrid time. Their backs have been performing with good understanding as they have proved in the league games. Their backs have regularly provided that extra pace which has made their task easier. Their strong point against Airmen will be their back division. Air Force will be at full strength, but will face a tough task to stop their opponents from going on another scoring spree. A better show is expected from the Airmen. But whatever they do it is going to be a difficult task for them to match the champion Kandy SC outfit.

Mahindananda seeks order to transfer asset case
Filing a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage sought an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.
On a previous occasion, this case had been fixed for trial on February 20, 21 and 22 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial.
When the Transfer Application was taken up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was transferred to another bench to be on February 20.
Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage.

Moves to form SLFP, UPFA Govt.- Dinesh
Discussions are under way to form a government comprising the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs, Joint Opposition Parliamentarians Committee leader Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday.
Negotiations between the two parties had led to them suggesting that SLFP Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva be named Prime Minister under this move, Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila said. The President suggested that we accept ministerial portfolios in a joint Cabinet, Gammanpila further said but the Joint Opposition had informed him that they would only do so if Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister. The President had rejected this suggestion.
Thus we decided that we would support the President to form a SLFP government but not accept ministerial portfolios, he said.
Accordingly, a committee, which comprises both the SLFP and the UPFA Parliamentarians, has been appointed to look into the process of forming a new joint government.
Minister Susil Premajayantha will lead the SLFP sector at the committee while Dinesh Gunawardena will lead the UPFA sector.
Several rounds of discussions have been held between the two parties aiming to come to an acceptable conclusion. The preliminary discussion in this regard was held between Minister Premajayantha and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa last morning.
It has been reported that the idea to form a new joint government was proposed when the Minister Premajayantha met Former President Rajapaksa at his residence on Wijerama Road, Colombo.
In the meantime UPFA MP Kumara Welgama informed the media yesterday that the President had stated that he would send for the Attorney Generals opinion on whether he, the President could remove the Prime Minister from his post.
<U+200B>The move to form an SLFP government however has not been accepted favourably by all SLFPers.Sources state that a group of SLFPers led by Minister Duminda Dissanayake have opposed this deal. Further, certain factions within the Joint Opposition itself have voiced reservations regarding working together as they point out that the SLFP is yet to inform the Speaker in writing that the agreement between the UNP and SLFP stands null and void.

Purchase of dry food rations for Security Forces:
MP urges investigation into alleged loss
United National Party (UNP) Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana yesterday urged the authorities to investigate the alleged loss of Rs. 2 billion allocated for raw and dry food rations to the Security Forces.
He further said that the authorities should take immediate measures to investigate any irregularities that occurred when distributing the required food rations without any delay to the Security Forces.
MP Pathirana yesterday lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption into the alleged loss of Rs. 2 billion which was to be allocated for purchasing raw and dry food items through the tender process for the Security Forces.
He urged the authorities to take immediate action on this tender issue before which has caused consternation among Security Forces personnel as well as members of the public. Pathirana alleged that certain officials and their henchmen are secretly trying to bypass the tender process in this matter.
"I lodged the complaint against the irregularities made by a female Accountant in the Defence Ministry and the Chairman of the Tender Board," he said. "I met Secretary to the Defence Ministry to discuss this issue and he has already refused this tender due to irregularities. I also expect to take this matter to the Public Accounts Committee in Parliament shortly, he added.

Namal's money laundering case fixed for trial
A case filed against Hambantota District Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs. 30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited, was yesterday fixed for trial on February 20 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon, the first witness of the case was not present in court and court was informed that the witness was suffering from an illness.
Four accused, Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd were present in court when the case was taken up before the Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused Indika Karunajeewa was not present in court but represented by attorneys. On a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed with the trial in absencia of second and sixth accused in the case in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case. The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014. It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services of Colombo 5, provided coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines. The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
President's Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for Namal Rajapaksa. President's Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the third accused. Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the second and fourth accused.

New electoral system
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who met Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday asked that the latter submit a report on the shortcomings of the new electoral system and ways in which it can be further improved to the Constitutional Council next week.
The Chairman had made special mention of the pragmatic issues which have cropped up when implementing the 25 percent quota for female candidates.
Deshapriya pointed out that there would need to be certain amendments made with regard to the quota in certain councils.
When the Speaker had inquired as to when the new councils would be established, Deshapriya informed him that they should be able to swear in all councils by the end of March. The Speaker further asked that the Elections Commission study methods to computerize the system in future to make the process easier.

A new hope for South Africa
All South African leaders will forever live in the shadow of the Great Nelson Mandela, or Madiba as he was affectionately called. But if there is one man who can at least come close to Madiba, it is Cyril Ramaphosa, who was by Madibas side as he came out of prison on February 11, 1990. Ramaphosa was just 37 then and a rising star in the African National Congress (ANC).
Today, as the newly elected President of the Rainbow Nation South Africa, Ramaphosa faces a raft of challenges and issues, not least the General Elections slated for next year. The new chief tenant of the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the fifth since the end of Apartheid in 1994, has a huge task ahead of him in bringing together a fractured nation. His ascension to the presidency follows a tumultuous few weeks in South African politics which saw the ouster of scandal-hit former President Jacob Zuma.
Ramaphosa, who Mandela always thought would one day become the South African leader, has lost no time in invoking his legendary mentors legacy. We should draw deep into Madibas wisdom, we should draw deep into Madibas style of doing things in an orderly manner, in a purposeful manner, in a way where we focus, he said, standing in front of a large photograph of Mandelas smiling face.
Ramaphosa dabbled in politics while studying and it was the former that became his true calling. Having become the Secretary General of ANC just one year after Mandelas release, he became virtually the right-hand man of Mandela. Ramaphosa was a skilled negotiator (in fact, he became the ANCs Chief negotiator) who helped achieve a smooth transfer of power and draft a post-Apartheid Constitution that is the envy of many other countries facing similar conflicts. Many South Africans can still remember Mandela and Ramaphosa posing for pictures with a copy of the new South African Constitution in 1996.
Ramaphosas life has its fair share of controversies, but he has shown an ability to genuinely repent and apologize for his mistakes, a rare quality in politics. Ramaphosas investment company owned 9 per cent of the mining firm Lonmin when a wildcat strike at its Marikana platinum mine in South Africas North West Province in 2012 led to a police massacre of 34 miners. Although Ramaphosa initially supported police action against the strikers, he has since apologized many times for the incident. Ramaphosa, who has an estimated wealth of US$ 450 million, with interests in mining, energy, fast food, and telecommunications, has also apologized profusely for once bidding 18 million Rand for a cow and her calf at an auction. It was a mistake to even put up my hand to do so. It is a mistake in the sea of poverty. The damage has been done, I will live with it, he told a radio talk show host.
Like Ramaphosa himself, South Africa can never forget its past. Even though South Africans have largely got over the days of Apartheid, it will be harder to forget Zumas reign which was rife with corruption and abuse of power. One South African columnist has called for a purge of epic proportions followed by prosecutions and prison sentences for Zumas cronies and the presidents keepers.
He will also have to rebuild destroyed ministries and institutions, including the South African Revenue Service. The biggest challenge is perhaps reviving South Africa's faltering economy - two leading credit rating agencies have downgraded the country's debt to junk status, growth is minimal, corruption is rife and the official unemployment rate sits is a staggering 27 per cent. Millions of people still live in rickety dwellings, schooling is patchy, much of healthcare is rudimentary and violent crime is on the rise.
It will be difficult to address all these issues within just one year before facing the elections, but there is another opportunity on the horizon for bringing all South Africans together - Mandelas centennial on July 18. It is only by emphasizing his links with the Father of the Nation and adhering to the values Mandela espoused, that Ramaphosa can give hope of a brighter future to his fellow South Africans. Perhaps he will be able to erase the nightmares of the Zuma years in the process. That is essential if South Africa seeks to get back on the road to peace and reconciliation.
Those are the very aims that brought Ramaphosa to Sri Lanka a few years ago. Though the conflicts in Sri Lanka and South Africa were quite different in scope, some of the undercurrents as well as the lessons learned are broadly similar. Ramaphosa has shared his views on these issues with the Sri Lankan leadership on several occasions. There is no doubt that South Africa-Sri Lanka ties will be further strengthened under his watch thanks to this familiarity and commonality of purpose. Regaining the trust of the wider international community should be a priority for Ramaphosa as he strives to build a prosperous, inclusive and stable South Africa which will be an asset to the whole world.

Open warrant to arrest Jaliya Wickramasuriya
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday re-issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the suspect was not present in Court. At a previous occasion the Court was informed through his counsel that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before the due date. The defence counsel said his client is still receiving treatment at a US hospital.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate yesterday issued open warrants for the arrest of two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for failure to appear before court.
They had been warned that sureties would be liable for confiscation of bail amount if they failed to appear in court.
Two sureties including wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya were not present in court yesterday as well.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Pakistans tour to Zimbabwe in doubt due to cash crisis
The Pakistan players will be busy for over a month now with the prestigious Pakistan Super League (PSL) coming up. The PSL will start on 22 February and will pan out all the way till 25 March.
The Pakistani team will then play a T2oI series against West Indies which will be followed by Test series against England and Ireland. Later they are scheduled to play against Scotland and Zimbabwe.
However, the tour of Zimbabwe seems to be under the cloud at the moment. The African side is due to host Pakistan across all three formats in June while Australia were to also travel for a bilateral series but those fixtures are now in doubt. The Zimbabwe series could well be postponed
Zimbabwe Cricket's cash crisis is threatening to interrupt their upcoming home international season. Hosting any team for a bilateral series is often a costly affair.
The visiting team needs to be provided with various facilities, logistics for which the cricket boards shell out from their pockets. Although some good amount of revenue is generated, the viewership for Zimbabwe's matches is not often on the higher side.
Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) has been trying to negotiate a with both countries attempting to arrange an ODI tri-series instead, but even that will be a financial setback. ZC's managing director, Faisal Hasnain, told ESPNcricinfo that Finances may not allow the [Pakistan] series to go ahead because we don't get a lot from our TV contract, and the series ends up  the production costs result in huge losses.
Given the current cash situation, he said the series could also be postponed. Given our current cash situation, in order to balance our books, we may actually have to either renegotiate the format or we may have to postpone it until such time as we are ready to play. We are looking at all of that to see whether we have the tri-series only, the Pakistan series only, or we change the format. We are just working through, considering our options at the moment, he added.
Zimbabwe are due to host the 2019 World Cup Qualifiers starting next month that tournament will be unaffected by the home union's cash crisis as it is an ICC event.

People for coalition between UNP, Presidents new movement - Ranawaka
The peoples wish is for a new coalition between the United National Party (UNP) and President Maithripala Sirisenas new movement to govern the country, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He also said in a statement that the same coalition should accept the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as the leading opposition party and Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Oppostion Leader.
Minister Ranawaka further said that the Local Government election results reflect that there is a strong objection against the process of the government.
He added that due to this reason there should <U+200B>be radical<U+200B> political reforms that would address the issues of the people going beyond providing the fertiliser subsidy, Samurdhi, construction of bridges and roads and changing of the ministers.
Minister Ranawaka added that there should be a novel approach within the next 18 months.
He further said that allowing a loose democracy for the sake of Good Governance will only lead to <U+200B>instability.
Minister Ranawaka also said the UNP too has to make changes to their policies.
He added that it should give priority to the talented and skilful youth to make it a progressive country.
Minister Ranawaka also said the UNP should transform itself to unite all the people in the country.
If not the UNP may lose the Provincial Council elections in September this year and April next year, Minister Ranawaka said.
He also said that although the new party,the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won the election this year, the JHU analyses the victory differently. Minister Ranawaka added that the name was only new but it was the same SLFP and the UPFA that won the election. The truth is that the new party was the one that was led by President Maithripala Sirisena, Minister Ranawaka said.
The Rajapaksa group is attempting to involve the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisenas new group in the fray with an intention to make hay while the sun shines. But, I think the people would not be misled,he said.
He also said that what is reqired at this moment is to accept the peoples mandate humbly and build up a national alliance between the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisenas new movement.
The leaders of these parties should be very far sighted in this endeavour and should accept Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader and the SLPP as the leading opposition party in Parliament, Minister Ranawaka added.

Colonel Henry Steele Olcotts 111th death anniversary falls today:
Pioneer in Buddhist Revival Movement
Colonel Olcott was an inspiring servant of mankind. He lived in our age and dedicated the later years of his life to Buddhism and the peoples of Asia particularly those of India and Sri Lanka. He gave up an affluent life for a simpler and nobler one. He devoted his energies to working for the benefit of the common people. The services rendered to Asia and particularly to the revival of Buddhist cultures are contributions worthy of an honoured place in the pages of Asian history.
Colonel Olcott died on February 17, 1907, at his home in Adyar, near Madras India, after having served his beloved Asian people for nearly 32 years. The anniversary of his death is celebrated throughout India and particularly by the people of Sri Lanka, who have a special veneration for him.
Colonel Henry Steele Olcott was born on August 2, 1832, in Orange, New Jersey, U.S.A. After a brilliant school career at the City College of New York and Colombia University, he became interested in agriculture. He edited a farmers periodical, and in 1858 he became associated with the New York Tribune as the agriculture editor. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, he gave up his newspaper work and went to the front, where he eventually attained the rank of Colonel. Colonel Olcott served in special capacities in both the Army and Navy Departments.
After the conclusion of the war, he was admitted to the Bar of New York State. He became a prominent as a lawyer, as well as an investigator of graft especially in connections with the scandals in the Mustering and Disbanding Departments. This work required unusual integrity and courage, as his life was constantly threatened.
Christian Orthodoxy
When he was employed by the New York Sun to investigate the mystic phenomena which took place at the Eddy Farm in New York, where he met Madame Blavatsky and he began a long friendship and collaboration with her which lasted until her death in 1891. During this time Colonel Olcott became interested in oriental religious, especially Buddhism. In 1875, he and Madame Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society of New York. The main objective of the Society were to establish the nucleus of a universal brotherhood of humanity, to promote the study of comparative religion and philosophy and to make a systematic investigation of the mystic potencies of life and matter, or what is usually called occultism.
He sat out with Madame Blavatsky for India in 1878 to study various religions there, and they arrived in Sri Lanka on May 17, 1880. Sometimes later in the same month both of them embraced Buddhism publicly in Galle. What profounded influenced Colonel Olcott to adopt Buddhism as his religion was his study of the famous public debates that took place in 1873 at Panadura. These debates erupted between incumbent monk Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda of Kotahena Temple, and his adversaries in the Christian priesthood. It is recorded by a bhikku that Ven. Gunananda faced the united forces of Christian Orthodoxy. So, powerful was his eloquence and reasoning in the Panadura Controversy, which was intended to bring discredit to the Buddhists, that the tables were turned against Christianity in Sri Lanka.
The decades between 1870 and 1890 became a crucial period in the history of Sri Lanka. The four notables in this period were Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda, Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Maha Nayake Thera of Maligakanda Vidyodaya Pirivena, Colonel Olcott and his pupil, the Ven. Anagarika Dharmapala. Their contributions to revival of Buddhism, Buddhist Culture and Buddhist education will never be forgotten by the Sinhalese Buddhists, who revere their memory.
When Colonel Olcott came to Sri Lanka in 1880, this great civilization was in a decadent state. He found on his arrival that there were only three Buddhist schools in this Buddhist country. The education system was dominated and dictated by the Christians churches, which discriminated against the Buddhists and compelled them not only to go to Christian schools, but also to get marriage certificates only in Christian Churches.
It was a time when Buddhists were frightened and ashamed to call themselves Buddhists openly, due to fear of economic persecution by the missionaries. Colonel Olcott revolted against this prejudice and therefore he started Buddhist educational movement and founded the Colombo brand of the Buddhist Theosophical Society, with the cooperation of Buddhists. In a remarkable way, all the high Buddhist monks of the island gathered around and received him with much warmth, so that he was the envy of other Europeans who lived secluded and isolated from the native people. He became one of the oppressed Buddhists who fought for their rights.
Colonel Olcott, together with Anagarika Dharmapala, were pioneers in the Buddhist revival movement in India and Sri Lanka. They worked together in the development of Sri Lanka's educational movement. They travelled from village to village on foot and in bullock cart, exhorting the people to live Buddhist lives, and collecting funds. Principally to the credit of Colonel Olcott there are about, 12 large colleges and over 400 Buddhist schools in the island.
International Buddhist flag
At this point Colonel Olcott felt the need for a symbol to rally the local Buddhists. To meet this need, he designed a flag for the Buddhists from the aura that shone around the head of the Buddha. It was accepted as the International Buddhist flag by the World Fellowship of Buddhist which met in Sri Lanka in 1950 for the first time, and its acceptance was further confirmed at the conference in Japan in 1952.
On the full moon day of Vesak in 1881, Olcott inaugurated at Kelaniya Temple a Buddhist National Fund for the general promotion of religious and secular education of Buddhist literature. The first cheque Rs. 100 was handed to Olcott immediately after his speech by R.A. Mirando. By 1886 the Buddhist National Fund had collected Rs. 13,000. Olcott also did many things to rouse the people's enthusiasm and he suggested the necessity for a public holiday on Vesak day and helped in getting if for the Buddhists.
On February 13, 1881, the first Buddhist Sunday School was started at the Society's premises in Maliban Street. C.W. Leadbeater, who had come to Sri Lanka with Olcott, was in charge of the Sunday School. On November 1, 1886, the same school in the Pettah was converted into the Pettah Buddhist English School, which later became Ananda College. The school started with 37 pupils with Leadbeater as honouary Head Master.
Before Olcott said goodbye to Sri Lanka he was able to see the fulfillment of the hopes he had on the eve of his first landing on these shores. In his achievements the sphere of education is the brightest. There were, when he left Sri Lanka a number of Buddhist Colleges and hundreds of schools to credit of his movement.
Olcott's last message
- February 2, 1907
To my beloved brethren in the physical body, I bid you farewell. In memory of me, carry on the grand work of proclaiming and living the brotherhood of religions.
To my beloved brothers on the higher planes, I greet you and come to you, and implore you to help me to impress on all men on earth that there is no religion higher than truth, as the Buddhist say and that in the brotherhood of religions lie the peace and progress of humanity.
(A special ceremony was held yesterday to mark Col. Henry Steele Olcott Day at the Kularatne Hall under the patronage of Senior Old Anandians of Ananda College)

POLITICAL REALITIES OF THE HUGE PURPLE TAINT
As this is written five days after the Local Government Poll the confusion still prevails  the disarray caused by those who loudly claimed the result was that of a general election leading to a change of government. It is not that they did not know the reality; rather it was their intent to mislead the public for their own personal political ends. This was a Local Government (LG) election, which the people of this country are quite familiar with. It was held specifically to decide on  what political parties or independents - would assume control of the LG bodies from Municipalities to Urban Councils, Town Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas, based on the number of members elected.
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) did obtain a massive victory, gaining control of possibly over 70 % of the local bodies. They were winners who clearly outdid their own expectations, and that of all their opponents.
The UNP came a distant second, and the SLFP much further behind it. But it was for control and management of LG bodies  and not the government of this country. In a county so familiar with cricket, the claim that this result was one for a change of government and prime minister, would look like an electoral exercise to decide on the groundskeepers, and maintenance workers of the major cricket grounds in the country, being considered as the means of selecting the National Cricket Team and its Captain.
There is much of political arithmetic still at play among those seeking to interpret this electoral result being different from what it exactly was. There are also others who do comparative calculations between the January 2015 Presidential Election result and this one, to show that this is no vote to change the unity government of 2015. That is certainly an unnecessary exercise, because the stuff of this poll was wholly different. It may be necessary to move on to political algorithms, closer to local government elections, and also consider the role of social media and the computer and digital analyses, to go into the deeper areas of calculation of this result.
The fact remains that what the people voted for, in essence, was for better and proper management of their local bodies  the building and cleaning of drains, the property rates and assessments, good road construction - maintenance and management, local housing, water supply, drainage, garbage clearance, and Dengue eradication, among key factors.
As the political bedlam settles down with the winners and losers in local government settling down to their tasks, under new laws and regulations, that involve increased female representation, and that of additional candidates; there is also the possibility of legislative amendments to polling laws considering the problem seen in the just concluded poll.
Political realities
The success of the SLPP with a remarkable victory is largely due to the many problems arising from the divisive thinking and politics in what was till recently the unity government.
The LG Poll campaign gave more opportunities for exposure of these differences, with the Presidents loud proclamations of how he would use the sword in his hand, to fight corruption; the clear attacks on the UNP and the Prime Minister from the leading SLFP and UPFA figures in the government ranks, the thinly veiled statements about how they would soon form an SLFP-led government (though not openly talking of joining the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp), and also the attacks on the SLFP rankers within the government by many UNP members, exposed the hugely divided thinking within the government. Such divisions, in the context of the largely worrisome Bond issue, which was fully canvassed by the President himself in attacks on his governing ally  the UNP, would certainly have contributed much to the huge blossoming of the pohottuva of the SLPP.
The confusion in these inter-unity divisions was best seen in President Sirisenas interview with Derana TV, just four days before the poll, when he clearly stated there was every intention to move together with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, after the local polls, in the fight against corruption and to better build the economy.
The Daily News in its editorial of Thursday 15  A make or break for Unity Govt.'  made an effective comment on this situation, stating: In sum, both, the UNP, and, SLFP were acting at cross purposes for the entirety of the Unity Government, resulting in sluggishness in the implementation of government policies, for the people's welfare. The public, naturally, were all at sea, unable to grasp this state of affairs. The UNPs hands were tied in most instances, with the SLFP always trying to project the image that it was the Blues that was against placing burdens on the public due to UNPs economic policies.
The Pohottuva curtain
Behind the vast purple colouring on the map that show the pohottuva won areas in the LG Poll, are many issues that are not mentioned by those who make their howl for an immediate change of government. President Sirisena has already made the appointment of the four- member Commission to probe SriLankan Airways, Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Catering from 2006 to 2018, chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Anil Guneratne. While many questionable issues involving SriLankan from 2015 till today will be probed, it will also probe the huge mismanagement of SriLankan for many years under the chairmanship of Nishantha Wickremasinghe, who was the brother-in-law of Mahinda Rajapaksa; which involved huge loss making purchases of aircraft, and many issues of corrupt management of his National Carrier. It will also bring out the shocking exposures by the Weliamuna Report, which were not acted on by the SriLankan directors under the unity government.
There is also the much subdued probe into the affairs and funds of the Siriliya Saviya Project of the former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa, which involved the use of Red Cross Jeep, and many more issues of expenditure and opening of bank accounts that have allegedly raised serious questions, as well as the availability of State vehicles for its activities.
There is also the necessity to resume the active probe into the affairs and functioning of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN), allegedly largely owned by the Rajapaksa Family, and the many questionable contracts it has received from the State, as well as the source of funds for the import of vehicles and equipment for it, and the ownership of the property it was housed in.
There is the continuing probe into the moneys and gems or gems and monies obtained by the Forrester aunt of Shiranthi Rajapaksa, whose money has allegedly helped one son of the Presidential Rajapaksas to own a property in Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia. These issues remain to be seriously probed, and cannot be covered by the purple curtain of the SLPP victory in the LG Poll, as big as it was.
The call for an SLFP-UPFA government or the removal of the UNP Prime Minister using the LG Poll victory of the pohottuva for the call to change a government is also a clear attempt to prevent any further action on the Report of the PRECIFAC Commission, which has called for action against key members of the previous Rajapaksa regime, including Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on many issues of fraud and corruption involving State funds and alleged violations of State administrative procedures.
It must also be noted that among the loudest voices calling for this government change on an LG Poll result are Wimal Weerawansa who faces charges of fraud involving many millions of rupees from his former ministry on matters of housing and transport, and Johnston Fernando, who is also not free of charges of fraud and corruption, involving the use of Sathosa employees for political work leading to many millions of losses.
Another loud voice in this purple call for a government change, Prasanna Ranatunga, saw the case involving him and his wife on an alleged major threat to a businessman involving over Rs. 60 million, postponed till March 12, 18. The other big talker on pohottuva success - Udaya Gammanpila of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, is also the accused in an alleged major cheating of a foreigner over an important Power of Attorney issue.
The purple taint of the pohottuva (SLPP) is clearly one of massive corruption, spread over several years, not to be ignored by the scope of the Treasury Bond issue, and the many issues of inaction against corruption under the unity government. President Sirisena is due to make his own statement of the situation, involving the continuity of the unity government, a day after this is written. Yet, as the UNP and SLFP-UPFA await this presidential decision, it is necessary to avoid any paralysis or hindrance of government on the basis of unreal calls for government change by the purple shouters.
Both the UNP and the UPFA-SLFP must make serious assessments of the constitutional and political realities of governmental change, and not be moved into wrong actions by the unquestioned victory of the SLPP in the LG Polls.

Rosy tells Election Commission:
Respect 25 percent quota allocated to women
Colombo Mayoral Elect Rosy Senanayake yesterday called on the Election Commission to abide by the 25 percent quota allocated to women in the recent Local Government elections.
On February 10 this year the country went to vote with the clear expectation that for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, a minimum of 25 percent of their council members would be women, she stated in a release to the media yesterday.
To now say that this minimum 25 percent of women council members could not be implemented, is disingenuous and in bad faith.
The minimum 25 percent quota is clear both from the letter of the law and the intentions of those who drafted it and the Parliament that passed it. Neither the Commission of Elections nor the Political Parties should consider adhering to this law to be unfair or burdensome.
The law cannot be set aside nor the clear intent of the law be defeated just because some Parties now have to nominate more women from their Lists than they expected to. To disregard the law would not only be discriminatory towards women but also circumvent the democratic process and the expectations of the electorate, said the former Parliamentarian.
She stressed that the law was not open to interpretation and that under the Ordinance, a minimum of 10 percent of nominees from each political party for election through the Ward system has to be women while a minimum of 50 percent of nominees on the separate additional persons List of each party has also to be women.
This formulation was put together with the sole aim of ensuring that a minimum of 25 percent of the members in each and every Council are women, she added.
In future, it is necessary to amend the law to further clarify the details of how exactly women members are allocated by each political party in different circumstances in order to ensure the 25 percent minimum of women members, I will fully engage with and support that process. In the meantime, the Commission of Elections and the Political Parties are under both a legal and moral obligation to implement the current law and ensure that all Councils are constituted with a minimum of 25 percent of women members and I strongly urge them to do so without delay, she further said.

Rules which are no longer valid in ODI cricket
Lots of experimentation has been going on with the 50-over format since the last decade or so, and this format lost a bit of popularity with time, especially with the success of the T20 format.
To attract crowds, Australia started a format with four innings of twenty overs each, and England started a pro 40 tournament, with each side playing forty overs.
None of these strategies paid dividends and failed to attract crowds.
Till 1983, ODIs used to be a 120 over contest with each inning of 60 overs, then it was reduced to 50-overs a side. The rules are changing very frequently to make the game more attractive and pull in some crowds.
A lot of permutations and combinations took place related to the field restrictions, and a lot was discussed in the ICC meetings related to this format.
At present, the first power play consists of an initial period of 10 overs, with at most 2 fielders outside the inner circle.
The second power play is from the 11th to the 40th over, where at most 4 fielders are allowed outside the circle.
The third and the last power play is from 41st to 50th over, where a maximum of 5 fielders are allowed outside the circle.
With the number of changes taking place in the ODIs, its unlikely those things are going to stay the same for a very long time.
The biggest drawback of these rules in ODIs is that the rules are dictating too many things to the fielding captain, hampering their natural decision making, as if, the ICC wants the ODIs to be played in a particular pattern.
The rules that are no longer valid in ODIs are as follows:

More importantly, the President too did not reject this proposal.

Virat Kohli is of a different class: Kumar Sangakkara
Indian skipper Virat Kohli just needs 176 ODIs and 166 innings to get past Sangas mark and notch up No. 26. This is October 2016 we are discussing. He has played 29 ODIs since then. Kohli already has 34 hundreds and is 15 short of Sachin Tendulkars world record tally.
In fact, he has scored 12 hundreds (as many Dravid scored in his career and two more than Dhoni) in his last 40 ODIs.
Kohli finished 2017 with 2,818 runs across formats, the most by any cricketer and third-most by any batsman in a calendar year.
Sangakkaras tally of 2,868 in 2014 still tops the charts. Kohli could have gone past Sangas tally had he played the ODIs and T20Is against Sri Lanka.
However, Sanga had famously remarked last year: I dont think that will last long the way Kohli is batting. He will probably overtake it next year and then do it again the year after. He is a different class.
Sri Lankan legendary batsmen Kumar Sangakkara finished his ODI career with 25 hundreds. He registered his last hundred in his penultimate ODI, his 403rd (379th innings) to be precise.
This is Sangakkara, one of the finest batsmen to grace the sport and he finished with fourth-most three-figures in ODIs, behind Sachin Tendulkar (49), Ricky Ponting (30) and countryman Sanath Jayasuriya (28).
To put things into perspective, Rahul Dravid has 12 hundreds from 344 ODIs (318 innings), MS Dhoni 10 from 310 (270 innings) and Mohammad Azharuddin 7 from 334 (308 innings).
We are talking of giants in one-day cricket. Sangas conversion rate does stand out.
