Life is not what happens to us, but the way we look at it:
You cant control the world, but your attitude
The insight you gain from meditation is so powerful, you can answer questions in all subjects. Even if you are put in an uncomfortable situation, you can use your experience and insights into the ways of the mind to cope with whatever happens.
No matter what you experience, you can always do something about it. The monastery in which I live we had to build ourselves. I recall an occasion where we monks were mixing concrete. When you do that, you get cement dust all over you.
My robes and under-robes got all dirty with concrete and water. When I was on my way back to my hut, I met a visitor, a Sri Lankan lady who was well-dressed and seemed to be upper-class. Im looking for the Abbot, she said. Do you know where he is Well, I was the Abbot.
So I said, If you go up to the hall, hell be there in fifteen minutes. I quickly went to shower and changed my robes, and became what a good monk should look like.
When I met her in the hall, she was very polite and inspired. As she was leaving, she said, I saw a monk in your temple who was very poorly dressed. Please tell him to dress properly.
When youre walking home from the office, sometimes unfortunately you trip in dog poo. Whenever you tread in dog poo, never scrape it off your shoes. Always take it home with you. Because once you get home, you may have an apple tree in your garden, and you can dig that dog poo into that tree. One year later, the apples from your tree will be sweeter. When you taste the sweet apples -- thats dog poo transformed. So, even when you face difficult experiences in life, which you must from time to time, like treading in dog poo, you can always dig it in. If you know how to use the dog poo of life, it always grows sweeter apples in your life.
If you have a down in life, a difficult period, never think it is something you have to get rid of straight away. Never allow the mind to get into depression. Surely you cant change the situation youre in. But you can change your attitude towards it.
You cant control the world, but you can control your attitude - how you regard the dog poo and what you do with it.
Control your emotions
It doesnt matter what people say to you or do to you. Why do people throw scorn on you anyway They do it to try to make you upset. Theyre trying to control your emotions. Why do you allow people to control you so much
Why do people allow their happiness to get destroyed in this way If youre wise, you say your peace and ease is under your power. You dont have to let people control you or your happiness. They can say what they like, do what they like.
You can choose to just let it go and make peace with it.
We have the opportunity to make a different response to the ups and downs in life.
We can make this difference. We can. In my experiences as a monk, you can see how people are able to make these changes in their lives. An extreme case came up when I went to Malaysia to teach. There was a girl who had had a big trauma in her life, and I was asked to give her some counselling. Buddhist monks are often sought after for counselling. Because were free! But also because we give good advice. She had a big problem. She had been to many counsellors and nothing had worked. Shed been raped violently. For her, it was affecting her whole life. She was in a mess.
As a monk, what I did was not to use psychic powers or anything like that. I simply sat opposite her. You make your mind very peaceful, and feel the person in front of you. You develop a sensitivity to understand where they are, how they feel.
Through silence, you understand her. Its not something you need a whole lot of meditation training to do.
I found that the woman had an amazing inner strength. This is the only time Ive said to someone in her situation, What happened to you is wonderful. You are very fortunate. It shocked her. I took a great risk to say that. As a monk, as a man whos never been in her situation. I risked trivializing or misunderstanding what she was going through. But I needed to say something out of the ordinary to shock her and open her mind to a different way out. When she was silent, I could really talk to her.
I said, I mean, I think you have it in you, some spiritual qualities, some inner strength to find a way out of this pain and humiliation and guilt. You know, people who have been raped feel they are somehow culpable and feel guilty for getting into that situation. It seems irrational, but they do. I said, You have the strength to do something. The reason I said you are fortunate is because I think this is your journey, to learn how to move away and climb out from this big hole. I cant really help you because I havent experienced it, so I dont know what its like. But I think when youre through this, your great gift will be that youll be able to hold the hand of another woman whos been through it and do what I can never do.
You can say, I know how you feel. More than that, not only can you hold her hand and empathize, you can tell her you know the path out. Your own experience can lead her step by step out of despair, out of pain and fear. You can give her life back. Show her freedom. That is why its very fortunate for you. Not now, but when youre through his. Youll be an amazing woman. You can really help others in way few people are privileged to do.
What I gave her there was hope. What I gave her there was a vision of life after the pain. What I gave her there was encouragement. It worked. This is actually an extreme case. When a person has been through such a down, such a trauma, it can scare them, emotionally cripple them for the rest of their life. I said There is another way. This is your way. When youve found it, share it with others.
That was an understanding of how during the downs in life, you do not need to allow the pain and despair to overwhelm you. There is something useful to gain no matter what has happened to you. The downs in life are the dog poo of your life. Thats where you learn. Thats the fertilizer. Thats the stuff of growth. Thats the Growing Pains.
As for the beautiful ups in life - thats your reward. But the ups also help you to grow happiness. We should always remember to.
Great downs in life
One of the great downs in life is relationships. Marriage. Partnership. Very often, I see the difficulties my disciples have figuring out how men and women can live together in peace and harmony. How to have a relationship with someone that wont descend into bitterness and divorce. Some peoples marriages are very dysfunctional.
Sure, they live together, but they arent happy together. What a strange thing that is.
If you have children, you love the children no matter what they do, who they are, or what their character is like. Now, when you choose husband or wife, you spend more time than you do selecting car. You take them out, check them out, have your friends and parents check them out. Sometimes these days you even test-drive them before you commit. Why is it that after you go through all these tests, you cant love your partner the way you love your child Why cant you love them unconditionally
If men and women can live in harmony, if we learn how to stop conflict, learn to give and take, in our own house, then people in the country, in the region, in the world may be able to.
How can we learn to do that So much of conflict starts with a fault-finding mind. When you look at a partner during your first date, you think hes the most wonderful person in world. But at the time you divorce, you think hes the most horrible person.
Actually, hes pretty much the same person. What has changed is your attitude towards him.
Love is blind at first. And if love is blind, then marriage is an institution for the blind. But after a while, you become blind not to the faults, but the good. You need to open your eyes to see the good. Dont just look at the faults. Actually, they had them from the beginning. Look at their beauty as well.
Too often in life, when we dont look at anothers beauty, we get angry. If you have an enemy, say a person in the office or next door or a family member, a great way of overcoming the problem is to look for beauty in the enemy. Something you can respect, something you can find endearing.
I was once at a funeral ceremony of an old man who had died. In Australia, at funerals there is the tradition of giving a eulogy. Close relations stand up and say something about the persons life, encapsulate who they were, and recall the good things. Eulogy literally means good words. This time, the deceaseds wife came up to say something about her husband. She told a story which her husband had told her about an experience that had affected his whole life.
One time when he was in school, children in the class were having an argument.
There was about to be a fight when the schoolteacher told them to all sit down immediately. He said, Get out a plain piece of paper and draw a vertical line down the middle. At the top write down the name of another boy in the class whom you hate the most. On the left-hand side, write down why you hate him. All the rotten things he does. Unkind words he says. Write it all down. All the kids in class started busily scribbling about their enemy, the one they hate the most. It took only a minute to fill the whole of the left side.
Then the teacher said, Now, on the right-hand side, write down something you respect about that person. Some kindness youve seen them do. This time, it took them a while to get the first thing down. But soon they thought up the right-hand side. Now, said the teacher, carefully fold the piece of paper in the middle and tear it in half. Put the left-hand side in the waste bin. Keep the right-hand side. Then get up and go give it to the person. So every child received a list of what their enemy liked about them. That changed the whole dynamic of that class.
It changed the life of her husband. Because for his whole life, he kept that piece of paper in his wallet. His wife took out that piece of paper, and showed it to the people at the funeral service. She continued, Whenever he was upset, he would look at this piece of paper  this is what his enemy thought of him. Imagine what his friends would say. So hes not such a bad person. It took him through some hard times in life. Because his enemy could see beauty in him, he learned to see beauty in himself.
At the end of her speech, three or four people stood up  his former classmates  and took out a similar piece of paper. They had also kept them. It meant so much to know your enemy can look at you and see something beautiful.
So the next time you have an argument with your partner, get out a piece of paper.
Write down all the mean, spiteful, lazy things they do. Then write down why you fell in love with them in the first place  all the beautiful things. Then go give it to your partner.
Do you understand what were doing here Through this exercise were forcing people to see something beautiful in the enemy. Because Im a monk, Ive been trained in this for long time. Its really incredible. When you see someone in a bad mood, dont look at the scolding. If you look at their beauty, its amazing. They change.
One disciple in Sydney, Judy, was a businesswoman. She ran a very good import export business. There was a very lucrative contract with a big firm in London that she really wanted to get. So she flew all the way across the world to London from Sydney. If youre a businessperson, you dont have time to get over jet lag. As soon as she got off the plane, she went to meet the board and CEO of that firm. The board directors met her, and said, Youve wasted your time. The CEO is a very hard man even in best of times. Today hes come in a terrible mood. Hes been shouting at us all morning. Theres no way in the world hes going to sign your contract. Go back home and come back next month.
But fortunately she knew a bit of Buddhism. So she decided to do a bit of metta (loving-kindness) meditation. She only had five minutes, but did it quietly in the corner of a room. When she heard the CEO was about to come in, she went out and met him. He was indeed in a foul mood. Murderous! Psychopathic! But here is what this disciple did  Im so proud of her. She said she hadnt planned it, it just came out of her mouth, but she told the CEO, Youve got such beautiful blue eyes, just like my daughter Holly. The CEO melted. All the anger drained out of him and he said, Oh, really The contract was signed in half an hour. All the directors said, Teach us how you did this. Whats the secret
It was amazing what she did. The CEO was so stressed out, but she saw something beautiful in him. Something so simple. Just blue eyes. Because she was looking for beauty, she saw it. And when she saw beauty in him, he saw it in himself.
So whatever you look for, the other person shows you that. If you look for faults. Theyll show you faults. And more faults. If you look for their beauty and kindness, they will show you that back. And more.
Life is not what happens to us, but the way we look at it, ourselves, our partner, our messes in life. Remember that dog poo is fertilizer. Say, Im so lucky! when you step in some. Scrape it off, dig it in, and grow from it. But remember you learn more from your successes. Whatever worked, repeat it. Never underestimate what you can learn from your successes.

Air Force aiming for a better display: Meet the  rugby clubs
Sri Lanka Air Force Sports Club is an A Division rugby union team, based in Ratmalana.
In 1961 Air Force SC together with Division B teams from Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and University were permitted to play alongside the Division A clubs in the Clifford Cup competition, which was changed whereby all thirteen clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1972 they were promoted to the Division A, Sri Lanka Rugby Championship and by 1975 captained by Shanthi Mendis, Air Force SC were victorious in 12 out of 16 games at the end of the season entering the final of the Clifford Cup before losing to Army SC in a close game by
3-4.Two years later in 1977 led by scrum half Ronald Rodrigo, they once again made the final, ultimately losing to Havelock SC. During the 1980s Air Force SC produced a number of well-known rugby players including scrum half Tikiri Marambe, number eight Nalin de Silva, flanker
Harsha Fernando, second row forwards Lofty Perera, Rex Anthony and stand-off Tony Wimalasuriya.
In 1986 Air Force SC captained by Lakshman Caldera won their first Clifford Cup, defeating League champions Police SC in the final with a score of 10 points to 8.
In 1990, the Air Force SC had to withdraw from the game due to the Second Eelam War. The clubs rugby revival took place in 1995 under their coach late Uddaka Tennakoon, after an absence of four years. Air Force SC won the plate championship for three consecutive years in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The club was the runners up in the Rugby Sevens championship three times in 2006, 2008 and 2010 and In the Clifford Cup knock-out tournament final in 2010 the Airmen gave a sensational display although losing 24-27 to Kandy at Bogambara under the guidance of Inthi Marikkar their dedicated coach.
Incidentally last season they created the shock of the league by beating Kandy SC in their first leg match played at Ratmalana. Air Force Sports Club is expected to fly high this season under former national coach, Kingswoodian Ronnie Ibrahim as their head coach for the upcoming 2017/18 inter-club rugby season.
Ibrahim has already been impressed by the energy, enthusiasm and the passion his chargers are showing towards the game. He noted these factors as the reasons behind his decision to take up this coaching assignment with Sri Lanka Air Force.
This season the Airmen will be captained by experienced hardy prop forward Pushpakumara Samarahewa.
There are few new faces turning out for Air Force this season bringing in CR, CH and Police cracking third row forward Radeesha Seneviratne (Brother in law of famous Air Force and Sri Lanka centre Charith Seneviratne) where he will be most probably occupy the important position of number eight and St. Anthonys College Kandys burly centre Jehan Seelagama, who will be making his club rugby debut this season, where he is most likely to be in the starting lineup for the Airmen.
Air men will come out for the first time this season against CR & FC on 05th of November at Air force grounds in Ratmalana at 4.00pm.

All Blacks face Springboks in World Cup opener
TOKYO, Thursday: Favourites New Zealand will begin their quest for a third successive Rugby World Cup title with a heavyweight clash against South Africa at the 2019 tournament in Japan.
The All Blacks are scheduled to face their old southern hemisphere foes in Yokohama on September 21, a day after hosts Japan kick off the competition against European qualifiers, likely to be Romania, organisers announced in Tokyo on Thursday.
"We are really excited to meet New Zealand first up," said South Africa head coach Allister Coetzee.
"There is a great and proud rivalry between the Springboks and All Blacks and this opening group match is bound to be another massive contest."
Speaking from Twickenham ahead of the All Blacks' Saturday clash with the Barbarians, New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen said: "I half expected it."
"It's a good way to start the tournament. It's something to look forward to.
"The tournament wants to get off to a bang, so why not play the two (big teams in the first match)"
France, drawn in the so-called "Group of Death" alongside England and Argentina, also open their campaign on September 21 with a key Pool C fixture against the Pumas in Tokyo.
Title contenders England take on Tonga in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo -- at the venue where a David Beckham penalty beat Argentina at the 2002 football World Cup -- the following day.
Two-time champions Australia face a potentially tricky opener against Fiji in Pool D, where rivals Wales open against Georgia.
"We kick off against Georgia before facing Australia, both of whom we play this November in Cardiff," said Wales head coach Warren Gatland.
"We then have a good block of time before facing Fiji in Oita. We have four cities to visit so it is important we buy into the culture of Japan and the tournament."
Matches will be played at 12 venues including Kamaishi in northeast Japan, which was ravaged by the 2011 tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster.
England's hopes of knocking the mighty All Blacks off their perch were complicated by a horror draw earlier this year.
The Six Nations champions, who two years ago became the first World Cup hosts not to reach the knock-out stage, take on the United States in Kobe after tough-tackling Tonga.
England then face huge back-to-back games against 2015 World Cup semi-finalists Argentina in Tokyo on October 5 and bitter rivals France in Yokohama a week later to complete a devilishly tricky bracket.
England have a mixed World Cup record against three-time finalists France, their last meeting a quarter-final defeat in 2011. They have won both of their World Cup games so far against Argentina, but the swashbuckling Pumas are capable of beating anyone on their day.
"Our aim is to win the World Cup and support for the team will be an important factor," said England head coach Eddie Jones.
"We hope to see as many England fans as possible getting behind us in Japan as we try to achieve our ultimate goal."
New Zealand remain the team to beat, however, and Hansen's world champions look to have an easy run to the quarter-finals after their blockbusting Pool B opener.
The All Blacks famously lost to South Africa in the 1995 final but have won their last two World Cup meetings, including the 2015 semi-final at Twickenham.
New Zealand will avoid England, France or Argentina in the quarter-finals, beginning on October 19, with two of the Group C trio set to collide with the top two in Group D, widely expected to be Australia and Wales.
"No matter where or when we've got to be ready for it," Wallabies coach Michael Cheika told local media.
"We don't need to know now what the colour of the grass is."
Hosts Japan face difficult games against Ireland in Shizuoka and Scotland in Yokohama as the Brave Blossoms look to defy the odds and reach the knockout phase for the first time.
Already 15 teams have qualified for the 2019 World Cup, with a further five to be determined via regional qualifiers or repechages.  AFP

Short of match fitness
Asela, Kusal overlooked for Test series against India
Batting all-rounder Asela Gunaratne and wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera have been left out of the 15-member Sri Lanka Test squad picked for the three-Tests against India starting at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on November 16 due to match fitness.
The Lankan squad was picked yesterday and has been sent for ratification by the Minister of Sports.
Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne and Kusal Perera all passed the yoyo and skinfold tests but as Asela and Kusal were short of match fitness we did not select them, said chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy.
They will probably be considered for the one-day series that starts on December 10 as they will be able to play in the Under 23 tournament that is due to commence shortly and prove their match fitness, he said.
Each team in the Under 23 tournament is able to field at least five senior players in their side.
Kusal Perera suffers from a hamstring injury during Sri Lankas record run chase against India at the Oval in June.
Perera has not played any cricket since the ICC Champions trophy in June where he picked up a hamstring injury while guiding Sri Lanka to a stunning seven-wicket over India at the Oval with an innings of 47 before retiring hurt.
Gunaratne fractured the base of his left thumb attempting to take a catch in the slips offered by Indian opener Sikhar Dhawan during the first Test at Galle in July and has not played any cricket since.
The Sri Lanka team is due to leave for India on October 8.
NO APPROVAL WITHOUT FITNESS TEST REPORT
In another new development Labrooy stated that all the teams selected and sent to the Minister of Sports for ratification should have the fitness test report (ie the yoyo and skinfold tests) attached against the names of each and every player selected.
This was a directive we received from the Sports Minister to prove that the individual selected is declared physically fit. Without the report the Minister would not accept the names. We have been following this procedure since we picked the teams for the series against Pakistan, said Labrooy.
The Minister it is reliably learnt will be expanding this fitness test report procedure to all other sports from January 1, 2018.

China - Sri Lanka diplomatic relations strengthened
Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana met Chinas Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi,in China. The discussions between the two Ministers focused on longstanding China-Sri Lanka relations, and hopes for future strengthening of cooperation and friendship.
Foreign Minister Marapana is currently in Beijing, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Yi, to attend the celebrations of the 60th Anniversary of diplomatic relations and 65th Anniversary of economic relations between Sri Lanka and China.
At their meeting, the two Ministers remarked positively on the two key anniversaries, which they saw as an indication of the strong and traditional friendship between the two countries, and a good foundation for continued growth in the future.

Commissioners berate SASG Dappula de Livera
The Bond Commissioners yesterday reprimanded Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera, for questioning the Commissions order and the way in which he was behaving.
The Commissioners pointed out that his behaviour is unbecoming for a senior counsel.
Commissioners, Justices Prasanna Jayawardena and K.T. Chitrasiri both said that in their lengthy careers, they have never seen such unbecoming conduct and also said that they have never witnessed anybody who kept making submissions following an order was made.
Several officers of the Criminal Investigation Department testified before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday. These officers were assisting the Treasury Bond Commission for its investigations during its mandate period.
A heated argument erupted as the Attorney Generals panel who was leading evidence moved to mark the statements recorded by these CID officers from witnesses, as evidence before the Commission.
Counsel Chanaka de Silva who represents former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran, raised an objection to this move. I will strenuously object to this.The Commission opted to call witnesses to give evidence before the Commission. The Commission is acting on the evidence given before this Commission. A statement made in front of a police officer is not evidence. Nowhere in our legal system is a statement made to a police officer considered as evidence.
I wish to object the process of marking these statements as evidence.
Most of these statements were available at the time these witnesses gave evidence before the Commission.
These statements should have been either put to them, shown to them or contradicted. But none of the witnesses were shown these statements. De Silva said.
In terms of law, a statement made before a police officer can only be used when contradicting evidence given by a witness. That was not done. In addition to that, there are statements apparently recorded from persons who have not given evidence before this commission. What is the situation then De Silva questioned.
Commission Chairman, Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri said that the Commission has seriously taken note of De Silvas objection.
Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena said that in his view SASG De Liveras submission has no merit. He also said, I am sure your words will be appropriately reported by media.We are not interested in what newspapers report. We are interested in doing our job of work. And at the end to write a report.
Counsel De Silva also pointed out that Once these statements are marked it becomes evidence. And furthered saying; This is like sanctioning our entire system of law. What is the situation with regards to witnesses who have never given evidence before this Commission Once their statements are marked before the Commission, they go in as evidence! He also pointed out that these materials were not made available to them.So marking statements as evidence is alien to our system of law and system of justice. he said.
It was also observed that marking of these statements goes against the rules of evidence in the Evidence Ordinance and the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Presidents Council Kalinga Indatissa also observed that marking the statements recorded by police officers as evidence is against the rules of natural justice.
At this point Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who was leading evidence observed that the Commission which is in a process of ascertaining the truth, and in fact can accept these statements recorded by police officers as material of the investigation.
The PCoI is established to ascertain the truth. For the purpose of ascertaining the truth, there are two mechanisms to a Commission of Inquiry. The first is the process of investigation, second mechanism is inquiring.We are currently going through inquiry.The process that took place two halls away from this hall done by these officers was investigation.In the 2008 amendment to the Commission of Inquiry Act, there is specific reference to both investigative tool and the inquiry tool. In order to look into truth the Commission can accept evidence lead before the Commission as well as materials collected during the course of the investigation, ASG Kodagoda observed. He also read a verbatim in paragraph 7 section A of the Commissions of inquiry Act supporting his observation.
ASG Kodagoda further said that If someone is alleging that while as witnesses, these officers have intimidated them or used force to make statements in a particular manner, this is an opportunity to cross examine the relevant officers.
It was reported last week that a Central Bank official filing a fundamental rights petition has sought the Supreme Court to prevent him from being questioned by Attorney Generals Department officers assisting the Bond Commission until the final determination of his petition.
Following ASG Kodagodas remark, Counsel De Silva stood to state that This Commission should not be used as a platform to answer allegations made elsewhere.This is like washing linen of others. Then Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera rose to say that We are not washing others linen. We know when and where to do it.
He also pointed out that the Commission is mandated to examine the materials collected in the course of investigation and accordingly can accept the submissions to mark the said documents.
The Commission observed that some persons have given statements to both the police and the Commission. It also observed that such persons were not shown or cross examined on their statements before the Commission when they testified. The tribunal was of the view that such action was against the rule of natural justice. Therefore following all the submissions made by the counsels, the Commission made the order that marking of these statements to be unacceptable.
Speaking of the order SASG De Livera rhetorically observed that This commission by this order has prevented itself from looking at investigative materials.
My position is that the commission is making a mockery of this proceeding by preventing itself from looking at these investigative materials. CID officers IP I. Raban, IP Nalinda Herath, Sergeant Mahinda Soma Jayathilake and Sergeant Siril Ranasinghe testified before the Commission.
The Commission is to sit on November 16, 2017 again.

EU delegates urge PTA repeal
Sri Lanka is making progress on the promises that brought the country back into the European Unions GSP+ tax benefit program, EU representatives said in Colombo yesterday.
We have seen a number of positive changes, said MEP Jean Lambert, the chair of the delegation to South Asia, such as the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons.
But Lambert emphasized that Sri Lanka should immediately repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the law that allows the government to hold people suspected of terrorist links without charges.
Were very disappointed to see that we have still not got change on the statute books, she said.
There are still people detained under the PTA, some of whom have been detained for a considerable number of years, she added. Wed like to see those cases reviewed, and people either charged or released.
Membership to GSP+ relies on developing countries upholding 27 international conventions on civic, human,labour, and environmental rights. The trade relationship allows Sri Lanka to pay lower duties on exports to the EU.
Sri Lanka lost its GSP+ membership in 2010 after UN investigations found serious human rights violations during the war.
Though Lambert said repealing the PTA is a key issue for the European Parliament, she said that a full reporting review on Sri Lankas status would not happen for another two years.
Momentum cannot be lost, she said. This process needs to be seen to be moving.
Regarding long-term membership to GSP+, we want it to work, she said.

Fishery community will not be in debt trap: Amaraweera
Since most housing projects make people indebted to banks, the Fisheries Ministry will never place the fishery community in a debt trap. As such, the Ministry will grant Rs. 350,000 to each family to build a permanent house and Rs. 100,000 to complete a half-complete home, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister made this observation at a ceremony held at the Nonagama Cultural Centre to mark the distribution of Rs. 33.9 million as housing assistance among 339 fishery families in Hambantota district.
A consignment of 26 boats and 23 containers were also distributed at this ceremony, where Rs. 30,000 each was distributed among another 50 families to uplift domestic sanitary facilities.
The Minister said owning a house is a dream come true for each and every family. Since he assumed office, he had directed Ministry officials to conduct a census on fishery families living in shanties without proper sanitation facilities in their homes, to assist them with financial grants to overcome their housing problems.
According to the statistics compiled by them, 30,000 fishery families lacked proper sanitation facilities. As such, the Ministry would grant Rs. 30,000 to each family to fulfill this shortcoming in their homes.

No more an MPSC upholds CA judgementRuling to be conveyed to Secretary General of Parliament
The Supreme Court five-judge-Bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday unanimously ruled that Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship.
The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment dated May 3 and its order in the nature of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament. Accordingly, the appeal filed by Geetha Kumarasinghe was dismissed with cost. The registrar of Supreme Court was directed that this order be sent to the Secretary General of Parliament forthwith.
The judgment was delivered by Supreme Court Judge Sisira de Abrew, who was a member of five-judge-Bench which heard the appeal.
The judgment had been approved by four other judges Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera.
When I consider the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliament Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country on the day of Parliament election or on the day of taking oaths as a Member of Parliament (MP), he/she cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as an MP is a nullity, Justice Abrew observed.
After taking oaths as a MP, if he/she becomes a citizen of any other country or continues to be a citizen of any other country, he/she too cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as a Member of Parliament is nullity Justice Abrew added.
I have earlier held that Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified to be elected as an MP on August 17, 2015 that she was not qualified to take oaths as MP on September 1, 2015. Thus, a writ of Quo Warranto is available to oust her from MP position. The Supreme Court affirms the Court of Appeal judgment and dismisses the appeal with cost.
Delivering its judgement on the Writ Petition filed by five residents of Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment.
On May 15, a divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench had granted special leave to appeal with the petition filed by Mrs. Kumarasinghe.
On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage to intervene into the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
In his petition, former MP Piyasena Gamage observed that Interim Order granted to Geetha Kumarasinghe should be set aside or vacated as the intervenient petition had not been named as a respondent.
The Chief Justice had nominated a fuller Bench comprising five judges of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
In this appeal petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L.Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Secretary General of Parliament and several others as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Counsel Sugath Caldera appeared for MP Geetha Kumarasinghe. Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna, Faisz Musthapha PC, Chandaka Jayasundara PC and Pulasthi Rupasinghe appeared on behalf of the respondents.
Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle with Senior State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appeared for the Secretary General of Parliament and Controller of Immigration and Emigration. Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for intervenient petitioner Piyasena Ranasinghe.

The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has introduced a 24-hour hotline - 1921 - for the public to obtain information and to make complaints, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau Chairman Attorney-at-law Nimal Bopage said.
Addressing a press conference at the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said the public can obtain any information through the hotline and also forward complaints. This is the only state institution which does not take a cent from the Treasury but instead gives several millions to the Treasury annually. There are around 300 other state institutions that take around Rs. 200 or 300 million annually from the Treasury for their survival, he said.
According to the Chairman, this year, it is expected to increase the funds given to the Treasury by the Bureau to Rs. 5,000 million. The Bureau has 16 provincial officers at present and it is expected to open one office in each district before the end of this year.
The issuance of licences is getting delayed due to the involvement of other state bodies. The applicant must obtain approval from those state bodies.
Deputy Director (Mines) Eng. D. Sajjana de Silva said annually around 100,000 licences are issued for various purposes by the Bureau. Out of this number, around 6,000 are issued for sand mining and transportation. Illegal sand mining and transportation (without a licence) is around 30 percent.

Is healthcare leadership geared to achieve sustainable development goals
The College of Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka (CMASL) is the largest collection of healthcare leaders of the government and private health sectors, armed forces and the police service. The college celebrates its Silver Jubilee this year and its Annual Scientific Sessions is held from November 3 to 5 in Colombo.
The theme of the sessions is Healthcare Leadership to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. This is a very appropriate and timely theme as the world has shifted its development agenda from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from 2015. Sustainable development meets the development of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs.
SDGs set the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, meant to transform the world as agreed upon by all the member countries at the United Nations (UN) Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiroin 2012 and adopted in 2015 at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs are a universal call of action to end poverty, to protect the planet and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They tackle the root causes of poverty and unite nations together to make a positive change for people and planet. They consist of 17 goals,169 targets and 244 indicators.
Sri Lanka has shown its commitment by establishing a separate ministry on Sustainable Development, appointing a Parliament Select Committee and establishing Cluster Committees on SDGs.
The SDGs not only consolidate roles that healthcare leaders could play in improving health outcomes, but also promote human rights, accountability, innovations, political commitment, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.
Leadership could be defined as the ability to influence the members of society or an organisation to get the support of (its members) in the accomplishment of a common task.
Collectively working towards achieving the SDGs is an important common task that needs to be accomplished at global and country levels. Our own healthcare leadership should be geared to achieve the SDGs by year 2030.
It is already been understood globally that there should be real healthcare leaders, not managers, as drivers of the SDGs.
Individuals those who have the right leadership orientation, skills and competencies should be tasked with the assignment of ensuring effective take-off, implementation, evaluation and reporting of the SDGs. Healthcare leaders of Sri Lanka must be able to influence the society and dominate even other sectors in achieving these imperative SDGs, as change agents as well as catalysts, and yet these influences should be brought about with compassion and with empathy. That is the challenge that healthcare leaders will face in the coming decade.
The College of Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka surely, would enable its membership in developing their leadership qualities and competencies in achieving the SDGs.

Jayasuriya, Aponso guide Sri Lanka A to two-wicket win
JAMAICA, Wednesday: Slow left-arm orthodox bowler Amila Aponso was named man of the match after picking up three crucial wickets and then helping Sri Lanka A score the crucial 32 runs for the ninth wicket to squeeze out a two-wicket win over West Indies A in the first unofficial ODI played at Sabina Park here on Wednesday.
In a low scoring game West Indies A winning the toss and batting first were bowled out for 176 in 48.4 overs with left-arm spinners Aponso and Malinda Pushpakumara making inroads into the batting after openers Montcin Hodge and John Campbell had posted 67 in 18.1 overs.
That was the only substantial partnership of the innings as West Indies A struggled to cope with the spinners. Hodge made a top score of 54 off 69 balls.
Aponso took three middle order wickets for 34 runs after Pushpakumara had dismissed the two openers.
Pacemen Lahiru Kumara and Chamika Karunaratne ran through the lower order taking five wickets between them.
Sri Lanka A in their reply didnt have things their own way as they lost half the side for 83 before a stand of 35 between Karunaratne (14) and Charith Asalanka (33) carried them to 118-6. But West Indies A kept on taking wickets and when the eighth wicket fell at 149 in the 44th over were in with a chance of pulling off a win.
However Shehan Jayasuriya joined by Aponso denied West Indies A of any further success as they guided Sri Lanka A to victory.
Jayasuriya was unbeaten on 31 off 36 balls and Aponso 16 off 13 balls that included a six and a four.
West Indies A 176 in 48.4 overs (M Hodge 54, R Cornwall 37, Lahiru Kumara 3/26, Amila Aponso 3/34, Chamika Karunaratne 2/36, Malinda Pushpakumara 2/35)

The Joint Opposition which follows the tradition of opposing everything that the government does is now creating an unnecessary panic among the ordinary people over the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, UNP Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Thushara Indunil Amarasena said.
To do that, they have selected some sensitive topics such as religion, nationality and patriotism. Everybody loves their country, religion and race. So they are trying to fulfill their narrow political purposes by levelling baseless allegations regarding this Interim Report, said the MP.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha, yesterday.
Some leaders who raise their voice against this report outside Parliament, have not yet spoken a single word at the debate which is ongoing in Parliament, he charged.
He said the UNP is confident of victory at the upcoming local government election and there is no need to join another party to compete the election. Commenting on a statement made by Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara at this weeks Cabinet media briefing, claiming that the SLFP had not yet taken a decision to compete the local government election jointly with the UNP under one symbol, the MP said the UNP does not want to form any Hansa Puttu (Pair of Swans) hereafter.
He further charged that Minister Susil Premajayanth is now acting a double role with the intention of getting his son free from corruption charges.

"The President's and the Prime Minister's vision about the career opportunities for 10 lakhs youth is becoming a success step by step. As the second step of this, many Employment Organizations are to be constructed in Hambantota, by early 2018" said MP and Deputy Leader of ACMC M. H. M. Navavi.
He made this statement while addressing the Job Fair, which had been organized by the District Secretariat under the guidance of the Parliamentarian, on November 1 morning at Puttalam District Secretariat auditorium. The Parliamentarian attended as the Chief Guest of this event.
The event had a massive participation including Puttalam District Assistant Secretary E. A. T. M. Athukorala, Puttalam Assistant Divisional Secretary Sampath Weerasekara, Puttalam District Career Guidance Officer Sujeewa Manjanayaka, the ACMC Youth Organizer Iflal Ameen, other high officials, and many Youth from Puttalam and Vanathavillu divisions.
"Nowadays many of us expect government jobs and teaching. But we hesitate to enter into the job opportunities that are available in the private sectors. But now, private sectors provide many offers than the government. Also in the private sectors, we can get a vast knowledge and experience. Therefore, the youth should come forward to seek job opportunities in the private sectors too" Navavi said.
"The Chinese, Indians and Pakistanis have understood the value of Sri Lanka and they have come here to do a job. But our Sri Lankans fly to the countries like Saudi Arabia, Italy, for just Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 75,000. Rather than travelling far away from our home country, we can work in the private sectors, may be in a different town but inside our Motherland," the Parliamentarian added.
Many Youth from Puttalam and Vanathavillu divisions participated at the Job Fair.Pictures By: M. U. M. Sanoon Puttalam TKN Corr

Last debt paid
The Venerable Sariputta then, accompanied by the bhikkhus, went up to the terrace of the house and entered his birth chamber. After seating himself, he asked the bhikkhus to go to their quarters. They had hardly left, when a grave illness, dysentery, fell upon the Elder, and he felt severe pains. When one pail was brought in, another was carried out. The brahman lady thought: "The news of my son is not good," and she stood leaning by the door of her own room.
Arahant Sariputta is a famous name in Buddhist literature among a few others: Moggallana, his colleague and Ananda, the Buddhas chief assistant. Sariputtas story starts in a village of brahmins, being born to Sari in Upatissa village. The brahmin priests named him after his hometown Upatissa.
Although Sariputta later became a monk followed by his siblings, his mother could never know the Buddhas teachings.
Bhikkhu Nanamoli describes a full length picture of Arahant Sariputta according to the Pali Canons. Where the arahant converts his mother is named as Last Debt Paid. Excerpts:
During his journey the Venerable Sariputta spent one night wherever he stopped, and thus for one week he favored many people with a last sight of him. Reaching Nalaka village in the evening, he stopped near a banyan tree at the village gate. It happened that at the time a nephew of the elder, Uparevata by name, had gone outside the village and there he saw the Venerable Sariputta. He approached the elder, saluted him, and remained standing.
The Elder asked him: "Is your grand-aunt at home"
"Yes, venerable sir," he replied.
"Then go and announce our coming," said the Elder. "And if she asks why I have come, tell her that I shall stay in the village for one day, and ask her to prepare my birth chamber and provide lodgings for five hundred bhikkhus."
Uparevata went to his grand-aunt and said: "Grandaunt, my uncle has come."
"Where is he now" she asked.
"At the village gate."
"Is he alone, or has someone else come with him"
"He has come with five hundred bhikkhus."
And when she asked him, "Why has he come" he gave her the message the elder had entrusted to him. Then she thought: "Why does he ask me to provide lodgings for so many After becoming a monk in his youth, does he want to be a layman again in his old age" But she arranged the birth chamber for the Elder and lodgings for the bhikkhus, had torches lit and then sent for the Elder. The Venerable Sariputta then, accompanied by the bhikkhus, went up to the terrace of the house and entered his birth chamber. After seating himself, he asked the bhikkhus to go to their quarters. They had hardly left, when a grave illness, dysentery, fell upon the Elder, and he felt severe pains. When one pail was brought in, another was carried out. The brahman lady thought: "The news of my son is not good," and she stood leaning by the door of her own room. And then it happened, the text tells us, that the Four Great Divine Kings asked themselves: "Where may he now be dwelling, the Marshal of the Law" And they perceived that he was at Nalaka, in his birth chamber, lying on the bed of his Final Passing Away. "Let us go for a last sight of him," they said.
When they reached the birth chamber, they saluted the Elder and remained standing.
"Who are you" asked the Elder.
"We are the Great Divine Kings, venerable sir."
"Why have you come"
"We want to attend on you during your illness."
"Let it be!" said the Venerable Sariputta. "There is an attendant here. You may go."
When they had left, there came in the same manner Sakka the king of the gods, and after him, Maha Brahma, and all of them the elder dismissed in the same way.
The brahman lady, seeing the coming and going of these deities, asked herself: "Who could they have been, who came and paid homage to my son, and then left" And she went to the door of the elder's room and asked the Venerable Cunda for news about the Elder's condition. Cunda conveyed the inquiry to the Elder, telling him: "The Great Upasika (lay devotee) has come."
The Venerable Sariputta asked her: "Why have you come at this unusual hour"
"To see you, dear," she replied. "Tell me, who were those who came first"
"The Four Great Divine Kings, upasika."
"Are you, then, greater than they" she asked. "They are like temple attendants," said the Elder. "Ever since our Master took rebirth they have stood guard over him with swords in hand."
"After they had left, who was it that came then, dear"
"It was Sakka the king of the gods."
"Are you then, greater than the king of gods, dear"
"He is like a novice who carries a bhikkhu's belongings," answered Sariputta. "When our Master returned from the heaven of the Thirty-three (Tavatimsa), Sakka took his bowl and robe and descended to earth together with him."
"And when Sakka had gone, who was it that came after him, filling the room with his radiance"
"Upasika, that was your own Lord and Master, the Great Brahma."
"Then are you greater, my son, even than my Lord, the Great Brahma"
"Yes, Upasika. On the day when our Master was born, it is said that four Great Brahmas received the Great Being in a golden net." Upon hearing this, the brahman lady thought: "If my son's power is such as this, what must be the majestic power of my son's Master and Lord" And while she was thinking this, suddenly the fivefold rapture arose in her, suffusing her entire body.
The Elder thought: "Rapture and joy have arisen in my mother. Now is the time to preach the Dhamma to her." And he said: "What was it you were thinking about, upasika"
"I was thinking," she replied, "if my son has such virtue, what must be the virtue of his Master"
The Venerable Sariputta answered: "At the moment of my Master's birth, at his Great Renunciation (of worldly life), on his attaining Enlightenment and at his first turning of the Dhamma Wheel  on all these occasions the ten thousand world-system quaked and shook. None is there who equals him in virtue, in concentration, in wisdom, in deliverance, and in the knowledge and vision of deliverance." And he then explained to her in detail the words of homage: "Such indeed is that Blessed One..." (Iti pi so Bhagava...). And thus he gave her an exposition of the Dhamma, basing it on the virtues of the Buddha.
When the Dhamma talk given by her beloved son had come to an end, the brahman lady was firmly established in the Fruition of stream-entry, and she said: "Oh, my dear Upatissa, why did you act like that Why, during all these years, did you not bestow on me this ambrosia (the knowledge of the Deathless)"
The Elder thought: "Now I have given my mother, the brahman lady Rupa-Sari, the nursing-fee for bringing me up. This should suffice." and he dismissed her with the words: "You may go now, upasika."
When she was gone, he asked: "What is the time now, Cunda"
"Venerable sir, it is early dawn."
And the Elder said: "Let the community of bhikkhus assemble."
When the bhikkhus had assembled, he said to Cunda: "Lift me up to a sitting position, Cunda." And Cunda did so.
Then the Elder spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: "For forty-four years I have lived and traveled with you, my brethren. If any deed or word of mine was unpleasant to you, forgive me, brethren."
And they replied: "Venerable sir, not the least displeasure has ever come from you to us, who followed you inseparably like your shadow. But may you, venerable sir, grant forgiveness to us!"
After that the Elder gathered his large robe around him, covered his face and lay down on his right side. Then, just as the Master was to do at his Maha Parinibbana, he entered into the nine successive attainments of meditation, in forward and reverse order, and beginning again with the first absorption he led his meditation up to the fourth absorption. And at the moment after he had entered it, just as the crest of the rising sun appeared over the horizon, he utterly passed away into the Nibbana-element which is without any remnant of clinging. And it was the full-moon day of the month Kattika, which by the solar calendar is between October and November.
The brahman lady in her room thought: "How is my son he does not say anything." She rose, and going into the Elder's room she massaged his legs. Then, seeing that he had passed away, she fell at his feet, loudly lamenting; "O my dear son! Before this, we did not know of your virtue. Because of that, we did not gain the good fortune to have seated in this house, and to feed, many a hundred bhikkhus! We did not gain the good fortune to have built many monasteries!" And she lamented thus up to sunrise.
As soon as the sun was up, she sent for goldsmiths and had the treasure room opened and had the pots full of gold weighed on a large scale. Then she gave the gold to the goldsmiths with the order to prepare funeral ornaments. Columns and arches were erected, and in the center of the village the upasika had a pavilion of heart-wood built. In the middle of the pavilion a large, gabled structure was raised, surrounded by a parapet wall of golden arches and columns. Then they began the sacred ceremony, in which men and deities mingled.
After the great assembly of people had celebrated the sacred rites for a full week, they made a pyre with many kinds of fragrant woods. They placed the body of the Venerable Sariputta on the pyre and kindled the wood with bundles of Usira roots. Throughout the night of the cremation the concourse listened to sermons on the Dhamma. After that the flames of the pyre were extinguished by the Elder Anuruddha with scented water. The Elder Cunda gathered together the relics and placed them in a filter cloth.

The Message of Universal compassion
Charatha Bhikkawe Charikang, BahujanaHithaya, Bahujana Sukhaya, Lokanukampaya, Aththaya Hithaya Sukhaya Devamanussanang.
After attaining enlightenment Sakyamuni Gautama Buddha proceeded to Saranath and preached his first sermon to the five ascetics.
Later Yasakulaputra and his 55 disciples too listened to his sermons with utmost faith and attained Arahantship.
Realising that there were now sufficient disciples to start the pioneer movement for the propagation of the Dhamma, he addressed the 60 Arahants to fulfil the sansaric tour for the wellbeing of the mankind.
The Buddha said Go forth Bhikkus into the world taking the message to them, explain to them what I have explained for the well-being of the majority, for the solace of the majority, show them how one could be of service to all divine and human beings.
It was on Il full moon day that 60 disciples were sent in different directions on this great mission to spread the doctrine.
Great Mission
Having accomplished that task, the Buddha himself set out for the city of Rajagaha where on his way he met hermit monks the three brothers  Uruwela Kashyapa, Nadi and Gaya Kashyapa with their retinue at Uruwela Grama. They had all been miraculously won over by the Buddha helping them to attain arahantship after the deliverance of Aaditta-PariyaSutta. The Buddha with his supreme gift of Dhamma dispelled their version and taught them the Buddhist approach to life.
Bosat Maithriya
Another major event of this Poya is the receipt of permission (NiyathaVivarana) by Bosat Maithriya to be the next enlightened one. A wealthy Buddhist in Sankassapura known as Siriwardana had entered the order as Bhikku Ariya Maithriya offered his new robes to Sakyamuni on his arrival at Sonkassapura. The Buddha with his divine and insight predicted that he will be born as the next Buddha and he proclaimed it to the world for the benefit of generations to come. He is the best person to protect and foster the doctrine - Dhamma and disseminate it to the entire globe. Hence the emergence of the future Buddha was a signal for the Buddhists to have hope and await the great occasion.
Parinibhana of SariyuthThera
This poya is also related to the attainment of Sotapanna by Rupasara Matha, the mother of Ven. Sariputta Thera. His entire family had been pure Buddhists except the mother who was ignorant of true Dhamma Ven. Sariputta erudite and eminent scholar due his esteem in the Sasana was determined to come to her rescue on her death bed which he did before his Parinibhana. Thus the foremost disciple of the Buddha, fulfilled his duty by the mother and finally passed into Parinibhana which is said to have taken place on this day.
End of Vassana
Il Poya is rather the climax of the Vassana season which culminates in the Katina Cheevara Puja believed to be the highest merit bestowing ceremony in the Buddha Sasana. Further the practice of observing Vassana continues to this day as the fulfilment of a disciplinary requirement as instructed by the Buddha. The Vassana season comes to a close with the Katinanusasana delivered as the final event on the day of the Katina Pooja.
This plays a very significant role in lay life as well as giving them the unique opportunity to follow Dhamma to their hearts content. Dhamma have rakkatiDhammachari.

MR says, honestly engaged in Constitutional process
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said his party had honestly engaged in the new Constitutional process and expects national unity and religious harmony through it.
He said this in Parliament yesterday, joining the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional reforms, held for the fourth consecutive day.
We joined this Constitutional process most honestly. Ending the war was also instrumental in establishing reconciliation according to a proper plan.
We engaged in the various committees. In fact when this was initiated we had our suspicions, but we did not destabilise the process but supported it.
We did this for the sake of the country and the people. We expect this constitution to be one that unites the people and creates reconciliation and religious harmony, he added.
However, he said that while they had discussed and forwarded certain views and suggestions, these were omitted when the report was presented. Yet, we still did not oppose the government and we still supported them despite the manner in which we were treated.
He said attention should be paid to the clause determining that demarcation of boundaries would be handed over to an international entity. This, he said is not a wise move and should be reconsidered.
Pointing out that there is considerable doubt and distrust regarding the constitution and therefore this would not be an opportune moment to bring in a new Constitution, Rajapaksa said, urging the government to allow all to use their vote in accordance with their inner conscience.

Much ado about nothing
The discourse in the country about the proposed new Constitution has garnered more rhetoric than serious content. It is more speculation than analysis.
The main allegation of the Opposition to the Constitutional reform process is that a new Constitution would divide of bifurcate Sri Lanka. However, the country would not break up on its own as it is not a physical division but a political one that is meant. Politics means human action, deliberate planning and execution of some action. Hence, the question who will break up Sri Lanka
It is alleged that the international community, particularly the Western powers are conspiring to divide Sri Lanka. There are nearly 300 States in the world and all of them accept the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. In other words they are against its division. This fact is reiterated in numerous ways in the course of trade and diplomatic activity.
Standing Committee of the Constitutional Council
If they wanted to divide our country they could have done so easily during the 30 year-old fratricidal war. Instead all the major regional and world power supported the Government in the war. For example, it is on record that the United States, France, Russia, China, India helped the war effort in many ways. The LTTE was proscribed in India, the United States, Canada and the European Union among others. In some of these countries the proscription still remains valid.
In todays globalized world no State could exist in isolation. For a separate State to be viable in Sri Lanka at least one regional or world power should recognize it. Such a possibility does not exist. Contrary to the speculation by certain chauvinist forces, India would never accept any Tamil Eelam in its southern tip. Internally, there is no political movement in the country that call for division of the country. Hence, the talk about the threat of division is much ado about nothing. It is further so in view of the fact that still there is no Constitutional draft. What is in the public view is a report of the Standing Committee of the Constitutional Council, which has all views presented (but not approved) by it. To confuse a document for discussion with a final report is not only wrong but also, in this case, mischievous.
Then why is this allegation brought forward Obviously, it is to arouse communal hatred and use it to gain support from the majority community, in an effort to wrest back power. It is a project by defeatist politicians. No wonder the former President has taken the leadership of these power-hungry opportunist forces.
They are advocating hegemony for the Sinhala Buddhists. However, no nation which oppresses another could be free. It leads to national disunity and communal clashes, a situation likely to cause external intervention.
To substantiate their allegation against the proposed Constitution they say that it does away with the clauses in the present Constitution that gives foremost place to Buddhism. It is fiction since no final draft yet exists. In other words, it is based not on facts but on mere suspicion.
Even the British colonialists pledged to give the foremost place to Buddhism and protected it, they say. The British promised to protect Buddhism to get the assistance of the Kandyan feudal leaders. Their pledge was not worth the paper it was written on, since the colonial power did all in its power to destroy Buddhism. It is peoples struggle that protected Buddhism. Buddhism or any other religion could be preserved only by its adherent masses through their support and agitation, a fact that should be taught to our patriots.
Peaceful co-existence of all communities
Inciting ethno-religious hatred and inspiring communal strife is very dangerous. It would, first of all end national unit which is a sine qua non for development. It would cause immense hardships to the masses. Unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and a thousand other ills and scarcities would affect them.
It would also end the culture of tolerance and peaceful co-existence of all communities in the country that prevailed over centuries. Instead a neo-fascist ideology of a super race would become the dominant ideology of the State. Today, one has to admit that compared to the situation that existed during the last Presidential election the degree of national reconciliation in the country has declined. It is the Government that should be blamed for it for two reasons. Firstly, it hesitated in implementing transitional justice measures required to alleviate the problems of those worst affected by the war. Second, Ministers and Other leaders of the ruling parties, the SLFP and the UNP, in the main started repeating the same communal rhetoric to compete with the Joint Opposition in wooing the majority community.
In their attempt to regain power the former President and his supporters have made use of opposition to the Constitutional reform process as their main platform. In defending a new Constitution the UNP seems to be isolated since the majority of the leaders of its both factions, barring the President, have united to oppose a new Constitution. Thus the SLFP has turned to be the main political force opposing a new Constitution despite the participation of its members in the Government. The rest of the opposition is numerically minute. The SLFP deviating from its position over decades has turned 180 degrees to oppose the abolition of the Executive Presidency. It is also opposed to land and police powers under the 13th Amendment despite its participation in the Councils for nearly three decades and the 13 plus pledge given to the international community. Likewise, they have reservations about devolution of power. They also scorn federalism following the JO and thus contribute to instilling unjust phobia among the population.
Such fears were entertained throughout recent history. For example it was said that giving parity of status to Sinhala and Tamil languages would ruin the Sinhala language. Today both are official languages and no damage has been caused to either of them. Similar fears expressed about granting citizenship to Up Country Tamils have been proved to be futile. The Provincial Council system would divide the country, the same forces predicted. But it has existed for nearly 30 years. Despite deficiencies in it there is threat to the integrity of the country.
Devolution of power
The Opposition says that devolution of power would divide the country. Yet they also oppose measures to reinforce central authority and commit the leaders of non-majority communities to the defense of the centre. Their opposition to power sharing at central level is an example.
The proposal for a Second Chamber is also to strengthen power sharing at the centre. Communalists also oppose it. It is a device to get unrepresented communities, professionals, academics and religious representatives on board. In other words, it is an extension of democracy. Most countries, including powerful ones have Second Chambers.
Finally, let us see what gives birth to separatism. In Sri Lanka separatism arose despite the unitary character of the state. That means the root cause of separatism is not devolution of power. Sri Lanka had no devolved powers when separatism arose. In fact the limited devolution that came later was its consequence and not the cause. The cry for separatism arises when discrimination against a community and the violation of the human rights of its members take place. This is proved everywhere in the world.

Opening of Indian funded Housing Scheme by Sajith Premadasa
The Indian government has awarded us a sum of Rs. Six thousand lakhs for the construction of houses for the less fortunate and down trodden people in Hambantota district. This shows the confidence that the Indian government has about the government of Sri Lanka, said the Minster of Housing and Constructions Sajith Premadasa addressing a meeting that followed the opening of the Santhosagama Siribopura in Hambantota.
The Housing Scheme was opened by the Minister who was accompanied by the High Commissioner of India Tharanjith Sin Sandu.
Premadasa said that he opened the four hundred and seventy second Gammana in Hambantota district today and that his target was to set up five hundred housing schemes in the Hambantota district.
He said that within the next three years two thousand housing schemes will be set up in the island. A sum of Rs.233 lakhs was spent on this Santhosagama Housing Scheme.
He said that he will utilize the funds released by the Indian government for the setting up of housing schemes for those who do not have a shelter upon their heads.
The Minister said that there is a system called Panchyathi Raj in India to decentralise the power of the villages. He said that his father implemented a similar program under the Gramodaya Mandala. Premadasa said that about two years ago, a housing scheme was opened in Tissamaharama named after the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.
He said in future even he will obtain the collaboration of the Indian government for the progress of our development projects. There was a group of people who queried about obtaining funds from the Indian govrnnment.
I wonder whether there will be a group of people who will protest against my obtaining funds from India for the setting up of housing schemes, the Minister concluded.

On the origin of the world
Humans since their evolution, from the earliest times, had been on the move, in search of food, pasturelands for herds, farmlands for agriculture, better shelter to protect themselves, water to drink and other human needs, and more comforts. This trend continued with new expectations, and desires and wants, as the humans became sedentary. This is a simplistic explanation for lay-persons, like us.
Relevant Sections of Agganna Sutta
The Great Philosopher and Teacher on Non-Violence, the Buddha speaks of this phenomena in the Agganna Sutta; He lucidly analyses, to Vasetta and Bharadvaja the two Brahmins, how humans evolved, lived contentedly in their environment, until, private ownership developed in the community based on produce of grains, and agricultural plots, when conflicts arose about how equitably their distribution should be effected. In order to settle such disputes a leader was chosen from among them who later acquired for himself powers, to execute decisions; the earliest seeds of the concept of kingship commenced thus and Maha Sammata was selected with the free will of these humans.
Empires and kingdoms
They themselves, underwent a whole cycle of evolution after descending from Abhassara, another Brahma Loka. The Maha Sammata or the leader chosen with the consent of the wider grouping of beings, ruled over these independent societies. Eons, later these came to be known as Empires, Kingdoms. The beings in these entities moved from one to the other for occupations, and the leaders eventually, expanded their economic territory. Some among these humans became land owners, (Khattiya), some agriculturists and merchants, entrepreneurs (Vaishyas), some manual-workers, (Shudras), and those who were in search of spiritual attainments, Brahmanas. These groups were called castes in India later; but they were really economic-spiritual-socio segments in society
These humans were in search of better worldly lives, and in the process there arose, inter and intra- quarrels, when the interests of one impinged on the other, - between and among these societies-. As humans grew in numbers these conflicts graduated to wars and later world wars. The greed and ignorance in persons in these societal-entities, led some to move from one community to the other, which seemingly were better equipped to satisfy them.
What is termed as Migration is thus, moving out from their habitat seeking more comforts. They could be social, economic, educational, and other facilities. Due to the controls and safeguards, governing varied communities, those who migrate had to force their way surreptitiously, and in secrecy, and in the case of some others their environs encouraged them to do so. The present terms Refugee and Asylum -seekers are persons who are forced to move out, due to war, famine, or persecution. Those who yearn for a better life in the process are called economic refugees. All of them are termed Migrants.
Explanation of modern science
Modern Science has studied this phenomenon of Migration in relation to the Evolution of Humans. There are varied theories propounded, by Eminent Scientists, Biologists, Archeologists and Naturalists. One of the theories generally, talked about is that the earliest Migration took place from Africa, around 77,000, years ago. They were the Homonids who migrated north who are called Neanderthals, and also called Homo sapiens, and Homo erectus in East Asia, and Hobbits in South East Asia.
These findings have been corroborated by DNA tests of persons, in the present different Continents. Different approximations of dates of how long ago these migrations have taken place are given by Scientists, ranging from 30,000 to 90,000 years. Migrations from present Europe to America have occurred approximately, 30,000 years ago from Alaska to Bering Strait. The knowledge has advanced in this field since our student days, that young researchers could undertake further studies. The humans in different environments changed physical structures and there came to being, indices like Cephalic Index, of the equation between the head and the rest of the body. There is certainly a core-relation of these findings to the Philosophical Teachings of the Buddha.
An aspect that the pure-scientists, leave for social scientists is the Trends of Migration in the World, known to us. They were in fact due the worldly reasons propounded in the Teachings of the Buddha, ignorance and lust. The Emperors and Kings or the Maha Sammatas, overwhelmed with greed and ignorance, ignored the Dasa Raja Dharma, taught in the Dhamma.
The rulers in the present day world are bereft of any of the ethical codes of governance. It has been so from the time of the Nation States emergence. They try to expand their territory for self aggrendisment. It is almost the same with all those who rule the present States. There would not have been two world wars, regional wars religious and ethnic conflicts, mass displacements of people, hunger, deprivation, inadequate shelter, migrations at the risk of -lives, refugees and all the evils, if the world leaders were humane. The emergence of World Bodies for preservation of peace, and economic advancement and social and cultural resurgence have been necessary because of mans inhumanity to man.
Dasa Raja Dharma
The Buddha taught- in The Kutadanda Sutta in Digha Nikaya,-the leaders to follow the Ten Royal Ethics, which are as follows;-
Liberality, generosity, charity (Dana), Morality ( Sila), Loyal Service ( Parichchaga), Honesty (Ajjava), Kindness, Gentleness (Majjava), Non Attachment- to mainly Power (Thapas), Non-Hatred ( Akkhoda), Non-Violence, Non Political Victimisation (Avihimsacha), and Non -opposition to Peoples Will (Avirodha). When these virtues are translated to the happenings today in world politics, and domestic politics, it is easy to comprehend that the varied administrations are responsible for the human problems and sufferings engulfing the Nations
Leaving aside the individual National problems, the major crises spots of the world are sufficient testimony to the unethical governance in most countries. The migration and the refugee crises in the Middle East and the violence in the region are due to the non-conformity to any human ethics by the ruling classes. As the space is inadequate, only the violence perpetrated in Europe during the last month are referred to in this essay. The Political causes are well-known to the readership.
Armed groups
There was an exodus of humans from the Middle East due to non-ending violence, caused firstly, by the ruling classes, and secondly, due to the violence by armed groups on the respective governments and their forces. The fleeing of millions of people to safe places on earth, commenced over a year ago. This was mainly to Europe, and Europe welcomed them. The violence by armed groups on the people of Europe due to hatred- based wrong concepts, are spreading violence in various parts of the world. One continuing saga of this phenomenon of inhumanity of man to man, are the attacks, by armed groups on civilians.
Therefore, this immigration to Europe from the Middle East is viewed by the Europeans, with a certain amount of suspicion mainly due to the terrorist attacks in the varied Cities, in Europe. In the month of July alone, there were attacks in Germany in a train at Wurzburg, Munich, in France, in Nice on Bastille Day, in a Christian Church in St. Etienne, and other sporadic violence. The debate in Europe is whether; the sympathy shown by them to the immigrants especially, from the Middle East had been adequately reciprocated. Since the time European leaders allowed the refugees to enter European countries in 2015, the terrorist violence they had to undergo seem to tell the immigrants that they are no more welcome.
Similar massacres continue in the name of ethnicity, religion, race and false concepts of freedom and sovereignty, in other parts of the world, forcing populations to flee such regions. The onus of reducing this inhumanity by man on man stems from Rulers and descends to the commoners. The Rulers therefore, should follow a Code of Ethics, based on whatever, Doctrine they follow. When such a world will be born is however, beyond comprehension.

Debate on Interim Report:
Opposition allotted more time: Kiriella
The opposition received more time for the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said.
He was responding to an accusation made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during the debate, that only a limited amount of time was allocated for the Joint Opposition.
He said the government side has only 673 minutes, while opposition receive 829 minutes and of that, Joint Opposition has 228 minutes.
Joint Opposition Member Pavitra Wanniarachchi said she was given a very short time while the JVP members were allotted enough time.
New Constitution must prevent another war
New constitution must include measures to ensure that a war never recurs in the country, Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamu Development Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the fourth day of the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms.
Today the whole country is talking about the new constitution. Some are of the view that a new constitution is not required and amendments to the existing constitution will suffice. However, we have a responsibility. A constitution was brought in 1972 and again in 1978. They were brought in without the consent of the people. The minority parties were left out of the constitutional process, Today all parties are involved in formulating the new constitution for the first time. There was also talk of amendments to be brought in without a referendum, he said pointing out that the Government brought in a new amendment to the Constitution.
"The SLFP is primarily agreeable to power devolution and are in favour of devolving power in a manner that will benefit all. We are in favour of power devolution under the 13th Amendment. I am glad that the TNA is engaged with the government in the constitutional making process. We need to operate within a unitary state. This is a time when all must act together for national unity. The war is now over and we need to ensure reconciliation among all ethnicities and establish national unity, Senaviratne said
He said that during the last election, the main topic was the new constitution.
The Prime Minister vowed to agree on many of the recommendations brought in by the SLFP. We support power devolution that safeguards the rights of all communities, Seneviratne said.
He said reconciliation should be the main focus to ensure that a war never takes place in the country ever again.
I was deprived of right to expression: Anandan
TNA Parliamentarian Sivashakthi Anandan yesterday accused for the second time that he had been deprived of the right to expression on the interim committee report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
He accused the Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan of not giving him an opportunity to join the debate.
Raising a point of order MP Anandan said that he was the only one in parliament who was deprived of the right to join the debate.
I am deprived of representing the voice of my people in Wanni, Anandan said.
Although it is said that the TNA is democratic, this is what is happening to its members, he said.
He said someone has misled the TNA leadership that he was attempting to criticise the interim report. He said he was promised on Wednesday that a decision on the issue would be made at the Party Leaders' meeting. But I did not receive a chance, he said.
Presiding member Selvam Adeikalanathan said he would talk with the Speaker of the issue and follow the Party Leaders decision made at the meeting.
A countrys most valuable document is its constitution: Pavithra
Constitution is the most valuable document in a country. But for Jayampathy Wickramaratne, who has been entrusted with the formulation of the new constitution, it is a machine that churns out dollars and pounds, Ratnapura district MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said in parliament yesterday. .
The Tamil Eelam separatists see that this document could provide them with a chance to realise their Eelam dream. We are today in a land dampened by blood shed by our past heroes who sacrificed their lives to safeguard the sovereignty of the country, she said.
Wanniarachchi said she was compelled to go against the new constitution as it demeans the powers of Parliament which was brought in through the peoples mandate and handed over powers to the Local Government on the whims of a few.
Isnt this an attempt to degrade the power of Parliament and put it under local bodies This sort of Constitution only serves the sinister motives of a handful of separatists and not the public, she said.
She said the Parliament can no longer make independent decisions upholding the integrity of the country according to the provisions of the new constitution.
Parliament will no longer be able to pass any law independently if this new constitution is brought in, Wanniarachchi said.
"This is an attempt to undermine the constitutional powers of Parliament," she said. She asked what would become of the sovereignty of the people if the new constitution was through.
Thirteenth Amendment led country towards chaos: Rambukwella
It was claimed at the time that the 13th amendment was the best solution and the last opportunity. Instead it put the country into a pool of blood, Joint Opposition Member Keheliya Rambukwella yesterday said.
He was participating in the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms in Parliament.
He said the Constitutional Assembly had met 73 occasions, and six political parties had submitted their reports. He said another report was there and queried who prepared it.
"Lal Wijenayakebeing a member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, who was appointed to head that committee had federalism in mind for a long time," Rambukwella said.
"Jayampathy Wickramaratne, a Sama Samaja Party member, supported federalism. He was brought to Parliament through the UNP national list and handed over this task. The public are obviously suspicious of their motives, Rambukwella said.
The MP said the assembly was illegal. He said its members made the same statements they made when they brought in the 13th amendment that it was the last opportunity. Their solution turned the country to a pool of blood and led the country towards separatism.
New Constitution should discourage secessionists
Must preserve unity, sovereignty, integrity:
New constitution must have built-in mechanisms to discourage secessionist tendencies and to preserve the unity, sovereignty and integrity of the state, SLMC MP Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana said in Parliament yesterday, joining the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional reforms.
He urged the assembly to include in the Article 5 the term administrative districts along with the provision to create new districts through an Executive Act to allow for the subdivision or amalgamation of an existing administrative district.
I believe the interim report would strenthen this argument and provides utmost justification, especially to create a new administrative district in Ampara. This would ensure equal rights and representation of all citizens in Sri Lanka.
On the issue of granting state lands to the landless persons, he pointed out that the interim report gives first priority to persons of any sub-division recognized by the law of the relevant district. That sub-division is evidently either a DS or a GS division. Taking into account the practicality of this issue, certain subdivisions lack land resources and a large numbers of landless people live in them, he said pointing out that this could be disadvantageous and counterproductive, unless the National Land Commission is empowered to formulate new criteria based on existing conditions such as population, land availability and equitable distribution among citizens.

Removing the thorn
Desire comes in two forms, attachment and aversion. The first makes us grab after the things we like and hold onto them, the second makes us avoid or resist or attack the things we dont like. Attachment leads us to consume resources at any cost, take from others what has not been given to us, and drives us to exploit others for personal gain. It also underlies such personality traits as pride, arrogance, conceit, selfishness, and the lust for power
In a remarkable passage in the Attadanda Sutta, the Buddha speaks frankly about his fear and dismay about the state of society:
Fear is born from arming oneself.
Just see how many people fight!
Ill tell you about the dreadful fear
That caused me to shake all over.
Seeing creatures flopping around,
Like fishes in shallow water,
So hostile to one another!
Seeing this, I became afraid.
This imagefishes flopping around in the shallowsseems as apt today as ever. As the worlds resources diminish and the number of people in need of them increases, things may well get only more desperate. Even in the Buddhas time the situation seemed overwhelming. The Buddha acknowledges his despair, but he also describes his breakthrough to a deeper understanding:
Seeing people locked in conflict,
I became completely distraught.
But then I discerned here a thorn
Hard to seelodged deep in the heart.
Its only when pierced by this thorn (Sutta Nipata 93539)
That one runs in all directions.
So if that thorn is taken out
One does not run, and settles down.
This pivotal insight shapes how conflict and peace are to be understood in the Buddhist tradition. Human society is formed by the collective action of its individuals; it thus reflects the qualities of heart and mind of each person. Peace in peoples hearts creates peace in the world; turmoil in peoples hearts creates turmoil in the world. The harmful behavior people manifest in the world can be seen as having a single cause. That cause is desire.
Desire comes in two forms, attachment and aversion. The first makes us grab after the things we like and hold onto them, the second makes us avoid or resist or attack the things we dont like. Attachment leads us to consume resources at any cost, take from others what has not been given to us, and drives us to exploit others for personal gain. It also underlies such personality traits as pride, arrogance, conceit, selfishness, and the lust for power. Aversion compels us to turn away from what we find unpleasant, to shut out or discriminate against those we dont like, and to destroy what we fear or what we dont understand. It also causes such aberrant behaviors as violence, cruelty, bigotry, and other acts of hatefulness.
But these thorns in the heart can be removed. It is just the thorn, driving us mad with pain and fear, that makes us crazy enough to hurt and hate, that makes us lose touch with our innate goodness. Like a ferocious lion with a thorn in its paw, we are only in need of a healer to come pull out the thorn that afflicts us. The Buddha was such a healer. Having diagnosed the problem as desireso embedded in the heart that it is often hard to seehis prescription was simply to apply awareness to the problem, and to do so in massive doses. Because the workings of desire are hidden in the unconscious functioning of the mind, we must bring greater consciousness to bear on the moment. We have only to learn to see things clearly, and a natural process of healing will occur.
To heal the individual wounds brought about by desire, the Buddha prescribed mindful meditation, the careful, moment-to-moment observation of everything arising and falling in the field of phenomenal experience. When we are able to see what is actually occurring within us, wisdom will gradually evolve. The principle is simple, but it takes practice. To heal the collective wounds of our planet, likewise brought about by desire in its various forms, it seems to me we might apply the same prescription. The way to bring collective mindfulness to bear on the collective field of experience is through witnessing and sharing what has been seen by others.
We can see many examples today of the beneficial things that can happen when an atrocity is caught on tape and shared widely with others, or when evidence of wrongdoing is brought to light and exposed before the court of world opinion. Just as the evil we are capable of as individuals lies lurking unexamined deep in our psyches, so also much of the cruelty and abuse that takes place in the world is hidden from view. And just as uncovering our personal demons can begin a process of healing, so also can the revealing of cruelties and injustices that have been kept secret have a transformative effect on global behavior.
According to the Buddha, the human world is protected by twin guardians, two forces in the mind that watch over and guide moral behavior. The first guardian of the world is hiri, a word that connotes conscience, moral intuition, and self-respect. It refers to that within the human psyche that knows the difference between right and wrong, between what is noble and ignoble, between what is worthy of respect and what is not. Each of us has within us an innate moral compass, and it is the view of the Buddhist tradition that religion is not the source of this but rather a form by which it is given expression. The second guardian of the world is ottappa, which comprises such notions as social conscience, a cultural or collective sense of morality, and respect for the opinions and the rights of others.
Buddhism teaches that anything we do that is wholesome will be done with the support and guidance of these two inner guardians. Conversely, everything we do that is unwholesome can only be done when these moral guides are disregarded. So if there is something morally reprehensible occurring in an individual or in a society, it means that we lack sufficient clarity of awareness of what we are doing. It means we are temporarily blinded by our greed, hatred, or delusion, or by some combination of the three, such that we refuse to attend openly to the deeds we are committing. When attention has been brought to bear on the matterin sufficient amounts, with sufficient intensity, and with sufficient honestywe will naturally shy away from doing harm to ourselves, to others, and to both.
Does this sound idealistic I dont think it is. It is rooted in a very sophisticated understanding of human nature. So lets spend more time on that collective zafu, shining the light of awareness into the dark corners of the world. The possibility exists for radical universal transformation. We have merely to start the process, in our own mind, and the rest will naturally fall into place.

Sarfraz rejects Chandimals witchcraft claim
Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed has dismissed Sri Lankan Test captain Dinesh Chandimal's claim that the Lankans won the Test series because of "witchcraft" and receiving blessings from a sorcerer, the Hindustan Times reported.
"We lost the two Tests because of our poor batting and that is all," Sarfraz said. "If they could win Test matches because of witchcraft or magic, then they should have also won the ODI and T20 series."
Earlier this week, Chandimal told reporters he had received a special blessing from a meyni, or sorcerer, ahead of the two-match series in the United Arab Emirates.
"I am always ready to accept the blessings of anyone  whether it is a meyni or any clergy," Chandimal told reporters after returning to Colombo.
"You can have talent, but without this blessing, you can't move forward," he had said a week after Sri Lanka's sports minister denied ordering the struggling national team to use witchcraft ahead of the Test series.
Responding to the claim, Sarfraz said today: "I believe in the Quran and also that there is magic in the world; but we just batted badly and lost our chances to win."
While luck plays a role in cricket, matches are won and lost on the field, he said.
Pakistan came back strongly after losing the Test series 2-0 to Sri Lanka, going on to whitewash the Lankan tigers in the five-match ODI and two-match T20 series. Pakistan's T20 series win has also helped the side clinch the top T20 spot in ICC rankings. - Dawn
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket media unit in a release states with regard to the press conference held by Dinesh Chandimal on October 31:
Q: There were various reports on social media stating that you had received blessings from a maniyo prior to the Test series. Did this help you to win, and if so how
A: It's like this - any religion blesses, furthermore no religion enables wrongdoing. Therefore not only this particular person but even if any member of the clergy blesses me I will gladly accept that blessing. Ones belief in the effectiveness of this blessing is a personal matter that differs from person to person. I personally believe in obtaining blessings before any endeavour. There may be some who have different views, this is my view. That is the answer I can give to this question.
Q: So did you'll lose the ODI series because you were not blessed
A: There is no such thing. Everyone needs blessings, but talent too. Just because you have blessings, you won't succeed without talent, likewise even if we have talent, we can't move forward without the blessings of all. That's the reality. No one sent me (sorcerer) to her. She is the mother of one of my friends, and the picture is one taken at a function we attended. There is press freedom in this country, so anything may be construed.

Set up an English speaking environment: Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director
Teaching is a noble profession. Some teachers are not aware about their responsibilities. It is the duty of teachers to build a good society and guide students in the current path so that they will become good citizens, the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A. M. Ahamed Lebbe said.
The Zonal Education Director Ahamed Lebbe visited the Addalaichenai Al-Muneera Girls Higher School recently and discussed issues relating to educational development activities in the school. The Principal of the School M. H. Razmee, School Development Committee Secretary A. B. Abdul Gaffoor, Members of the SDC and staff were also present.
The Principal M. H. Razmee said the activities in the past and the proposed plans in the future were discussed in detail. The importance of proper education should be realized by the teaching staff. Some teachers waste their time and do not pay attention to students in classrooms. Such teachers will be looked down upon by society, he said.
A majority of school children from rural areas have excelled in examinations. The government should provide basic facilities for rural schools as whatever hardship parents undergo, they somehow educate their children, the Zonal Education Director said. The Zonal Education Director A. M. Ahamed Lebbe has requested all teachers to set up an English speaking environment at the school for the benefit of the children. The educational activities of the school and the achievements of students were commended by the Director.

So much hot air
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has set the record straight. He told parliament, that has converted itself into a Constitutional Assembly, on Wednesday, that no finality has been reached on the new constitution and what they were discussing are only the proposals of the steering committee and the various sub committees, that are before them. All these will be put to the people and religious leaders before preparing the draft. The views and opinions of all stakeholders will be obtained before finality is reached. He made it clear that the government was amenable to accommodate proposals of the Joint Opposition and dropout what the JO is opposed to.
The preeminent position granted to Buddhism will remain intact as well as the unitary state. A broad discussion will be carried out on the new constitution with the Mahanayakes and the people, as suggested by the President. You say Provincial Councils should not seek to divide the country, PCs should not be allowed to merge, Buddhism should be given the foremost place, the Prime Minister should be elected by parliament. Leader of the Opposition should be elected by Opposition MPs. We are agreeable to all these, he said. He said all the proposals before the Constitutional Assembly will be discussed with the people and religious leaders before the draft is prepared, preceded by the necessary formalities.
He reminded the MPs that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, too, sought a mandate to set up a constitutional assembly and so did other leaders. Hence, what they are now doing is implementing the mandate of the people. The Premier went on to state that constitution making was a laboured process and they could not rush into anything. It would be April, when the final contours of the new constitution emerge.
Hence, the Prime Minister has made it clear that nothing has been decided upon, in no uncertain terms, and that it was the divergent views within the committees that were being discussed by the Constitutional Assembly. The distilled version of the new constitution will come out only after the different views of all the disparate forces have been collated and sorted out. The Speaker himself, in a newspaper interview, had stated that he would not lend his signature to a constitution that contains provisions that are inimical to the state or where the status of Buddhism has been compromised.
So what is this big song and dance by the Joint Opposition How can one say that the constitution has already been made by America Will either the President or Prime Minister commit political hara kiri by acting in defiance of the Maha Sangha
The game plan is clear. The Joint Opposition is hell-bent on making the proposed new constitution the whipping boy at the upcoming local government elections. What else could be more plausible, given that MR himself pledged to grant 13 plus to the Tamils The JO is clearly hoping that the emotion whipped up by its sell out slogan, would be powerful enough for the Sinhala electorate to overlook the corruption cases against prominent JO leaders and tip the scales in its favour. It is this same emotion that was whipped up to force Bandaranaike to tear up the Banda-Chelva Pact and Dudley to jettison the Dudley-Chelva agreement, that saw rivers of blood flow in the country, in the years to follow. Is history repeating itself Will the JO action mark another watershed in this country, where the ethnic question is concerned, with the future generations having to pay dearly for the folly of a few
It is time that saner counsel prevail and the JO stopped playing football with the national question. The more moderate among its members, at least, should prevail on the hardliners to desist from playing politics with this issue. Veterans, such as Dinesh Gunawardena can take the lead in this regard. After all, he can boast of an excellent political pedigree, unlike some of the riffraff who have entered the present parliament.
Be that as it may, the government should embark on an effective campaign to educate the public on the current state of affairs, vis-a-vis the new constitution. Like the President has noted, many positive developments of the government have not reached the public domain and the attention being paid to disseminate the correct information on the new constitution, too, appears heading for a similar fate. Keheliya Rambukwellas claim that a US Congressman had told a Lankan parliamentary delegation, of which he was one, that America has already wrapped up the constitution, should be countered by the government. If not, there will be other similar claims from JO functionaries, to incite the public, as the LG elections draw near.
We witnessed such a scenario during the Presidential Election, too, where non-existent pacts with the TNA, by the Common Candidate, were freely bandied about. The strident rhetoric of the JO is bound to increase with every step of constitution making, and, reach a crescendo at election time. The propaganda machinery of the government should wake-up from its slumber and be alert to the machinations of the rabble rousers.

Southern Province achieve high GCE O/L results
The Southern Province has reached the national level in the field of educational development with highly successful results achieved by students through the GCE Ordinary Level Examination this time, Southern Provincial Minister of Education Chandima Rasaputhra said while speaking at a ceremony held at the Wilpita Maha Vidyalaya in Akuressa.
Rasaputhra said that there is an excess of teachers in some schools while some other schools in remote rural areas in the region have a shortage of teaching staff. He expressed his deep sense of gratitude to students for making better academic achievements amidst difficulties and bringing honour to the Southern region. A recent survey carried out in South has revealed that lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children in view of want of parental protection, poverty and disruptions of families led to the decrease in examination results of some children.
SPC Ministry of Education is also exploring the possibility of getting the children going through difficulties and economic hardships admitted to childrens homes and afford them a quality education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these procedures, Rasaputhra said.
Rasaputhra said that children are the asset of the country. Making financial allocations for them would not be an invaluable investment for a bright future for them and it definitely wont be a mere expenditure and waste of money. Affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the cherished aim of his ministry.
Rasaputhra mentioned that in the National Educational Development Process, the study of technological subjects has been prioritized. Better facilities should be made for children for the same.
Plans are afoot to further boost the academic attainments and examination results of all students in State schools in the Southern Province. Speedy measures have also been initiated to enhance the physical and human resources in all schools in the Southern Province, the Minister said.
The educational development of the children would be the vision and mission of the SPC Ministry of Education, Rasaputhra further said.
Several speakers also addressed the meeting.

Stability ensured, safety assured
Our government, since January 08, 2015, has ensured that all citizens of Sri Lanka are secure and safe, and that stability prevails across all sectors of the society.
Safety, security and stability play a pivotal role in building a stronger and sustainable economy and our efforts have received wide support from across the globe.
We have taken diligent measures to ensure that the damages done in the past are redressed and all communities are a focus for the national development agenda.
Tackling serious crimes was a top priority for the UNP and as a result, serious crime rate has been cut by almost a third since 2014.
Todays Sri Lanka is a more stable and safer country than it has ever been and our plans for economic development will ensure that this remains the case.
The government is bringing back stability and security so that people can enjoy peace of mind and live without fear. Public investment in police and public security has increased 8-fold, from Rs 3.3 billion in 2014 to Rs 28.5 billion in 2016.
Organised Crime and Narcotics Range
To further strengthen our battle against serious crimes, we set up the Organised Crime and Narcotics Range to defeat narcotic trade in Sri Lanka and established the Financial Crimes Investigation Division to tackle issues including major financial crimes, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and unlawful enrichments.
The overall goal of our government in relation to the drug problem is an ambitious one and its key objective is to reduce the drug supply and drug use to minimum levels by 2020.
This goal will be pursued relentlessly by all drug law enforcement agencies, the government agencies directly involved in drug demand reduction, including provincial and local administrations and other agencies, which have a strong potential for contributing to the end objective of our mission. We have already sought the support of NGOs and private sector agencies in this regard.
The Government will deal with this horrendous scourge, while curtailing overseas supply chains of drug lords, in partnership with our friendly nations. At the same, we will intensify our battle at home as it will play a critical role in shaping the future of our country, our society and our children.
Our progressive efforts on the front of accountability and reconciliation has been recognized and appreciated by former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki moon who said the unity government was geared to find a solution to the long-drawn issues in this area.
He said: I commend the unity Government for taking steps to pursue truth-seeking and accountability mechanisms and to deal with the grievances of people in the North and the East. I welcome the establishment of an office of missing persons and the process to reform the constitution to achieve a political settlement.
Law enforcement authorities
Our Government has a clear commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence, and the rule of law. We have directed the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country. We will protect all citizens equally and we will punish anybody who harasses them, irrespective of their positions, affiliations and allegiances.
We must all stand united to strive to eliminate this dangerous affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves in the present or in the future, to once again be dragged into a conflict as in the past.
By building a strong economy and an efficient law enforcement system, we can create a safer Sri Lanka that has the right resources to protect all our people. This is what drives this UNP led government and this is our passion and the core commitment.

Trump vows crackdown after terror  attack
*Calls for attacker's execution
*Mulls terminating Green Card Lottery
US: President Donald Trump on Wednesday vowed a battery of tough measures to curb immigration after a deadly terror attack in New York, but left the White House scrambling to figure out how to fulfil his promises.
Looking to burnish his hardline image after what appeared to be the first majorJihadist attack on the homeland during his administration, Trump pledged sweeping changes and later called for the attacker to be put to death.
Surrounded by the Cabinet, Trump -- who ran for the White House on a promise to end what he called radical Islamic terrorism -- announced he was starting the process of terminating America's Green Card Lottery.
Diversity lottery. Diversity lottery. Sounds nice. It's not nice, he said. We're so politically correct that we're afraid to do anything. The program was created 27 years ago and awards US permanent resident visas to around 50,000 applicants from around the world each year.
According to Trump, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, identified by authorities as the man who plowed a rented truck into cyclists and pedestrians on a New York City bike path Tuesday, came to the country via the program in 2010.
Trump also floated deep changes to how terror suspects are prosecuted and said he would consider sending Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, the US military detention center which holds suspected foreign Jihadists in Cuba.
(We) have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now, Trump said.
Trump continued his hardline rhetoric on Twitter Wednesday night, calling for the attacker's execution.
NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!, he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State jihadist group.
The White House was forced to walk back some of his comments, stressing that he was not taking executive action but looking to Congress to change decades-old laws.
We're going to continue pushing for and advocating for getting rid of this program, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of the Green Card Lottery.
Sanders also ruled out executive action to introduce quicker and greater punishment for those guilty of terror offenses.
I believe he was voicing his frustration with the lengthy process that often comes with a case like this, Sanders said.
And just hours after Trump and the White House suggested declaring Saipov an enemy combatant -- opening the possibility of detention without charge and possible dispatch to Guantanamo -- that idea was also undercut.
Prosecutors in New York quickly announced two initial charges against Saipov: provision of material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Saipov, 29, who was arrested after being shot by police, planned for weeks to undertake his attack in the name of Islamic State group, following online instructions from the Jihadist organization, officials said.
Trump ran for election last year promising a crackdown on immigration, including building a wall on the Mexican border and banning Muslim immigrants.
This year he has already slashed the country's annual refugee intake by more than 50 percent to 45,000, tightened visa issuance around the world and ordered a ban on travelers from 11 unnamed high-risk countries.
Refugee experts say all but one have Muslim-majority populations; they do not include Uzbekistan.
The officially titled Diversity Lottery Program aims to diversify the origins of people granted permanent residence -- so-called green cards -- in the United States.
In 2015, lottery applications were received from more than 14 million people, of whom 49,377 won green cards, including 2,524 Uzbeks. - AFP

Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thera : Buddhist revivalist of recent times
Using simple language drawing parallels from everyday life was his way of addressing the young and old. The popular programme Anduren Eliyata SahaNana Pahana (From darkness to light and Wisdom) proved his virtuosity as a speaker whose ideas appealed to the minds of his listeners.
A wave of shock swept across Sri Lanka in the evening of Friday 12 December 2003, when the news came from Moscow announcing the passing away of the much respected Ven. Gangodavila Soma Thera who was on a visit to Russia to receive his Doctorate in Buddhist philosophy from the Petersburg University.
Venerable Soma Thera was 55 years old, at the time of his passing away. He suddenly fell ill and underwent urgent heart surgery but did not recover in-spite of the doctors effort to save his life.
Venerable Soma Thera popularly known in the country as Soma Hamuduruvo was the Head of the Australian Buddhist Vihara in Victoria. He was born on April 24, 1948 and at the age of 26 became a samanera under the guidance of Venerable Madhihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thera and Venerable Ampitiye Rahula Thera.
Higher Ordination
In 1976, he underwent his training at the Buddhist Training Centre in Maharagama and received his Upasampada  Higher Ordination. Thereafter he left for a forest hermitage in Maha Oya in Ampara district where he practised Buddhist meditation. While staying at the hermitage he wrote his first book on the Buddha Dhamma in which he stated that Bhikkhus should not confine themselves to their pansalas. He also said that participation in pirith ceremonies, alms givings, administering pansil, conducting pansakula and delivering Mathaka Bana did not constitute the desired results in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha, he asserted.
Following the footsteps of his erstwhile Nayaka Theras of Vajirama temple in Colombo - Ven. Palane Vajiragnana, Ven. Narada, Ven. Piyadassi and Ven. Madhihe Pannaseeha  Venerable Soma Thera adopted a new path. It was approaching the problems of youth in the country by organizing discussions explaining to them how to overcome their problems in a rational way. Before long he became popular as a preacher among the listeners on Buddhist values. With his ideas on youth problems he formed Tharuna Saviya to guide and direct the young men and women on Buddhist thinking.
On realizing the importance of meditation Venerable Soma Thera wrote Buddhastupa, a guide book on meditation.
 Dharmamduta Mission
His visit to Victoria in 1986 was a memorable one as he enlisted the support of the Sri Lankans living in Australia to build the Buddhist vihara in 1993. It was the Dharmamduta Mission that helped to spread Buddha Dhamma among the enlightened people living Down Under.
The sil campaign he began in 1975 with 35 youths increased to thousands over the years because of the commitment to what he began, in helping young people in their longing to live according to Buddhist precepts. His ideas on religious beliefs deviated from the orthodox form. It was the result of new thinking at a time when the society was changing with the rapid development of science and technology breaking barriers that hitherto existed in our country. The national issues took a different form when violence increased affecting the very existence in keeping with Buddhist values. While visiting remote villages he gave sermons to those who wanted his advice and guidance. He also contributed to the national newspapers.
Numerous sermons
Soma Thera also appeared on TV and participated in radio programmes on panel discussion on issues affecting the lives of the people. Thus he became a popular preacher among the Buddhists in the country.
In his numerous sermons he emphasized the value of Buddhist philosophy and made the people to think and live according to the teaching of the Buddha. It was this practical approach that made him popular among the laymen as their guide and philosopher. Using simple language drawing parallels from everyday life was his way of addressing the young and old.
The popular programme Anduren Eliyata SahaNana Pahana (From darkness to light and Wisdom) proved his virtuosity as a speaker whose ideas appealed to the minds of his listeners.
He also pointed out that as long as Buddhists believe in Hindu religious ideas and other forms of beliefs based on the supernatural, they are unable to understand the fundamental teachings of the Buddha and therefore they should eschew such thoughts.
Soma Thera showed the teachings of the Buddha contained in the Tripitaka and to follow the Gnana Marga instead of Bhakthi Marga. He was critical of some practices at the Buddhist places of worship. These practices he said lead to ignorance and corruption in the name of religion.
Buddha Dhamma
He pointed out that the national problems have become acute because of the bungling of the politicians. He mentioned that the duty of the leaders should be to shun all forms of corruption and should endeavour to improve the lives of the people.
The Bhikkhus he said should take an active part in this process. In his sermons Soma Thera mentioned about the role of the Bhikkhus.
In his message to the politicians he admonished them to follow the Buddhist precepts.
With these ideas in mind he organized Jana Vijaya Foundation to bring among the laymen. People he said should live according to Buddha Dhamma to achieve their salvation.
He mentioned what he called social justice sans violence and respect for all human beings including animals. His popularity was amply shown when his last rites were performed at the Independence Square in Colombo.
