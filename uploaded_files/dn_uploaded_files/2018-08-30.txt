Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 to begin September 6
Cormorant Strike IX - 2018, the joint mega Tri-Service Field Training Exercise (FTX) organised by the Sri Lanka Army for the ninth consecutive year, would begin on September 6 with the participation of 100 foreign military participants and observers, in addition to 2,500 army personnel, 400 sailors and 200 airmen.
It was announced by Kilinochchi Security Forces Commander Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana, at a media conference held at the Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (SLEME) auditorium on Tuesday.
Over the years, the said field training exercise had evolved as one of the most consistent and comprehensive training exercises which transfers and shares military experience and knowledge in a multinational milieu, for the benefit of future military aspirants, as well as the foreign military participants, the Commander said.
It will continue until September 26, covering the Eastern, Central, Western and North Central provinces and will provide a catalyst to build the capacity of Army Special Operations Forces (SOF), and to formulate a theoretical framework for the employment of SOF officers, he added.
This years exercise would portray counter-insurgency scenarios with the influence of asymmetrical warfare, which had turned out to be the common approach among most non-state actors, extremist groups and appears to be the most likely national and international security threat in the 21st century, Major General Ranawana said.
The exercise would mainly focus on joint planning and coordination, pre-engagement training, staff functions, real-time role-play, and execution of special operations within the given framework.
Exercise settings had been developed under the guidance of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayaka and under the close supervision of Exercise Director Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana and a special committee.
Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 would begin from the mock Operational Headquarters at Minneriya on Thursday (September 6), after a brief induction ceremony, with Brigadier Krishantha Gnanaratne and Colonel Vipula Ihalage serving as the Deputy Directors of the exercise.
Using SOF tactics, Infantrymen that include commandos, Special Forces, Air Mobile and Mechanised Army Infantry Regiment troops, sailors and airmen would participate in the exercise.
The SOF would deploy troops under command on special operation tactics, techniques and procedures in the Operational Framework (Deep, Close and Rear), during the Exercise.
Foreign military participants and observers from Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, Sudan, Turkey, UK, USA and Zambia, have so far confirmed their participation. Through the execution of 20 special operations missions, the participants are expected to stick to the above-mentioned core tasks.
The field training exercise terminates with the Critical Engagement on September 26, at Kuchchaveli. It had been planned as a joint operation against opposing force strongholds supported by Naval, Air Task Forces and Mechanised Infantry troops. The debrief of the exercise would take place on completion of the Critical Engagement on September 27.
The Army Commander said that Sri Lanka Army, having defeated the worlds most ruthless terrorist outfit, should sustain the status quo and always be well-geared to take on any future challenges the country or its people would face, as defenders of the nation.
The media briefing was also attended by Training Director-General Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi, Army Training Command (ARTRAC) Commander Major General Rukmal Dias, Media Director Brigadier Sumith Atapattu, Commando Brigade Commander Brigadier Krishantha Gnanarathne, Special Forces Brigade Commander Colonel Upul Ihalage, Air Component Commander Group Captain Vishwa Samantha and Naval Component Commander Captain Damian Fernando.

Access Engineering records highest turnover in 2017/18
Access Engineering recorded its highest turnover in the history at the Group and the Company levels, recording Rs 26 billion and Rs. 18 billion, a growth of 27% and 21%, in a challenging business environment, Chairman Sumal Perera told companys shareholders in the companys Annual Report 2017/18.
Construction related activities have contributed 57% to the Group turnover, while 31% was contributed by automobile activities, 10% from sale of construction related material and the rest being made up of leasing office space. Profit after tax was Rs. 3 billion and Rs. 1.9 billion at the Group and the Company levels.
We also paid dividends amounting to Rs 1.2 billion during the year, in addition to the Rs 1.5 billion paid in 2016/17. The net asset value per share grew by 10% and 4% respectively at the Group and the Company levels, he said.
The company reported this performance through focused execution of strategic imperatives for the year with ownership and accountability, thereby enhancing the quality of companys service offering,
depicting the robustness of its business model and the underlying core values.
The company has also completed several infrastructure projects of national importance and continued large-scale projects both independently and as joint ventures with international companies.
Despite the cyclical recovery in the global markets, the international operating environment was not conducive to the business segments that we operate in. Especially in the international markets, the construction and engineering sectors were negatively affected while the automotive sector remained resilient.
The construction sector grew by 10% in 2017 despite the setbacks through delays in the decision-making process, depreciation of the rupee, and changes in the corporate tax structure.
Perera said the companys signature real estate project to transform the skyline of Colombo, Capital Heights Rajagiriya, will be completed in 2020 and has garnered interest from locals and expatriates.

Waste recycling plant at Dompe under Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA:
Another JO fabrication - Rajakaruna
Gampaha district UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna yesterday denied the Joint Oppositions allegation that a waste recycling plant would be established in the Dompe area as part of the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore.
MP Rajakaruna said the JOs claims are utterly baseless. This is bare-faced lies, he observed. Instead, MP Rajakaruna said that Cabinet approval has been granted for the establishment of a Higher Educational Institute in the Dompe, Keragala area.
MP Rajakaruna pointed out that the said Higher Education Institute will be established under Public Private Partnership which will be a non-profit institute.
MP Rajakaruna said that most of these rumours are fabricated by forces backed by the Rajapaksas.
MP Rajakaruna also condemned the cheap moves taken by the Joint Opposition for their political survival.
He pointed out that the recent claim about a recycle plant is another one of those fabrications created by the Joint Opposition.
The JO MPs who participated in this media brief were trying to establish a relation between the FTA and the waste management issue that Singapore is having at present. They referred to a certain article in the Business Times newspaper on this waste management issue. However, there was not a single instance where Sri Lankas name appears in this article.
The FTA is not mentioned either. This is how JO is fabricates stories. They are trying to mislead the public. MP Rajakaruna said.
Speaking oN the FTA, he pointed out that an agreement will not supersede the common law of a country.
One cannot import or export anything in and out of the country according to their whims and fancies just because an FTA has been signed. They have to obtain a license. No one will be allowed harmful things such as waste to be brought to this country, he pointed out.
MP Rajakaruna speaking further on the FTA pointed out that the agreement is open to amendments. There are two committees overseeing this agreement. They meet annually to discuss the progress and issues. These committees have the ability to amend any conditions in this FTA, he pointed out.
MP Rajakaruna, emphasizing the importance of indepth discussions on the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, said that there will be a panel discussion on the said topic at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute at 6.00 p.m on September 5.

Bangladeshi doctors on study tour at Ninewells Hospital
Ninewells Hospital recently hosted a contingent of ten Gynaecologists and Obstetricians from Bangladesh who were in Sri Lanka to study the countrys region-leading maternal and baby health care system.
The Government of Bangladesh had selected Sri Lanka for this study tour as the island boasts the lowest maternal mortality rate in South Asia, while the choice of Ninewells Hospital was due to the contribution it has made over the years to Sri Lanka maintaining this record as the countrys only specialized private maternity hospital.
At the conclusion of the visit, Dr. Saleem Yasmin from Bangladesh said, Ninewells Hospital is a very clean and sophisticated, and has excellent service standards.
A crucial difference between Ninewells and Bangladeshi hospitals is the doctor-patient ratio. Hospitals in our country, even high-end private hospitals, are overcrowded due to our population. Therefore, providing focused attention to patients is always a challenge. Ninewells Hospital on the other hand has a healthy doctor-patient ratio, allowing doctors to spend more time on each patient. This explains the impressive record the hospital has maintained over the years.
Dr. A. B. M. Shamsuddin Ahmed from Bangladesh said, The hospital is greatly concerned about the well-being of patients and service standards. Everybody is highly qualified. Coupled with the facilities available, I would say Ninewells Hospital offers great value for money. I thank the staff at Ninewells for hosting us and helping us gather information.
Speaking on behalf of the hospital, Medical Director of Ninewells Hospital, Dr. Vibash Wijeratne said, We were honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation to our facility and are delighted to be able to share our expertise with the Bangladeshi doctors to help improve the condition of their healthcare system. Our teams here gave their fullest support to the visiting doctors to ensure that all the requirements for their study were met.
The Hospital was recognized as one of the best private sector hospitals in Sri Lanka and also reputed for being one of the countrys most successful fertility centres.

Lives of all great men teach us that we can make our lives as sublime and leave our footprints on the sand of time. She put this quote into perspective and deed by helping the needy from her early years.
Touching many lives through her words and work Sheshadri Kottearachchi continues her mission with the same zeal she possessed many years ago.
I experienced injustice which was directed specifically towards young people during my school and university days. Yes, there will always be something or someone who crosses your path and brings your progress to a halt, but its your responsibility to develop your capabilities to an extent where no challenge is tough enough to hold you down. Its a difficult process, undoubtedly, but its important to engrain a sense of optimism and confidence in young people. We tend to be easily discouraged and the last thing this country needs is a proactive portion of the population that feels like they are not good enough, Sheshadri enthused.
Delivering a speech as a guest of honour at UNDP Sri Lankas 2030 ceremony
The 25-year-old past pupil and former Head Girl of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, had represented the country at the 72nd meeting of the Third Committee at the General Assembly in New York, 2017. She had also delivered the youth statement, based on the agenda of Social development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, persons with disabilities and the family at the event. She had worked closely with youth delegates from countries like Switzerland, Germany and Georgia to formulate a working-paper on representation of youth in national policy-making.
She had been noted for her leadership, public speaking and debating skills. She had won the title of the Best Delegate of Security Council at Everest International Model United Nations in 2017. She had been awarded the prize for Best Leader of the Year 2010 by former president Mahinda Rajapakse. She bagged the Colombo Toastmasters Club All Island Best Speakers Competitions Bartleet Challenge Trophy in 2012 and became the Best Speaker of the Kelaniya Intra-University Debating competition in 2013. She also became the Best Speaker at the 12th Dr. Mahbub Ul Huq Memorial Interschool Debate, organized by the UNDP and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.
Speaker at Dialogs nGage forum
The perfect recipe for a good leader isnt written in stone. A good leader evolves with time and adds or removes certain attributes of their personality for the sake of improvement I appreciate leadership qualities like dedication, an inspiring personality, an understanding soul, reliability and optimism. With dedication comes passion in what you are involved in and the motivation to keep going. Someone who is passionate about their work or their purpose in life will work hard to see it develop into something better. They know what it means to slowly, but steadily nurture a good cause, Sheshadri opined.
Her first big win came when she clinched the title of Colombo Toastmasters Clubs All Island Best Speakers Competition soon after she had completed her schooling. She says that she had taken part in the event not because she was vying for the glory of winning but to prove to herself that she could speak in a public setting without feeling nervous.
Despite being a debater, inter-school award-winning announcer and MUN delegate, I had a fear of public speaking which I was keen to shake off. The process up to the semi-finals of the competition was daunting. I remember feeling extremely intimidated by the older, more experienced competitors. I was so convinced that this was as far as I would make it, that when they announced the winner (me!) it took me a few moments to respond accordingly as I was sitting in a corner, envisioning my speech for next year, she recalled with a smile.
Delivering the Youth Statement for Sri Lanka at the United Nations
She says that inspiring people brings about waves of change, because they are able to reach out to others on an emotional level.
Being able to inspire people to do better and be better can create revolutionary changes if we allow it. You can call them, role models  people who set good examples and motivate other people to do the same. We tend to mimic, or at least appreciate what we see more of. If you spend time with someone who has a well-rounded personality, chances are, this will influence you too. On the other hand, if youre exposed to someone with questionable values, you might find yourself spiralling downwards, she said.
She says that her biggest inspiration in life comes from her grandfather. His own grandfather had been the national hero and author Piyadasa Sirisena from whom Sheshadri and her grandfather had picked up their life- long love of books.
This has been the best gift anyone has given me. He was a simple man  somewhat stern and a brilliant singer - who believed in always doing what was right, no matter how difficult it may be.
Moderator for a Womens Empowerment Forum
When he was alive, seeya was one of my biggest supporters; always showing up for plays I acted in as a child, taking me to the library and telling me stories about his life growing up in a village. One of my fondest memories of him was how he used to head outside in the hot sun and fill in the cracks on the road with cement. When I asked him why he bothered to do so (he no longer owned a car himself),he simply replied It isnt good for peoples tyres when they constantly fall into these holes  so Im fixing the road to prevent that, Sheshadri enthused.
Reading and writing skills come hand in hand. Sheshadri published her maiden novel titled City Lights when she was 12. She also hopes to publish a collection of poetry and prose soon. She says that she herself is her harshest critic and is obsessively thinking how she could have done a certain task better.
She notes, While it is always great to evaluate yourself, it opens up a floodgate of doubt and allows other people to do doubt you too. In that sense, learning to differentiate between constructive criticism and scathing remarks has been a game-changer. Its important to listen and improve but it is also important to take a step back and appreciate what youve done so far.
Born and raised in the suburbs of Kelaniya Sheshadri grew up in a setting which was full of books and art supplies. Her father, Lalith Kottearachchi, is a businessman while her mother, Shehara Sirisena, is a a full-time matriarch. Her sister, Senara, is a decade younger than her. Her family as well as her grandmother, Malini Sirisena, has been understanding and supporting her work.
Sheshadri is employed as the Communications Coordinator for Oxfam in Sri Lanka. As the United Nations Youth Delegate she also supports youth oriented programmes. Though hectic she says that her roles are educational and challenging.
At the UN Headquarters in New York
I am quite the workaholic and what better than to be busy yet love what you do at the same time! I travel and work with different communities across the island through my work at Oxfam. Our team focuses on poverty alleviation, womens empowerment and improved sanitation, among other thematic areas; covering a wide scope of prevailing issues that average Sri Lankans face on a day-to-day basis. This has definitely opened my eyes to the pressing issues we face as youth and as citizens of this country. It helps piece together the many aspects that build our society and also brings out the problems that need to be addressed, Sheshadri pointed out adding that as a UN Youth Delegate her areas in focus are self-development, education, gender equality and the anti-ragging movement in universities.
Many groups I have worked with are motivated and have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish. Realizing that the future of Sri Lanka lies in the hands of a talented, motivated crowd of young people is reassuring. What remains is the need to give them a final push towards their goals, she stressed.
Queried on what she thinks is the most crucial issue concerning Sri Lankan youth today and prompt comes the answer.
Sri Lankan youth have lost faith in themselves. How can we blame them The socio-political landscape of this country is quite unforgiving and undoubtedly leads to a lot of issues; particularly among youth, who are a volatile segment of society. We lack the space and freedom to explore our options and because of this, seldom do we see young people breaking apart from traditional lives. Thinking outside the box is a risk that many hesitate to take and plenty of talent is lost in the process. Of course, we must be grateful for new programmes which are slowly emerging; promoting innovation and creativity. But such platforms dont always reach the far corners of the island - which is a shame. There is a lot of untapped potential in Sri Lanka. Young people are a gold-mine of resources but seldom are it seen that way.
The archaic misconception that young people are trouble-makers still exists in Sri Lanka, when in reality, if given a platform for expression. One can easily find trailblazing personalities in every part of the country, she said.
She proposes restructuring the education system as one means of solving the issue.
I know this has been said over and over again to no avail, but it is where we ought to begin. We need to change the way we educate ourselves and by this I mean, we need to start thinking ahead and prepare ourselves for future challenges instead of depending on outdated textbooks and replicating parroted answers onto an exam paper, Sheshadri adds.
One of her favourite quotes in life is Winston Churchills A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
I am a huge advocate of looking on the bright side and while this is often contested as being detached from reality, I firmly believe that our reality is what we make it out to be. Being optimistic and always trying to find good in anything you do, is important. It helps you find faith and the energy to keep moving, no matter how challenging a situation can be. An optimistic leader can boost the morale of everyone who looks up to them. In this day and age, where the world seems bleak and problematic, I look to leaders who have an inkling of faith in the goodness of people and are optimistic about what were capable of achieving, Sheshadri mused.
She aspires to continue her work for the humanitarian and development sector and be a part of the life-changing endeavours people make, globally.
I want to empower young people and help make Sri Lanka an example for the rest of the world. We are a nation that has endured a lot of grief and yet to this day, we remain hopeful and hungry for a better future. Its amazing how after all our people have gone through, we still have warmth and kindness in our hearts. This motivation is an inherent part of our identity and if nurtured properly, can help us move forward as a nation, Sheshadri said.
Dont be afraid to be who you are. The world will do everything in its power to make you feel insignificant, that your ideas arent normal and that your voice deserves to be drowned in a cacophony of nay-sayers. Dont let that hold you back. Work hard.
Develop your uniqueness. Appreciate your support system. Dont let anything dull your shine. As Dumbledore rightfully said, Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times. If only one remembers to turn on the light. Be that light, she concluded with a smile.

Call to establish Daycare Centre in Parliament
A proposal has made to establish a Day Care Centre in Parliament to look after the infants and children of female Members of Parliament, MP Dr. Thusitha Wijemanna said.
Addressing a workshop at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday on the theme of Breastfeeding and the working mother - A multi sectoral approach, she said that laws should be introduced to grant Paternity Leave for fathers, similar to that of other countries.
In the past, the family members were there to support the new mother, but today, only the husband is there to support the mother and infant, Dr.Wijemanna said.
MP. Dr.Sudarshini Fernandopulle said that employers and society try to portray that the 84 working days maternity leave granted for mothers as something negative.
But, this is an investment for the entire country. Today, Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are rapidly increasing in Sri Lanka. Breastfeeding prevents the possibility of developing NCDs when children become adults.If the infant passes urine six times per 24 hours, the mother had breastfed the infant adequately. The first 1,000 days of the babys life can be treated as the golden 1,000 days of any human beings life, Dr.Fernandopulle added.
Consultants stressed the importance of continuously breastfeeding infants for the first six months and continuing to do so along with complementary feeding. After introducing food, breastfeeding should be considered as a complementary food. Breastfeeding increases the IQ by 7 to 10 points. Breastfed babies have an IQ of 8.5 percent. Breast milk is something natural and changes instantly according the infants requirement various environmental conditions.
Infants milk powder (formula) is something artificial without the ability to change. They increase the possibility of developing various diseases and negative health conditions in infants and children especially when they become adults, Consultants added.

A mans unemotional confession
The narrative of Don Sumathipala better known as Hithumathe Jeevithe probably has no parallel in real life anywhere in the world. Depending on how they look at it, people may find it repugnant, incredible or admirable but certainly moving.
The gang-rape and murder of an Avurudu Kumari by a politician, the OIC of a police station, a school principal, a businessman and three others in 1972, has in itself much to say of what we call a modern civilised society in a Buddhist country.
The rape victims seventeen-year-old brother (Sumathipala, Hithumathe Jeevithe), who discovered the truth of his sisters disappearance, quietly vows to avenge the deed. Single handed and unwaveringly focused, he breaks out of jail four times and eliminates all of the therapists in his own way.
A television media person in an interview has brought out the events in the mans (Sumathipalas) unemotional confession.
Among many dramatic events, sharing a prison cell with two prominent personalities of Sri Lanka, one of whom later while in office acts fast to save the mans life seems a providential coincidence.
The terrible psychological forces unleashed in a human mind under the given circumstances need to be analysed and it may be possible to understand and forgive this wronged, extraordinary man who has been deprived by society of living a normal life.
Without a doubt, to me, he is a hero.

Clinical waste to be dumped in Muthurajawela
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has obtained land in Muthurajawela through a Cabinet paper to dump clinical waste collected from the state hospitals in the Western Province, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The private company which collected the clinical waste and destroyed it used a place inside the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital, but the process stopped after a court order prohibiting it. However, the place had the approval of the Central Environmental Authority.
Now the waste disposal company collects the waste and dumps it in another place temporarily, while destroying it gradually, using the system of the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital.
Meanwhile, the clinical waste issue of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) will be solved shortly, NHSL Director Dr. K. Wickramasinghe told the Daily News yesterday.
The institution which handles the task of removing clinical waste from all state hospitals faced an internal administrative issue recently and as a result it was forced to limit the daily clinical waste removal from all state hospitals and not only from NHSL, Dr. Wickramasinghe said.
But the institution removed clinical waste daily from all state hospitals, including the NHSL, and it is not true that the waste has not been removed for a period of one month.
There was a limit for daily removal and as a result, a part of the clinical waste collected inside the hospital, he said.
Chemicals were added to the waste left inside the hospital in order to maintain hygiene, he said.

Colombo Big Data Meetup powered by Virtusa
Industry professionals, big data enthusiasts, academics and students congregated at the latest edition of the Colombo Big Data Meetup held recently at the Virtusa auditorium.
Powered by Virtusa, the interactive sessions apprised participants of the latest developments in Big Data tools and technologies. Selvendra Selvarajah, Associate Architect at Virtusa and Sajeetharan Sinnathurai, Microsoft MVP and Senior Tech Lead at 99X Technology delivered the key note addresses of the evening.
The session kicked off with a presentation by Selvendra Selvarajah on the increasing use of R programming language in industry. A leading open source programing language consisting of powerful functions to tackle all problems related to Big Data processing, it has been used only in academics, historically.
Microsoft has begun including R language in their development process making it more popular than ever. This makes the lives of programmers that much easier as they can directly apply what they learn in university to real world situations, he said.
Sajeetharan Sinnathurai came in next and delved into the practical applications of sentiment analysis. He took the audience through the different steps involved in building a sentiment analysis solution using the Azure platform. A live demo was run to extract data from Twitter and, with the participation of the audience, sentiment analysis was applied on the resulting data.
The key to business has always been knowing what your customer wants and at a time where customers are constantly updating their social media with their thoughts and emotions that information has never been more accessible. However, unlocking the hidden value of that raw data can be tedious and overwhelming if we were to do it manually by reviewing every post ourselves,: said Sajeetharan Sinnathurai.
The Big Data meetup has been taking place each quarter since 2014 with the participation of many industry professionals and academics. The eventhas proven popular amongst its target audience with the community growing to almost 3000 strong. Having recognized this as a great platform to bring enthusiasts, students, academia and the industry together and engage and update them on the latest in the world of Big Data, Virtusa has been an active part of this forum, right from its inception.
Tharindu Buddhika, Senior Software Engineer, Commercial Bank of CeylonPLC, has been an active member of this community and a key organizer of the event since its inception.
When we started these sessions about four years ago Big Data was only an emerging field but we knew right then that it would play a big part in IT simply because at that time in history there was more data being created and collected than ever before,: said Tharindu.

Fast absorbing Body Yogurts by The Body Shop
Lifes too short for waiting. Which is why the new fast-absorbing Body Yogurts take just 15 seconds to absorb into your skin. Just 15 seconds a day is all it takes for a healthy-looking glow.

Next level body moisturising 
The Body Shop revolutionised body moisturising from a squirt to a scoop, introducing the first ever Body Butter.
And now, here comes another game-changing formula  one you can smooth on - and its set to completely transform the way you moisturize.
Six sensorial scents 
What makes Body Yogurts so special The refreshing gel-cream formula sinks into damp skin in seconds, providing 48 hours of lightweight moisture. Which means you can go from shower to jeans (or pyjamas) in 15 seconds. Its perfect for a morning or night routine, and is ideal for balmy tropical weather when you dont want a sticky finish. Added bonus: it gives your skin a healthy looking, year-round glow.
The entire range is 100 per cent vegan and available in Strawberry, Mango, Almond Milk, Coconut, Moringa, British Rose and special edition Banana - you wont be able to resist spooning it on.
When Im in a hurry, I sometimes struggle with thick moisturiser as it can feel wet and uncomfortable on my clothes. My favourite thing about The Body Shop Body Yogurts is how the gel-cream texture instantly absorbs into my skin, giving it a silky ultra sheer veil of hydration without feeling thick and greasy. My recommendation is to use the Body Yogurts on damp skin right after you shower because the hyaluronic acid and glycerin will help attract and seal in moisture to your skin. Body Yogurts deliver moisturisation for 48 hours, but can be used as many times a day as you want, for hydration without a heavy feel. The Body Shop Body Yogurts are ideal for everyone, especially if you are a reluctant moisturiser, explained Dr. Christine Choi Kim, Dermatologist for The Body Shop.
Organic almond milk from Spain
The Body Yogurts are all made with Community Trade organic almond milk sourced from Man in Alicante, Spain. The Body Shop have worked with Man since 2016.
They provide stability for the cooperative of local, small-scale farmers who extract our almond milk, using low-intensity farming methods. They use broken nuts that arent sold for food and turn unwanted almond husks into compost to help minimise waste.
The Moringa, British Rose and Banana Body Yogurts are also enriched with their own Community Trade ingredients  which are exciting new additions to The Body Shops unique Community Trade programme. The Body Shop Community Trade moringa extract comes from Rwanda, Community Trade English rose essence from Herefordshire, and Community Trade organic banana puree is from Ecuador.

Get your stress  out with a laugh
YWCA of Sri Lanka is a pioneer as early as 1882 in creating safe spaces for young women embarking on educational and professional pursuits away from their sheltered lifestyles. The womens facilities at the National YWCA Headquarters in Rotunda Gardens Colombo 3 was initiated to provide various facilities for aspiring young women in the 1970s at subsidized rates.
The present estimates of women of all ethnicities, religions, and economic strata who have walked through YWCA Hostel portals are over several thousands, while the demand for young womens safety is still significantly high. Between then and now the Hostel capacities have outgrown the increasing demands. Maintenance and refurbishment have become urgent. It is in keeping the vision of safe spaces for young women that we have organized a fund raiser to renovate and scale up facilities.
The fund raiser, Wilson Gunaratnes famous play Charitha Atak, will be staged on September 8 at the Bishops College Auditorium at 6.30pm, where the main actor will portray eight different characters, which is how the play gets its name, Charitha Atak. Tickets for the show are available at the National YWCA of Sri Lanka and the Bishops College Auditorium.
The headquarters of the YWCA of Sri Lanka is located in Colombo in the heart of the city, with easy access to most Universities, Colleges, Businesses and Government Offices. The land was gifted to the YWCA by Iranganie Peiris and the building was erected in 1976. The National YWCA building which is 45 years old comprises of three stories and houses the Office of the National YWCA, a Peace Room (for prayer and meditation), a Safe Space for Women (offers services to those in need of guidance in combating violence against women and HIV/AIDS), a Cafeteria and Kitchen, Hall and Board room, Hostel, and rooms for transient guests.
The hostel facilities in the original building were for only 75 students. Due to the demand for safe and affordable accommodation, the hostel now has a total of 170 hostellers. With this comes the need to repair and refurbish the 45 year old building.
Further, the building was designed by the renowned Architect Geoffrey Bawa. Therefore, it is of great architectural and historical value, enhancing the need for its refurbishment and maintenance to preserve its architectural design and historical significance.
The YWCA was initially founded in England in 1855 by Emma Roberts and Mary Jane Kinnaird and has its roots in a prayer group for women. Soon the Association established its first hostel for young women going out into the world and the first female training institution was founded shortly thereafter. The Colombo YWCA was born when Emily Kinnaird visited Ceylon in 1882 and met a group of women with similar aspirations. YWCAs were soon formed in other major Ceylonese cities such as Kandy, Galle, Panadura and Jaffna.
The National YWCA of Sri Lanka is affiliated to the World YWCA in Geneva, Switzerland, is the mother organization of 22 local Associations spread throughout the country. The YWCA, by its very constitution, recognises the equal value and inclusivity in Gods eyes, of all human beings without distinction of any kind and more particularly advocates against discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, gender, political opinion and so on.

Govt to implement modified inflation targeting framework
Sri Lanka will soon commence a modified inflation targeting framework said Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
Speaking at the oration to mark the 68th anniversary of the Central Bank he said that this is expected to be implemented form 2019 April. He said that a legal frame work in this regard is now been prepared. The governor also said that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will enter the stock market soon.
The fund has recently begun trading in the secondary government securities market, he said.
He added monetary authority has established sufficient safeguards to improve transparency and accountability in trading guidelines and improved fund management functions. The EPF withdrew from trading in the aftermath of investigations into the controversial bond trades in 2015 that sparked public outcry and the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry.
But, the EPF has already returned to trading on the secondary market, the Governor said adding that they are working towards EPF coming back to the stock market fairly soon once all the preparatory work is completed.
New investment and trading guidelines have been developed; surveillance system has been put in place. The segregation among front, middle and back offices has been made more entrenched, he added. He assured there is a new auction system in place which works effectively.
Meanwhile former Deputy Governor Central bank Dr W A Wijewardena speaking at the 68th anniversary of the Central bank said that the present management of the Central Bank (CBSL) has resolved itself to adopting a flexible inflation targeting system and is now in the process of converting its policy architecture to facilitate its full implementation shortly. This is a policy measure taken in the correct direction, he said.

Govt. to reduce loan burden by 2020 - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that measures are being taken to reduce the loan burden to 70 per cent of the total state revenue by 2020.
The state revenue in 2013 was Rs. 1,137 billion whild Rs.1,162 billion would have to be paid for loan installments and loan interest, the Prime Minister said.
We undertook an economy filled with loans, he said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the launch of the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme in Moneragala yesterday.
Over Rs. 40,000 million is needed to pay as compensation for loans obtained by the previous regime. The previous regime obtained loans to the tune of Rs.54,000 million from local banks for road construction activities. We paid the contractors since the previous government had not settled this money for the construction of 183 kilometres of roads from 2005 to 2015. But, the present government has already constructed 185 kilometres of roads. Construction work on the Central Expressway will be completed soon, the Prime Minister said.
A massive some of Rs.23,164 million was paid on behalf of the Internal Affairs Ministry for the activities conducted by the previous government. Furthermore, the highest ever amount of money was settled for the loans obtained for the Hambantota Harbour and Mattala Airport. In addition, colossal amounts of money has to be paid for various projects started by the previous regime, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said the present government is taking the country forward while strengthening the economy.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that when the government came to power, there was a huge dearth in various posts in the education sector. Accordingly, there was a shortage of 4,000 Principals, 854 Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service (SLEAS) personnel, a severe shortage of teachers and so on, during the period in which the then rulers boasted about uplifting the education sector.
We constructed 26,000 toilets in schools to fulfill the scarcity of sanitation facilities. But, this amount is still not sufficient to meet the requirement, the Prime Minister said.
He added that Rs.26,250 million was obtained as loans by SriLankan Airlines by 2015.
As a remedy to get rid of the loan burden of the previous regime, the present government had to obtain soft loans from the IMF and take several measures, including increasing VAT. Now the country is marching forward with economic stability, the Prime Minister added.
Thats why I said that we had to protect our wickets before starting to score runs. Gradually, we were able to score runs. The pragmatic policies introduced by the Government helped the country obtain the GSP Plus again and we were also able to re-enter the European market. The countrys fish exports has also increased during the past three years. Accordingly, the country received a revenue of US $ 11,000 million from the fisheries sector last year. But, I believe that this amount should be further increased, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
As promised, we have been able to create 700,000 jobs. These figures can be monitored from the statistics of the Employee Trust Fund (ETF) and Employee Provident Fund (EPF). Now, moves are underway to increase the number of tourist arrivals to the country to 2 million per annum, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister speaking further on the steps taken by the government for the wellbeing of the public, said eye lenses and stents are provided free. Unlike the previous government, cancer patients are allocated money without any limit. The price of 48 varieties of medicines have been reduced bringing a huge relief to the people.
Under the measures taken to uplift the education sector, 3,000 schools have been developed and upgraded under the Nearest school is the best school programme. All facilities have been provided for more than 1,000 secondary schools as well, he said.
The Suraksha Insurance Scheme was implemented to protect school children. Political interference and patronage has been done away with from the education sector, especially when enrolling teachers. The Mahapola bursary and other educational aid have also been increased, the Prime Minister added.
Under the Gamata Kotiyak Programme conducted by the Youth Council, Rs.1,000 million was granted for carrying out various development projects at village level, the Premier said.
Several road development and agriculture development projects have also been launched throughout the country, the Premier said.
All these projects have been initiated by the government without any fanfare, he said.
The biggest ever Free Trade Zone will begin operations on 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota. The Hambantota harbour is operating as a public and private venture while the Hambantota Airport will also be put to good use in future under a PPP project, the Premier said .
The Prime Minister said that people have not been asked to bare the burden of the Hambantota port and the airport anymore.
A Tourist Zone will be introduced along the highway system. Accordingly, a Tourist Zone will be set up in Galle, Haputale and a few other areas of the country, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier added that people can easily obtain loans under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme from state banks.
This is not similar to any other bank loan programme as it is designed to create entrepreneurs, he said.
At the opening ceremony of the exhibition, the Prime Minister distributed land deeds to 800 families from the Moneragala district.
The keys to a set of Suywaseriya ambulances were also handed over for the public service by the Prime Minister.
In addition, several rural and provincial roads will also be developed and all schools in the district without access to proper sanitation facilities will be provided with such facilities. School grounds and public playgrounds have also been earmarked to be developed via the Gamperaliya Programme to promote sports among schoolchildren.

Indigenous diet
The Sri Lankan Veddah community is usually described as indigenous as they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated in the country. Little has changed in their community and a number of books have been published on their customs, traditions, language, rituals, history and songs. In addition to this collection, Vedi Janayage Sampradayika Ahara Thakshnaya (Traditional Food Technology of the Sri Lanka Vedda People) written by Pujani Gunasekara reveals a deep study of the traditional food of the Vedda community published in Sinhala.
Their food is known to be highly nutritious and is said to be very healthy. The diet of this community consists of mainly meat and honey. For six months Gunasekara traveled back and forth from Colombo to Dambana assisted by her father, Gunasekara Gunasoma who is a folklore researcher and writer.
Their food has sustainability and is eco-friendly. They eat only fresh foods. There are three types of Veddas in Sri Lanka  they are the Gal Vedda, Gam (village) Vadda and Coastal Vedda (Weralabada Vedda). For my research I selected the Gam Vedda of Dambana area in Sri Lanka, said Gunasekara.
The Veddas of Sri Lanka are a people who know the jungle well. They are part of it. They understand the creatures of the jungle and have understood nature.
When procuring honey, they have insight into the activity of the bees and their characteristics. According to the bees behavior they can make a prediction about the right time to harvest the honey in the honey comb. They instinctively know how much honey can be harvested. Basically they understand the character of the honey comb. We who live in these urban areas do not have the instincts of these Veddas, and we do not know the ways of the forest like they do, explained Gunasekara.
Pujani Gunasekara
When it comes to hunting, their skills are have been honed to perfection. They possess with them knowledge passed down through centuries. They are shrewd hunters.
The can recognize the bird by the sound it makes and they can identify other animals through the sounds the animal makes. Because of these sharpened senses they hunter stealthily. They hunt in the jungle through a pre-conceived plan. Before setting out of their village they decide which animal it is that they are hunting and focus on that animal, said Gunasekara.
Gunasekara also pointed out that they only take from the land or hunt what they need. They only take what is sufficient and necessary for them. The vegetables and fruits they eat are all mixed composing of different kinds. As an Agriculture Graduate, Gunasekara feels that this is an excellent practice.
Another feature of these Veddas is their preparation of land for growing crops  zero tillage or minimum tillage. They dont disturb the soil structure and the environment. In modern agriculture we disturb the entire natural soil structure which is not eco-healthy, stated Gunasekara.
The Veddas also believe in not wasting anything. They are very frugal and thrifty. In that sense they are extremely practical and use food preservation methods.
`Atuwa preservation method Pictures by Ruwan De Silva
There are several methods they use to preserve the meat. One method is by smoking. It is done using a barbecue structure and the meat is placed on top of it. For this they use special firewood. Because when it comes to smoking, fire wood is different. This they know through the knowledge handed down through generations. The chemical compounds are not the same in every fire wood. They know which firewood to select even though they have no knowledge of chemistry, explained Gunasekara.
Gunasekara also pointed out that when you take the Balangoda Man who lived during Sri Lankas late Quaternary period there is a similarity between their foods and Veddas food.
The Vedda people have a very close relationship with their hunting dogs and take care of them well. These hunting dogs are specially trained. The Veddas do not hunt every animal. For example the cow and fowl is not hunted and eaten, said Gunasekara.
Uruwarige Gunabandiyalaththoo-Next Leader, Elder son of the present leader
The Veddas when they obtain the honey from the beehive they prepare it as it is. Gunasekara attributes this to sustainability in her opinion. Veddas know which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous. They have this indigenous knowledge. Another feature of the Veddas is that they have no specific intervals like urban dwellers and rural folk. They have no breakfast, lunch and dinner. When they feel the hunger they hunt and eat.
For us when cooking we sometimes use lime. But with the Veddas they use a special kind of leaf which gives a citrus taste. We use artificial flavours in our food, which is not very advisable health wise. But they use natural flavours. For example they take the pumpkin seeds and they dry it and then they blend and make flour which is used as a flavour for the vegetables, pointed out Gunasekara.
Gunasekara added that other researchers have done research about the Veddah people, concentrating on the social aspects with little focus on a scientific background of their food like her.
Their food is not artificial. It is very eco-friendly and natural. Their food habit and food patterns and how they cook, are the special features of the Veddah community. Honey is very nutritious and has many properties that are very healthy. They use pure honey. Veddah Chief Vannila Aththo told me that their secret to long life is their food pattern. Their food habits are identical to the food habits of their most ancient grandfathers. Our broiler chicken is very artificial but this is not so with their meat. They are a part of the jungle and they never use artificial chemicals in their food or in their preservative methods. Their long lives can be attributed to their lifestyles, explained Gunasekara.
Firing
Gunasekara has attended the University of Ruhuna Agricultural faculty and studied Agriculture Resource Management and Technology. During her undergraduate life she has conducted extensive research.
My father is a researcher and a writer. And that background helped me. When I was at Ruhuna University there was a very good environment in our faculty for research. One reason I have been so successful in my research is because of the training I received at Ruhuna. There are ample resources and the academic staff are very supportive. There is a great library and we were shown the correct path at Ruhuna. I must say that I am very much encouraged by my Vice Chancellor who commented on my book. I think there has to be a discourse in society about non-communicable diseases and make people aware of them, said Gunasekara.

Justice for the Disappeared
Some men arrive. They force their way into a familys home, rich or poor, in a city or in a village. They come at any time of the day or night, usually in plain clothes, sometimes in uniform, always carrying weapons. Giving no reasons, producing no arrest warrant, frequently without saying who they are or on whose authority they are acting, they drag off one or more members of the family towards a car, using violence if necessary. This is often the first act in the drama of an enforced or involuntary disappearance, a heinous violation of human rights.
This is how the United Nations describes enforced disappearances which have frequently been used as a strategy to spread terror within society. According to the UN, an enforced disappearance occurs when persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty by officials of different branches or levels of Government, or by organised groups or private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons outside the protection of the law.
The feeling of insecurity generated by this practice is not limited to the close relatives of the disappeared, but also affects the society as a whole. Since most of the disappeared are in the prime of their youth, the society as a whole is affected. Today (August 30), the world will focus on this serious issue on the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances. Having been removed from the protective powers of the law and disappeared from society, the victims are in fact deprived of all their rights and are at the mercy of their captors. Some of the human rights that enforced disappearances regularly violate are: The right to recognition as a person before the law; The right to liberty and security; The right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; The right to life, when a disappeared person is killed; The right to a fair trial; The right to an effective remedy, including reparation and compensation and the right to know the truth regarding the circumstances of a disappearance. Even if death is not the final outcome and the victim is eventually released, physical and psychological scars of this form of dehumanization remain for life.
The International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances is especially significant for Sri Lanka in the context of the recently established Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and also in the context of many enforced disappearances prior to 2015. The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has recorded 12,000 cases of enforced disappearances related to the Southern uprisings and the armed conflict in the North and the East from 1980 to 2009. A particularly horrendous episode was the use of Goni Billas (Masked Men) during the 1988-89 periods to identify suspected insurgents. The insurgents too abducted their political enemies. Most of the victims were never seen alive again. Among the most high-profile disappearances in recent memory are cases involving journalists Richard De Zoysa, whose mutilated body was later found, and Prageeth Ekneligoda, who is still missing. Several other abducted journalists including Poddala Jayantha and Keith Noyahr were lucky to escape, albeit with injuries inflicted by their captors, thanks to telephone calls placed by influential politicians apparently to the powers that be who controlled the abductors. Investigations are now underway into these cases and several arrests have been made. Today, after the advent of the National Unity Government in 2015, there are absolutely no white van abductions and journalists and everyone else can breathe easy as a result.
The OMP is a golden opportunity to address the issue of disappeared and missing persons in this country. We cannot think of a bright future without addressing and probing these bleak spots in our recent history. All disappearances must be investigated  it is only then can we find the truth and take steps to avoid this abhorrent crime in the future. The massive reception received by the OMP in both the North and the South is a testimony to the desire of parents and families to find out the fate of their loved ones. As for the allegations that war heroes are being targeted by the OMP and other judicial probes, nothing could be further from the truth. Legal action is being pursued against a very few members of the Armed Forces because evidence points out that they had acted beyond their mandate outside the theatre of war. The OMP mechanism is also actually an opportunity to find out about the fate of captured and missing Security Forces members. Every Sri Lankan family where someone is missing is suffering in silence, unable to seek closure. As Sri Lankans, it is our duty to find the answers and put these dark chapters behind us.

Lankas first unanimous cooperative policy ready after a decades work
After a decade of country-wide efforts involving eight million members, the first ever national policy for Sri Lankas historic cooperative sector has finally arrived at Cabinet levels for ultimate approval.
Once the approval by the Cabinet of Ministers for the National Cooperative Policy (NCP) submitted by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen is granted, NCP will become the sole framework of reference and guidebook for Sri Lankas coop sector way forward.
The 111 year old Sri Lankan cooperative sector employs 46,000 and packs a membership total of a little over 8 million. The Lankan cooperatives assets and savings base is estimated at huge Rs 418,416 million. At present there are 14,454 cooperatives -in various productions, services, SMEs, womens development, rural banking, insurance and farming -active across Sri Lankas nine provinces.
After a decade, the policy has been finally approved this year by Cooperative Ministers of all Provincial Councils, District Cooperative Councils and regional cooperative officials (representing their 8 million members) unanimously. This go-ahead by the entire Lankan coop sector is the first such unanimous approval given by this sector for the NCP, whose work began way back in 2008 and subsequently undergoing multiple revisions under different governments.
This year, a decade later, subsequent to many rounds of NCP stakeholder consultations in Colombo led by Minister Bathiudeen and his Ministry of Industry and Commerce and that began in 2016, the NCP was finalised with International Labour Organisation (ILO) backing and has been submitted for Cabinet approval by the Ministry on Minister Bathiudeens directions.
Among the main themes of the new NCP are modernising the coop sector in par with other cooperative movements in the world, bringing in ICT, introducing self-financing, good governance, financial and credit methods, involving more youth and women in the sectors next stage and simplifying the legal set-up for the sector to be more viable.
Given the cooperatives importance to Sri Lankan consumer lives it is time we officially step in and support the sector to develop it. Minister Bathiudeen said.

Disneys train of live-action adaptations just continues rolling, and it doesnt look like itll slow down any time soon. With Mulan, The Lion King, Dumbo, and Aladdin already in production, the studio now has its sights set on the story of the puppet-turned-real boy, Pinocchio.
The live-action Pinocchio movie has been in development for some time, with Paddington director Paul King taking over the film earlier this year. While details about the movie, and its development schedule, have been scarce to this point, its writer has finally revealed when filming is set to begin: next year.
While speaking to Latino-Review Media, writer Chris Weitz said that the Pinocchio script is currently being worked on, and the goal is to begin shooting next year in Europe.
Its going to shoot in England and Italy starting next year, Weitz said.
Were still in the early stages of, you know, development and developing the script, so theres no casting to talk about, but Im very excited about it.
By the way it sounds, any information about Pinocchio is still a long way off. Weitz, who also penned the script for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is currently promoting his directorial debut, Operation Finale. Given that hes busy with that projects release, the Pinocchio script likely wont be finished until later this year. Comic Book

Kalana, the elephant of the Vishnu Devale in Devinuwara will be handed over to the Dehiwala Zoo or the elephant orphanage at Pinnawala following complaints of abuse, Wildlife officials said.
Wildlife Minister Sarath Fonseka earlier said elephants being kept in temples and devales will be sent to zoological gardens if they are mistreated.
Two persons, arrested for allegedly neglecting the elephant Kalana, were released on a Rs. 100,000 surety bail each, when produced before the Matara Magistrate on Tuesday.
Kalanas mahout and the Secretary to the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya Basnayake Nilame were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly neglecting the elephant.
Kalana had been chained at the same place in the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya for about three years. As a result, its legs had been injured and infected. The arrests were made following a Police complaint lodged by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma and Wildlife Department officials on Monday.
The Deputy Minister intervened after environmentalists and social media activists brought the matter to his attention.
The veterinarians of the National Zoological Gardens Department have started treating the elephant. They inspected the elephant on Saturday.
The elephant was gifted to the Devalaya in 1989 by former President the late Ranasinghe Premadasa. The next date of the court case was fixed for September 9.

Mobitel was the first to commercially deploy 4.5G/4G+ in South Asia, and the network expansion will also include upgrades to keep Sri Lanka at the forefront of technology leadership by offering wider coverage of 4.5G/4G+, NB-IoT (Narrow Band Internet of Things) services to its customers, and modernizing its network with NFV/SDN technologies and host of other next generation platforms to make it more agile, thus paving the way for easy adoption of 5G in the near future.
The CEO of Mobitel, Nalin Perera said, Mobitel is committed to invest in network expansions, bringing the latest in mobile technology to Sri Lanka on par with global standards. 4.5G will act as a bridge for the eventual adoption of the 5G standard, while bringing significant improvements to Mobitels existing 4G network by allowing them to handle more data-intensive applications such as HD Voice with MP3 level quality, Ultra HD Entertainment, Ultra Dense Sensor Networks, AR/VR based Advanced Gaming LTE based broadband trunking systems (LiTRA) etc. Our expansion is ongoing and will further improve speeds and end user experience.
We are maintaining our leadership by executing some of the fastest expansions and will continue to do so in order to maintain our market position, he said.
Mobitels partnership with Citibank for network investments is pivotal in achieving its future plans. Commenting on the partnership, the Citi Country Officer, Ravin Basnayake said, We are pleased to partner Mobitel on their rapid network expansion drive. We are honored to have had the opportunity to bring Citibanks financial expertise to support Mobitels aspirations of achieving regional technology leadership position. We look forward to working with Mobitel as they transform the industry.
Having launched the first Super-3.5G HSPA network in South Asia in December 2007, and subsequently trialed HSPA+, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) in 2009, another first in the region, Mobitel went on to demonstrate 4G-LTE technology also for the first time in South Asia in 2011.
Accordingly, Mobitel launched its 4G-LTE Network in 2013 to provide unparalleled broadband experience to Sri Lankans. Keeping ahead with pioneering new technologies, Mobitel trialed 4.5G LTE-Advanced Pro Technology with CA (Carrier Aggregation) of three bands, again for the first time in South Asia in June 2016. In 2017, Mobitel was able to deploy the first Sub-1G Mobile Broadband Network in Sri Lanka based on 900MHz spectrum innovatively to provide superior coverage some rural areas of the country. On February 1, 2018 Mobitel launched the first commercial 4.5G/4G+ Mobile Network in South Asia.

Disappearance of 11 students:
MOVES UNDERWAY TO ARREST CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday ordered the CID to take necessary action to arrest former Navy Commander and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne.
The order was made on condition that there is sufficient evidence to prove that he had aided and abetted Navy officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath to evade courts regarding the magisterial inquiry into disappearance of 11 youths.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order when the Magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 was taken up for inquiry yesterday.
Chief Inspector Nishantha Silva of the Criminal Investigation Department informed court that there is sufficient evidence to support that CDS Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne acted in a manner to prevent the tenth suspect Lt. Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi being arrested over the disappearance of 11 youths in Colombo.
Meanwhile, Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath arrested in connection with the abduction, torture, extortion and murder of 11 persons in 2008 and 2009 was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till September 12 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
Court was informed that Attorney Ajith Prasanna had appeared on behalf of Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi during the previous magisterial inquiry without the suspects consent or his instructions. Counsel Kalpa Perera appearing on behalf of the suspect told court yesterday that his client had never given instructions to Attorney Ajith Prasanna to act on behalf of him.
The tenth suspect had been impersonating a guard named Polwattage Gallage Ashoka with a fake National Identity Card. He had been working as a guard in an estate in Dompe.
Hettiarachchi was in the Sri Lanka Navy in the rank of Lt. Commander. He was wanted by police in connection with kidnapping for ransom, illegal detention and murder of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
Previously, he had been issued an open warrant to be arrested by the Fort Magistrates Court.
The CID is currently investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth and several navy personnel have been arrested in this connection including former Navy spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake.
The CID is investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth based on a written complaint by then Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the DIG CID on May 28, 2009 against his personal security officer, then Lt. Commander Nilantha Sampath Munasinghe following which the CID was able to uncover the Navys involvement with the abductions.
Those abducted were Kasthuriarachchilage John Rit alias John, Rajiv Naganathan alias Malli, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Tillakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohomed Sajith, Jamamdeen Dilan, Amalan Leon, Roshan Leon, Anthony Kasthuriarachchi, Theagaraja Jegan and Mohomed Ali Anver alias Hajiyar.
OIC of CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Chief Inspector Nishantha Silva appeared for the prosecution.
Counsel Kalpa Perera appeared for the suspect. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved party.

Online system for health care programme applications
The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry has introduced an online system for the submission of applications for training programmes conducted for health care professionals in order to accelerate the recruitment process.
The Gazette notification will be issued tomorrow (31) for the recruitment of trainees for 12 training programmes including nurses, paramedics etc.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, Deputy Director General (Education, Training and Research) of the Health Ministry Dr. Sunil de Alwis said that according to the previous system, it took around one and a half years to complete the recruitment process, but under the new system, it will take around two to three months to complete the process.
Since the online system has been introduced for the first time this year, we have decided to accept the applications under the new online system as well as those forwarded under the previous system, he said.
Health Ministry Human Resources Director Dr. Dilith de Silva said the online system is not a new concept for applicants since it has the same features of the online system introduced four or five years ago by the UGC for the submission of applications for university admissions. The IT Department of the Moratuwa University is the technical partner of both institutions.
According to the software developed with the assistance of the Moratuwa University, we can check the Advanced Level Examination results of the applicants within a few seconds since their NIC number and index number are linked to the Department of Examinations. Earlier, we had to wait for months to verify these results, he added.
Earlier, the Health Ministry issued two Gazette notifications with regard to the recruitment of Pupil Nurses and Paramedical trainees. This year, one Gazette notification will be issued for the recruitment of trainees for 12 training programmes and it will be issued on August 31.

Open economy: A friend or foe of the poor
The Deputy Leader of United National Party and Minister of Housing Sajith Premadasa recently called for an open economy with a human face. He said it is the right way to establish a just society.
Mr. Premadasa added, It must be understood that full-blown capitalism is not the order of the day. A just and fair society can only be established through systems, structures and procedures that are based on benevolence capitalism. To use a more apt phrase, a just society could be established through capitalism with a human face.
Sri Lanka has over four decades of experience in open economy. Economists since Adam Smith and David Ricardo, writing in the 18th and 19th Centuries, recognized the benefits of open economies for consumers, investors and nations as a whole. Today, most nations operate open economies to varying degrees and are quite aware of the benefits it brings in.
For consumers, the advantage of an open economy is a greater variety of goods and services from which to choose. At the same time, competition among producers results in lower prices and improved services. These are the two major advantages for consumers.
The benefits of an open economy are not limited to consumers. Global interaction allows companies to gain access to customers in other nations. U.S. brands as McDonalds, Apple and Starbucks, and Finnish communications giant Nokia, amongst others, have established worldwide customer bases including Sri Lanka
For investors, an open economy expands their opportunities to invest in companies of other nations having open economies.
Yet, there are also drawbacks in open economies.
Since open economies are interdependent, they are exposed to certain unavoidable risks. For example, fluctuations in income, prices and employment etc., originating in one economy, will spread to other economies also.
And, there are also footloose funds. Large amounts of footloose (or highly speculative type) funds are moving around the world in search of places where they can be parked (that is, invested temporarily) within reasonable level of safety and return.
Certain varieties of imports can expose an open economy to undue political, economic and cultural risks. Examples are imports essential for defence, health care, energy needs, food needs, and the like.
Finally, large scale increase in international capital flows has resulted in problems like heavy indebtedness of certain developing countries and their inability to repay their debts. Sri Lanka is a good example.
These are the major pluses and minuses of open economy. Being a veteran politician, Mr. Premadasa would have been fully aware of those points.
Disparity in wealth
Therefore, for any sensible person, it is quite appropriate for him to talk of a human face for open economy. Unlike many politicians, Mr. Premadasa has not forgotten the Governments prime obligation to the people  which is, to provide a dignified life to many millions who do not enjoy even the basic necessities of life.
Past four decades experience in our country would have shown him that when the space for economic activity expands for the private sector, it is the people with the necessary resources that profit best. Hence, their incomes rise faster than those who do not possess such advantages.
That is why Matale, Matara, Kegalle and Ampara have countrys high unemployment rates while Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha do not. That is why, rural and estate sector contributes 92 per cent for the total poverty in Sri Lanka while urban areas contribute only 8 per cent. The so-called benefits of our open economy have not proportionately flowed down to the rural and estate sectors where the most of the poor live.
Dilemma
Open economy also comes with a requirement that the government shrinks itself. When it happens, it reduces the scope for the government to intervene on behalf of the weak and needy. The ability of the government to bring more people to participate in economic activity is curtailed.
Therefore, if we are to accede to Mr. Premadasas request, a type of conceptual dilemma will arise for both reforms - withdrawing the government from activities that the private sector could carry on profitably - and also to create a human face - redoubling the involvement of the government where only the government can mediate.
The problem for Sri Lanka economic experts is to translate the concept into reality.
Human face
What exactly, is meant by open economy with a human face Economists have their own high-wrought definitions. But in simple terms it means pro-growth reforms which are strengthened by pro-human resource development programmes.
While the former means withdrawal and disengagement of the government, the latter requires (as Mr. Premadasa rightly said) re-defining the systems, structures and procedures of the government. One important item of the re-definition is the drastic restructuring of the governmental organisations.
Politically, is the Government ready for this difficult task
Even currently the government is disposing funds and resources meant for strengthening the poor. Therefore, one might ask whether there is much purpose in pushing more resources through a corroded and clogged delivery channel that the Sri Lankas top-to-bottom bureaucratic machinery is.
Bureaucracy
Bureaucracies are not by nature bad. They are available in every country in the world  developed and developing. In general, there is a wide range of thinking about the value of bureaucracies and work done by bureaucrats; it leads some to devote thought to how bureaucracies can be made more effective in what they do.
Here in Sri Lanka, our problem is our bureaucracy is not built for crisp decision making. However, we must not confuse our public bureaucracy with slow thinking public officers because they have functions that are largely not associated with decision making. Our bureaucracy is focused on decision rights, not decision making.
Most governmental bureaucracy is the result of crossed purposes and multiple groups who disagree on the desirability of certain results. They keep on pushing papers round and round, and then the actual decision goes to a person who does not understand the subject at all.
Action plan
In business today, effective processes for decision making are associated with words like speed, agility, and ambidexterity - characterized by fewer filters through which decisions have to be processed and fewer people who have veto power over ideas, good or bad. Authority is delegated along with responsibility. Everyone acts in the best interests of the organisation, assuming knowledge of the objectives and acceptable ways of achieving them.
That is in contrast to our bureaucracy, which is, according to this writer an administrative system in which the need or inclination to follow rigid or complex procedures impedes effective action.
In this situation, our immediate issue is clear. We have to find ways of capturing the deliberative advantages of bureaucratic decision processes without paying the price of so many meetings, delays, decision screens, and vetoes.
Unless the government has an action plan to make bureaucracy responsive like the private sector, the concept of open economy with a human face would remain an empty and worse, a misleading slogan. If a good action plan can be implemented with commitment, before long, bureaucratic delivery channels can be cleared of the debris.
The question for Sri Lanka is whether the ruling alliance would stand united in shrinking, re-sizing and restructuring the government to present its human face.
If it does not, open economy with a human face would not only fail to deliver on human resource development but would also pull down the economys growth impetus.

Perfect peepers!
Come morning, the lack of sleep is clearly evident on our face. Having dark rings is a common beauty complaint among women. Besides trying a variety of under eye creams, there have been effective home remedies which give wonderful results after daily applications. So refresh your tired peepers with a help from these well verse tips from experts.
Guidelines to prevent dark circles
* To reduce puffiness, a temporary cause of dark circles, change your sleeping habits. Sleep on your back, elevating your head with one or more pillows. Gravity lets fluid buildup drain away.
* Sleep well (doctors advise at least eight hours sleep daily) to have a fresh and circle-free face. Lots of sleep means less stress and thus less puffiness.
*Control allergies and the puffiness they cause. Take proper medication for allergies to airborne materials like flour or smoke. If you have dust allergies, make your bedroom as dust-free as possible: use bare floors, put dust covers on mattress and pillows, and remove or cover upholstered furniture, clothes, books, and papers.
* Remove all eye make-up, like eyeliner and mascara, before going to sleep. Anything that irritates eyes can leave them watery and puffy.
* Use a Neti-Pot to rinse the nasal passages, to relieve sinus infections and hay fever that cause puffiness under the eyes.
* Daily exercise circulates blood throughout the body and the face, reducing puffiness. Concentrate on yoga too, which stimulates your breathing, leaving fresh skin.
* To eradicate morning puffiness and bluish colour, apply something that cools the skin and the capillaries beneath it, reducing swelling and making the blood vessels less visible. Apply cucumber or potato slices, chilled spoons, or bags of ice water to the area around the eye for up to an hour and a half.


*Include plenty of green vegetables, fruits, and vitamins in your diet. Eat seasonal fruit like bananas, mangoes, and oranges, along with vegetables like spinach, greens, carrots, and brinjals (eggplant).
* Include plenty of iron in your diet, from whole grains, legumes, eggs, or iron supplements.
* Reduce salt in your diet to reduce puffiness.
* Arrange your life to reduce stress. Stress releases cortisol, which causes increased blood volume and puffiness, and has other undesired effects.
* Stay hydrated; dehydration causes thin and sagging skin. Use moisturizer. Limit cigarettes and alcohol.
* To keep looking young years longer, protect your face and eyes from the sun. Ultraviolet light from the sun destroys protein in the skin. Use sunscreen and a hat when you go out.

Philippines hunt festival bombers
THE PHILIPPINES: Philippine authorities were hunting on Wednesday two men believed to have planted the explosives that killed two people, including a young girl, at a festival in the nations south.
The blast late Tuesday in the town of Isulan, which wounded 35 others, is the second deadly bombing in less than in a month in the region where Islamist militants have waged a decades-long insurgency.
A man left the improvised bomb in a bag near a grocery store as crowds gathered to celebrate the towns founding anniversary but he and an accomplice escaped, the military said.
One (man) did the emplacement while the other one (drove) the getaway motorcycle, Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana told AFP, adding a manhunt was underway.
The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, is the latest violence in the south of the mainly Catholic archipelago where a long-running Islamist insurgency has left more than 100,000 people dead by government count.
Sobejana said it was highly likely that the pro-IS Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) plotted the bombing.
A military spokesman said the blast could have been in retaliation for offensives against the BIFF, adding the group had planned bomb attacks in parts of the southern region of Mindanao.
They want to create and sow terror in the area, regional military spokesman Captain Arvin Encinas told AFP, adding two soldiers were among the wounded.
The attack comes less than a month after a van bomb ripped through a military checkpoint on the neighbouring island of Basilan on July 31, killing 10 people.
IS claimed responsibility for that bombing as well and authorities believe the man behind the wheel of the explosives-laden van may have intended to target a nearby childrens parade.
President Rodrigo Duterte put Mindanao under martial rule until the end of this year after pro-IS militants seized the southern city of Marawi last year.
On Wednesday, Dutertes aides condemned the bombing saying it could prompt the President to extend martial law in the area.
The recent blasts follow the Duterte government enacting a law to create greater autonomy for the Muslim minority in the south and which is hoped will help end the conflict.
The mother of the girl who died in Tuesdays bombing pleaded with authorities for justice.
I hope they help us and catch the perpetrators, Nezel Alayon said in between tears. - AFP

Piyadasa Sirisena and his impact on the public sphere
This narrative on Piyadasa Sirisena and his role in the public sphere in the early decades of the 20th Century is in remembrance of his 143rd birth anniversary. Mr. Sirisena was born on August 31, 1815.
But before we proceed further it is important to define the public sphere so that it will hopefully add clarity to this article.
The public sphere as a key component of general life emerged into limelight in the 17th and 18th Centuries in Europe.
It was seen as a social development which was connected to influencing the mindset of people.
It was additionally considered a part of the democratic process that first evolved itself during the same time  more especially the right to discuss matters pertaining to life.
The public sphere and the world of letters
According to Professor Wimal Dissanayake, an eminent critic on films and literature, the world of letters made its mark within the public sphere, as society progressed itself adding yet another dimension to the discourse. It was however made more complex by secular thought, religion and the march of civilization.
It is important to remember that this country was a colonial state for more than four centuries.
The impact of colonialism on the social fabric, the cultural values, the economy and the plight of people under colonial rule, should be an essential part of this discussion.
Colonialism  its strains
According to the noted Indian Social Analyst Ashis Nandy, colonialism had two strains. One strain impacted on the land colonized as a result of the exploitation of such land, and the other had a harmful effect on the minds of people or in other words by the colonization of the mind.
It was in particular the second strain that led to the emergence of one of the most influential cultural revivalists of the early 20th Century, Piyadasa Sirisena.
It was he who reshaped the mindset of the fallen Sinhala race in that divisive social climate imposed by alien rule.
Certainly it was a force of change as pointed out by the likes of the German philosopher Jurgen Habermas. The public sphere is a domain of social life, where such things as public opinion can be formed where citizens deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion, to express or publicise their views. Despite the controls on other aspects of life through governance enforced by the British, they did not (except in 1915) curb publications and meetings conducted by people.
As in Europe, Ceylon too the newspapers and magazines played a particularly important role in the revivalist activities of the people at the helm of public life.
In a previous article on this subject the writer referred to a book published by Ven. Kalukodiyawe Panasekere Thera titled the history of newspapers and magazines in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries which period could rightly be called the period of enlightenment. That era saw an unprecedented rise in the print media in this island.
The novel and the Sinhala public sphere
Piyadasa Sirisena is called the father of the Sinhala novel. He is credited with having published the first Sinhala novel Vasanawanthe Vivahaya or Jayatissa and Rossalyn in 1904. It became exceedingly popular fiction and ran into four quick reprints during those early years.
Modern day critics like the eminent Professor Sunanda Mahendra who considers Piyadasa Sirisena a great visionary of the 20th Century has written extensively on Sirisenas novels which awakened the dormant Sinhalese of the last Century. In other words Sirisena was a powerful agent of change.
Sirisena who authored 19 novels in a life of vigorous literary activity that lasted 38 years is also considered the pioneer in writing novels of advocacy.
Besides the above he is credited with being the first to venture into social inquiry.
Perhaps the most lucid definition of social inquiry has been made by Professor Sarathchandra Wickramasuriya in an article published in 1986 in a book on Sinhala Literature and the work of Piyadasa Sirisena.
This novelist had gone deeply into the society prevalent at that time, the various strata of society, their lives and their foibles notes Wickramasuriya.
Sinhala Jatiya newspaper
Besides the Sinhala Novel, in a few other areas covering the public sphere, Sirisena made a noteworthy contribution. One was through the newspaper he published the Sinhala Jatiye which was a popular source of discourse and extolled this countrys rich cultural past. It was also an active organ of anti-colonial struggles.
The Sinhala Jatiya also reported on the Indian freedom movement and the struggle against the British spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru whom Sirisena admired.
Temperance movement
Sirisena was opposed to the British liquor policy of that time and he joined the temperance movement interacting with its leaders who utilized his newspaper and his oratorical skills at the temperance meetings in various parts of the country.
According to Professor Wiswa Warnapala, Anagarika Dharmapala and Piyadasa Sirisena, the two principal national revivalists of that era paved the way for political reformation in the 1930s.
History of that period also shows that Sirisena was associated in creating the Sinhala Maha Saba.
Piyadasa Sirisenas contribution to the restoration of national self respect if not pride and our age old cultural values through his extensive public sphere activity, should be afforded more recognition in the annuals of history of the country of early 20th Century.

Pre-election fever hits all-time high
Provincial council elections which have become a bone of contention between the major political parties looks set to be postponed yet again after the events of last week when the vote on the Delimitation Committee Report for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils was defeated in Parliament.
In a rare show of apparent political unity, all major political groups including the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the Joint Opposition (JO) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) voted against the Report, albeit for very different reasons. The final tally was 139 votes against the Report, with no votes for it.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was absent at the time of voting. Ironically, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha who presented the Delimitation Committee Report to Parliament also voted against it.
The Delimitation Committee comprised of Kanagaratnam Thavalingam, retired Surveyor General, Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranaike, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank, Professor S.H. Hisbullah, Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Election Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena. Unfortunately, Prof. Hisbullah passed away following a sudden ailment soon after the report was defeated in Parliament.
Effectively, the defeat of the Report means that provincial council elections are almost certain to be delayed further, even though party leaders in Parliament had in late July arrived at a decision to conduct the polls on January 5, 2019.
Provincial Council elections
Elections to three provincial councils in the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and the East are now overdue. Polls will soon be due in the Central, North Western and Northern Provinces. By March next year, elections will also be due in the Western and Southern Provinces while polls should be called in the Uva Province by September 2019.
The Delimitation Committee Report was necessary because the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 was enacted in Parliament in September last year and was signed in to law by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya a few days after it was approved by Parliament. This Act calls for a major overhaul of the electoral system.
The proposed new system, which has now been legislated for, envisages a hybrid between the proportional representation (PR) system and the Westminster style first past the post system which allows for representation for specific electoral areas. Presently, elections to local government institutions are held under this mixed system.
Although Parliament approved this system for provincial councils as well when it enacted the new legislation last September, political parties are now wary of it after their experiences at the local council elections held in February this year. Hence the frantic moves to revert to the PR system.
The UNP, TNA and the JO are all advocating a return to the PR system as are minority parties. The latter in particular increased their representation through the PR system over the past three decades and are now loath to revert to a system which will undoubtedly reduce their chances of having members in local and provincial councils.
However, the biggest stumbling block to reaching a resolution is the lack of a consensus among political parties as to which system serves the country best, with all parties naturally attempting to safeguard their own interests. The polls are further hamstrung by the fact that Parliament, having already approved a hybrid system, requires a two-third majority to make changes to that system, a majority that would be difficult to obtain if one major political party refuses to co-operate.
Hence the likelihood of further delays in the conduct of provincial polls. In the latest move to break the deadlock, a five-member committee, headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on Tuesday to review the Delimitation Committee Report and suggest recommendations. The other members of this committee are R.M.A.L. Ratnayake, Periyasamy Muthulingam, Professor P. Balasundarampillai and Dr. A.S.M. Naufal.
However, it is unlikely that this committee could meet, make recommendations, have them approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament for elections to be conducted by January 2019. Given the tasks that need to be completed prior to that, this would be an optimistic timeline.
Despite all parties rejecting the Delimitation Committee Report, different parties attribute different reasons for their decision. The JO, for instance, states that the hybrid system does not reflect the aspirations of the public. Although voting against the Report and effectively contributing to the delay in conducting provincial council elections, the JO is also accusing the government of deliberately dragging their feet to delay the polls.
Buoyed by its first outing as a political entity in the form of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which swept the board at the local government polls in February, the JO feels it can capitalise on provincial council elections, if they are held. With presidential and general elections due in 2020, the JO feels that provincial polls in 2019 would be the ideal springboard to generate a political advantage.
Presidential elections 2020
It is precisely the same concern that is worrying the UNP and the SLFP, the latter in particular as it came a distant third in the local government elections. Both parties are now working overtime to get their grassroots party networks and election machineries in to top gear and are mapping out various development programmes at the electorate level. They are therefore not as keen to test the political waters before their efforts bear fruit, knowing that a negative outcome could have a snowballing effect on national elections.
It has also been pointed out that presidential elections, though due in 2020, could also be held in 2019 if President Maithripala Sirisena was inclined to do so. It is now all but a certainty that President Sirisena will run again for President- although he is yet to announce this formally - and being the incumbent, he does have the advantage of calling the election at a time that would give him the best prospects.
This is all the more relevant due to the confusion in the ranks of the JO. For several months now, it was assumed that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the frontrunner to be the JO candidate although there were rumblings of dissent from within the JO camp itself at this prospect. Besides, Rajapaksa has to renounce his United States citizenship which he is yet to do.
Now, in an about turn, the JO is suddenly seeking to clarify whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could be a candidate for a third time. This is a process that is time consuming, requiring legal action that needs to be then referred to the Supreme Court for that court to make a determination.
In such circumstances where the time factor is of the essence, calling an early presidential election while the JO is still trying to get its act together, would confer an inherent advantage to other major parties. It is unlikely that this would have escaped the attention of strategists in the mainstream SLFP who want President Sirisena to stand for President again.
If the prospect of a snap presidential election emerges, provincial council election would of course take a back seat. This, and the fact that the major political parties are still squabbling over which system suits the provinces best, must mean that the next provincial council polls are many months away.

President to hold discussions with university dons
A series of discussions are being held to receive feedback from universities academics after the launch of the National Sustainability Discourse.
This discussion with university academics consists of two rounds, and the second round is scheduled to be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena in the near future.
Discussions were already held at the Colombo University, Sabaragamuwa University and the Open University, and during these meetings, the challenges faced by Sri Lanka as a middle-income country in formulating sustainable development policies in the fields of education, transport, agriculture and industrialisation were discussed.
The National Sustainability Discourse aims to create a broad dialogue in all fields, including with the public, politicians and academics, to ascertain the vision for Sri Lankas sustainability development.
These meetings will be held with the participation of vice chancellors of the universities, the Presidential Expert Committee Chairman Prof. Mohan Munasinghe and other members.
Steps have been taken to hold a series of meetings at ministry level regarding the Sustainable Sri Lanka Vision, from next week.
According to the statement made by the President at the UN in 2015, he is spearheading Sri Lankas drive to achieve the sustainable development goals.
The National Sustainability Discourse which operates efficiently to obtain the ideas of all will be implemented in every province of the country. Through this process, the public will get an opportunity to express their views on relevant issues and directly engage in dialogue.
The main objective of this programme is to prepare a plan to determine the long-term economic, social and environmental goals of the country over the next 12 years, while displaying the capabilities of Sri Lanka.
The discourse aims to engage young people, academics and professionals. The report will be updated according to the feedback of the parties.
This would be the first effort to announce the capabilities and ideologies of Sri Lanka and to make plans to confirm the economic, societal and environmental vision for the next 12 years, where the President has identified the importance of holding a national debate based on this draft.
The National Sustainability Discourse, which includes discussions held for three months on the content of the first draft of the National Sustainability Vision for 2030, was launched by President Sirisena.
The draft will be amended to incorporate the contributions of the public to create a national blueprint for sustainable development policies until 2030.
Sri Lanka expects to become a middle-income country with a prosperous, competitive and developed economy, comfortable environment with fauna and flora, and a peaceful society.
The National Sustainability Discourse will identify the issues within most sectors and provide solutions and reveal the way forward for the countrys development.
Even though the governments which come to power conduct development programmes, they are not launched in accordance with a comprehensive national development plan.
Although every government has made such development plans, this is the first draft which is deprived of criticism or political favour, and with the contribution of a committee of experts in different fields.

Rajapaksa blinded by power thirst: Duminda
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa often said that even the smallest individual could rise to the top, but his words only prove to be contradictory as he was attempting to reclaim the throne as President, instead of supporting his brothers to achieve it, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Disanayake said.
He said that in those actions, the former President only revealed his thirst for power.
Minister Dissanayake was addressing an Anuradhapura West Electoral Board of Authority meeting convened by Anuradhapura West Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLPF) Organiser W.B. Ekanayake, recently.
The minister said the country knew that former President Rajapaksa was barred from contesting the Presidential elections since he had previously completed two terms. However, neither Gotabhaya nor Basil Rajapaksa was allowed to contest as they held dual citizenship.
The stand of the Joint Opposition and Pohottuwa party concerning the next presidential candidate, had been controversial and questionable, Minister Dissanayake said.
Politician Kumara Welgama recently said that his colleagues opposed the idea of a retired army officer governing the county, and that a person not even elected to a Pradesiya Sabha would be unfit to contest the Presidential elections. United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara had the same view.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would require at least one of his kith or kin to become the next President in order to whitewash his crimes, the minister said.
''The former President has not changed his ways. We witnessed this in his words against his private secretary Udith Lokubandara, recently," he said, adding that Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena were polar opposites with regard to social, political and economical vision.

Riu Sri Lanka in CSR initiatives
Riu Sri Lanka, an all-inclusive resort with 501 rooms, recently held a tree planting and beach cleaning program as part of its social and community responsible activities (CSR). The resort is confident to take part in similar initiatives in future.
One of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is environmental pollution, which is occurring on a vast and unprecedented scale around the globe.
Riu Sri Lanka with a motive to contribute to a cleaner and greener environment focuses on two major challenges air pollution and water pollution and strongly believes in giving back to the local community. The hotel planted king-coconut trees with the participation of government officials, staffs and locals. Planting trees undoubtedly produce clean air, reduce carbon, and provide shelter to birds and other wildlife.
The hotel also recently spent a day together with its staffs in a beach cleaning activity and many of their guests volunteered for this worthy cause too. Tons of rubbish especially plastic find its way into the worlds oceans every year and it is causing significant threat to marine life and sea birds. Riu Sri Lanka is the ideal destination for afamily.

Sam Chandrasena, a generous sport personality
He created waves in society by introducing the IRONMAN4x4 brand to the Sri Lankan motor racing industry. Also, during a time when the value placed on human life is at its lowest, he spear-headed the creation of a group of volunteers known as ICERT, that would place their own lives and machines in danger during natural disasters, to rescue and assist their own fellow countrymen.
With the attention of the general public drawn to the stunning feats achieved by this group of volunteers, working towards the benefit of their country and people, he was able to change the image of 4x4 users that had become a mindset of the public. He is a well-know personality in the racing world and by continuously maintaining his standards finally was rewarded with the SLT  SILK Outstanding Generous Sport Personality in Sri Lanka for 2017. He is Sam Chandrasena, the man behind TEAM IRONMAN 4x4 and I-CERT.
Sam Chandrasena was born in Kahawatta in 1976, received his primary education at St. Thomas College, Guruthalawa and secondary education at St. Thomas College, Bandarawela. Finally he attended S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. In 1994 and at the end of his schooling career ,he migrated to Australia to pursue my higher education, whilst working. As soon as he completed his studies in Australia, he wanted to return to Sri Lanka to work in an industry for which he was qualified and trained for. On arrival in Sri Lanka and due to the knowledge and experience gained by working in the same sector in Australia, he joined Foster and Reed Pools and Spas (Pvt) Ltd.
The path to enter the racing world was opened in 2005, just after he brought a Jeep Wrangler to take-part in extreme 4x4 racing. At that time, very few people owned a Jeep Wrangler. He had a large following of fans because of this new vehicle in the racing industry. He did a few modifications to his Wrangler and entered extreme 4x4 racing, during a time period in which people treated it as a wonder. After few years he decided to change his vehicle brand and switched to the Nissan Patrol. That decision paved a pathway for another destination on his journey.
He says Most people are unaware that he is the person behind the introduction of the Australian IRONMAN4x4 brand to Sri Lanka. He considers it as huge privilege to be the ambassador for such a well known brand and to cater for people who are willing to engage in the 4x4 recreational and racing culture, in Sri Lanka.

On match-fixing suspicion:
SLC anti-corruption unit arrests two Indians
Sri Lankan crickets anti-corruption unit detained two Indian spectators on suspicion of match-fixing during a domestic Twenty20 league game, officials said Wednesday.
The men were apprehended after officials spotted them behaving suspiciously and making repeated calls on their mobile phones during the match between Galle and Dambulla at Pallekele.
We saw suspicious behaviour of the two Indians and ACU (anti-corruption unit) officials handed them over to the police for further investigations, a Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) official said.
The arrest comes a day after SLC issued a new match-fixing alert after a group of spectators were asked to leave another venue after officials suspected them of involvement in attempted match-fixing.
The ongoing T20 tournament features solely Sri Lankan cricketers after plans to emulate the massively lucrative Indian Premier League and attract foreign stars to Sri Lanka fell through.
Authorities say the scaled-down competition is still attracting match-fixers, and have increased the deployment of officials at games and team hotels, while players have been warned to inform the authorities of any attempt to approach them to fix matches.
Sri Lanka has also announced plans for tougher laws against sports corruption and a special police unit to deal with match-fixing following an Al-Jazeera documentary exposing corruption in global cricket in which three Sri Lanka officials were filmed agreeing to sway matches. AFP

The Minneriya National Park had to be temporarily closed following the clash last Sunday over the arrest of a fisherman engaged in illegal fishing. He was scheduled to be produced in the Hingurakgoda Magistrates Court on August 27.
The Police said the forest rangers had apprehended a fisherman engaged in fishing in the Minneriya tank together with the net used for fishing in the Ambagaswewa area.
Later villagers had attacked the forest rangers and vandalised the Wildlife office and had freed the arrested fisherman.

Sri Warriors, Gladiators, dream makers and administrators
The modern game is certainly as demanding, hectic, intense, unforgiving and impossible to ignore.
Naturally our resident deckchair experts have plenty to wax lyrical about the current status of our global game.
Needless to say we hail their wisdom about the Wallabies skill levels and where the Bledisloe will not be going this season
What this same lot have to share on our Asian Games campaign...is far too high tech for us islanders and quite capable of handing off world rugby with one extended appendage.
Hot off the games update from the team village in Indonesia......is alarming news about our top finisher and game changer Danushka Ranjan has a minor concern with one of his hamstrings...and will miss our opener vs UAE.
Not really much to fret...or jump nervously, but accept the decision between player and coach as a calculated risk with your no. 1 on ice and supervised stretching.
As coach I would not chew my bits to pulp...but look at practical plan B alternatives....whilst extending my mind not to dwell on it...the gut in knots that didnt inspire smiling.
After some educated sighing...captain Muthu will be informed and expect the slightest of mental shudders as the boys warm up for their 1st match.
Day 1 opener is always a major tester....and till we secure good ball and run the nervous petrol off, absolutely vital we dont make simple mistakes.
The process of settling will be cleared by huge impact tackles and turnover ball....some magical footwork by Sooriyabandara or Sudham to put us in space and a try to follow.
Perfect start Sri Lanka 8, UAE 0. Coach Woods equally gut nervous till the boys settle.
Our Achilles heel has been the looming colours of Korea ...who have nudged us out of too many assignments both seniors and juniors.
Best not ask Naveen H or coach Nilufer Ibrahim their opinion on Koreans in Hong Kong
Alas the reality is very much a crocs jaw for Sri vs Korea in the middle under pressure.
I imagine maximum impact and effort from Muthu...Jason D and Gayan Weere to win the physical contest on the deck and securing solid Korean ball for us to run.
If we beat Korea on the deck, at the breakdowns...we have reason to ice bath for the quarterfinal line ups.
Dramatically once in the quarters we are on our way...the podium and medals...close enough to taste.
Vital that our focus from quarters to semi is not about the big WIN...but absolutes about playing our unit skills and doing our jobs max...
Under pressure or not ...we must be clinical to full time and satisfaction from good 7s Sri Lanka.
Lets raise our mind energy for the 7s team at the Asian Games and the fabulous prospect of a medal on the flight home.....a huge embrace for sport fans...who had very little to celebrate from the games so far.
Perfect corner flag to direct choice insult in all 3 national languages ...ss to why the Sri womens team missed out again ...no. 6 in Asia and not playing ...I hope the union provide adequate facts on this compelling oversight.
Fair call to ask the powers that rule what our 7s ambitions are...Asia wide over the next 3 years
Does the plan include maximum growth in the player populationand equally important that we play matches till we are blue in the face.
What is our priority...especially since World rugbys focal point is the womens 7s.
Glad to get off my soap box and contemplate how good team spirit and morale in the camp.
From all the rugby hearts in Sri paradise ....play hard and sharpest in the middle...we believe that this is going to be new history for 7s and much to cheer from our sunny rooftops.
Bula bula Muthu and the boys...pride for Sri and fly the flag.

Swap to  healthy food
There are many ways you can teach and support your children in eating healthy.
Start with breakfast
Eating a balanced breakfast with protein is a great way for your child to start their day. Protein can help them stay fuller longer. It even can help teenagers lose weight.
Make mealtimes a priority
Sitting down at the table, as a family is an important part of establishing healthy eating habits but its more than just eating together. Mealtimes are also a chance to:
Provide your kids comfort
Children thrive on routine. Knowing they have dinner or other meals with their family regularly helps them feel safe.
Talk with your kids
Show interest in whats going on in their lives. Tell them whats going on in yours. Build stronger connections among your family members.
Monitor their eating habits
Older kids and teenagers spend more time eating at school or at friends houses. Use this time to watch what and how they eat. See if there is anything you can do to encourage better habits.
Set an example for your child
If you prepare and eat healthy foods yourself, your child will eat healthier, too. Avoid obsessive calorie-counting. Dont talk negatively about yourself. Your child could adopt the same attitudes. This could lead him or her to develop body image issues or negative associations with food.
Get kids involved
Have your kids help you shop for groceries and choose food to eat. Teach them how to read a food label so they know the nutrition in the foods theyre choosing. They can also help fix meals and take some ownership in what theyre eating.
Another fun way to involve your child is to plant a garden. Growing some of your favourite fruits, vegetables, and herbs can teach children valuable lessons. Planting, maintaining and harvesting your own food is satisfying. It can be a fulfilling experience for children and adults alike.
Make small shifts to healthier foods
You dont have to overhaul your entire meal plan. Just find a few alternatives to unhealthy items in your fridge or pantry. Slowly start adding in more until youve adopted healthier food choices.
Limit sugar
Sugar occurs naturally in many foods. These include fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products. We get all the sugar we need from these foods.
Many foods have added sugar. At best, all this extra sugar just adds empty calories to our diets. At worst, it can contribute to hyperactivity, mood disorders, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
Sugar is often added to foods we wouldnt think had sugar in them.
These include breads, canned soup or vegetables, condiments such as ketchup, frozen meals, and fast food. For the best health, we should avoid or reduce the amounts of these foods we eat.

Terrified of  public speaking
I want you to stick two fingers between your teeth vertically, then say a line from a nursery rhyme.
Biting my hand while trying to talk is less comfortable than lying on my back huffing out breaths to a count of 10, which is what I have been doing for the past half an hour, but I do as I am told. I cant remember a single nursery rhyme. The moon is made of green cheese, I mumble. Louder, instructs Kate Lee, a former actor whose voice is vibrant yet relaxed. I try again. And again. It is hard to talk when you are gagged. Now take out your fingers and repeat the phrase. Listen to the difference.
Apart from being a lot easier to say, the words come out with surprising oomph. They sound powerful. Authoritative. You might even believe the moon was made of green cheese. This is how much energy you need to use, says Lee. If you can do that, your voice should feel more alive, more energised.
A few weeks before, an invitation had dropped into my inbox. I report on family law and child protection, and I was being asked to give a lecture in honour of the late Bridget Lindley, the principal legal adviser to the charity Family Rights Group, who had battled to uphold the human rights of parents and children in the family courts. The inaugural lecture, I recalled, was given by a senior appeal court judge. I am a jobbing freelancer. But you dont turn down an invitation like that, so I pressed send on my acceptance email before I bottled it.
Then I started worrying: about researching and writing the equivalent of a mini-dissertation; about speaking persuasively in public; especially about my voice.
Hence Lee, a communications coach who trains some of the countrys best-known broadcasters. And hence research into why I am worried at all.
I discover almost immediately that my concerns are not unusual - and that they are felt particularly keenly by women, often for good reason. There has been lots of prejudice about womens voices, says Anne Karpf, a sociologist and the author of The Human Voice: The Story of a Remarkable Talent. In the world of broadcasting, for example, there have been a vast variety of reasons put forward over time to exclude women from the airwaves. These range from the Daily Express saying in 1928 that listeners felt womens voices were monotonous to the Sunday Dispatch saying in 1945 that women were too emotive in their delivery. From too little personality in their voices to not enough, women cant win.
You say to me that your voice is not authoritative, says Karpf. That speaks to me of all the ways that women have not been allowed a voice in the metaphorical sense.
This prompts me to do some reading about womens voices in history. Disapproval of women articulating their opinions is ingrained across cultures and across time. In her bestselling essay Women & Power: A Manifesto, Mary Beard gives her readers a depressing history lesson about how classical society abominated the very idea of women speaking in public. This can happen insidiously, even if not through a statutory ban: on the landmark 1963 civil rights march on Washington, black female activists were given no opportunity by organisers to address the crowd; no woman was trusted to read the television news as a regular long-term newsreader on a national programme in the UK until Angela Rippon caused a sensation in 1975. Beard suggests we are not comfortable with women speaking publicly even now. Take the language we still use to describe the sound of womens speech ... in making a public case, fighting their corner, in speaking out, what are women said to be Strident; they whinge and they whine, she writes. I am reminded suddenly of King Lears description of his daughter Cordelia: Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman. However softly and gently she phrased her opinions, it didnt do her much good in the end, I think, crossly.
I tell Karpf that I suspect men benefit automatically from having lower voices with a deeper timbre than women do. She agrees. Studies have shown that we perceive deep, resonant voices - such as those of Judi Dench or Mariella Frostrup - as attractive. However, in women, that huskiness means they also sound very sexy, which undercuts the idea of authority, Karpf says. There has long been pressure on women in positions of authority to deepen their voices. Margaret Thatcher is thought to have taken voice lessons to lower hers, possibly further than her natural range easily allowed: in the latter part of her career, her voice sounded distinctly strained. Women politicians have it very tough, Karpf says. If you look at Theresa May, she exhibits a phenomenon I call tears in the voice - as if theres something trapped in her throat - and it makes her uncomfortable to listen to. Emily Thornberry is lucky: she has a very rich, resonant voice. As a former barrister, shes also used to being assertive with her voice and its a tremendous asset.
Journalists, even those who specialise in particular subjects, are generalists, not experts. Their job is to report what other people - the true experts - think. What right do I have to talk about family law to senior judges, lawyers, academics and directors of childrens services who have dedicated their lives to thinking about how best to protect children Will my talk be rubbish Will I - very visibly - fail I am battling internally with a basic question: do I have the authority to speak
Everybody feels that. And, yes, absolutely, speaking in front of an audience is an honour, says Sylvia Baldock, a professional speaker, trainer and coach. Overcoming that insecurity, she says, is about establishing your credibility up front. At this point, Baldock doesnt seem all that bothered about my voice. Instead, she asks why I am so fascinated by family law. When I answer - about how I was sent to court one day to see a woman apply for a non-molestation order without the benefit of legal aid and found myself sucked in - she pauses.
Then she says, firmly: Id like you to go a bit deeper.
Feeling embarrassed, I find myself telling her why I really care - and I realise that I am going to have to rewrite my opening section, in a more truthful way than I had contemplated. I need to get personal.
This makes me uncomfortable. Reporters dont often, and shouldnt often, talk about themselves. Our job is to report the world. But Baldock is adamant that this is different. You need that powerful opening. People feel that they have a relationship with you then. Your history ... its what has all led to your work on this.
I write my new introduction and understand immediately how my motivation to explore the ways in which the law affects families - so often rendering them powerless against the implacable authority of the state - is what will drive the lectures content. My childhood was immeasurably better than those of most of the people whose stories I try to tell, but I know the anguish of yearning for an adored parent, because we lived in different countries after my parents split up. I am sure my deep suspicion of authority is shaped by my fury, between the ages of eight and 12, at having no control over decisions that caused me damage and immense distress. Once I feel I have something useful to say, and therefore a right to speak, much of my insecurity about my voice drops away. Is this a particularly female way to approach speaking in public or is it just me, I wonder I am still not sure, but I sense that it stems from a fear of being shamed. The idea of someone thinking shes not as good as she thinks she is - or, worse still, shes not as good as we thought she was - provokes a hot flood of anticipated embarrassment. It is not OK just to do all right. I have to do well - ideally, very well.
I give the lecture. Throughout, I breathe into my diaphragm. Three minutes in, my legs start to shake and I realise that I am fluffing at least one word per page. But I discipline myself not to rush. Rushing is for people who dont believe an audience is interested in what they have to say.
I keep breathing. I have no idea if I use my full vocal range, but I dont think the annoying tch is so apparent. After long hours of thinking and reading, writing and rewriting, I finally believe my words are worth listening to.
I have also come to believe that, as long as my voice conveys what I want to say so people understand, that is what matters. Not whether the noise that comes out of my mouth is thin or high or girly.

US hands over coast guard ship to Navy
The US Coast Guard handed over a high endurance cutter, formerly the USCGC Sherman, to the Sri Lankan Navy in a ceremony presided over by Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe and Rear Admiral Michael Haycock of the US Coast Guard, on Monday.
The cutter, a gift from the people of the United States, will be the largest ship in the Sri Lankan fleet and strengthens defence cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka.
The ship will increase Sri Lankas ability to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone, providing additional security for ships from all nations that transit the busy sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. It measures 115 metres long and when fully staffed, carries a crew of 167.
For over a month, 110 Sri Lankan sailors have been training with the Shermans crew on operating the vessel.
The handover builds on Sri Lankas first-ever participation in the US Pacific Fleet exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 in July and will increase interoperability between the two navies.
The sail-away date for the cutter will be in February 2019. Overhaul and maintenance, as well as the training of the crew, will continue until then. The gift of the cutter was first announced by former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon during the U.S.-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue in November 2017.
The new ship will join the SLNS Samudura, also a former US Coast guard vessel that was gifted to Sri Lanka in 2004.

Young cricketers can stay in the sport with Campus Cricket, says Mahanama
Tournaments such as Red Bull Campus Cricket can help university-age cricketers stay active in the sport, while they juggle studies and edgling professional careers. So says former Sri Lanka bats-man, and ex-ICC match referee Roshan Mahanama, who believes too many young cricketers quit the sport after finishing school, due lack of cricket tournaments and opportunities for sportspeople aged 18 to 23. He says many promising cricketers are lured away from the sport by other career prospects, and are unwilling to wait around for a spot on a senior team.
Mahanama is a Goodwill Ambassador for this years Campus Cricket World Final, in which six teams from around the world play in a week-long tournament held in Colombo from September 23 to 29.
Campus Cricket has been running for six years, and I thought this is one of the areas we need to support, because in Sri Lanka we lose a lot of cricketers from ages 18 to 23, Mahanama says. We dont have proper tournaments for them, and we scrap those age-group competitions. Its a career choice for many of these players, and parents are also involved in these decisions, and sometimes its easier to pursue another career and stop playing cricket. If we can encourage them to continue playing the game, thats a good thing.
Although cricketers in Sri Lanka are particularly likely to quit sports soon after leaving school, largely because the domestic system does not cater for the many young players who are not yet ready to graduate to first-class cricket, nations around the world are trying to tackle the problem of losing promising sportspeople in their university years.
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) together with the England Cricket Board are also trying to fund and support university cricket in the UK for the same reason, Mahanama said. We need to look at keeping players in university, because sport teaches a lot, and the chances of young people going astray if they are occupied by sports is minimum.
Mahanama also hopes that the young cricketers involvement in Campus Cricket will help instill values that will assist them elsewhere in life - values such as respect for others and discipline.
I watched some of the Sri Lankan campus cricket matches earlier in the year, and I was struck by how competitive these guys are. Tournament director Brendon Kuruppu told me it had been getting more competitive every year. So while giving them an opportunity to play cricket, it would be ideal to give them a taste of the discipline you require, as well as having codes in place like you do in top-level cricket.
But overall, I thought this was a good cause and I needed to come forward. Its a great initiative to get players combining their studies and sport as well.
