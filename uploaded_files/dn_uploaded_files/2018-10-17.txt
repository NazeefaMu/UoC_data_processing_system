Ex-world swim champ Magninis doping decision postponed
Milan, Monday: Former two-time world swimming champion Filippo Magnini appeared before a court of Italys anti-doping agency (NADO) on Monday to answer accusations he used banned substances for which he risks an eight-year ban.
At the end of the four-hour hearing, the judges ruled that additional time was needed with a decision expected on November 6.
I simply told the truth and now Im calm, Magnini said on leaving the court in Rome. We explained everything in detail. Im happy because my lawyers have managed to bring out the truth.
Sentencing has been postponed due to the complexity of the case.
NADO prosecutors have requested an eight-year ban for Magnini and four years for his former Italian relay teammate Michele Santucci.
Magnini is accused of drug use, abetting and administration or attempted administration of a prohibited substance.
The investigation was opened after Magnini, 36, and Santucci, 29, were questioned in October 2017 over their relationship with nutritionist Guido Porcellini, who has since been banned for 30 years by Italys national anti-doping organisation for distributing illegal drugs.
Magnini, who retired last year, was named in the case but his dossier had been closed due to lack of evidence. Certain products were destined for him but, according to the investigators, he did not use them or even receive them.
Four-time world medallist Magnini won the 100m freestyle at the 2005 and 2007 world championships and a relay bronze at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
Santuccis evidence will be heard on Wednesday.

Foreign Policy and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue commences
The Sri Lanka Foreign Policy and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue, organised by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, commenced on Monday with the participation of mid-career diplomats from 23 countries from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Australasia.
The two-week long programme is held as part of the Economic Diplomacy Programme (EDP) of the Foreign Ministry and will primarily focus on Sri Lankas Economy, with special emphasis on its emergence as a Hub of the Indian Ocean and as a trade, investment, and tourist destination, while showcasing Sri Lankas international brands, entrepreneurship, as well as important strides in research and innovation.
It will also explore Sri Lankas history and culture, aspects of foreign policy including positions on international politics, and thematic issues: good governance, sustainable development, and right to information, social media and cyber security. Sri Lankas key government officials, academics, scientists, and business leaders will participate in the discussions, and a three-day field visit will follow.
At the commencement of the session, the participants called on Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana, who welcomed them and wished them a productive and enjoyable stay in Sri Lanka.
State Foreign Affairs Minister Vasantha Senanayake, who inaugurated the Dialogue, said Sri Lanka had always been a melting pot of diverse cultures and ethnicities as well as different religions, and its strategic geographical location had made it a unique international player since ancient times.
Outlining the trajectory of Sri Lankas foreign relations and the challenges the country has faced through history, he said Sri Lanka was well-positioned to be a knowledge centre for international relations. In their interactions with each other and their Sri Lankan counterparts, he encouraged the visiting diplomats to be forward-looking and to collectively seek to anticipate future trends and how to deal with them, in the region and the world.
Acting Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha said their presence was a reflection of the importance their respective governments placed on relations with Sri Lanka. He expressed confidence that through this Dialogue, Sri Lanka will not only be informing them about how Sri Lanka is straddling the many politico-economic and social challenges of our times, but that in turn would also be informed of the perspectives their respective countries and regions have on each of these subjects. He said their remaining engaged with Sri Lankaboth professionally and personallywould be a tremendous support to the efforts by our respective Missions in or accredited to their capitals, as they seek to strengthen bilateral relations between the countries. Under the EDP, having analysed patterns of recent economic flows and the potential within each target market, the Foreign Ministry has set specific performance targets to be accomplished on exports, investment, tourism and foreign employment for each Mission.
In collaboration with the relevant line ministries and the private sector, 10 Sri Lanka Missions abroad in emerging markets are being supported in carrying out targeted campaigns that would enhance Sri Lankas global footprint and bring tangible economic benefits to Sri Lanka.
Projects are being initiated to promote ICT products and services and also organic food products in Sweden, apparel, textile and footwear in South Africa, fresh and processed food in Bahrain, gems and jewellery in Turkey, spices and apparel in Brazil, wellness tourism in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), inward investment from South Korea and Japan, and outward investment in Myanmar and Nepal.
State Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Grace Asirwatham and Additional Bilateral Affairs Secretary Sumith Nakandala were also present at the inaugural session. The programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute (BIDTI) and the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI). LKIs Executive Director Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja delivered the inaugural lecture on The evolving Asian Economic Outlook and implications for Sri Lanka, while BIDTI Director-General Pamela J. Deen and Foreign Ministry International and Technical Cooperation Director Kapila Fonseka also addressed the participants.
Diplomats from Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Cuba, Egypt, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, are attending these sessions.

Govt.looks to limit imports
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday directed the Finance Ministry to provide him with a report of all imported goods which can be restricted within a week.
The President made the directive when the National Economic Council (NEC) met at the Presidential Secretariat.
The main focus of the meeting was to discuss measures the government could take to deal with the current economic crisis that has resulted with the appreciation of the dollar against the rupee in the international market.
The discussion also focused on the import restrictions already in place on non-essential commodities and on the import of polythene.
President Sirisena noted that by restricting non-essential imports and with the right taxation on other imports, the countrys trade deficit could be brought to a manageable level
The NEC which had invited local manufacturers and businessmen to its meeting this week also paid attention to many issues faced by local businesses and manufacturers.
The issues faced by sugar importers were also discussed and the importers had pointed out that they were facing heavy losses with the current price controls on sugar.
Local fruit juice producers discussing their issues highlighted the sugar tax imposed on the fruit juices, and a committee was appointed to report on ways in which the government could help promote and encourage local fruit producers and juice manufacturers.
The NEC also discussed introducing the manufacturing of single phosphate using Apatite in Eppawala as a substitute for imported tri-phosphate. It was observed that this could reduce the foreign exchange spent on the importation of fertiliser.
The President also discussed the scanning mechanism of all goods which enter the Ports and asked for a report on mechanism where all containers instead of random containers could be scanned. Ministers Mangala Samaraweera, Rajitha Senaratne, Dr Sarath Amunugama, Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera, Mahinda Samarasinghe and Malik Samarawickrema, Secretary to the President Udaya R.Seneviratne, NEC General Secretary, Prof.Lalith Samarakoon and Central Bank Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe and other officers were present at the meeting.

Lalith de Mel publishes his memoirs
How he made things happen
Deshamanya Lalith de Mel recently launched his book which traces his journey to become The First Sri Lankan on the Main Board of a Top 100 Company in the UK. It is a narrative of his career from his school days at St. Josephs College, where he was instrumental in introducing rugby, straight through to Cambridge University and then returning to work for Shell where he honed his marketing skills and got caught up in motor racing.
Switch then to the British multinational Reckitt and Colman, where in the days of expatriate managers he rose up the ladder in a quick succession to the top, and then spent time in the Brazil business which prepared him for his greater international role to earn a place in the Main Board of the Group, a top 100 company in the UK, while also being the first and only Sri Lankan to do so. He was also recognised as the Godfather of the Groups pharmaceutical business.
When he retired, a cluster of opportunities was awaiting him. His company retained him to do a years consultancy to develop a long term strategy for their pharmaceutical business, and he also became a British Government nominated Director of CDC plc, a government owned entity created to support development in poorer countries.
He returned to Sri Lanka to and was invited by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to be the Chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom at a time when it went into a private public partnership with NTT. He went on to be called upon for a number of high profile roles in the Government sector. These included his terms as: Chairman of the Board of Investment, Senior Advisor to Ministry of Finance overseeing the monitoring and implementation of major government infrastructure projects, Director of Peoples Bank, Director of the State Enterprise Management Agency, and Chairman Tourism Cluster of the National Council for Economic Development. He worked free in all his government appointments and took no remuneration.
He also made his experience available to a number of private sector companies, serving on the Boards of John Keels Holdings, Hemas Holdings, First Capital, Piramal Glass, Serendib Hotels and Delmege Forsythe. Narratives and anecdotes from his experience in these companies are included in the book.
He also was a prolific writer, contributing more than 65 articles in the past decade mostly to the Daily FT. The book reproduces all his writings. A small circle of friends and colleagues were invited in thanking for their involvement in the book.
Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, JKHs Chairman Susantha Ratnayake and R&Cs Nimal Gunewardena reminisced briefly on each era and his various roles. Melanie Senanayake worked with him in putting the book together and the design and layout was done by Bates Strategic Alliance.

## Title: Is the ICC living in a fools paradise

Is the ICC living in a fools paradise
The senior manager of the ICC Umpires and Referees was seen issuing a statement carrying a brief for their Match Referee and chairman national selection committee of Sri Lanka Graeme Labrooy. The statement articulated the stance of the ICC clearly stating that the ICC does not see any conflict of interest in his role in performing dual roles. By the language used in the press release it was clear it was done at the behest of Labrooy as it contained hints of a spin where it had attempted to give the impression that the ICC engaged his services only in womens cricket which as everybody knows is furthest from the truth.
For the benefit of the senior manager we highlight below a few sensitive areas of conflict which may encourage him to reconsider his stance:
a) Does the ICC really think that the coach and the manager of the Sri Lanka cricket team is going to keep the national team from taking the field in a Test match without the concurrence of the chairman, national selection committee
b) That being the case, is the ICC satisfied that a referee affiliated to the ICC chooses to confront (albeit wearing a different hat) members of their elite panel at a Test match on an extremely serious charge of ball tampering Does such a situation not construe a conflict of interest
c) When decisions made by members of the ICCs elite panel of match referees and umpires are challenged by way of an appeal on perceived technical/procedural errors on the part of the match officials, and the matter is referred to the ICCs Judicial Commissioner for arbitration who does the ICC think was offering technical advice to the attorneys
d) How does the ICC expect the chairman, selectors of any member country to be in charge of team selection whilst being thousands of miles away carrying out refereeing duties for the ICC
e) Should it surprise anybody that in such a loose environment selections are going to be influenced and manipulated by corrupt administrators The normal protocol is for the entire selection committee to affix their signature on the selection book as dictated by the Sports Law of the country. There is a clear violation of the law of the land where the chairman is sanctioning team selections via Skype (as reported over the press) whilst being engaged by the ICC in the capacity of a match referee. In fact the guidelines stipulated under the Sports Law reads thus:
The Chairman and all the members should sign the recommendation of the selection. If any member does not agree with the majority he still has to sign the document indicating his dissent with the majority decision. However, due to some reason beyond the control of the committee signature of any member or members cannot be obtained, the Chairman is expected to make a note indicating use of the particular member or members. If the member is not available for some reason, the Chairman has to make a note explaining the position.
All these conditions laid out in the Sports Law are blatantly violated when the Chairman is engaged on match refereeing duties many miles away. Can the senior manager of match referees and umpires truly espouse satisfaction that laws of a member country is openly violated on account of the ICC
f) In such a backdrop should the ICC be surprised that members of their anti-corruption unit is running round in circles trying to stamp out match fixing and corruption There is speculation that a former chairman selectors is under investigation by the ACU. Isnt the ICC taking a major risk is promoting dual roles in such a sensitive function In an environment where several administrators, coaches, selectors and players are supposedly under the scanner with several phones being confiscated for forensic examination wouldnt the image and reputation of the ICC be sullied should any untoward evidence emerge during the course of these examinations
A clear example of external meddling in selections is the exclusion of Lasith Malinga from the national side for well over a year. In fact the chairman went to the unprecedented extent of declaring that Malinga was not in his World Cup 2019 plans. Anybody with a little interest in cricket knows that he was a victim of falling foul with the former Sports Minister and former president of SLC who ensured that he was sidelined from the team in concurrence with the chairman selectors. Is it not the country and cricket overall that is poorer when such players are sidelined If iconic players such as Malinga can be victimized in the toxic system that is Sri Lanka cricket where double hatting is considered the norm, the ICC is surely living in the clouds.
It is understandable for the ICC to find it convenient and cost effective to engage officials performing dual roles. However, is it a penny wise pound foolish policy that is being adopted by the ICC given the untenable negative press that is being generated for the game of cricket due to match fixing, corruption and what not It is common knowledge that selections are a key area being targeted by illegal bookmakers to include players under their control through corrupt channels. It is alleged that peripheral players are promoted through corrupt coaches and administrators for selection into teams.
It is suggested that such malpractices dates back to the nineties when the germ of match fixing first entered our cricket. The senior manager of referees and umpires may have little knowledge of cricket and the inner workings of the processes involved. However, he will hopefully contemplate the virtues of the dangers cited and take necessary safeguards to sanitize the processes in the larger interest of the game.
It must be admitted though that the main responsibility of rectifying this clear violation of the Sports Law rests with the Minister of Sports where a position of national importance is being degraded to the detriment of the reputation of the country.

IGP hasnt informed us of resignation  Nalin Bandara
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara has not informed the Minister of any plans to hand in his resignation, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara yesterday said.
Neither the Law and Order Minister nor I have been informed of such a decision as yet. I am not aware if IGP Jayasundara has informed the President or the Prime Minister of an intention to resign. I do not believe that he has taken such a step. I also believe that IGP Jayasundara has the right to resign if he desires, Deputy Minister Bandara said.
He also said that there have been no serious allegations against the conduct of the Sri Lanka Police in the last three years for the IGP to hand in his resignation under social pressure.
Deputy Minister Bandara also said he is not aware of a decision to give a diplomatic post to Jayasundara following his resignation, as rumored in some sections of the media. Such things happened prior to 2015, when then President Mahinda Rajapaksa offered an ambassadors post to one of the IGPs following serious social backlash against the police in relation to the death of Roshen Chanaka in 2011. That is not how this government operates, he said.
Most of the allegations leveled against him are based on the way in which he is presenting himself before the public. If you put aside your coloured glasses, you will understand that Sri Lanka Police is operating independently unlike ever before. I am not saying it is 100 percent independent, but it is way better than what it was used to be. Sri Lanka Police does not have serious allegations levelled against it, unlike many other police services in the regional countries. You must understand that IGP Jayasundara has initiated a number of programmes curbing drugs and the underworld, Deputy Minister Bandara said.
When questioned if IGP Jayasundara is involved in politics or is trying to pursue a political career, Deputy Minister Bandara said that the IGP is not involved in politics. I cannot speak for the IGP. But as much as I know, this is the way he behaves from the time he was a DIG. He is a down to earth man who is interested in community service. He deals very closely with his officers.
If you take the last Kandy Perahera, the IGP could have stationed himself by the side of the President and watched the perahera peacefully. But he chose to be on the road, working with his men. That is the way he is, and I do not believe that he is involved in politics, he said.
Speaking of the Joint Oppositions enthusiasm in removing the IGP, Deputy Minister Bandara said that the JO is politically motivated for this purpose. If we were in the Opposition, we would not have requested the removal of a weak IGP. A weak IGP destroys the image of the government.
So it is obvious that the JO wants the IGP out of the scene because they would like law and order of this country distorted. They are the ones who are asking for the removal of FCID, the CID and the new Anti-Corruption High Courts, Bandara said.

Jumbo  pick-me-up
A tea estate in Darjeeling is finding ways to brew an elephant-friendly cuppa by minimising human-animal conflict.
There were elephants in the tea garden. A herd of 60  little calves, watchful mothers, young boisterous tuskers  who had flattened the fence and clumped their way into 35 acres of tea. It was a new section, planted in 2012 after a long gap  the garden, like so many others, faltering due to the relentless recession in the industry. This section was extra-special, for it marked new beginnings  it was the first new planting in many years in the 1,200-acre Nuxalbari Tea Estate in the Darjeeling district of North Bengal.
Should we drive them away, asked the manager who delivered the news to the estates owner, Sonia Jabbar. It was well past midnight. Jabbar looked out into the estate, which has been in her family since the late 19th century. A journalist and artist, she had just taken over the reins after her mothers death.
Her bond with the land ran deep  and she was acutely aware that they could ill-afford any losses.
But love for the wilds ran in the family, too. As a child, Jabbar had spent her holidays in forests  trekking, camping and hunting (before it was outlawed) with her shikari father. She knew the jungle and its inhabitants. Elephants, she believes, are bodhisattvas  sensitive, intelligent, empathetic, wise.
And there was no way I was going to hound them out of my land, says Jabbar. So she decided to let the elephants be.
It was a sleepless, restless night
She was at the new section at the crack of dawn, and was struck by the sight that greeted her: The field was intact. The young saplings were standing as before, and the only sign that a herd of elephants had spent the entire night in the area were the moon-like depressions on the wet earth. Of the thousands of tea bushes there, a mere seven had been damaged.
And, to top it all, they had left behind a gift  lots of dung, the best natural fertiliser for my new field, laughs Jabbar.
Since then, over the last few years, the elephants have quietly become a part of the gardens, coming through as they traverse the broken forests of the Dooars.
The second real test of elephant love came soon after the first episode. The humdrum of a routine morning was rudely broken by screams, crackers and shouts. A frenzied mob had entered the estate, chasing the elephants. The mayhem continued until dusk, when the crowds finally dispersed and the animals got some peace.
Confining a giant
Jabbar realised that the problem of elephants in a human-dominated landscape was a complex one. The Nuxalbari Tea Estate was part of the once-contiguous  and increasingly fragmented  Terai forests stretching from present-day Haryana up to Bhutan, passing through Uttar Pradesh, Nepal, Bihar, West Bengal and Bangladesh. Following heavy deforestation, in North Bengal alone the elephants have lost nearly 70 per cent of their original habitat to urban sprawl, agriculture, hydroelectric projects, highways, railway tracks, tea estates, tourist resorts, factories and housing. The heavily degraded pockets that remain cannot sustain the elephants.
The situation has worsened since an electric fence was erected by Nepal, blocking the traditional route of elephants, says the ranger forest officer Suresh Narjanary. The forest department is poorly equipped and understaffed, with some ranges/divisions facing a 70 per cent shortage. The need of the hour is dedicated, well-equipped and sensitised elephant-conflict mitigation.
The blocked route confines the elephants to small, fragmented areas, thereby forcing them into human habitations. The elephants raid paddy fields in search of sustenance, destroying livelihoods and, occasionally, killing people. In Darjeeling and the adjoining Jalpaiguri district, 50 people die each year because of conflicts with elephants.
Several elephants have been killed, too. Many others bear scars, burns from the firecrackers and torches, their bodies limp and pockmarked with bullets. They are shot at by poachers, frequently run over by trains, hounded  occasionally poisoned  by farmers trying to protect their crop, and taunted and chased by young men who see this as sport or a mark of valour.
The calves born and living amid such conflict are not unlike children raised in war zones. Anxious, traumatised and having never known peace, they are more capricious, prone to get into conflict. Indeed, a 2005 study  Elephant Breakdown by Bradshaw et al  in Nature, cited stress as a potential trigger for conflict. The use of searchlights, crackers or guns to scare them only makes them more aggressive.
Narjanary remembers that about three decades ago, when he was starting out in his job, there were more forests and the elephants were not short of space or harassed as they are now. They moved around freely and the conflict was minimal.
Unfortunately, elephants are viewed as a problem, requiring to be confined to designated forests, when in reality they are impelled to be on the move to strengthen their bloodlines and avoid overburdening a fixed stretch of forest. They disperse seeds as they travel, smartly packaged in dung, contributing to the forests regeneration and plant diversity.
Mammoth give-and-take
At the Nuxalbari Tea Estate, a different kind of experiment is underway. The conflict can ease only if we learn to accept the elephants and if we can ease the losses of farmers, change attitudes and grant the animals the rite of passage, says Jabbar.
As a first step, the estate staff has been trained to keep away the crowds and maintain a 400-metre safe corridor for the elephants. Under the estates Haathi-Saathi campaign, it has started an awareness programme for the children of workers to raise a new generation of barefoot conservationists.
At a meeting with Jabbar and forest officials in early September, the regions farmers explained that they understood that the elephants were deprived of their home and were helpless and hungry, but they wanted solutions.
Many of the farmers told this reporter that they do not bother to apply for the compensation the state offers for the crop loss, as the process is cumbersome and the amount negligible. Though crop loss caused by wildlife is widespread across the country, no private insurance company or government crop insurance scheme covers it, says Jabbar. Local forest officials have helped identify 15 families in the adjoining Tukriajhar village where elephants regularly raid their fields, leading to crop losses. The Nuxalbari Tea Estate is trying to raise funds to provide quick and fair compensation for any losses suffered by these 15 farmers.
This move  coupled with others  is expected to help cool frayed tempers and de-escalate conflicts with elephants. Thanks to its varied efforts, the Nuxalbari Tea Estate has been certified as Elephant Friendly Tea by the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network and the University of Montana, US. Tenzing Bodosas tea farm in Assams Udalguri district was the first small tea garden to bag this tag worldwide.
Such efforts are expected to set an example: Conserving wildlife in human-dense areas needs all hands on deck, and the tea industry is a major stakeholder in North Bengal.
Jabbar is currently creating a 100-acre nursery to house nearly 20,000 saplings of native forest species. This area stands out for its gentle slopes and a stream running through it, providing a much-needed sanctuary for the beleaguered Asian elephant in the summer months.
The tea estate is a half-hour drive from Bagdogra airport. It is not a tourism spot, but encourages visitors to drop in for a day to learn what goes into the making of its organic cup of tea. One can explore the 1,200-acre estate on horseback (and do some bird watching, as well).
The charitable crche and clinic at the estate welcomes trained doctors, nurses and midwives to work with the estates children and teach them. Or one can simply get their hands dirty, planting a forest worthy of its giant denizens. (thehindubusinessline.com) Prerna Singh Bindra is a conservationist, writer and journalist

The Police dismissed reports in certain web sites stating that a woman had been killed while trying to save her son from motorcycle gangs in Jaffna, adding that the incident had no connection to the Aava gangs in the North.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara clarifying the incident said that a clash had occurred between two groups of youths in the Kopai, Uralu area over a personal feud and when the mother of one of the boys had intervened and tried to break up the fight, she was assaulted and had sustained injuries.
She was admitted to the Jaffna Hospital and had later died. However, the postmortem examination conducted on the 53-year-old victim Sandararasa Wijayakumari had revealed that she had died due to a heart attack.
Meanwhile, the Kopai Police had conducted investigations and had arrested three suspects in connection with the attack. They were produced before the Jaffna Magistrates Court and were ordered to be remanded till October 25. However, the Police Spokesman said that these three youths were not involved with any group or gang and this incident was based purely on a personal dispute between the two parties.

Lankas wobbly batting  suffers a setback - injured  Kusal Perera ruled out
PALLEKELE, Tuesday: Sri Lanka who are trying to sort out their batting woes that has contributed largely to their spate of losses in one-day internationals suffered a setback when one of their top order batters Kusal Perera was ruled out of todays third ODI against England at the Pallekele International Stadium here.
Team manager Charith Senanayake said that Perera suffered a quadriceps injury to his right thigh during the second ODI at Dambulla on Saturday and has been ruled out of todays match.
We are awaiting the MRI scans to see the extent of the injury. We have not taken a final decision yet on whether he will be ruled out of the series, said Senanayake. But there is a likelihood that Perera will miss the rest of the ODI series.
Perera, an aggressive batsman plays an integral part in a somewhat unstable batting line up that has failed to fire so far. He scored 30 off 37 balls in the second ODI at Dambulla where he suffered the injury.
Sadeera Samarawickrama who is the only other specialist batsman named in the 15-member squad is expected to replace Perera for todays game.
ENGLAND LOSE DAWSON
Meanwhile England also has a casualty with all-rounder Liam Dawson being ruled out of the rest of Englands tour after suffering a side strain. Dawson who played in the first two ODIs sat out training on Monday and after the injury was assessed by the medical staff a decision was taken to send him home.
All-rounder Joe Denly who was recently named Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) Player of the Year and was picked for the England Test squad will replace Dawson.
DASUN SHANAKA ON HIS ROLE
Sri Lankas fast bowling all-rounder Dasun Shanaka whose position in the batting order at number five has raised many an eyebrows said that he was elevated and asked to bat in that position because of his contributions with the bat in domestic cricket.
The reason why i have been asked to bat at no. 5 is because i have been pretty consistent in domestic T20 and limited overs cricket, said Shanaka at the pre-match press briefing. What they expect from me is to bat as many overs as possible for the longer I wait at the wicket the runs will come. That is the role they expect of me.
They expect a long innings from me. They have seen how I batted in the domestic matches and what I can do. Chandika (Hathurusingha) spoke to me and gave advice on how to prepare and how to bat for long periods. Tactics are most important to improve. Those are the things the coach discussed with me. I have been asked to play out the first 15-20 balls and then to go for my shots, it is very simple, he said.
Shanaka got only one opportunity in the second ODI at Dambulla but he couldnt contribute much being dismissed for eight off 15 balls in a match that Sri Lanka lost under the D/L rule by 31 runs to trail 0-1 in the five-match series.
I think I can play the role of batsman at 5 but it all depends on the starts we get. If we get a good start we can continue from there onwards. We have not been able to do that in recent times because we have been unable to get good starts, said Shanaka.
If we have a settled batting order it will be good for the team. We have talked a lot about it and the captain and senior players have decided that from this series we should have a settled batting order, he said.
Shanaka was of the view that no major changes are needed for the struggling team to come out of their rut.
I dont think we have to make any big changes. We have won in the past if we dont lose 2-3 wickets in the first 10 overs. If we can score around 40 runs in the first 10 overs without losing a wicket we can reach the targets that are required. Our main concern is to stop losing early wickets within the first 10 overs.

A letter to smart children
My dear child,
We celebrated the Childrens Day recently. And we spoke much about child rights and privileges. Well, I know very well that hardly interests you. Wait, I am not writing to lecture you on such things.
When I see you, dear child, glued to the smartphone, I cannot but reflect how advanced and smart you are  definitely more than our own times. You have proven your mettle as a multi-task performer with the latest digital devices. You are faster with your work. Your fingers run on a screen like a marching, leaving no room for mistakes. Unlike us, your generation is blessed with the touch which helps them to retrieve any information on any topic within a second or so whereas we spent much time looking for books and reading them.
The best friend of many young children now seems to be the smartphone, which has become an integral part of your lives.
Your active and inquisitive nature, particularly with such devices in the present context calls for special attention as a simple touch with their soft fingertips, can take them to infinite locations with images and actions of any kind.
It seems that many children have distanced from their parents, brothers and sisters under the same roof and embraced smartphones as their sole companion with whom they share conversations, smiles, laughter, worries, problems etc. while being deaf, dumb, and blind to the nearest ones at home. Moreover, the habits we had during our childhood like playing with friends out in the fields, hide and seek, helping with parents with their gardening and domestic work, having a swim in the village river or a stream etc.
are becoming a thing in the past as they have been replaced by video games and social media on small screen. Qualities like respecting parents, teachers, elders, compassion, honesty, faithfulness, empathy etc. seem to be disappearing from the world of the present generation. One reason for this is they cant see properly as their eyes are glued to the screen most of the time and the other reason is they cant hear properly as their ears are connected to earphones. Its quite true that we have to keep pace with the changing world and make proper adjustments. Im reminded of what the Buddha opted for Enlightenment. He selected the Middle Path  in the simplest sense, maintaining a balance without going to extremes. Therefore your generation must think more of what you do with the screens and if you do it with the sole intention of getting the advantages of it for your future prospects, while maintaining a balance paying an equal attention to values, customs and traditions of our culture, our sons and daughters, you will be going along the correct path which as adults, we too can follow you with a sense of pride and happiness.

Love, lust, sacrifice and solace
In most peoples estimation the 21st century is now lopsided and seems to be far removed from the past with the advancement of science and technology, and we see preserved cultural norms are challenged with the coming of transparency and openness in human relationships.
In Lanka, as I see and observe, the Tamil community here, have lost their so-called treasured values and they have no meaning now, necessitated by the protracted war faced by the middle class and the poor people among them. The upper classes have their own set of values for several decades now. That is not a problem for the others. Let them be.
Dreaming
In this context, a young lady from Thirukonamalai (Trincomalee) has written a maiden novella in Tamil. Her name is Rathi Thananjeyan. The title of the book is Kanaa Kaanum Kaalam (The Era of Dreaming).
I presume she anticipates a reality that will come true and enacts a dreamy fiction with downright common practices in adolescents as far as conjugal and sexual relationships are concerned. Though the story looks fanciful, valid reasoning out and a rationalization becomes effective at the end of the story. The dialogues are put in an intellectual climate, backdrop. I welcome that part of the story because it is the only way out for the protagonists to solve the problem they confront.
In this there are two protagonists- one is Aakash (Male) and the other Divya (Female) They both have an entangled situation but understandably the writer most of the time looks through the female character in her narration.
Maturity
Before I continue, I must bring the attention of the readers at the beginning of the story.
The writer says that she began the story in 2002 and completed it in 2009 and kept it in store until recently to polish it with her newly gained maturity to submit her story to the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Eastern Province for publication. And the Department has published it in 2017. The book has 92pages.
Inspired by the South Indian past romantic writers in Tamil, the writer uses the motif practised there and also liberally follows the language and speech pattern of those writers. This was irritating me at first because Lankan Tamil and modes of speech are different from the Tamil spoken in India.
However, as the story develops the plot becomes convincing and the characterization comes in place.
As I began reading, I thought that it is a love story between two people, - no, a one-sided attraction of Aakash towards Divya. But with coming of Swathi in the scene, it becomes a triangle of love. Swathi loves Aakash, and Akaash is fascinated by Vidya. Vidya is non-committal because she having lost her parents had to depend on his brothers family. She is unhappy. So, she applies for a job and gets it at Aakashs office. He forces himself on her and Vidya also lends herself to be kissed by him. Meanwhile, Vidya and Swathi become friends and knowing that Swathi loves Aakash, Vidya sacrifices her apparent love for the latter. Vidya was forced to marry someone who wanted only sex with her. Aakash is also married. Vidya wants him to live with his wife and Swathi gets married to someone else.
Readability
There are few more characters in the story, but I desist from giving more information as the readers in Tamil would read and enjoy themselves.
The story goes on ends well.
But the significant thing about the novel is the perception of the writer to understand well the contemporary realities in human relationship. Rathi Thananjeyans style of writing is appreciable. She is familiar with the craft of writing. Her multifaceted knowledge on many matters is evident mostly in the latter part of her story. Rathi Thananjeyan at present works as a Management Assistant in the Maddakkalappu (Batticaloa) Kacheri. She hails from Thirukonamalai(Trincomalee)
She has a promising future as a writer of novel themes. Congratulations to her.

Sri Lanka is an amazing country to tour
Malinga is our main threat  Moeen Ali
PALLEKELE, Tuesday - All-rounder Moeen Ali has identified fast bowler Lasith Malinga as the major threat to his team in the ongoing five-match one-day series where England lead 1-0 with the third ODI scheduled to take place under lights at the Pallekele International Stadium here on Wednesday.
Malinga rattled the England batting line up in the second ODI at Dambulla with a five-wicket haul that included Moeen who became the bowlers 500th victim in international cricket.
Hes a brilliant bowler. Hes got 500 international wickets. Hes been around for years, and been at all the big tournaments. He knows what hes doing and is going to be a major threat for us going forward in this series, said Moeen at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
As a team and as individuals weve spoken about how were going to play him. Weve got plans in place. Nothing out of the box - its pretty simple. Hes the main threat for us and weve got to be really cautious against him, he said.
England who scored 278-9 in 50 overs won the match by 31 runs under the D/L rain rule rushing through their overs to beat the rain through spinners Moeen and Liam Dawson.
That was probably the first time it happened to us as a team for a while. Youve got to rush through the overs but not rush through your bowling. Youre rushing through field placings and your thinkings not as clear, said Moeen.
I think once we got the 20 overs out of the way we took our time a little bit as usual.
Weve spoken about that and weve got to counter that and take that into the equation.
There may be a time when the situation gets like that again, and weve got to be a bit smarter.
Moeen wont have Dawson as his spin partner on the tour after the left-arm spinner was ruled out with a side strain.
Well just probably go back to the balance of the team weve had over the last few years. Its a shame for Daws. It would have been a great opportunity to play regularly. I think thats something hes been wanting for a while. Unfortunately it hasnt happened for him. I think hell come back strongly into the side when hes ready, said Moeen.
In Dawsons absence Englands third spinner in the squad Adil Rashid will come into the equation.
Its not been as easy because of the rain. The pitches are a little bit tacky, but its not spinning massively at the moment. Im sure going forward it probably will spin quite a bit, said Moeen.
I really enjoy bowling with Rash as everyone knows. I think Dawson bowled really well as well during the match. Adil didnt bowl as well because of the weather. We were just trying to get the overs in, which we were rushing to do. But I think going forward were going to have to keep it simple and use the pitches.
Moeen described Sri Lanka as an amazing country and said that they were fortunate to be here on a few occasions.
Theres so much to do in Sri Lanka. We know its one of the best places to come and tour. We do try to see wherever we go what the options are to go and see. I know yesterday (Monday) the guys wanted to play golf, but because of the rain they couldnt play much. Its an amazing country to come and visit. A few of us have been fortunate enough to be here a few times before, so weve seen some of the places, Moeen said.

MR in Cuckoo land
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who addressed the Kandy District convention of the Pohottuwa party over the weekend was an angry man indeed. He took strong exception to the so-called acts of corruption allegedly involving top politicos of the Yahapalanaya Government. The former President claimed that millions of rupees were deposited into the bank accounts of various ministers as commissions and inquired in apparent self-righteous indignation whether any such thing took place under his tenure. He also said President Maithripala Sirisena was aware of such dealings, but failed to take any action. Instead members of the former regime were being regularly paraded before the courts and it has become the task of the Justice Minister to decide when such persons are to be arrested and the duration such persons can be kept in custody.
He also repeated his dire warning issued to the personnel of the FCID and members of the judiciary, made at the Hyde Park rally held under the theme Mahinda Samaga Negitimu (Let Us Rise with Mahinda) in the immediate aftermath of his fall from power, that they would be looked after under a future regime.
Rajapaksa, of course, is being economical with the truth. True, one cannot recall any episode of millions being deposited in a ministers bank account surfacing at any time during the tenure of the former regime, assuming of course that this was the case at present. But this was not because they did not take place. All such shenanigans were strictly kept under the wraps.
In contrast, even a whiff of impropriety under the Yahapalanaya regime entered the public domain - The Right to Information Act making things that much difficult for the personages of the current regime. Nay, the Yahapalanaya ministers being exposed for alleged misdeeds became the rule rather than the exception- the Ravi Karunanayake episode bearing ample testimony.
Could any reasonable soul in this country ever visualize a scenario in the past where the Secretary to the President is apprehended in a sting operation by the Bribery Commission and thrown in the slammer Besides, there was no need for ministers then to maintain bank accounts into which commission money could be deposited. There was a very powerful minister who is said to have demanded 10 percent of every project that was undertaken, upfront, even those not coming within his purview.
What is more, overseas tsunami aid was deposited in a personal account of the former President, an act which nearly lost him his Presidential candidacy but for a favourable ruling by then Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva which he bitterly regretted later and begged forbearance from the nation for the lapse on his part, which however he chose to forget subsequently in a different avatar.
That bank accounts were rendered redundant during that era for Rajapaksa cronies to amass wealth which could also be deduced by the fact that billions of rupees of public funds were spent willy-nilly with scant regard for financial regulations. This was seen in the manner in which Rajapaksas handpicked Central Bank Governor released astronomical sums to Public Relations firms in the US to lobby Sri Lankas case with the US Government, at a time the country had become an international pariah, when this was the official task of our well paid Ambassador -a cousin of the Rajapaksas.
The fact that Rajapaksa cronies had enough and more in bank accounts, but went unexposed, is borne by other examples. There was the famous incident of a former minister who was unable to account as to how he had Rs. 400 million in his bank account. When summoned by the Bribery Commission he had the ready reply that he could not make it since he was stung by a Polanga (Russels Viper).
Besides, the ongoing investigations into the doings of the Rajapaksa associates unravel the extent to which ill gotten wealth was amassed, with many of them having their accounts frozen, that of Udayanga Weeratunga Sri Lankas former envoy to Russia, and another Rajapaksa relative, being a stand out. Ditto for the Siriliya Saviya Fund operated under the aegis of the former First Lady. So much for Rajapaksas claim that money apparently pouring into the bank accounts of Yahapalanaya ministers was a new phenomenon that was non-existent during his ten year rule.
Be that as it may, the Government should take serious measures to challenge this claim, lest it go by default. The public naturally wonder as to what became of bank accounts that were said to be in off-shore shelters that the Yahapalanaya Government pledged to recoup and bring back to the country. Besides, if the alleged loot is anything which prominent Government ministers claimed to be, at the very outset, then it would be more than sufficient to tide over the countrys economic woes occasioned by the plunging rupee. The Government should bear in mind that a sizable chunk of the vote President Sirisena received on January 8, 2015 was from the middle classes who wanted the rogues brought to book and the stolen money returned to the country.

When the Members of the Moratuwa Arts Forum (MAF) organized a campaign to promote music right around the Island, their very first step was to tour Hatton and stumble upon a glittery stone in the mud. Named Dineth Nilmina Bandara, this 17-year old student schooling at Sri Pada College, Hatton, can play many instruments. The MAF offered a generous scholarship to Bandara.
Although his hometown is Laxapana, Dineth has chosen to live with his parents in Dikoya, in the neighbourhood of Hatton. Studying for his A/Ls, Dineth is determined to enter university to further his career as an academic.
Dineths parents are a pillar of strength. He received a classical box from his parents and a keyboard from his grandfather. Instrumental capacity aside, Dineth is proving his mettle as an accomplished vocalist as well.
With a little bit of proper musical coaching, Dineth will easily fit into any top class band in Colombo.

National VB coach to be sacked
The Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation which conducted the first ever Asia Challenge Cup in Sri Lanka failed to reach the final when they lost the most important match to Saudi Arabia. The result was a very suspicious one for interested parties as such the Federation had to appoint a Special Committee to inquire into the matter in question. The Committee after completing the investigations under the leadership of DIG Priyantha Jayakody submitted its report to the Federation and it was released to the media yesterday. The other members of the Committee were former Secretary Susil Ranasinghe, K.R.D.C. Ratnamudali Chairman Technical Co., Ranjan Premaratne Chairman Selection Com. and Dhanpal Jayapadma Tournament Com. Secretary.
The Committee has found that the defeat was mainly caused due to the negligence of the head coach Dejan Chulicivic, According to the investigations carried out by the Committee it was proved beyond doubt that he has willfully kept off the top players from the game against Saudi Arabia. This has brought down the mentality of the players which resulted in Sri Lanka losing to Saudis and failing to reach the final. After receiving the report the federation has discussed the matter at length and decided to terminate the services of the present coach from December 31 said the Minister of Power and Energy and Renewable Energy and President of SLVBF addressing the press yesterday. Minister adding further said that when the present Committee took steps were to promote the national sport and prepared a four year plan which included to get the services of a foreign coach, to play more international matches, to conduct international tourneys and also to have long term training programs for selected players after the completion of the national championship.
Services of a foreign coach is to be looked for by next January and with this mind have requested the World Governing bodys assistance for same, said the Minister.

Tokyo, Tuesday: New hotels in Japan with more than 50 rooms will be required to provide wheelchair-friendly accommodation, the government said Tuesday, as the country gears up to host the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics.
Japan is hoping to attract around 40 million tourists annually by the time of the Games and concerns have been expressed over the quantity of accommodation and facilities for disabled travellers.
Under the revised laws, which come into effect on September 1 next year, at least one percent of rooms in newly built and refurbished hotels or traditional inns must be barrier-free for wheelchair users. Through efforts to improve travel and lodging for the disabled, we hope to make the Games a success and create a society where people with and without disabilities can live together, Olympics Minister Yoshitaka Sakurada told reporters on Tuesday. According to a government survey conducted last year, only 0.4 percent of around 100,000 rooms at more than 600 hotels or inns were barrier-free. AFP

He said that the letter was read out at the Central Committee but no one spoke on the contents of the letter.
Jayasekera added that the party focused on reforms activities at the Central Committee meeting.
The Central Committee decided to change the key positions in the party and convene the Executive Council soon.
It has also been decided to convene the partys national convention soon as part of Party reforms drive. The members of SLFP 15 group did not participate in yesterdays Central Committee meeting.
Former Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena added that they have taken a decision not to participate in the Central Committee meeting until the SLFP takes decision to leave the Unity Government
We have apprised our decision to the Party General Secretary and the Chairman too.
However, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera when contacted by the Daily News said that the Central Committee did not take not on any letter sent by the SLFP 15 Group. We focused on the party reforms only.

No electricity pricing formula - Minister
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday, debunked speculations about the implementation of a cost-reflective pricing formula for electricity tariff.
In accordance with the Electricity Act, the introduction of a pricing formula is not practical. If we want to change tariff, we need to get the consent of the Public Utilities Commission. Even if we submit a proposal, the Commission can seek the publics views and this can be a long process. So there is no way we can implement such a method on our own, the Minister said.
The Minister said a proposal submitted to the Cabinet to appoint a Committee to find ways to lower power generation cost and control generation cost in the face of fuel price increases has been misinterpreted and misunderstood.
He said the above decision in no way means the government was planning to implement a electricity pricing formula similar to that for fuel.
The minister went on to say that the CEB was one of the institutions which carries a heavy burden due to subsidies given to the public.
He said the number of total electricity consumers in the country were around six million and the CEB was providing electricity for more than half of the total consumers at a price which is half the generation cost.
He said the aim of setting up a Committee was to find ways to reduce the power generation cost and not to increase of tariff.

No show by DIG Nalaka Silva at CID
Former Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) chief DIG Nalaka Silva failed to report to the CID to record a statement yesterday, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekera told the Daily News.
However, he had notified the CID through a private lawyer stating his inability to attend due to personal reasons and had requested another date, Abeyesekera said.
The CID had notified DIG Nalaka Silva to report to the CID Headquarters yesterday morning at 9.00 am to record a statement regarding the assassination plot against the President and the former Defence Secretary and the two LMG rifles that were taken out of the Central Armoury for two days as well as the missing sniper rifle.
This is the first instance that Nalaka Silva was summoned to the CID with regard to the investigations into the voice recordings of a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa through underworld criminal Makandure Madush who is evading arrest. This plot was revealed to the media by Anti-Corruption Front Working Director Namal Kumara.
The investigations regarding this revelation were initially handed over to the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU), but were later handed over to the CID on the orders of IGP Pujith Jayasundara.

Order on Wiggies preliminary objections reserved
The Court of Appeal yesterday reserved for December 10 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran.
This is regarding a contempt of court action filed against him by Provincial Council Minister B. Denishwaran
The Court of Appeal made this order as part of Contempt of Court proceedings filed by B.Denishwaran alleging that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran and Ananthi Sasitharan and K.Sivanesan have willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Province.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran appearing for Wigneswaran raised several preliminary objections regarding the maintainabillity of the Contempt of Court proceedings.
He contended that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear this application in terms of the provisions of the constitution.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Janak de Silva fixed the original application to be heard on February 11 next year.
Northern Province Chief Minister and former Supreme Court Judge C.V. Wigneswaran and two others appeared before Court of Appeal yesterday over a complaint that they have intentionally acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order.
The Court of Appeal has extended the Interim Order, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to remove B.Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province until final determination of this application.
Denishwaran stated that the first Respondent, Justice Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province. The petitioner B. Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister.
Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran had also filed an appeal in Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeals Interim Order to prevent Wigneswarans decision to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province. Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioner Denishwaran. Presidents Counsel K.

Over 30% of population suffer from food related diseases - President
Despite the countrys positive human development indices, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday noted that close to 32 percent of the population suffered from medical conditions related to food.
Celebrating World Food Day at an event organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) at the Bandaranaike Memorial Conference Hall (BMICH), yesterday, the, President explained that 16-17 percent of the population suffered malnutrition, whilst an equal number suffered from diabetes.
FAO, Country Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Nina Brandstrup observed that the malnutrition rates in children and anaemic rates in women have remained virtually unchanged in the last decade despite rapid economic growth in the country.
We also have a case of both undernutrition and overnutrition. Whilst there is poor nutrition status across the lifecycle of a person in Sri Lanka, we also have one in two women in the country being obese, she added.
The theme this year was achieving the second Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030.
President Sirisena however, noted that at a time when close to 200 million people are starving around the world, a lot of food is thrown away or wasted. In my 27 years in Parliament, I have seen a lot of wasted and thrown away food there. At times, most MPs dont turn up or they dont eat there.
Apart from waste, 35 percent of the food produced for human consumption in the country was being destroyed by pests (including wild animals),the President said.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, I met the Executive Director of the International Food Policy Research Institute and I asked him how other countries managed pests. He said that they killed them. Given our Buddhist and Hindu principles followed in the country, it is difficult for us to adopt such measures and many would criticise me for it but I think it is time we adopt a more active pest management strategy like other countries, President Sirisena added.
We cannot let humans starve and let the animals eat our food, the President said.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera observed that they were yet to find a successful way to reduce the percentage of crops destroyed by pests every year.
He further noted that close to Rs.16.5 billion worth of vegetables and fruits were spoilt every year, while being transported from the farmer to the consumer.
The Ministry he explained had put into implementation several programmes to be able to produce 90 percent of the food consumed within the country by 2030. This would also save the country millions in foreign exchange spent every year in the importation of fruits and vegetables.

Pharmaceutical  Industry  withdraws  11 drugs
The Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry (SLCPI) in a statement to media said that despite persistent appeals, the Government has failed to address the issue of a fair and proper pricing mechanism for pharmaceutical products in light of the sharply depreciating Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar.
With over 85% of pharma products being imported, both Ministry of Health as well as the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) have remained wilful in depriving the industry of adjusting pricing of products as per the prevailing exchange rate, SLCPI noted with concern.
SLCPI notes with distress that discontinuation of pharmaceuticals implicates multiple parties such as the manufacturing firms, patients, providers, pharmacies and the health authorities.
The biggest setback would be for the patients who are adversely affected if the drug product that provided excellent therapeutic benefits and resulted in positive health outcomes is no longer available in the market.

PM to meet Modi this week
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will visit New Delhi later this week and meet his counterpart Narendra Modi to discuss bilateral matters, The Hindu reported, quoting official sources in Colombo.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will take part in high-level meetings, including with Modi, on October 19 and 20, the PMs Office had said.
This visit is seen as significant from both sides, sources said. New Delhi has been concerned with the slow pace of several India-aided projects in the island, while Colombo appears inclined to iron out issues in order to better balance its ties with key partners India and China. President Maithripala Sirisena is scheduled to visit Beijing soon.
From the Indian side, priority projects in the island include the Mattala airport, the Palaly airport, the Trincomalee oil tank farm, the East Container Terminal at the Colombo Port, and the liquefied natural gas plant in Kerawalapitiya.
Indias strategic interests in some of these projects, especially in the Mattala airport and Trincomalee oil tank farm, are well known. However, over the last few months, New Delhi and Colombo have put out conflicting messages on the Mattala airport, sparking speculation on whether Indias interest to run it would actually materialise.
In principle, India and Sri Lanka have already agreed to jointly operate the World War-era oil storage facility in Trincomalee and more recently, the two countries decided that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Lanka IOC would jointly develop the near-85 tanks in the upper farm of the facility. The upcoming discussions, officials on both side said, might help accelerate the projects.
Premier Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi comes a little over a month after former President and key Opposition figure Mahinda Rajapaksa met Modi. The meeting was read by many as a possible thaw in the relationship between the former President and New Delhi. (The Hindu)

## Title: Politics of Caretaker Government
## Supertitle:

Politics of Caretaker Government
The internal conflicts between the two main partners of the current Yahapalana government e.g. the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party seem to be exacerbating day by day. As reported in the media, the ongoing overt discussions between the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena and the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa about establishing a Caretaker Government by expelling the present government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe shows the seriousness of the rift between two main coalition partners. It is also apt to state that this conflict has grown to such extremes that an amicable settlement between the two parties looks a distant reality. It also shows the President Maithripala Sirisenas strong resentment in continuing with the political marriage between the UNP and the SLFP.
What is more problematic is the non-disclosure of facts relating to the conflict by the parties privy to the conflict. As a result, this has led the public to arrive at various conclusions based on their own imaginary assumptions. Needless to say that this situation is detrimental to the countrys political health as well as to the health of the parties involved in the power struggle aiming at toppling the Yahapalana government and bringing about a new Caretaker Government.
An important question arises in this context with regard to the establishment of a Caretaker Government and whether a Caretaker Government can be made into a political reality. In other words is it a viable political idea that can be achieved in the current political context of the country or is it a mere political utopia that can be never achieved. In order to seek an answer to this question it is necessary to pay attention to two things. First thing is to understand what a Caretaker Government means, and second thing is to understand the relative power positions of political parties that try to muster in a Caretaker Government.
The Caretaker Government is a political tradition associated with the Westminster model of government or so called Cabinet form of government. According to the established norms, traditions and practices a Caretaker Government can be formed under two special instances. First instance is where incumbent government - the Prime Minister and the Cabinet - is removed from office by passing a no confidence motion in the House of Representatives to which the government is bound to be held responsible. Second is the dissolution of the House of Representatives by the nominal executive on the advice of the Prime Minister of the incumbent government and go for a general election to elect a new government. Under the first instance, the nominal executive has two options. First is to appoint new permanent government, e.g. a new Prime Minister and a cabinet to govern the country for the balance period until the next general election is held.
Second option is to dissolve the House of Representatives and go for a fresh general election giving the chance for the public to elect new government on their own wish. Yet even under this situation a government must be appointed for the interim period e.g. that is the period between the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the conclusion of the general election and the formation of a new government.
The government appointed for the interim period may either be the old government which was in power or a totally new government with a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet. The role of the nominal executive in this regard is vital as he/she has the power to decide the form of government. Whatever the nature of the government is, whether it is old or new, under the Westminster model it is generally called as a Caretaker Government. Under the second instance mentioned above, when the House of Representatives is dissolved there is no option to appoint a permanent government and the only option available is to appoint a Caretaker Government. Once again this government also could be either old or new depending on what is decided by the nominal executive. But the usual practice has been to retain the old government without inflicting any serious changes or by doing minor changes.
Characteristics
Based on the above discussion a number of conclusions can be drawn with regard to the so called Caretaker Government. Firstly, it is a fundamental political phenomenon associated only with the cabinet form of government and not with the Presidential or Semi-Presidential system of governments. (It is important to keep in mind that the present governmental system in Sri Lanka is a Semi-Presidential system.) Secondly, the dissolution of the House of Representatives is a must to form a Caretaker Government. Thirdly, a Caretaker Government is appointed only for a short period and only on a temporary basis. The usual period is the period between the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the election of a new government by a fresh general election. This may be limited to not less than one month and not more than two months.
Fourthly, since the Caretaker Government is not a permanent government it is charged with only handling day-to-day routine functions of the government. Hence it is not expected to make serious public policy formulations affecting the general political, economic and social body of the country. Fifthly, the main function assigned to the Caretaker Government is to hold the general election on an independent, neutral and fair basis. For this, it is expected that the public service and police service should be made totally neutral and this is another important function assigned to the Caretaker Government. Sixthly, a Caretaker Government is not a government formed with an objective of saving the country from a severe political, economic or social crisis as it is a government formed for the in between period on a temporary basis with very limited number of functions assigned. Seventhly, once the election is held and a new government is formed, the Caretaker Government will be dissolved or it will naturally fade away.
Pseudo-Caretaker Government
Mentioned above are the general characteristics associated with the Caretaker Government. Can such a form of government be formed in Sri Lanka under the existing political context It can be said that it is not an easy thing under the current constitutional framework. Firstly, it can be said that the concept of a Caretaker Government does not go hand in hand with the existing Semi-Presidential system of government.
Establishment of a Caretaker Government involves either appointing a totally new government or to retain the incumbent government until a new government is formed on the basis of a new general election. So if a new Caretaker Government is to be made, it is necessary to remove whole incumbent government from power. The removal of the whole government in the Sri Lankan context means the President, Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Those who are advocating the Caretaker Government have forgotten the fact that the President is part and parcel of the government created under the 1978 Constitution. But those who argue for a Caretaker Government do not talk about removing the President and their attempt is to keep the President untouched and remove only the Prime Minister and other Ministers. It can be said that this notion is politically wrong and does not go together with the concept of the Caretaker Government. If a Caretaker Government is created leaving this factor behind, it would definitely be a pseudo-Caretaker Government and such a government cannot claim due legitimacy to remain in power and to rule the country even for a short period.
Even to create such a pseudo-Caretaker Government, it is necessary to expel the Prime Minister and the Cabinet or to dissolve the incumbent Parliament by a Presidential decree. To remove the Prime Minister and the Cabinet it is necessary to adopt a no-confidence motion in the Parliament with the support of 113 members. Can President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa muster this number under the prevailing strengths of political parties representing the Parliament The proponents of the Caretaker Government currently have only 92 members. Twenty three out of these belong to the SLFP headed by the President Maithripala Sirisena and these 23 are also members of the current government.
The Joint Opposition has 54 members and 15 others belong to the breakaway faction of the government who voted against the Prime Minister when the no-confidence motion was put forth against him. So if a no-confidence motion is to be brought about by the proponents of a Caretaker Government they need to source additional 21 votes from other parties representing the Parliament. Under the prevailing political scenario of the country it appears that it is not an easy task. Furthermore, a no-confidence motion will not be limited only to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and other UNP ministers. It will also equally affect the SLFP ministers and if the no-confidence motion is adopted they also have to resign from their portfolios. So, a decision to support the no-confidence motion might and can boomerang against the SLFP ministers in no time and it is doubtful that they would agree to support a motion that will perhaps destroy their political career.
If the case is as such, the only option available to the proponents of the Caretaker Government is to dissolve the Parliament by a Presidential decree and then attempt to appoint a fresh Caretaker Government. But within the provisions of the Constitution, this also cannot be done as the President has no power to dissolve a newly elected Parliament until it completes four and half years duration since its inception. The current Parliament completes this mandatory period in January 2020. Even if the current President is re-elected to office in 2020 and then dissolves the Parliament in February 2020 and appoints a Caretaker Government immediately, that government can only be in power for one or two months as the general election has to be held within one month of the dissolution of the Parliament. Again, it becomes clear that the second option available to create a Caretaker Government too is unrealistic.
Unrealistic
From all these, it is apt to state the political tactics of the proponents of a Caretaker Government are absolutely unrealistic, imaginary and utopian. Politicians mostly take decisions on imaginary political grounds which are far detached from realistic politics. As far as the Sri Lankan Constitutional context is concerned it appears that the idea of Caretaker Government is not only theoretically wrong, but also it is an utopian idea that can be never realized. Therefore, everyone should clearly understand the current political situation and know that the current government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe cannot be removed through such imaginary and utopian political means.

Careless driving, drunk driving and unruly private buses, the main reasons :
Road accidents killed 2,368 up to October
Road accidents had caused 2,368 deaths by October this year, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha yesterday revealed.
This is nearly eight deaths per day on average on the roads. I hope society will be sensitive to this revelation. If you take the very recent records, there were nine deaths due to road accidents yesterday, six day before yesterday and ten more in the previous day.
This is a serious issue. We need to create a social discourse to analyse this matter and find solutions.We cannot do this alone, Deputy Minister Bandara said.
He said during the last seven years, from 2012 to 2018, 18,491 deaths were caused by road accidents.
Bandara said the government, together with Sri Lanka Police, will create a special team and a programme to bring down these numbers.
He urged the public, social activists, civil society, media and all responsible parties to contribute to this task.
According to the Deputy Minister, in the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, the recorded number of deaths caused by road accidents amounts to 3100, 2961, and 2816 respectively. Bandara observed that road accidents are relatively low in Expressways compared to other main roads.
Careless driving, drink driving and unruly private buses are the main reasons behind these high road accidents. Bandara pointed out that 722 pedestrians, 778 motorcyclists, 153 pillions, 189 drivers and 333 passengers had died in accidents this year.
You have to understand that these deaths have a ripple effect on the victims families. Most of the time, the victims happened to be the breadwinner of the family. So, these victims families are thrown into poverty among other difficult situations.
I hope everyone will see the importance of putting a stop to this condition, Bandara furthered.

Lying about mobile phones  and hiding SIM card
Sanath Jayasuriya accused of obstructing anti-corruption probe

Sanath Jayasuriya has been accused of obstructing an inquiry into corruption in Sri Lankan cricket by allegedly destroying a mobile phone.
The probe is believed to relate to Sri Lankas surprise 3-2 home defeat by Zimbabwe in a one-day series in July 2017. The following month, Jayasuriya stepped down as chairman of selectors.
Jayasuriya, who achieved fame at the 1996 World Cup when he helped Sri Lanka win the trophy for the only time, has been charged on two counts by the ICCs Anti- Corruption Unit (ACU).
Not only is he alleged to have refused to cooperate with what ACU boss Alex Marshall described as our ongoing investigations into serious allegations of corruption in cricket in the country, but he is said to have tried to conceal, destroy or tamper with evidence that could be crucial to an anti-corruption investigation.
Sportsmail understands Jayasuriya, 49, is accused of having multiple mobile phones in his possession, and is also alleged to have hidden one of his SIM cards and disposed of the handset.
His resignation last year came seven weeks after Angelo Mathews stepped down as Sri Lanka captain following the defeat by Zimbabwe.
Mathews, Sri Lankas highest profile player, was omitted from their one-day squad for the current series against England because of concerns about his fitness.
Marshall spoke to the Sri Lanka and England teams ahead of the series, which continues in Kandy tomorrow, though there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by either side.
In a country where cricket is heavily politicised, Marshall also briefed the president, prime minister and sports minister. He is likely to return to Sri Lanka to continue the ACUs investigation.
If found guilty, Jayasuriya would represent one of the biggest fish caught in the anti-corruption net since the unit was established in 2000 after the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal in South Africa.
At his peak, Jayasuriya was one of the games most explosive batsmen. His tally of 13,430 one-day internationals runs is fourth on the all-time list. He has two weeks to respond to the charges. - Daily Mail

Australia closed the day at 20-2, trailing by 262 runs with eight wickets in hand.
After his below-par 15-run innings and weak wicketkeeping in the first Test which ended with his team unable to turn a strong position into a victory, Sarfraz faced calls for his sacking as Test captain. Yeah the pressure was there, definitely, said Sarfraz, who had made just 74 runs in the his six previous Test innings. AFP

SLAF drones monitor Wilpattu  Deputy Minister
The Sri Lanka Air Force carries out drone surveillance to check if illegal felling is taking place in Wilpattu and other forest areas in the North and East, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
If anyone engages in clearing jungles and illegal felling of trees, Air Force personnel inform the Wildlife Conservation Department and other relevant authorities to initiate action against them, the Deputy Minister said at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Air Force personnel have undertaken drone surveillance for the last two weeks while Civil Defence Force personnel are deployed to monitor Wilpattu for any illegal activity. A classified report based on their observations will be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena in this regard, the Deputy Minister said.
Deforestation in Wilpattu has occurred on land given to several individuals by the previous government and not by this government. President Maithripala Sirisena abolished all these permits through a circular after he came into power. No forest land has been cleared after this government came into power in 2015, he said.
During the war, forest cover in the North and East areas remained up to 60 percent as there was no human activity in those areas. But, after the war, many people came forward as owners of these lands.
A committee headed by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa distributed these lands to some of these people who claimed ownership, the Deputy Minister said.
But, we have stopped all theses illegal activities and the authenticity of land ownership will be checked by two committees set up at district level and national level, he said.
Deputy Minister Mannapperuma said that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has also emphasised that the deforestation rate in Sri Lankan is much less compared to the rising population in the country.

The theme of the evening of October 2, was power. It was the 150th birth anniversary of one man who changed the course of history and the lives of millions of people  Mahatma Gandhi. It was the launching of a project by a hotel chain that is creating history right now  ITC Hotels. It was the day of a Musical Extravaganza featuring world-renowned legendary violinist Dr L. Subramaniam accompanied by the Liepajas Symphony Orchestra from Latvia with over 60 musicians that encapsulated the transformative power of music.
To influence the course of history is power and today in the 21st century providing luxury is power. Providing luxury to those who have the power to buy it, is power. On October 2, the launch of Sapphire Residences in Galle Face, a project of ITC Hotels, was celebrated by the musical extravaganza. Daily News visited Nelum Pokuna to see history in the making.
The Indian High Commissioner, Taranjit Singh Sandhu who attended the launching of Sapphire Residences and the ITC One Hotel delivered the most powerful speech he had ever made in Sri Lanka when he spoke of Mahatma Gandhi.
Today the world celebrates Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary, October 2, as the International Day of Non- Violence. This year is even more special as the government of India is commencing the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi. We are paying tribute to a great leader through a series of events spread over two years across the globe. We are honoured to have such distinguished guests from all walks of life in Sri Lanka to celebrate this special occasion. There are very few leaders in human history who have been able to proclaim to the world  My life is my message. Mahatma Gandhi is the one and he belongs to the whole world. He has been the icon for non -violent movement and social changes across the globe, said Sandhu.
Non- violence was the essence of Gandhis movement. This is true power - influencing leaders down through the ages - Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Desmond Tutu and many more. Gandhi is an inspiration for young people. The world we live in can be a cruel world. But young boys and girls all over the globe have someone to look up to. He is especially important to children because his life is a light that lights up the path for those walking in darkness.
Even under oppressive conditions and in the face of insurmountable challenges Gandhi did not move away from the path of non-violence. His words, thoughts and ideas and actions have inspired millions and millions of people around the world. He became the source of inspiration for many. Albert Einstein said of Gandhi  Generations to come will hardly believe that such a man in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. Gandhi rose above his circumstances through his sheer conviction and actions. Gandhi was deeply influenced by Lord Buddha and his teachings. Gandhi said  When I became acquainted with the teachings of Buddha, my eyes were opened to the limitless possibilities of non-violence. Gandhi acknowledged that Sir Edwin Arnolds book the Light of Asia had a profound influence on him. It was a book focused on the life and times of Gautama Buddha, explained Sandhu.
Sandhu commented that he felt privileged to be in the presence of the master of violin Dr L. Subramanian and the National Latvian Orchestra to celebrate this momentous occasion  the Launching of Sapphire Residences.
Chairman WelcomHotels Lanka, Nakul Anand pointed out that the world is changing. The landscape of Colombo is being rapidly transformed. Life in Sri Lanka is keeping up with the rest of the world.
We are very proud to introduce two major landmarks in Colombo today. The Sapphire residences and the ITC One Hotel that is both located at Galle Face. We thought very hard about the suitable date when we could celebrate the addition of such a significant landmark to Sri Lanka. We thought that the Nelum Pokuna would be a fitting venue to launch this landmark.
The Sapphire Residences are an exclusive collection of magnificent apartments and penthouses with interiors meticulously designed. The residents will have privileged access to the neighbouring five star ITC One Hotel and all its services. The Hotel ITC One will have luxurious facilities. Both these two landmarks will have the standard of hospitality provided by luxury Indian Hotelier ITC hotels in Sri Lanka. Each ITC luxury hotel is certified with a LEED platinum rating, endeavouring towards green building, using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient. It is the largest LEED platinum building in Sri Lanka, said Anand.
The musical extravaganza was beautiful. It was very glamorous and it was obvious that tremendous effort had been put into the organization and preparation. It was most enjoyable and it was music at its best. The power of music was really felt by the audience who enjoyed every moment of it. The audience experienced a beautiful blend of music by the little master and the Orchestra.
The musical extravaganza was supported by the High Commission of India in association with the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival.

The Police have obtained an order from the Akkaraipattu Magistrate to evict students and parents blocking the administration building of the South Eastern University, the UGC and Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry said, in a statement issued through the Director General of Information yesterday.
The statement said that the allegation that the University administration had closed the administration building is completely false and a travesty of truth.
The statement added that earlier, a group of students who committed acts of indiscipline by engaging in ragging and other acts of obstruction were punished according to the gravity and seriousness of their acts.
However, they were given an opportunity to appeal against their punishment.
The students who were punished are trying to resolve their problem by force by trying to hide their wrongful acts, the statement said.
A majority of students in the technology faculty were completely against these acts of indiscipline committed by a handful of students and opposed any moves to restore the studentship of the students who had been expelled.
They have threatened to even leave the University if these expelled students were taken back.
Given this situation, some of the students along with their parents had forcibly entered the administration building on Friday night and barricaded it with chains preventing the Vice Chancellor and other officials from entering the building.
However, academic activities of the South Eastern University are continuing as usual and the Vice Chancellor and his administrative staff are operating from an alternative building, the statement said.

Los Angeles, Tuesday: Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth will play next month in Las Vegas in his first US PGA Tour fall tournament in America after failing to meet the tour event minimum last season.
Spieth failed to meet the minimum number of PGA starts last season after he failed to qualify for the season-ending US PGA Tour Championship, opening him to a fine and major penalty under tour rules.
But officials said last month that Spieth and the tour had reached a unrevealed resolution and that might have led to Spieths change in schedule for an early start in the 2018-19 season.
Spieth will tee off November 1-4 at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open at TPC Summerlin.
Im really excited to be playing, Spieth said. The event has been on my radar for a while, as the course has a great reputation on tour and I absolutely love the affiliation with the hospital. Its going to be a really fun week in a great city.
Spieth previously played fall US PGA events from 2013-15 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China.
In 2014, he won the Australian Open and Hero World Challenge, setting up a five-win campaign in 2015.
The 25-year-old American won the 2015 Masters and US Open and 2017 British Open and needs only the PGA Championship to complete a career Grand Slam.

Sri Lanka broadband penetration to grow at 50%
Sri Lankas broadband penetration will soar from 17% to 50% in the coming 3-5 years, according to a report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
These details were spelled out at the Asia-Pacific WTTx (fixed wireless access) summit at Shangrila-La Hotel Colombo yesterday with the theme Bring Affordable and Fast Fixed Wireless Broadband to Every Household.
With more diversified mobile applications happening in the home, fixed wireless access will be a crucial ingredient in bringing wide coverage and low cost in providing universal broadband services, the report further said. GTI, Informa and Huawei hosted this summit and discussions were centered on accelerating the growth of Asia-Pacific household penetration, advancing the affordability of favorable policies and regulations, and gathering more partners to forge an end-to-end industry ecosystem.
At this summit, Huawei together with Asia-Pacific ICT regulators, leading operators and industry organizations launched a joint declaration called Bridge the Digital Divide, Accelerate Broadband to Households to endeavor to create a sustainable industry environment for the development of fixed wireless broadband.
The event saw ICT regulators engage in discussion on how fixed wireless broadband can achieve the maximum usage for the development of society by policies and regulations including spectrum, tax, land and subsidies.
WTTx is a home broadband technology using 4G/4.5G technologies to deliver cost-effective fiber-like wireless broadband access to unconnected households. Low deployment costs and operating expenses are among WTTxs greatest advantages.
During the summit, Pradeep de Almeida, Dialog Group Chief Technology Officer, said, Current subscriber and data growth demands faster network roll-outs and affordable services. We have identified WTTx to be the fastest way to cater to this demand. WTTx is used to rapidly capture the customer demand and provision the services for home broadband.
Tide Xu, Chief Strategy Office of Wireless Product Line, Huawei, said in his opening speech, Huawei will keep customer-centric, continuous innovation to provide best experience, cost effective solution for a better connected intelligent Asia-Pacific.
By 2017, the accumulated WTTx user numbers had reached 50 million globally. With WTTx, wireless broadband connectivity to unconnected households can be achieved 75% cheaper and 90% faster when compared to fixed-line deployments, delivering a return on investment to operators in less than three years.

Of the key topics under discussion was the possibility of three main parties, the Vehicle Exporters, Vehicle Importers and the Government of Sri Lanka to work together under one umbrella to dissect the industrys obstacles and issues at hand and to disseminate the solutions in a method that is mutually beneficial to all parties involved.
President of SLAAJ, Nishantha Meegalla, said, One of the biggest challenges faced by vehicle exporters out of Japan is the lack of coordination between industry officials and the other relevant organizations which in turn affects the business. Therefore, the Association places great emphasis on developing trade links through appropriate programmes to establish mutual relationships with vehicle dealers and other parties.
The final outcomes of our discussions at this convention has to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved and our final stakeholder, the vehicle user. It is only through a united front amongst these parties that we can work towards achieving our goals, he added.
SLAAJ was formed in 2012 with a membership of over 70 Sri Lankan motor vehicle exporters based in Japan. The association was a brainchild of the then Ambassador to Japan, WasanthaKarannagoda who felt the need to unify Sri Lankan vehicle exporters under one umbrella to maintain, manage and interrelate the industry with proper standards and certifications.
The SLAAJ remains a self-motivated, non profit-making social organization that functions and interacts directly with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Japan.
Since its inception in 2012, the Association has conducted trade development between Sri Lanka and Japan through integrated programs, launched awareness programs relating to the automobile industry, vehicle spare parts and other businesses, and developed a mutual relationship between vehicle dealers and other parties while cooperating with relevant regulations, and has taken up other issues with the Sri Lankan government as well as local and international organizations.
Umar Ali, President Kobe Motor Company said, Constant and ad hoc policy changes mean that we have to recalculate our procedures which impacts trade losses faced by exporters and importers as well as delays in shipments and documentation.
This is why we want to liaise with two of Sri Lankas main bodies, the Vehicle Importers Association Lanka and Vehicle Importers Association Sri Lanka and work as one voice to raise issues and formulate policies that will be helpful to us and the policy makers.
Kobe Motor Company is one of the Top 10 vehicle exporters out of Japan. Of the Top 10, six companies are Sri Lankan owned.
The two main vehicle importers associations in Sri Lanka are the Vehicle Importers Association Lanka and Vehicle Importers Association Sri Lanka.
Launched at this event is the SLAAJ Guarantee, a sticker that will be pasted on every vehicle exported from Japan hereafter, ensuring the end user will be guaranteed of quality, and the proper standardization with their purchase.
The SLAAJ also conducted a forum that was attended by officials of the Foreign Ministry, Import Control Department, Sri Lanka Customs, RMV and the Ministry of Environment.
President Maithripala Sirisena, was the Chief Guest while Chairman and Managing Director of Vallibel One Group, Dhammika Perera was the Guests of Honor at the event.
Prof. Dammika Ganganath Disanayake, Ambassador Extra-Ordinary and Plenipotentiary for Sri Lanka to Japan and Wasantha Karannagoda, Admiral (Retired) former Ambassador Sri Lanka Embassy in Japan and other Ministry and government officials also participated.

Sri Lanka well above Human Capital Index averages
Sri Lanka scored well above the South Asian region average and on par with the world average according to a new Human Capital Index (HCI) launched by the World Bank that assessed the health and education standards in 157 countries.
The HCI was launched by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim at the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings last week as a new tool to encourage countries to invest in people.
The Index ranks where each country is now in terms of productivity of the next generation of workers. According to it children born in Sri Lanka today would be 58 percent more productive as workers in the future if they enjoyed complete education and full health.
According to the HCI, 17 out of 100 children in Sri Lanka are stunted, and so at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime. 99 out of 100 children born in Sri Lanka survive to age 5. In Sri Lanka, a child who starts school at age 4 can expect to complete 13 years of school by her 18th birthday. Across Sri Lanka, 87 percent of 15 year-olds will survive until age 60. This statistic is a proxy for the range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes that a child born today would experience as an adult under current conditions, the World Bank said in its data analysis.
The HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. It conveys the productivity of the next generation of workers compared to a benchmark of complete education and full health. According to the World Bank 56 percent of children born today across the world will lose more than half their potential lifetime earnings due to under investment in health and learning.
In 2017, Sri Lankas HCI is higher than the average for its region and income group. The Index is part of the World Bank Groups Human Capital Project, which includes a programme to support to countries to accelerate progress in human capital outcomes.
The HCI have ranked countries using a rating scale of 0 to 1. The HCI South Asia average is 0.46 where as Sri Lanka has scored 0.58. The world average is 0.57. The HCI score is 0.44 in India, 0.48 in Bangladesh, 0.49 in Nepal, 0.39 in Pakistan and 0.39 in Afghanistan.
Singapore tops the HCI rank with a score of 0.88 and Korea, Hong Kong, Finland, Ireland and Australia also have a higher rating. The countries which lag behind in the index are Chad, South Sudan, Mali and Liberia.

Stability of Markets: Beware of Volatilities and Asset Bubbles
Hard on the heels of present global currency depreciation tensions, the world financial markets confronted a turbulence during last week 3rd-11th. It started from the Wall Street, New York, and quickly spread across the world. Unlike normal market volatilities, this turmoil was sudden, disruptive and fast-spread. Some investors lost billions of their net worth overnight.
The Wall Street panic started on 3rd with a sudden rise in Treasuries yields waiting auctions of new Treasuries around US$ 230 bn during the week. By next day, it spread as a heavy stock market sell-off (inclusive of derivatives and other products) that led the worlds globalized markets to be turbulent and tumbling for 11 days, despite macro-prudential and monetary models in central banks available to tract such markets turmoil. The 11th was the worst day. The Chinese stock market fell four years-low. The stock sell-off caused nearly 6-9% fall of stock indices in major markets. The fall during last Thursday (11th) alone was more than 2%. Although markets showed some signs of stabilizing on Friday, tensions resumed on Monday (15th) with alerts for further turmoil.
Immediate Cause of the Turmoil
Financial turbulences invariably hit due to monetary policy decisions and confusing policy statements made in forward guidance models of central banks. Before the last global financial crisis 2007/09, the monetary policy in all central banks was a confidential activity where interest rates, reserve requirements, credit limits, etc., were communicated to banks in circulars. The general public neither required nor had access to details.
* Monetary Policy Forward Guidance
However, central banks in the west commenced informing the public of their policy targets, i.e., inflation and unemployment, to ensure the policy consistency and public support to recover from the recession caused by the financial crisis, despite monetary policies and regulations.
The US Fed announced targets of 2% inflation and 6% unemployment to drive its ultra-lose monetary policy and started publishing forecasts of key macroeconomic variables along with a press release and a press briefing after each policy decision to explain the policy rationale and performance as compared to pre-announced targets. As their languages have become highly technical to give different connotations (see press releases of the US Fed and other central banks) as central banks do not have adequate data on the present economy and future performances and shocks.
* Interest rates spillovers
Interest rate decisions of central banks immediately affect market interest rates, Treasuries yields and prices of assets/investments such as stocks, bonds and mortgages. Therefore, markets before and after central bank policy meetings drive enormous speculations to seek profits out of policy decisions by interpreting all communications of central banks diversely.
The present US Feds monetary tightening phase since December 2015 towards its normalization and neutral interest rates has been under constant speculations by markets world over along with Feds economic forecasts, current developments and experts comments. The Fed interprets neutral interest rates as rates that neither overheat nor restraint the economy. Immediately after the Feds latest rate hike (September 29, 2018) by 0.25% to 2.00-2.25%, the Fed Chairman Jeremey Powell made a comment as below at a forum on October 2, 2018.
Interest rates are still accommodative. We are gradually moving to a place where they are neutral, but not that we are restraining the economy. We may go past the neutral, but we are a long away from the neutral at this point, probably.
* Immediate Market Reactions
Above comment was not a model-based monetary policy forecast, but a blunt view of the Fed Chairman, similar to statements by Governors of other central banks. Up to this point, markets were speculating the Feds neutral rate to be around 3.5% at the end of 2019 at the current speed of rate hikes. Therefore, the comment became a surprise and markets started speculating of faster rate hikes beyond 3.5% as the Fed says the point of neutral rate is dependent on up-coming data and views of the FOMC.
Next day (last 3rd), financial media repeatedly displayed the Powells comment. Immediately, the Wall Street became turbulent with rising Treasury yields (benchmark 10 year-yield rose from 3.06% to 3.32%) when investors attempted to sell Treasuries to cut capital losses interim as securities prices would decline with rate hikes in anticipation to buy them back later when prices are lower. This is the bearish market behaviour. Next day (4th-Thursday), stock market confronted a sudden sell-off to buy Treasuries at lower prices pushing down yields (10 year to 3.12%). This is normal arbitrage activity in markets. However, such excessive arbitrage is quite rare.
Market analysts commented that the usual correlation between Treasury yields and stock market (changes in few basis points in Treasury yields generally go with few points changes in stock market indices) broke as stock indices involved in falls as high as 400 points a day (DJIA) as compared to few-basis-points-change in Treasury yields. In the sell-off, investors also re-profiled their portfolios of certain asset classes to suit new speculations.
* Views of Ben Bernanke and Mervyn King
Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote on two similar instances of market turbulence caused in April 2016 consequent to his statements, what he described as rookie mistakes, that caught him with heavy public criticism. He wrote that he learned an important lesson about the power his words carried in his public capacity.
Mervyn King, former Bank of England Governor and a veteran central banker, wrote To retain credibility, it is important that central banks do not claim to know more than they in fact do. And it is clear that central banks are not able to provide accurate forecasts of their own actions. Policy must confront the fact that stuff happens. Making forecasts is inherently difficult. They always turn out to be wrong. The most egregious example of wrong forecasts by central banks was the prediction before the crisis that the Great Stability would continue. He concludes that central banks are using forecasting models that ignore the lessons learned in the past.
The present exchange rate forecasts of Sri Lankan central bank have failed as the currency tensions continue to prevail. Therefore, despite so-called macro-forecasting model-based policy decisions of central banks, markets suffer if they bet on or rely too much on central bank decisions and confusing communications as they are not angels to know more than markets do.

Immediate Public Response to Powells Comment
* Market Response
All market analysts started criticizing the Fed for its faster tightening phase of the policy cycle, initially expected to be 3 to 4 years as against the ultra-lose relaxing phase of nearly a decade of 2007-2016 at around zero interest rates. Markets in the world are now built on high US Dollar liquidity being the most popular global reserve currency. Therefore, the US monetary tightening so fast under the guise of unknown neutral interest rates has started causing immense disruptions to both the US economy and global economy. The IMF before its annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, 12th-14th last week, cut the global growth forecast for the year from 3.9 % to 3.7% and alerted that world trade tensions and tight monetary policies could fracture global value chain of trade and cause biggest risks to emerging market economies and there is not time for complacency as near-term financial turmoil risks have elevated.
* President Donald Trump
The president Trump who had been publicly critical since June 2018 on the Feds fast monetary tightening criticized again several times on 10th-11thas he became furious of sudden market sell-off where he boasted earlier of his new domestic economic policy for high market activity and strong economy. His critical remarks were The Fed is too aggressive and far too stringent and it is making a big mistakeThe Fed is going loco. There is no reason for them to do so. I am not happy about it. The economy is about to crash. I know the monetary policy more than the Fed, believe me. The central bank is out of control. I will not fire Powell...Blame the Fed for sell-off, dont blame trade wars or China. His economic team clarified that the Fed was independent and it could consider views of the President. The whole world has shown similar views on the Fed on the heels of prevailing currency turmoil that has caused world-wide economic disruptions. Views of the Fed and others are quite diverse on intellectual grounds as nobody has a universally accepted forecasting model or economic theory.
Central banks, if they do not listen to democratic views of public because of their money printing power and intellectual model-based dogma, can confront public protests in the event markets become turbulent causing bankruptcies and losses, despite the stability duties of central banks. Therefore, markets have to find own market mechanisms innovatively to protect their interests. The panic is not the solution.
Monetary Policy and Financial Turbulences
Modern monetary policies carried on through overnight interest rates and open market operations in the inter-bank markets follow cycles. Each cycle constitutes a tightening part followed by a relaxing part and vice versa. Durations of cycles are not identical and may vary from 5 to 15 years depending on the macroeconomic conditions of respective countries.
* Lose Monetary Part and Bubbles
On the relaxing part of the cycle, credit expansion, asset market boom and market value of wealth rise faster. Such wealth gets into credit collaterals for further lending where bank balance sheets and profit start booming. As a result, banks tend to lower their prudential credit standards in pursuit of sugar high profit while the regulators become complacent of improved performances of banks and the economy. Accordingly, an asset price bubble/boom fueled by a credit bubble develops where everybody lives on too much credit in all corners.
* Tight Monetary Part and Bursts
After few years of monetary relaxation, central banks suddenly wake up and start yelling at markets on too much credit expansion and potential risks to inflation in the unidentified medium to long term. They talk about the need to anchor inflation expectations of the public to be within their inflation targets, fixed or flexible, which they never have a track-record other than lengthy macroeconomic reports. Accordingly, they start tightening money by raising interest rates and lowering credit. Depending on its magnitude and speed, credit and asset bubbles start prinking. If the bubbles are too blown, they start bursting with asset prices tumbling.
See graphic
At the beginning of the bubble-pricking, always-complacent markets and central banks state that it is a market correction although they never commented ex ante on over-growth of markets. The last weeks stock market sell-off, although markets commented as a correction, could be an early warning of an asset bubble already blown during the last ultra-lose monetary decade waiting to burst in the current phase of monetary tightening. Nobody could predict it until it hit.
No central bank monetary policy or macro-prudential models have ever predicted them. Frederick Mishkin, Columbia University Economics Professor and former Fed Governor, described the last global financial crisis as a kind of a burst of an asset bubble fueled by a credit bubble which required monetary policy intervention. Although he was in the Fed Board at that time, he also could not predict it.
The bursts or collapses of asset prices and credit lead to business bankruptcies and non-performing loans due to liquidity and credit crunch. Banks confront big holes in collateral values available to recover non-performing loans in rise. This raises bank vulnerabilities including bank runs. Meantime, non-banking financial institutions/shadow banks which normally operate in different degrees of regulatory arbitrages confront immediate vulnerabilities and runs, given the excessively risky nature of their businesses. Then, once the horse left, central banks start monetary relaxing to boost credit and economic recovery (Econ 101). By this time, central banks have new staff as the staff who did the monetary tightening earlier have left.
Therefore, banks, other financial institutions, businesses and public have to be mindful of live risks of monetary policy cycles on their sustainability if they bet too much on monetary policy decisions as central banks are not accountable in the event of crises. Central banks invariably blame the markets for crises. Governments cant bailout markets and economy as they also live on credit and may even confront bankruptcies due to difficulties to service and roll-over debt, given the huge debt pile they are sitting on, whoever manages it.
Therefore, market participants need to beware of market volatilities frequently and follow a stable and moderate growth path (e.g., around annual 10%) of businesses with quality assets and capital to prevent build-ups of unhealthy risky assets and business bubbles and to ensure long-term sustainability.

The third Sri Lanka Next 2018, A Blue Green Era, conference and exhibition will be held on October 19 and 20 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) under the aegis the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The exhibition is organised by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry in line with the worlds interest on controlling climate change.
Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday, the event also aims at gathering updated knowledge on local, regional and global efforts to address climate change issues and disseminate such knowledge to support Sr Lankas development agenda.
This programme is to ensure Sri Lankas low carbon pathways to reduce global warming with respect to the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
It also aims at creating an awareness among the key stakeholders and the public on the environment and a blue-green economy to obtain their active participation to achieve both economic and environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka.
The Deputy Minister said a major challenge faced by the world today is the impact of global warming which has a direct link with the activities of the people. Since it is estimated that the world population will increase by another 2 billion by the year 2050, it has become absolutely necessary to pay increased attention to global warming in keeping with the increasing population.
Therefore, it is important to take necessary measures to utilise the worlds limited natural resources for sustainable production and consumption for the benefit of future generations, he said.
Meanwhile, the Central Environmental Authority has organised the Presidential Environment Awards Programme to reward individuals, institutions, Organisations, Environmental Journalists and Industrial activities who have made a special contribution to the field of environmental conservation and protection.
The awards ceremony will be held on October 19.
The main objective of this awards ceremony is to appreciate the enthusiasm of the public towards environmental conservation and protection, while sustaining their active involvement in the long run for the clean and green production and services.

Turkey searches Saudi consulate
TURKEY: Turkish Police on Monday searched the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for the first time since journalist Jamal Khashoggi went missing, as US President Donald Trump floated the idea that rogue killers could be to blame for his disappearance.
Khashoggi, a Saudi national and US resident who became increasingly critical of powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since he walked into the Istanbul consulate to sort out marriage paperwork on October 2. Turkish officials have said they believe he was killed -- a claim Saudi Arabia has denied -- with the controversy dealing a huge blow to the kingdoms image and efforts by its youthful crown prince to showcase a reform drive.
Trump despatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for what the State Department described as face to face meetings with the Saudi leadership to find out what happened.
Until now, Riyadh has not allowed Turkish investigators to search the consulate -- officially Saudi territory -- with reports both sides were at odds over the conditions. But late Monday evening -- after Turkish authorities placed high iron barriers in front of the consulate -- a motorcade of six cars drew up and Turkish police and prosecutors entered the premises.
Some police were in uniform while other officials were in suits carrying printers and files, an AFP correspondent said. A Saudi delegation had entered the consulate one hour before the Turkish police arrived and appeared still to be inside as the search was conducted.
A Turkish forensic expert was seen on the roof close to the consulates flag. After over three hours work, the teams were still inside the consulate.
Trumps comments came after a telephone conversation with King Salman, father of the crown prince, the first such talks since the crisis erupted.
Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened to our Saudi Arabian citizen, Trump tweeted.
Riyadhs most recent comments have focused on having no knowledge of any killing or denying any such order had been given.
The denial was very, very strong, Trump later told reporters at the White House. It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows- AFP

Twin sisters give birth to sons on the same day
Identical twin sisters Jalynne April Crawford and Janelle Ann Leopoldo, 30, experienced miscarriages at the same time. Jalynne, from Arizona, has polycystic ovarian syndrome and had an unviable ectopic pregnancy whereby the foetus grew outside of the womb. At the same time her twin, Janelle, from California, had a miscarriage which she experienced again at a later stage.
Jalynne and Janelle then ended up getting pregnant again simultaneously. Now, with some work, theyve given birth on the same day to two healthy boys.
We kept telling each other, Its Gods plan, said Janelle. Maybe this is his way of getting us pregnant together like weve always wanted. Weve got to be patient and accept the journey.
Following their fertility struggles, the sisters were ecstatic when they discovered they were pregnant, just four days apart.
As their pregnancies progressed, they shared their story with the world, posting a pregnancy photoshoot on Instagram and revealing the painful journey which had got them there.
I thought it would be helpful if we could reach someone going through this to know not to give up. This happens to a lot of women. explained Janelle.
Despite their joy at becoming parents again, they worried that they wouldnt be able to do it together as they resided in different states.
Determined to have the whole family together, Jalynne approached her doctor and asked if it would be possible for them both to deliver on the same day in Arizona.
With their due dates so close, the doctor said it wouldnt be a problem so they packed up and went to Arizona six weeks before the big day.
In June this year, Jalynne gave birth in the morning and Janelle in the afternoon, with their whole family waiting there to meet the babies. Jalynne, who now has four children, has completed her family, but Janelle, with three, said she is not quite there yet. I know she and her husband want four kids as well, so theyre not done, added Janelle.

Voice to an expression
Walking down the memory lane, I picked up two fascinating works by Edmund Wilson (1895  1972), the US literary critic, essayist, editor, journalist and creative writer. The two books out of a galaxy of his works are Axels Castle first published in 1931, and the other To the Finland Station first published in 1940. The former is a study in the imaginative literature of 1870  1930. The latter is a study in the writing and acting of history.
I read Axels Castle in order to perceive literary insights into the much-discussed topic of symbolism in the first instance as followed by a series of literary notes on WB Yeats, Paul Valery, TS Eliot, Marcel Proust, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. The writer cum critic Edmund Wilsons literary approach was different from most others who were his contemporaries as well as those who followed him.
Creativity blended
In order to enter into the world of symbolism, Wilson takes a synoptic view of what was known as Naturalism, Realism and the Romantic Movement. He initially selects Yeats in order to show the poetic vision that has gone into the world of creativity of Realism, Naturalism and Symbolism rest, at times in isolation and at times as blended. He tries to compare the poetic flux of Yeats and Valery in this direction.
Eliot is regarded by Wilson as a poet initially influenced by the French symbolism of Stephane Mallarme and Paul Valry. But analyzing the two works of Eliot, the Waste Land and Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock, he shows the latent independent creative symbolism he utilizes. Wilson visualizes Eliot as a pacifier to the human sufferings that culminate in warfare and nuclear disaster.
Wilson attempts to interpret the creative works of James Joyce as a seeker of a new symbolic movement. He selects the short story collection, Dubliners, the much-discussed narrative, A Portrait of an Artiste as a Young Man, and the long epic narrative, Ulysses. Wilson tries to show the different forms as utilized by Joyce to create shades of symbolism that opened new dimensions in fictional writing. Wilson denotes that the Homeric parallel in Ulysses is in general pointed by and charmingly recreated in modern psychological ways of expression. As such, Joyce tries to give the story a universal significance. Furthermore, Wilson states that the most remarkable features of Ulysses are its interest as an investigation into the nature of human consciousness and behaviour. Its importance from the point of view of psychology has never been properly appreciated through its influence on other books and in consequence upon our ideas about ourselves has already been profound.
Main narratives
In this manner, Wilson presents a lengthy interpretation of the creative process in the three main narratives. Coming on to the works of Gertrude Stein, the critic Wilson states that her best-known work is the narrative titled as Three Lives. The works consist of three long short stories, the histories of three women, two of them German servant girl, the other a mullet Negro girl. As we can agree, Wilson states that the work of Stein is written in a style which appears to owe nothing to that of any other creator of her time.
Three Lives of Stein as Wilson points out, though not circulated widely, exercises a considerable influence, on other writers as well as literary circles. As a literary critique Wilson maintains the idea that the personal conviction of a particular writer compulsorily enters into the body of the creative process, he or she is involved.
He takes the example of several writers whose lifestyles and convictions have seeped into the creative flux engaged in. In this direction, an emphasis paid to the profile and the work of the French writer Marcel Proust as exemplified in his work Remembrances of Things Past (A la Recherch du Temps Perdu in French).
All in all, this collection of essays by Edmund Wilson provides an indispensable field to the representative literary works of the 20th century with special reference to Yeats, Valery, Eliot, Joyce and Stein.
The literary movement that of significant are covered taking into account quite a number of the representative creative writers as well.
Wilson was the managing editor of Vanity Fair and later served as associate editor of The New Republic and as a book reviewer for The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books.

Yahapalana govt protects womens rights - Minister
One of the main aims of the yahapalana government is to protect the womens rights and give them a place in society, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
No other government has done so much for women in the country. We have increased womens representation in the political sphere and made 25 percent representation mandatory in local polls, the Minister said.
She was speaking at a ceremony to appoint 75 women from across the country as Justices of the Peace (JPs) organised by the Eksath Lak Vanitha Peramuna (womens wing of the UNP).
Empowering women is very important in the countrys forward march. Women who take the lead in household matters are well positioned to take leadership at village and national level, the Minister said.
I have been appointed as the first female member of the Constitutional Council and it was a great victory for the entire community of women in the country, she said.
The post of Justice of the Peace is an honorary title and these appointees should function in the interest of the public. The Justice Ministry can abolish these posts if they misuse the post and if they have behaved unethically, she said.
Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe always says it is important to empower women to get their maximum contribution to boost the economy. It has been proved that womens contribution in decision-making bodies at all levels, especially at the community level, is more efficient and effective. We need to empower women and a special programme has already been initiated to uplift the living standards of women, he said.
Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said the role of women has evolved over time moving from the primary role of a woman as a wife, a mother and a keeper of the household to a more challenging and demanding role, which involves active engagement and contribution towards her familys financial and social wellbeing. Given this background, empowering women and uplifting their living standards are key areas of concern for the government.
Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage said it has been proved that corruption and misappropriation have gone down and the efficiency has increased in places governed by women.

SL exports to China doubles for  first time in a decade- DoC
Sri Lankas Department of Commerce (DoC) has reported the countrys largest ever global trade linkage for Sri Lankan exports sector so far on October 16 in Colombo.
The DoC also said that for the first time in a decade, Sri Lankan exports to this huge market has doubled.
The visit of China National Agriculture Wholesale Market Association (CAWA) delegation to Sri Lanka opens a huge export opportunity for Sri Lankan agriculture and fresh produce sector. We also warmly invite member associations of CAWA to invest as joint ventures in Sri Lanka, transfer latest technology and partner with our Sri Lankan suppliers, said Minister of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka, Rishad Bathiudeen in Colombo. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the visiting CAWA delegation led by Chairman of CAWA Zengjun Ma, who is not only the leading personality in the massive US$ 2 trillion Chinese agriculture and fresh produce wholesale market but also well known by Netherlands based World Union of Wholesale Markets (WUWM) the collective global voice for wholesale and retail fresh food markets from 44 countries across the world. CAWA is a national industry association approved by the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs. Minister Bathiudeen was joined by DG Commerce Sri Lanka, Sonali Wijeratne and many other DoC officials during the October 15 meeting.
CAWAs International Commissioner Jingjie Kong said, CAWA has members in all provinces and municipalities across China accounting for 70% of the national wholesale total-which means we have an even bigger presence in China retail sector. All of the top 200 wholesale markets in China are members of CAWA. The CAWA managed annual wholesale turnover within China exceeds China Yuan/CNY 10 Billion or US$ 1.4 Trillion, which is 70% of the national wholesale total.
We are impressed by Sri Lankan fresh produce. As a result we are looking for trade and agriculture cooperation with Sri Lanka announced CAWA Chairman Ma and added: Not only the taste of Sri Lankan produce are better, also due to European Union standard compliance, the quality of Sri Lankan produce a very high. DoC has shown us some fresh produce such as coconut water and kernel processing in Sri Lanka and we are impressed due to their in-depth reach. Many such processing activities taking place in China are not so in-depth nor multi-level. It is very clear that Sri Lankan agriculture and fresh produce supplies can clearly expand in the huge Chinese market due to competitive pricing of Lankan products, features such as good taste, higher quality, and uniqueness. We are also impressed by DoC organised supplier meetings with in Colombo with such institutions as the Coconut Development Authority and Seafood Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (SEASL). Chinese consumer market is expanding in a big way and we suggest to prepare a good, dynamic pricing strategy for Lankan suppliers to China to win in our market. We invite an official DoC delegation to China with Lankan suppliers for B2B matchmaking. China has high level seafood processing technology that Sri Lanka can make use of.

Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa honours 40 alumni this year
The annual Sri Jayawardenepura Pradeepa 2018 to be held on October 17 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla for the third time will be awarding 40 alumni who have contributed to mother Sri Lanka through various mediums of art. The award will be presented by President Maithripala Sirisena for the third consecutive year.
The Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa can be best regarded as acknowledgment of those worth of an age-old legacy. The history of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura can be dated to the inception of Vidyodaya Pirivena by Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera in 1873. While the Thera is remembered for his contribution for the independence struggle of Sri Lanka, he is often regarded as an unsung hero of the struggle to set up public education in the country.
While we are aware that he along with Rev. Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera rekindled the Pirivena tradition of the country, it is a little known fact that it was he who encouraged Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott to establish Ananda College and several other notable schools. Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott, upon reading the translation of the Panadura Debate conducted by Rev. Migettuwatte Gunaananda Thero is said to have visited Sri Lanka. He paid a special visit to meet Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, who was a chief contributor of facts during the Panadura Debate.
As the intellectual bond between the two grew, Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera together with Rev. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera encouraged Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott to establish Ananda College. At the time, there were only four Buddhist schools in the country catering to 246 students, while there were 905 missionary schools catering to 78,086 students. With the establishment of Ananda College, there was a great revival of spirit that led to set up150 Sinhala Buddhist schools. The schools he helped establish; the Pirivena he established developed and supported the nation through education. He created a generation of well-versed scholars who would aid the nation in their future.
He dedicated his life to develop this nation and his example was followed by many such as Anagarika Dharmapala and the founder of Vidyodaya University known to us today as the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera.
Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera was indeed a visionary; he made sure that his vision will continue by being a role model to many, and as mentioned, Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera took the initiative he began by developing Vidyodaya Pirivena to become Vidyodaya University in 1959, becoming the first University of the Independent Sri Lanka and the Second University of the country.
The Vidyodaya Pirivena was promptly shifted from Maligakanda to its present location, Gangodawila when it was decided to be given university status. The vision was to expand it to provide students with better opportunities and a host of new subjects. The land necessary for such expansion was donated by the Sunethra Devi Pirivena; a pirivena established by King Parakramabahu the Sixth of the Kotte Kingdom for his mother - Sunethra Devi. In essence, with the present glory of the university, we are still paying tribute to one of the most significant kingdoms of the country which brought about the golden era of Sinhala literature in those days of yore.
Though decades apart, the Vidyodaya Pirivena and the Vidyodaya University was set up with the unified vision of servicing the nation with an educated population. The Vidyodaya University was born out of the necessity to provide higher education in Sinhala, a gap that needed to be filled upon the passing of the Sinhala only Act in 1956. The concept of providing the university status to a pirivena was at times looked down upon, even laughed at by many, but Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera took upon the challenge and delivered effectively.
The pirivena he began with just seven students has become one of the largest universities in the country with seven faculties committed to the vision of its founders to produce young scholars who will develop the nation. The University of Sri Jayewardenepura has continued to expand over the years and is the only university that has been able to increase its intake by 500 students with each passing year.
Today the University takes a student centred approach in creating young intellectuals, thereby ensuring that the students are not only intelligent but are independent. The students of the university are given exposure and industry training to develop their soft skills and personality to befit the needs of the industry and the nation.
Having revisited the history of University of Sri Jayewardenepura and its present status, it is made evident that providing service to mother Sri Lanka is the legacy it has continuously kept true to.
The Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa acknowledges and awards individuals produced by the university who has continued to uphold this legacy by providing their services to Sri Lanka with the hope of developing it.
The Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa is an annual event that awards alumni of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura who are working in different sects of the country. The selected alumni are awarded a miniature replica of the statue of Rev.
Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera, which was established in the university premises in 2013 by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne. Prof. Ariyaratne, alumnus of the university and an eminent artist, will not be awarded at this event as he has graciously agreed to be among the panelist that chooses the alumni who best deserve this award for their remarkable service to their motherland.
While being unable to award, the university fondly pays tribute to the memories of the artists such as: Somaweera Senanayake, Simon Nawawattegama, Rev. Hiripitiye Pragnakeerthi and many others who were also once sons and daughters of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

Adios the immortal songstress!
Classical music remained second religion for her. She worshipped the Buddha, lived with music and blessed Sri Lanka with extraordinarily classical music for well over half a century. She is Professor Amara Ranatunga who passed away at 79. Her demise leaves a void in Sri Lankan culture for many reasons.
Born on August 22, 1939, at Hanwella to Don Wiyolis Kasthuriarachchi, Head Master of the Hanwella Primary School and Dona Alpinona Meegahapola, Dona Amara Kasthuriarachchi was the fifth of the eleven children of their music-loving family.
Though her parents had no scholarship over music as a subject, they loved music passionately. Their keenness and enthusiasm inspired the children  Amara well included.
As a young pupil, she used to take her music books and run to the bus halt to reach Colombo. Dayaratna Ranatunga, who was to be her husband later in life, and Amara Ranatunga were the pioneer students of the Government College of Fine Arts Heywood (known as University of Visual and Performing Arts). The much revered academic institute was open mostly to train teachers. The extraordinary talent both Amara and Dayaratne showed in their performances opened them to the gates of the Music College at the age of 12.
Amara first got introduced to music and dancing by watching the performances of her older siblings. Dr B S Wijeratne and Dr Lionel Edirisinghe, oldest veteran vocal trainers of Heywood and the great Sitarist Dr B S Wijeratne and K A Dayaratne Silva were the maestros.
Generally, the music degree course was for three years. Amara and Dayaratne followed it for six years, and when they reached the age of 18 years, their knowledge in `Raagadaari Sangeethaya was equivalent to the level of a Masters degree.
During her six years at Heywood, she never missed a single day. She would come to Colombo from Hanwella after the school. It was hard.
The enthusiasm kept her alive and energetic. Music has been part of her life, body and soul.
The doors of Radio Ceylon were open to Amara and Dayaratne by Dr.Lionel Edirisinghe and Ananda Sarath Wimalaweera when they were about 10 or 11 years. Hence the `Radio Mahagedara is not a strange place to the veteran duo. Both got a lot of chances to perform in many childrens programmes broadcast on the National Radio Service.
Amara means immortal in oriental lore.
Amara Ranatunga will stay in our hearts as an immortal songstress.

Art on the ends of strings
Indian puppetry was considered as one of the important art forms in the Indian theatre. Several centuries ago puppetry originated in India as an entertainment art form. However, due to the arrival of the modern multimedia entertainments, it has lost its vitality today.
All over the world puppetry is quite popular. It is considered one of the most important entertainment art. Puppetry reflects the countrys culture, traditions and customs. Even some of the contemporary issues are enacted through puppetry. Names of these puppet shows vary from region to region and from place to place. Several years ago puppetry originated in India as an entertainment art form. It derives its theme from various religious epics.
It imparts and cultivates various religious values and religious philosophy. In earlier times the puppeteers move from place to place to earn their livelihood. Yet it is considered as a folk art. Mostly these puppets are manipulated by strings, shadow, rod and glove. On these bases the puppets are categorized into four varieties namely, String puppets, Shadow puppets, Rod puppets and Glove puppets. Normally in the string-puppet shows, the strings are tied to various limbs of the puppets. Commonly the strings are used to manipulate the puppets even today.
Popularity
Earlier, puppetry was started for entertainment purposes only and later it gained more popularity and recognition among the common masses. Originally, the puppets were made out of leather, thats why it was called Tholpavai Attam or Bommalattam. Tholpavai means dolls made out of leather. In Andhra Pradesh, it is called Tholu Bommalattam. Later the puppets were made out of various other materials such as cloth, light wood and paper pulp. But today some of the puppets are made with heavy plastic or rubber. The movements of the puppets are always accompanied by dialogue, narration, appropriate vocal and instrumental music. Different Indian states named the puppetry differently.
Puppet making is an exceptional art. They must bring out the characters with appropriate figure and facial expressions. Even proper costumes and ornaments are adapted to adorn the puppets. In addition, external voice support and appropriate music are given to the puppets to reveal the theme of the story. Earlier, the puppeteers travelled to various places to earn their livelihood. However, it was considered a folk art.
Recognition
In Tamil Nadu, puppetry was originally performed in the royal courts in Tanjore of Tamil Nadu. This art form was very popular in the Tanjore district and it originated during the period of the Tanjore regime. Originally, mere platforms were used to display the art, but now, covered stages are used and manipulators stand close to the stage to manipulate the puppets.
The names and nature of the puppet shows vary from region to region. For instance, earlier in Andhra Pradesh puppets were made out of leather. Mostly these puppets were manipulated with sticks. Another branch of development in the Indian puppetry is shadow puppet show.
Andhra Pradesh is very popular for this shadow puppetry and yet it is persevered by certain communities. Similarly, another shadow puppet show was performed in the modern Kerala state, called Pavai Koothu of Malabar. And later the puppets were made out of various other materials such as cloth, wood, and paper pulp. Sometimes the shadows of the puppets are allowed to fall on the back curtain. In Tamil Nadu, this type of puppetry is called Nillal Attam (shadow puppet show). Still, puppetry shows are very popular among the rural public. Usually, puppet shows take place in the night.
Origins
In Rajasthan, puppetry was called Kathputali. They also believed that their ancestors were responsible for the origin and development of Indian puppetry. Later they migrated to different states and wherever they migrated, they introduced this art form. Beautiful puppets are made with an aesthetic touch. Earlier the rational theme of the story was the life history of a ruler named King Amar Singh who ruled some hundred years ago. Later numerous techniques were adopted and introduced to keep the interest of the audience alive.
In Orissa, the Odissi puppetry was based on Radha and Krishna themes and based on Vaishnava cult. Sometimes folklore or popular legends are also selected for puppet shows. The size, shape and even the figure of the puppets differ from state to state.
In Bengal, it is strictly dedicated to goddess Kali and performed during the special religious functions and festivals of the temples. Some of the puppetry was vested in the hands of a few classes or certain communities. A few puppet shows have gained popularity within a particular regional level alone, due to various factors such as linguistic and cultural differences.
Technology
To activate the puppets, mostly the strings are used. Besides this, modern technology is also added to some extent by giving different sound and colour light effects. Due to the arrival of modern technological innovations such as television, video and home video systems, this traditional puppetry art form has lost its vitality among the masses. Yet at the village level, it has some entertainment value.
To a certain extent, puppet shows have again gained popularity through the visual media. Now various sociopolitical themes and contemporary subjects are selected for television puppet shows to impart and spread certain ideas among the viewers.
By seeing the television puppet shows, the younger generation has got an opportunity to gather some ideas about this traditional folk art. At present, in some puppetry shows, the puppets are activated by remote control equipment.
Like some other Indian art forms, the Indian puppetry is also established its own domination in the South East Asian cultural scene, mainly in Java and Bali. Wayang Golek is one of the popular puppet shows of this region. The ancient popular Indian epics, such as Ramayana and Mahabharata are the main selective themes for this puppet show.

Bolt offered contract with Malta football club: reports
Sydney, Tuesday: Sprint king Usain Bolt could be making his way to Europe after being offered a two-year professional football contract in Malta, reports said Tuesday, with the club saying it wanted to "write history" with the signing.
Bolt, 32, has been on trial with A-League club the Central Coast Mariners since arriving in Australia in August in his bid to pursue a boyhood dream of becoming a footballer after retiring from athletics last year.
The 100 metres world record-holder scored his first two goals in professional football on Friday when he started a pre-season game against second-tier Macarthur South West United in Sydney.
Malta club Valletta FC said they had made a formal offer which includes playing in its upcoming cup final, with chief executive Ghasston Slimen saying the move to snare Bolt was "about writing history".
"Usain Bolt broke the record in Beijing (Olympics) in 2008, and I have followed him for the last year-and-a-half on his football journey," Slimen told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"We play the final of the Super Cup on December 13, which we will win... so can you imagine Usain Bolt lifting the Super Cup trophy 10 years after he broke the record in Beijing
"This isn't about money, this is about history. This is something that they will talk about in 50 or 100 years' time."
A group of investors from the Sanban Group in the United Arab Emirates acquired a majority stake in the club last month, vowing to qualify for the group stages of Europe's Champions League.
Slimen admitted Bolt still had to improve his footballing skills, but said he was inspired by the former sprinter's jubilant celebrations -- including the trademark lightning bolt victory pose -- after the goals.
"I don't want him to be here on holiday, I want him training hard," he said, adding that he wanted Bolt to be lifting trophies during his stint at Valletta.
"I don't want to make a big fuss, I want him to sign the contract, get on the flight, arrive in Malta and train, because we need to prepare for the Super Cup."
The Australian agent who arranged Bolt's trial with the Mariners declined to confirm or deny the reports when contacted by AFP on Tuesday.
Bolt does not yet have a contract with the Mariners ahead of the start of the A-League season this Friday, with the club's chief executive Shaun Mielekamp saying in a statement that the Jamaican "will continue his indefinite training period... until any further notice".
Media reports suggest the Mariners are waiting for governing body Football Federation Australia to decide whether it will contribute to a potential Aus$3 million (US$2.1 million) offer to Bolt.
FFA head David Gallop said Tuesday "the story of a contract in Europe is news to me", but that any financial support from the governing body would not be drawn from a marquee fund set up to attract top players to the A-League.
"The ball is very much in the Mariners court. They have to make a decision whether they want to move to put Usain onto a contract," Gallop told Macquarie Sports Radio.
"If they get to that point (of signing Bolt) then we'll look at what's feasible for us but it can't be from the marquee player fund.... we can't use that money but we'll look at if we can do anything else."
The 32-year-old previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway to no avail. AFP

Buddhist principles to boost workplace ethics, values and profits
How could the principles of Buddhism help boost levels of workplace happiness, productivity and profits while safeguarding workplace ethics and values was the main theme of a forum on Buddhist Leadership Practices in Business organized by the National Council for International Affairs of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC) in Colombo yesterday.
Welcoming the gathering Lakshman R. Watawala, President National Council for International Affairs ACBC said that their main motive behind the forum is to practice and propagate Buddhist teachings in all humanitarian services.
Practice is essential in all our activities otherwise we would forget what we are doing, he said.
Speaker, Karu Jayasuriya said Buddhist values and principles should be used in businesses to achieve maximum wellbeing. Currently one of the main Buddhist practice, meditation is used in business environments to develop the mentality of the employees. Nevertheless in some business schools, it has been seen that Buddhist teaching programs have been conducted as part of their curriculum.
Business is not a business if it incurs harm on others, physically or mentally. These days, adopting Buddhist practices has become a global trend. Some of the worlds major companies have adopted these teachings to ensure their success. Mindfulness and motivation are the chief principles of Buddhist management. Employees wishes can be satisfied through these, he added. He also suggested the ACBC should expand this event to accommodate international Buddhist leaders and to share their ideas for the future development.
Sarath Jayamanna, Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption said, all businessmen must practice the 10 perfections. As preached by the Buddha, the only three rules that one should follow are to guard your speech, guard your body and guard your mind. Giving things without any expectations, having the thought that everyone is going to the same destination at stressful moments, giving attention to others and taking competition as a positive aspect are some practices of Buddhist teachings as followed by some businessmen.
Even though we have resources we lack the skill of using them for our development unlike countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore. The environment should be preserved well irrespective of any business we are engaged in.
Our Employees should be treated well so as to get the maximum benefit from them. We have to set an example to others through Buddhism, he said.
Presenting the key note address Ven. Madagampitiya Wijithadhamma thera, Head of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Sri Jayawardhanapura said that teachings of all religions are not limited to any particular area. Compassion is the foundation for the user first approach to business. Compassion is the sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings of others. Equally businesses provide solutions for customers problems. The customers trust and respect could be gained by avoiding all ill practices. The more we respect the customer, the more we receive trust and loyalty. Individuals should fight against poverty by avoiding the six channels as stated in the Sigalovada Sutta of Deegha Nikaya.
Accordingly the income received by an individual should be divided in such a way that quarter of each should be kept aside for family needs and savings.
The rest needs to be used in the business processes you are engaged in. The role of wealth is to provide adequate services to oneself and society no to be craved for.
According to the Lord Buddha contentment is the greatest wealth that one can gain, he said.
According to Jagath Sumathipala, President of All Ceylon Buddhist Congress and Vice President of The World Fellowship of Buddhists, this forum has been conducted consecutively for seven years all around the world. It is the first time that this forum is organized in Sri Lanka.
He also said that they are hoping to initiate a Buddhist Business Circle through ACBC. With this ideas could be shared internationally to develop businesses.

Budget promises:  8% progressing to schedule
Only 8% of 2018 budget proposals are progressing according to schedule and the promises doing well include, providing 20,000 housing units for low income families, according to a research by Verit Research, a private think tank.
At the end of the first six months of 2018, the pace of progress is slow as only 8% of the budget proposals are progressing in line with their targets, Research Director, Verit ResearchSubhashini Abeysinghe said.
In 2018, the platform by Verit Research has been tracking 38 budget promises amounting to Rs. 149,350 million, which accounts for 82% of all new expenditure proposals in the 2018 budget speech.
The progress on 33% of proposals is categorized as broken, neglected or undisclosed. This means that the government has not communicated properly the status of the promises amounting to Rs. 60,200 million. The bulk of new expenditure proposals in the 2018 budget (59%) are categorized as lagging in terms of their implementation, she said. Governments willingness to share information remains low at 26%. While the governments progress in implementing its budget promises remains stagnant, its willingness to disclose this information has declined.
In the first half of 2018, information on progress for 74% of the tracked promises was either not available or obtained with difficulty.
In nearly 60% of the promises being tracked, government institutions failed to provide the action plan or progress report in response to a request filed under the RTI Act. Further, only 33% of progress reports could be compared against the action plans received, Abeysinghe said.
In the 2018 Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance announced that an implementation unit would be set up under the ministry to monitor the execution of the proposals in the speech. However, in response to an RTI request, the Ministry of Finance claimed that such a unit does not exist. Yet, in another response, this statement was contradicted by the same ministry, Team Leader, Economics, Vidya Nathaniel said. However due to the implementation of the Right for Information Act, information gathering has become flexible.
The Research identified Megalopolis urban housing project, National Youth Corp, and Fisheries Ministry as some of the best institutions that are implementing budget proposals successfully.
Ministry of Agriculture, Highway projects and some of the education projects were listed by Verit Research as moving at snail pace when it came to implementation of 2018 budget proposals.

Call to cancel Rs.5,000 note to tide through economic crisis
The circulation of the Rs.5,000 note should be cancelled as for a solution to the economic crisis, said National Movement for Social Justice Convenor Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya yesterday.
He said that there is information on people who have so much of Rs.5000 notes in their possession that could fill even a container. He also said that there is information on several such people who store Rs. 5000 notes in gunny bags. He added this affects the countrys economy.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference at the National Movement for Social Justice head office in Rajagiriya.
Prof.Wijesooriya added that the some politicians have stored money in such a disorganised manner according to the information received.
He also said during the period when N.M.Perera was the Finance Minister, he cancelled the Rs.50 and Rs.100 denomination notes which resulted hiding and storing such notes being exposed in public. He added that this strategy is more applicable today than then.
He also said that it was far better to cancel the mass scale events organised to build the image of politicians as a means of improving the economy rather than curbing imports.

Call to pay Rajarata Uni.Medical Faculty lecturers allowance
The State Medical Students Parents Union demands the Government to pay the due allowance to the Medical Faculty lecturers attached to the Rajarata University,Media Spokesman of the union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the Rajarata University Medical Faculty faces closure. This is a huge injustice for state medical students who passed the G.C.E.Advanced Level Examination in the Science Stream with flying colours and are studying in order to become MBBS doctors.
According to Alwis, the Dean and all the lecturers of the Rajarata University Medical Faculty resigned because of non payment of the due allowance. This may be a ploy to promote private medical education.
The medical students just re-commenced their education after eight months wasted on preventing the illegal and fraudulent SAITM coming into operation.Now there is no issue at all to pay the due allowance for lecturers. The relevant authorities should make arrangements to pay it and enable state medical students to study without further delay, he added.

CCBSL, Eco Spindles and RDA launch plastic recycling project
Coca-cola Beverages Sri Lanka (CCBSL) along with Eco Spindles Pvt Ltd and Road Development Authority (RDA) of Sri Lanka launched a plastic recycling project last week.
The project Give Back Life focuses on collecting PET plastic bottles for recycling at every exit point along the Colombo-Katunayake Express way.
Addressing the gathering Saman Opanayake, Director, Expressway Operation & Maintenance Division, Road Development Authority said that this project helps to minimize environment issues. Thus it makes a favorable place for both consumers and residents dwelling on either side of the road way. The intention behind this project is to build up an eco-friendly environment. We hope to place 10 bins at every exit point and 16 bins at every police and STF check point. Steps are taken to distribute educational material about recycling to the public. The first stage of this project has been already initiated in Southern Express way where 48 bins are already placed at every exit point. John Keels Pvt Ltd and Eco Spindles have sponsored for this commitment.
CCBSLs project Give Back Life, provides easily accessible collection bins as an effective solution. World without waste been their global goal they hope to reach this target well before 2030. Through this they intend not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also to collect and recycle the same amount. We believe that all packaging materials have benefits and they can be turned into valuable products said Asoka Wickremesinghe, Chairman, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. He further emphasized that they require a better collection of plastic materials. With the help of Eco Spindles these plastics can be turned into brushes, yarn, clothing and shoes. He also said that the government gives their full support to this public-private partnership. Furthermore Coca Cola has expanded its project with Arpico Super center, Perera and Sons Pvt Ltd and Sri Lanka Cricket Council.
BPPL Holdings with its wholly subsidiary Eco Spindles is the largest plastic recycling firm in Sri Lanka. Every month 250 tons of plastic are recycled for usable products. They have 125 collection points all over the island which are run by independent parties. These points are regularly audited and health and safety rules are strictly followed. The bottles collected from these centers are delivered to the washing plant in Horana. The washed bottles are then produced into usable industrial and housing appliances exported across the globe. In July 2018, the company opened the first yarn industry in the country. It is never possible to eliminate plastic from our lives due to economic factors. But what we could do is to recycle them to usable products, Anush Amarasinghe, CEO of BPPL Holdings said. Each kilo of plastic is purchased at a price of Rs.20 to Rs.40.
This initiative would help not only to make Sri Lanka an eco friendly environment but also provides many job opportunities.

Chameleon pens
Alcohol-based markers can be some of the best tools in any artists arsenal. Whether you are an accomplished artist, a creative crafter, or a beginning hobbyist, markers like Chameleon Pens will help you take your creativity up a notch. They can easily integrate into any project youre working on.
To understand how they work and how to unlock their full potential, its important to know what an alcohol-based marker is and how it differs from your standard water-based marker. An alcohol marker has pigment or dye suspended in alcohol, making them fluid and fast-drying. With vibrant colour and the ability to layer and blend seamlessly, they are a must-have item for most artists. An added bonus is that you can use these permanent markers on a wide variety of surfaces. From fabric and wood to ceramics and plastic, you dont have to limit yourself just to paper.
Chameleon Pens is an innovative product that combines a high-quality alcohol marker and Mixing Chamber. By infusing the pen nib with the Mixing Chamber, you can create incredible gradations of colour in a single stroke. Known for achieving Colour like no other, the revolutionary marker opens up even greater possibilities when it comes to creating high-level art.
To get the most out of these refillable markers, lets look at some of the key colouring techniques that a Chameleon Pen can accomplish with ease.
Bright, crisp colour is one of the hallmarks of alcohol markers. As they dry quickly, you can easily layer colour to build up the dimension in your work without worrying that the colours will appear muddy. Using a slight touch, you can feather colours onto one another for a seamless transition that isnt possible with other types of markers. This overlay allows you to create new colours right on the page. If you think about the fact that there are 52 Chameleon Pen colours to select from even before you start layering, this gives an idea of the endless colour combinations that are right at your fingertips.
Its even possible to stack your colours by infusing your Chameleon Pen with more than one colour top to get a silky blend of shades to make your artwork pop.

The media is praiseworthy for publicising jumbo deaths on both road and rail. Whats worrying is the sad lack of interest with keeping to our ancient culture in protecting animals.
Theres no single answer to the problem but those in authority should move urgently.
Look at the Daily News picture of jumbos crossing the highway. They should construct overhead bridges over jumbo crossings both over road and rail. There are enough funds collected from Wildlife parks. This type of overhead bridges is built in both Africa and in the west. So why are we so backward and unkind to them
I appeal to all to give highest priority before more are mauled down. The food and water should be made available in plenty with electric fences.

ComBank winner of Green Company  of the Year at 2018 ACES Awards
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon was declared the winner of the Green Company of the Year title at the 2018 Asia Corporate Excellence & Sustainability (ACES) Awards that honour the regions finest and most responsible corporate leaders.
The Green Company of the Year title was awarded to the Commercial Bank for its contribution to the environment by offering sustainable finance products to clients to adopt environmentally responsible practices.
The candidates that qualified for this award were judged on a Sustainability Matrix that encompassed products and innovation, leadership value, ethical compliance, diversity and inclusion, and community empowerment.
The award for the Green Company of the Year can be attributed to the Banks stringent evaluation of credit proposals to gauge their impact on the environment and the sustainability of the projects; support to sustainable energy projects of its clients through lending; and for its own efforts in making its operations more environment friendly. Commercial Bank adopts a Social and Environmental Management System (SEMS) to assess and manage social and environmental risks in a strategic and systematic manner. Procedures and work flows within the framework of SEMS ensure that the Banks lending is to environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable and economically viable projects.
The Banks Green Loans and Green Leases too contributed to winning this award, as they facilitate the purchase of energy-efficient household equipment, the installation of energy-efficient lighting for households, the purchase of hybrid or electric vehicles, solar panels and other machinery or equipment used for renewable energy, energy efficiency, emission reductions, water and wastewater management and waste management.
The installation of solar power systems at branches, the Banks use of waste management companies that follow international standards in disposal practices for the dispatch of e-waste and paper, initiatives to migrate customers to digital platforms, and investments in automated technology that minimise the use of paper are a few of the other environment- friendly efforts initiated by the Bank.
Commenting on the title conferred on the Bank at the awards ceremony at the Fairmont Hotel, Singapore, recently, the Banks Managing Director, S. Renganathan said, This award reaffirms the Banks stature not only as a leading corporate in Asia, but also as an institution that is committed to being environmentally responsible; one that extends its planet-friendly ethos to its clientele and encourages eco-friendly operations with lending support.
Commercial Bank was also named among the Top Companies in Asia and the Top Green Companies in Asia at the 2017 ACES Awards.
The ACES Awards organised by the MORS Group recognise successful companies and individuals in Asia across two main domains, leadership and corporate social responsibility.

Creative possibilities of prosthetics
As the founder of The Alternative Limb Project, designer Sophie de Oliveira Barata uses her special effects expertise to create state-of-the-art prosthetics. Blending form with function and blurring the line between art and technology, this ambitious endeavour aims to creatively improve the lives of those in need of limb replacement.
To create these alternative limbs, de Oliveira Barata works closely with each client in order to get a sense of his or her style. Once she has an aesthetic in mind, she begins designing the limb, employing the help of 3D modeling specialists, electronics experts, and, sometimes, the client's prosthetist. The result Imaginative limb covers that delight the eye, empower the wearer, and inspire a positive dialogue about the human body and difference.
In addition to these highly stylized and avant-garde artificial limbs, de Oliveira Barata also designs and creates realistic prosthetics. Unlike the alternative pieces, these hand-sculpted models are intended to meticulously match the wearer's other body parts. In either case, though, de Oliveira Barata views each artificial limb as a means of self-expression and, ultimately, as a physical extension of the wearers personality.

Growing up with a strong will
De La Salle College, Modara
His maxim is that the deserving should be rewarded. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of De La Salle College Modara, Sivakumar Rukshan who strongly feels that merit comes through untiring effort.
For Rukshan, hard work is the determinant to ones social and spiritual development. You have to work hard to create your personality.
I feel that this drug addiction is really a big problem when it comes to young people. We need to nip this in the bud. From school itself, young people need to be dissuaded from using drugs. That will help in creating a society that is free from drugs. This must be started at home as well. Parents should know about what is taking place in the lives of their children. If they do their duty well, the child will be protected. Even teachers need to take responsibility as the student spends nearly six hours at school. A students life needs to be monitored consistently, said Rukshan.
There is much temptation in society. Here again, you have to work very hard at resisting.
Strong will
Today we cannot do without the internet. It is here to stay and it has now become a part of life. There is good and malign side to the internet. Pornography is rampant on the internet. The sexual content entices the young minds. Here young people must be strong-willed and use the internet for knowledge that will help in their education and stop there. They can then achieve their goals. But the problems is some of the youth go astray, explained Rukshan.
Fear leads to wisdom and if the teachers and parents do their duty, the child will become a model citizen. That will create a healthy society. Rukshan feels that a child should fear to do wrong. And that fear needs to be instilled in the child. He also stresses that a person should be rewarded according to his/her abilities and not according to where he/she comes from or the social status of his/her school or family. If there is a poor person who is talented, he or she must be promoted.
Rukshan also pointed out that if you take the society we live in young people are conditioned in such a way, that they only focus on the classroom work and the subjects taught in the classroom.
Even though this is the excellent knowledge that will help a young person in life, I also feel that in many cases today, the young persons capabilities are elsewhere. He or she may have certain talents, possess unique qualities and characteristics, display creativity and originality that may not be directly linked to what is taught in the classroom  the subject matter. If you are good at what you do then you will succeed at what you do. If you do what you like, then you will succeed at it, stated Rukshan.
Leadership qualities
Rukshan is a talented basketball player. The sport of basketball has instilled in him certain qualities that have helped develop his leadership qualities. His brothers have also been prefects at De La Salle who have become role models to him. The unwavering support of his Principal and the teachers of De La Salle College have been a great strength to him.
Rukshan feels that constructive criticism is always formulated by those who have in mind the best interests of the society he or she lives in.
I always follow instruction from my teachers. I believe in being honest and forthright. I am a straightforward guy. I always appreciate constructive criticism. I am always willing to correct any fault of mine. I say what I have to say and believe in straight talking. This I feel has enabled people to have faith in me, pointed out Rukshan.
Rukshan looks up to those who are closest to him. The greatest advice he has received is that if he puts his mind to the task at hand he can always accomplish it successfully.
I normally look up to people who are directly involved with my life and those who have helped me. They have taught me that my mind can take me wherever I want to go. I have done two professional software engineering courses (Advanced Technology and Research Institute certified Professional Software Engineer.) I am now a professional software engineer. On the side of basketball, I have gone on to international selection. I am also interested in the music field. I have also tried my hand at art. I am doing commerce for my A/Ls and want to go to the management or banking side, said Rukshan.
Start young
Lazing is normally the result of a misinformed mind that does not fully appreciate reality.
My advice to any young person is to start young and form your goals in life. Do not idle. Also never forget your parents and what they have done for you. Be a good citizen. Dont spoil your life doing drugs. Dont delay and procrastinate and always associate with the good company, explained Rukshan.
He points out that the first step to solving a problem is correctly identifying the nature of the problem and its causes. You should never give up in the face of adversity. If the problem is too complex, you should seek the counsel of a teacher or senior.
When facing pressure in life I always have with me my close friends my confidantes. For me, if I am under pressure I go to my Basketball Master in Charge or speak to my father, who I enjoy a close relationship with, summed up Rukshan.

2018 Nobel in Economics is awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer
Economics of innovation and climate change
WASHINGTON The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus has spent the better part of four decades trying to persuade governments to address climate change, preferably by imposing a tax on carbon emissions.
His careful work has long since convinced most members of his own profession, and on Monday he was awarded the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in recognition of that achievement.
But Professor Nordhaus sadly noted that he hadnt convinced the government of his own country.
The policies are lagging very, very far  miles, miles, miles behind the science and what needs to be done, Professor Nordhaus said shortly after learning of the prize. Its hard to be optimistic. And were actually going backward in the United States with the disastrous policies of the Trump administration.
Professor Nordhaus shared the prize with Paul M. Romer, an economist at New York University whose work has demonstrated that government policy plays a critical role in fostering technological innovation.
The award was announced just hours after a United Nations panel said large changes in public policy were urgently needed to limit the catastrophic consequences of rising temperatures. The prize committee said its choice of laureates was meant to emphasize the need for international cooperation.
The message is that its needed for countries to cooperate globally to solve some of these big questions, said Goran K. Hansson, the secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
That was described as a rebuke to the Trump administration by some proponents of stronger action to confront climate change. Under President Trump, the United States has pulled back from global efforts to limit climate change, and it has moved to reduce controls on pollution.
Any Nobel Prize linked with global climate change will inevitably be seen as an international critique of Mr. Trumps outspoken opposition to domestic and international climate change action, said Robert Stavins, head of the Environmental Economics Program at Harvard.
Professor Romer, for his part, offered a more optimistic take on the challenges confronting society, saying that his work showed that governments could drive technological change. He noted the success of efforts to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons in the 1990s.
One problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesnt exist, Professor Romer said at a news conference after the announcement. Humans are capable of amazing accomplishments if we set our minds to it.
The day began with a little comedy, as the Swedes struggled to contact the winners.
Professor Romer said he heard his phone ring, twice, in the early morning hours, but he did not answer because he assumed it was a spam call. Then he checked caller ID and saw the call was from Sweden. So he called back and, after waiting on hold, learned he had won the Nobel Prize.
Professor Nordhaus said he slept in, only learning that he won the prize when his daughter called.
She said, Its so nice! Professor Nordhaus recounted, and I said, What
Professor Nordhaus, 77, graduated from Yale in 1963, earned a doctorate in economics from MIT in 1967 and then returned to Yale as a member of the economics faculty. He has been there ever since.
In the 1970s, amid rising concern about pollution, economists including Professor Nordhaus began to argue that taxation was the most effective remedy: The government should require polluters to pay for damage to the environment and to public health. The idea remains broadly popular among economists.
There is basically no alternative to the market solution, Professor Nordhaus said Monday.
To assess the costs of climate change, including crop failures and flooding, Professor Nordhaus developed an economic model he called the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, or DICE.
The name, he said, consciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet.
The approach developed by Professor Nordhaus remains the industry standard. It undergirds the new United Nations report on the dangers of climate change, released Monday in South Korea, which warns that avoiding significant damage will require the international community to quickly coordinate changes in environmental regulation on a scale that has no documented historic precedent.
The Nobel committee cited Professor Nordhaus for showing the most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes.
Professor Nordhaus has also worked on broader issues related to economic growth. In a paper published in 1996, he showed that traditional measurements of growth understated improvements in the quality of life.
He used the example of artificial light, calculating that the amount of work required to produce a given amount of illumination had decreased much more sharply than the standard measures of the price of light. His technique was also unusual: He created his own fires, for example acquiring an authentic Roman oil lamp to measure the light it produced.
Professor Romer, 62, was honored for loosely related work on the determinants of economic development.
Economists who studied the broad workings of the economy understood that the pace of innovation was influenced by human behavior, but they had not mastered the details. As a result, they often treated innovation as manna from heaven, and not a legitimate subject of public policy.
Professor Romer received his bachelors degree and doctorate from the University of Chicago. He has spoken publicly about his struggles with dyslexia, joking that he found the strength to keep writing by telling himself, If Neil Young can make a living as a singer, I can make a living as a writer.
He said he was attracted to growth theory because he was intrigued by the acceleration of innovation that is a hallmark of the modern era. In papers in the 1980s and 1990s, Professor Romer developed the idea that nations could foster innovation by investing in research and by writing laws governing the ownership of intellectual property that rewarded innovation, but not excessively.
He argued that differences in policy helped to explain differences in economic growth.
In an interview, Professor Romer said the value of his work was in being precise about a broadly intuitive idea. It helps to see connections that werent obvious at first, he said.
In particular, his work elucidated the benefits of scale. While a community might meet its own material needs, larger communities will still tend to produce more and better ideas. It isnt just that we exchange mutton for port, Professor Romer said of the benefits of international trade. Probably the most important part of globalization is the sharing of knowledge that billions of people can all pursue in parallel.
In advocating for his ideas about growth, Professor Romer has sometimes courted controversy, telling one interviewer in the 1990s, Im quite happy to offend everyone.
In a 2015 essay, he criticized some other economists, including those with different ideas about the determinants of growth, for the sin of mathiness, which he described as the use of math to obscure rather than clarify underlying ideas. The style that I am calling mathiness lets academic politics masquerade as science, he wrote.
In 2016, Professor Romer was named chief economist of the World Bank, a prestigious perch for a development economist. But he resigned 15 months later, in January 2018, after suggesting the banks positive evaluation of Chiles economic policies had been influenced by political considerations.
There are broad commonalities in the contributions of Professor Romer and Professor Nordhaus.
The prize committee emphasized that both men, in their work, have argued that markets are imperfect and that government intervention can improve outcomes.
Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto, said both men also had helped to reduce the barriers to government intervention: In the case of climate change, by estimating the costs of inaction; in the case of innovation, by estimating the benefits of action.
Each showed how a careful accounting of economic forces can lead to progress, Mr. Gans wrote.
But both men still struggle to sell their ideas to policymakers.
Professor Romer, who is the son of Roy Romer, a former Colorado governor, said economists needed to cultivate and husband a reputation as umpires in the fact business rather than openly campaigning.
Professor Nordhaus lamented that that approach did not seem to be enough.
We understand the science, we understand the effects of climate change, he said. But we dont understand how to bring countries together. (www.nytimes.com)

England attack bounced  back, says Southgate
Seville, Monday: Gareth Southgate believes Englands attack answered their critics on Monday by scoring three goals in a whirlwind first half against Spain.
Raheem Sterling hit two either side of a clinical finish from Marcus Rashford, while Harry Kane was heavily involved too, providing a pair of excellent assists in the 3-2 victory in Seville.
Spain had never conceded three goals at home before half-time and while Paco Alcacer pulled one back, Englands win was secure by the time Sergio Ramos headed in with the games final touch.
Sterling, Rashford and Kane have all faced criticism in recent weeks. Sterling had not scored for England in three years -- 1,102 days to be exact -- while Kanes international drought now stands at seven matches.
Rashford, meanwhile, was guilty of spurning two golden chances against Croatia on Friday.
All three of them understandably had questions asked and all three responded with real top performances, Southgate said.
We could play off them, retain the ball. Their speed was the obvious threat but the decision-making, passing, and finishing was top quality.
The scrutiny on Sterlings performances for England has been particularly intense but Southgate had backed the 23-year-old to rediscover his scoring touch.
Its not for me to take any credit, the only thing we did say is when he scores, he will score again and he managed to do so pretty quickly, Southgate said.I dont think he ever lacked confidence. Sometimes you get chances and think too much. Tonight he took the chances, he was prepared to hit the thing early.
England kept alive their hopes of finishing top of their UEFA Nations League group and this performance was their best since Southgate took charge.
It was perhaps even their most impressive result since thrashing Germany 5-1 in Munich in 2001. Spain arrived on the back of three convincing wins under their new coach Luis Enrique, including one over England at Wembley, and had scored 12 goals in the process.
They will gain huge belief from what theyve done, Southgate added. As a team, to play the way they did, this can be a great reference point for them for the future. AFP
