All London Premier League clubs linked to sex abuse probe
London: Allegations of historical sex abuse have been made involving all five London clubs in the Premier League, the capital city's Metropolitan Police Service announced on Monday.
The five clubs swept up in the scandal that has rocked English football since former Crewe Alexandra youth player Andy Woodward went public in November last year are Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and West Ham.
Some of the claims go as far back as the 1960s.
The Met's figures mean the number of Premier League clubs who have been connected with the investigation has risen by one from last month when the global English figure given out by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) said there were four.
In all the Met said the allegations involved 77 London-based clubs -- three in the second tier Championship and three in League One and League Two -- and have received 255 allegations of sex abuse.
"On 8 December 2016, the Metropolitan Police Service confirmed it had launched an investigation into allegations of non-recent sexual abuse at football clubs in London," read their statement.
"As of Monday, 30 January, the investigative team, with officers from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, have received 255 separate allegations.
"The allegations are connected with individuals at 77 named clubs or teams.
"The breakdown for those clubs is: Five in the Premiership; Three against Championship clubs; Three against clubs in Leagues One and Two; and there have also been 66 other named clubs which would include non-league or non-professional or amateur teams."
Detective Chief Superintendent Ivan Balhatchet of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said that each and every one of the allegations will be looked into but the Met would not be supplying a running commentary on the investigations or how many allegations have been made against a particular club.
"The Met take all allegations seriously, and specialist officers will work through the information passed to them," he said.
Overall the number of football clubs who have been brought up in the enquiry stood at 248 according to the figures released by the NPCC earlier this month.
The NPCC were at pains to point out that does not mean they are under investigation but have been 'referenced when information is submitted'.
The number of alleged victims stands at 526 with the youngest aged four and 97 percent of them are male -- there are 184 potential suspects who have been identified.
Not all the alleged victims or perpetrators come from football with 10 other sports implicated including rugby, gymnastics, the martial arts and athletics.
The scandal blew up last November when Woodward went public over the abuse he had suffered at the hands of a convicted child molester at Crewe Alexandra.
Other ex-professional players have since gone public with several coming from Chelsea -- in an era well before present owner Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich bought the club -- claiming to have been abused by scout Eddie Heath in the 1970s.
Heath, who had similar allegations levelled at him from former youth players at another London club Charlton Athletic where he went after he was sacked by Chelsea in 1979 although not for sexual impropriety, cannot defend himself as he died in 1983 aged 54.
Chelsea have launched an internal investigation over the slew of allegations of historic abuse made by former players. AFP

## Title: ART OF DAVID PAYNTER

## Date: Wednesday, February 1, 2017 - 01:00
ART OF DAVID PAYNTER
The renowned artist David Paynter who had the distinction of being the first artist from Sri Lanka to receive his art education in Europe. He was the son of Arthur Stephen Paynter and Agnes Weerasooriya, missionaries of the Salvation Army of India.
They were working in a colony at Almara close to the Himalayas in Uttar Pradesh, India when their son David was born on March 5, 1900 and he received his early education at the Brecks Memorial School on Ooty South India, where the children of the missionaries received their education.
After some time, his parents decided to leave India for Sri Lanka, arrived in the island and made their home in Nuwara-Eliya where they founded the Arnold Paynter Home in memory of his father Stephen, for children and mothers who were left out as destitute by the First World War.
The Home, later became a sanctuary for the needy children of mixed parentage. Today, the Home provides a training for boys and girls to make them independent.
David and his elder brother were admitted to Trinity College Kandy for their secondary education. While David was in the class, he was in the habit of filling the margins of his exercise books with sketches of his teachers and friends. He drew their heads and hands displaying his early aptitude for art.
He was 19, when he chanced to meet a lady named Mason who was seen painting a scenery of the Lake Gregory in Nuwaa-Eliya. After getting acquainted with her, she volunteered to give him a six month painting trial and encouraged him to enter an open art competition, to follow a four year course in art at the Royal Academy School in London.
After he completed his course of studies, he won the coveted gold medal awarded bi-annually, with it the Edward Scott Travelling scholarship to study further in Italy and France. On completion of his two year course he returned to the island in 1925.
The Principal of Trinity College, McLeod Campbell offered him a teaching post on his teaching staff. In addition to teaching art, he coached students in boxing, rugby and athletics.
During the school vacations he was in the habit of going into jungles in the dry zone in the company of one or two teachers or some of his students and spend nights under the canvas. In these exciting trips, he carried his shot gun and walked along the beaten tracks in search of game.
The favourite places he visited were on the East coast, north of Trincomalee which he described vividly, just before the North East monsoon becomes thundery and heavy lowering in the East, towards sunset shafts of sunlight from the West lit up, the landscape in a strange unusual way which he ably captured with his brush and paint.
The preliminary painting Offering he painted in his studio  cum room in the school on a stone slab. The Principal then gave him the opportunity to paint murals on the surface of the bare stone walls of the newly built College Chapel.
The first mural he painted was Are ye Able. He portrayed the episode from the Bible, showing the mother of James and John, sons of Zebedee making a request from Jesus, to give her sons an honoured place when he establishes his kingdom.
Paynter illustrated this scene set against the Sri Lankas scenery using models of his students and some members of the school staff. He painted Jesus as a young man of thirty, sans his beard and Arab dress to give him an Asian appearance.
The Crucifixion painted above the main altar has a background with an outcrop of rocks, low hills, overcast sky, mangrove swamps and lagoon which fascinated him on his visits to the East coast, which he painted in great detail.
The Good Samaritan was painted above the pulpit with a background showing a stream lined by Kubuk trees and rocks with young lads and passers by, a member of the despised race, a Samaritan goes to help a wounded Jew who was lying on the roadside. He painted this mural with the other mural Washing the Feet of the Disciples using different colours.
The original murals he painted were damaged by exposure to the elements of weather. The figures he drew gave the Biblical stories a Srilankan look and contemporary relevance. His earlier paintings on Biblical themes were The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalam and The Entombment convey his deep religious convictions.
His portrayal of the beauty of the Mongolian women, LApre Midi Nepalianne and Nepali Mother and Child are paintings he did with great skill showing the training he received at the London Royal Academy schools.
Before he commenced to paint, he did a rough sketch of his paintings and worked on it capturing the facial expression of his figures and colour. Then with his selected colours,he painted making the colours permanent to last for a life time.
In painting, he concentrated on the visual aspects like line, colour, light, mass, movement and structure which he harmonized with realism displaying his craftsmanship.
One of his paintings, Paddi shows farmers tilling the soil with long handled mamoties which he painted using brownish grey.
Paynter, while teaching his students instructed them to study the human figure and he stressed that it is the most important aspect of studying art. He discouraged them not to distort the human figure until one acquires the proper skill. Explaining his concept of art he said, art demands from his followers a deep desire to experience aesthetic feeling.
In his pursuit of the ideal, he painted the male figure similar to the figures in Greek sculpture. The male nude and semi nude figure form the central image in art and sculpture of the Greek classical period which he followed rivaling with the Greek artists.
In 1931 he exhibited two of his painting; Goats and Cactus and Boy with a Catapult at the Royal Academy exhibition which won him praise and they were described as underlying rhythm of forms and colours.
The salient feature of his work was that he treated his objects with reverence for life because of his belief that all works are of the creator. The murals he painted at the Trinity College chapel and in the Chapel of the Transfiguration of S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia was based on the themes described in the Bible. He painted them skillfully and imaginatively to bring out the essence of the message of Jesus. Thereby he created Sri Lankan Christian art with an indigenous outlook and he was considered as one of the artists of the Asian Christian art movement.
Paynter had selected varied themes comprising ordinary people from everyday life, fishermen, peasants etc. Some of these paintings adorn the walls of private homes in Sri Lanka and India.
Portraits were his forte and he painted the celebrates of his time like Sir John Kotalawala, Sir Ivor Jennings, Dr. R.L. Spittle, Mahathma Gandhi, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru which he painted capturing the facial expressions when they sat before him.
He described a painting as a decoration, a part of the architectural setting of the building to be decorated. The religious faith of his parents and the Renaissance Christian Art he studied in Italy influenced him to paint Biblical themes in terms of his country and people.
Albert Dharmasiri writing on the art of David Paynter has said, He had a passion for pure vivid colours, infusing it with true tropical hues. There is also the poetic relationship with the figures and the landscapes, a theme he has developed.
Paynter held exhibitions of his work from 1923 for 17 years at the Royal Academy. In 1936 he held a one-man exhibition in the Wartheim Galleries in London which brought him recognition among the critics.
He also participated in four International Exhibitions in Pittsburg, Rome, New York and New Delhi and in addition he exhibited his paintings in the galleries of Edinburgh, Liverpool, Hull, Brighton and Manchester.
Most of his figures were painted in brownish-grey and he also used brilliant colours of the impressionists. While painting a landscape, he would select a typical Srilankan scene with foliage of trees and creepers.
He was essentially a master of pictorial compositions and painted figures following the academic style without using a limited range of colours. He had a strong reverence for all forms of life and it arose from his belief that everything was the work of the creator. There are unmistakable signs of his love for life and his surroundings.

Ban Ki-moon, former UN chief, drops South Korea presidency bid

Former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has ruled himself out of the running for South Korean president.
In a surprise move, the leading conservative candidate blamed political slander and "various fake news" stories against him for his decision.
His withdrawal is a boost for liberal candidate and frontrunner Moon Jae-in.
South Korea is seeking to replace President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached in December aftera long-running corruption scandal.
Ban gave a brief press conference in which he said he wanted to use his 10 years' experience as UN chief to achieve national unity, but said he had been subjected to "malign slander akin to character assassination".
"With all kinds of fake news, my intention for political change was nowhere to be seen and all that was left was grave scars to my family and myself, and to the honour of the UN where I spent the past 10 years," he said.
He said he was "disappointed by old-fashioned, narrow-minded egoistic attitudes by some politicians, and I came to a conclusion that it would be meaningless to work together with them".
Slump in approval rating
South Korea has been gripped by political chaos since Park was unseated. Millions took to the streets to protest against her leadership.
She is now on a trial at the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether her impeachment is upheld or if she is returned to power.
If it is upheld, presidential elections will be held within two months rather than their proper date in December.
Ban appeared to have significant support early in an unofficial campaign and was at one time the perceived frontrunner, but his approval ratings fell sharply as he faced criticism about his political competence.
He apologised in January after losing his temper at a press conference and calling reporters "jerks", and has denied allegations he took bribes from a businessman at the centre of a corruption scandal.
Moon called Ban's decision "unexpected" and said she would be willing to seek his advice on international affairs.

Bangladeshi girl may be first female with 'tree man syndrome'

When a bark-like wart grew on 10-year-old Sahana Khatun's face four months ago, her father was not worried.
But after they began to spread, he became more concerned, travelling south from his village to the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka to get medical help.
Now doctors fear Sahana may be the first female to ever be afflicted by so-called "tree man syndrome".
If their diagnosis is right, she becomes one of a tiny group worldwide with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
It is a rare genetic disease that produces scaly, bark-like growths which particularly affect the hands and feet.
Only a few people - all men - are thought to have the disease.
For some, it is incapacitating, with one man unable to touch his wife and child for a decade.
Abul Bajandar's hands were each consumed by growths which weighed 5kg (11lb), with warts also growing on his legs, giving him the appearance of a tree.
The 27-year-old, who was the first Bangladeshi diagnosed with the disease, has now undergone 16 separate surgeries at Dhaka's Medical College Hospital to allow him to use his hands once more.
Doctors told the AFP news agency last month that he would soon be able to leave the ward - and those same doctors are now conducting tests to establish whether Sahana has the same unusual skin disorder.
For her worried father, Mohammad Shahjahan, it is little comfort.
"We are very poor. My daughter lost her mother when she was only six. I really hope that the doctors will remove the barks from my beautiful daughter's face," he told AFP.
Doctors are hopeful Sahana may have a less aggressive version of the illness and should be able to recover more quickly.

Bodyline Group reaffirms its carbon conscious status
Marking its fifth year as a CarbonConscious(r) company, the Bodyline group has renewed its certification making it the first sustainability milestone under its new leadership.
The company recently appointed Dinesh de Silva as CEO to spearhead Bodyline's operations, and joining him on the directorial board is Surath Chandrasena, who has been appointed as Bodyline's Finance and Sustainability Director.
The new appointments reaffirm the company's vision to consistently maintain and uphold the highest standards in their continuous efforts to not only remain CarbonConscious(r), but to also redefine standards of environmental sustainability within the business sphere. Bodyline, comprising four factories, was the first Sri Lankan apparel manufacturer to be certified as CarbonConscious(r), with the company's third plant located in Pimbura setting a new benchmark by being the first in the group of factories to be certified CarbonNeutral(r).
The CarbonConscious(r) certification requires clients to join a programme of measurement, management and mitigation of a business entity's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through regular monitoring and reassessments, adhering to international standards and guidelines. To this effect, Bodyline has been collaborating with The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC) to obtain comprehensive annual GHG Inventories for its operations, as well as to monitor and update their Carbon Management Plan set up by the same.
The certification was awarded by The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) - one of Asia's first verification, validation and certification bodies to be accredited for ISO 14064 GHG Quantification and Reporting.The Conscious(r) range is part of a proprietary, diverse range of certifications developed by SFG following internationally accepted standards and protocols to measure, manage and mitigate/enhance key environmental impact areas such as carbon, water, waste and biodiversity.
Stepping into a leadership role in a company which continues to demonstrate its commitment towards protecting earth's life and compensating for its impact on the planet is a privilege CEO Dinesh de Silva said. Bodyline has already set such a high benchmark in its environmental practices and through this initiative, we hope to set an example and encourage other corporates to collectively work towards becoming a part of the solution for a greener future.
He further added, As I believe, if we each take responsibility in shifting our own behavior, we can trigger the type of change that is necessary to achieve sustainability for all life on this planet.
We change our planet, our environment, our humanity every day, every minute, through our work and we must take responsibility to make sure we change it for the greater good of Mother Nature.
Carbon Consulting Company CEO Sanith De S. Wijeyeratne said the emissions produced by Bodyline's factories have significantly and steadily declined in comparison with its production levels, with a notable increase in performance and productivity.
"This is a testament to the Bodyline Team's hard work, commitment and steadfast pledge to uphold the ethos of being not only a leading business in Sri Lanka and an apparel sector trendsetter, but also one that sets an example as an entity that holds itself accountable for its environmental sustainability.

Book review: Robert Knox in brief
The effort of Dr. Bandu Edussuriya in bringing out an abridged version of such an important and cerebral publication is a great need of the day. Undoubtedly, it is an arduous task. The significance of the publication relates to a number of reasons. Condensing of the original volume of Robert Knox (RK), himself a foreigner making an indomitable effort to capture the essence of the social, cultural and economic dimensions of the Kandyan Sinhala community, successfully, secondly contributing to the literature, the only recorded publication sociologically and culturally of the period during the 17th century, thirdly the authenticity of the facts due to his living with the Kandyans for over two decades, though in a sort of an open prison in the Kandyan territory (perhaps the first ever open prison camp any where in the world!), fourthly highlighting the level of tolerance of the Sinhalese. The achievement of Dr. Bandu Edussuriya, from the discipline of medicine, should be highly appreciated for providing the reading public an abridged version of such importance.
The writer very cogently emphasises for whom the abridged version was developed. The focus has been very futuristic to include children and modern day reader'. He very rightly avoids mentioning academia since the latter would prefer more details which are in the original. The modern readers are more concerned about time since there is no much of information and sources and lack of time to devote to details unless these are related to the work he/she is engaged. Furthermore, modus operandi related to travelling and logistics is far better than ever before that enables them to concentrate on less serious reading while travelling and during any space of time. Hence, short and abridged versions of even serious writings serve the voluptuous readers. Hence why there are similar short versions of books.
The abridged version of Robert Knox's Historical Relations... printed in 1681, opens the door for the younger readers a glimpse of the recent past history, 17th century, about the Sinhala culture and insights to the fauna and flora, the interests and the care of the people on the natural phenomenon which provided sustenance for the communities. The abridged version (AV) consists of the 39 chapters in 4 parts in 128 pages, the full volume of the original publication. Written in simple language, each chapter is less than 10 pages, readable in less than 2 hours which ideally fits into the schedule of any commuter. The four parts consist of a) Part 1-chapter 1-14, background, capture, and imprisonment in Candy (Kandy), tolerant nature of the Candyans, Part 2-chapters 15-22, fauna, flora, fruits, precious stones, part 3  chapters 23-28, The King nature, vices, recreation and religion, tyrannical nature of the king, revenues and treasurers, governors of the provinces, kings strengths, rebellion against the king, Part 4-chapters 29-39, inhabitants of the country, honour rank and qualities, religion, god and temples, gods and festivals, houses, diet, housewifery and salutation, lodging bedding, whoredom, marriages and children.
All of the above chapters provide the reader an inquisitiveness to probe in details as to how our ancient people lived, behaved and ruled. The ancient chronicles, both Mahavamsa and Chulawansa do not provide first hand information although both are used as important sources of our ancient history. This is true of countries that have similar historical records written down later, for centuries preserved in he minds of men. Hence, facts become blurred and distortions, contradictions do occur, unless these are supported by rock inscriptions and the like to substantiate the texts. Today, we use carbon tests and modern technology to verify the periods and scenarios of the past. In this background the book by Robert Knox is vital and valuable for us to know, almost first hand authentic information written by a person who experienced by living with the people and travelling all the time in the Kandyan territory without hindrances but all time planning his escape back to his motherland, UK.
The abridged version prepared by Dr. Bandu Edussuriya is also a valuable contributing towards motivating the younger readers to the study of the history and culture of Sri Lanka, who otherwise are engrossed with modern technology and rushing through life for want of time. Further, RK's publication indicates that even in dire straits one could be resourceful and be engaged while not giving up his desire to escape. The lesson of RK's publication for the younger generation of today is one of great importance. In that one could be creative and reflective contributing to social development without any resources at hand through a process of developing divergent thinking. Likewise it is also known that diaries of farmers who had recorded the daily routines and reflections of their activities meticulously have been used by scholars/researchers for their higher degrees, as well as for policy planning. The famous diaries of Government Agents of the past civil service in Sri Lanka is a case in point at a different level. RN's publication was also based on such routine recording of events.
The language of the publication is simple and could be easily understood by any one who has some competency in English. This abridged version of Robert Knoxs Historical Relations of Ceylon could be recommended to all school libraries.
The author could have made a suggestion in this direction in the introduction as a matter of encouragement to writing taking the writing phobia out of the youth. I wish this abridged version is translated into Sinhala and Tamil.

Book review:Kafka captured
English reading public will be thankful to O.T. Perera for writing a book on Franz Kafka, his celebrated novel The Trial and a critical study relevant to this novel. The content of O.T.s book has been divided into six chapters, namely Franz Kafka: A life, The Trial: the story, Interpretation of the Trial, the problem of interpretation, the world of France Kafka and afterward. The intention of O.T. in each chapter is to forward his knowledge, feelings and understanding of Franz Kafka together with the novel- The trial.
The author has attempted to give a detailed account related to the life story of Kafka in the first chapter. A number of photos have been included in this regard to portrait different incidents associated with this great novelist. Altogether there are twenty three photos. These photos are the authentic evidence which elucidates Kafkas life more than words. One of them includes O.T.s visiting of Kafkas tombstone. The second chapter includes the complete story : The Trial. The third chapter deals with the interpretation of the story. It exemplifies O.T. s real contribution to Kafkas literary service. He attempts to interpret Kafkas philosophy and literary .views while forwarding his ideas together with details selected from other literary critics. Since O.T is not satisfied with his interpretations, he includes the fourth chapter explaining the problems of interpretation.
The other two chapters are devoted to describe the literary world created by the novelist together with concluding remarks about him. O.T concludes this chapter as follows.
 He longed for a system of thought or belief that would transcend the distinction between the various compartments of life. It may be that he sensed, but would not accept, the limitation of reason, and new in his heart that only faith, which he thought was denied him, could answer his longing. He gives not an interpretation of the world in which there is desperate need for a synthesis of many interpretations, each of which is doubted. He exposes the apparent absurdity of reality, and equally the absurdity of the human mind that judges it to be absurd.
At the end of this book the writer provides a list of major works of Kafka and contribution of other critics towards his literary service. Kafka was born in July 3, 1883, in Prague, capital of present Czech Republic and grew up in an upper middle class Jewish family.
Kafka did not intend to publish any of his works during the life time. All his writings were published posthumously. The following note addressed to his close friend- Max Brod- discloses this fact.
Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me (that is, in the book cases, chest of drawers, writing- table, both at home and in the office, or wherever anything may have got to, whatever you happen to find), in the way of note books, manuscripts, letters, my own and other peoples, sketches and so on, is to be burned unread and to the last page, as well as all writings of mine or notes which either you may have or other people, from whom you are to beg them in my name.
Letters which are not handed over to you should at least be faithfully burned by those who have them. Franz Kafka.
Bellanwila O.T. Perera while living with his beloved wife in England continue to write article on various aspects of life and society to the Sinhala Newspapers in Sri Lanka. As I understand he is interested in creative writing and analyzing the world literature. He has published a Sinhala short story book known as Bindunu Pingana (Broken Plate). Camus and Kafka (A Critical Assessment of the two writers), Sinamaven Samugat Satyajit Rayi (Life and Work of Satyajit Ray) and Rabindranat Tagore (Biography). Franz Kafka is his first book written in English. It is my fervent wish that O.T. will write more English books in the future on world literature.

As highlighted in the Daily News last Friday, an overseas referee for the Kandy Sports Club vs Havelock Sports Club game. Charlie Brown from Singapore will handle the whistle on Sunday.
He is a top referee and has refereed in our soil earlier and the last was in the Sevens final. Charlie Brown grew up in Ireland and played rugby as a boy right up through high school.
As an adult and a passionate PE teacher, he became interested in working as a rugby referee.
He started refereeing in 2004 and has since refereed matches in America, P.R. China and other countries around Asia. Charlie joined CIS in 2012 and joined the Singapore Society of Rugby Union Referees. He was also appointed as a referee on the International Panel of Rugby Referees and refereed his first test match between Malaysia and Thailand. One can see today that there are lot of referees with different levels and abilities. I dont think anyone is born to be a good referee. Everyone has their passion, which really helps a lot to develop their referee abilities. The best referees, I feel, are the ones who allow the game to keep moving, without being at the center of attention.

Fearful behaviours of elephants
In my letter to your columns on July 27, 2016, I emphasized the dangerous behaviours of the elephants, especially when they are engaged in processions, very particularly in peraheras, the need of carrying tranquilizers as precautionary steps in case those massive animals run amok.
But it seems nobody to have bothered about it. Even the police had not advised those who are engaged in using elephants for events.
The Daily News recently carried a news item in which it states that an elephant participating in a Perahera at Gandara had run amok causing extensive damages for private and public properties, damaging three-wheelers, electrical post, etc. However it had been brought under control by the Wild Life Department authorities after five hours. What would have been the situation if it had attacked the spectators that include small children during the whole of five hours Who will take the responsibility if some casualties have occurred
I have often come across opinions and suggestions of the public published in newspapers. They seemed to give some food for thoughts for those both in the parliament and Cabinet as well. But those politicians do not wish to hearken or acknowledge such opinions and suggestions and thus involve in their proposed activities which are often detrimental to the people or the country.
My question is, are the relevant authorities waiting till human lives are trampled to death

Health factors in connection with rules and regulations on issuing visa for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka should be further strengthened considering the risks it poses to the countrys health sector and to protect Sri Lankans from diseases, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
We have already won many challenges in the health sector. But more challenges emerge with climate change, social change and development, the President said addressing the gathering after opening the new National Dental Teaching Hospital in Colombo yesterday.
President Sirisena said people visiting the island for various purposes, pose a major threat to the countrys health sector.
A large number of foreigners arrive in Sri Lanka for various reasons. They stay here for short or long duration. This poses a major threat to the health of the country. It is also a threat to the illicit drug eradication programme. The Health Ministry and the government should give priority to solve this issue, he said.
The people, state institutions and others should support to control dengue in the country. I will hold a discussion with the Health Minister and formulate a better plan next week to control dengue, he said.
Active participation of both state and private sectors will be sought to control dengue, the President said.

Edulji vows to put BCCIs house in order
Mumbai: The first woman to hold a top post at India's powerful and immensely wealthy cricket board vowed Tuesday to put the scandal-plagued body's house in order.
Former India captain Diana Edulji was appointed Monday to a four-member team tasked by India's Supreme Court to oversee the running of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
"The first step we have to take is to get the house in order," Edulji, who played 20 Tests and 34 one-day internationals for India between 1976 and 1993, told AFP outside her home in Mumbai.
"Let's hope we can bring justice and bring BCCI back to its glorious days," added the 61-year-old, saying it was time for Indian cricket to "look ahead" after years of turmoil.
The Supreme Court's appointment of the panel, headed by former government auditor Vinod Rai, was the latest development in its BCCI shakeup.
The board has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including accusations of corruption in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a betting scandal involving an IPL team linked to its former head Narayanaswami Srinivasan.
Charges of corruption and nepotism dented the BCCI's image in recent times, leading many activists to urge India's top court to intervene to reform the privately-run organisation.
The Supreme Court earlier this month sacked the BCCI's two most senior officials for failing to implement reforms aimed at improving governance and transparency.
Edulji, who joins prominent historian Ramachandra Guha, Mumbai-based banker Vikram Limaye as well as Rai, on the new administrative body, said it was unclear how long the four would be in place.
"Until we get the house in order, BCCI elections are done and everything (with) the state associations. Until the orders of the Supreme Court are implemented then only we will know."
Their exact titles were expected to become clear when the group meets for the first time in Mumbai on Tuesday. AFP

European athletics chief denies crisis
London: Athletics is not in crisis despite the horrendous publicity following the exposure of state-sponsored doping by Russia, European Athletics Association president Svein-Arne Hansen told AFP on Monday.
The 70-year-old Norwegian added the Russians would be back at some point competing under their flag instead of the neutral one they are obliged to race under now.
Hansen admits the scandal -- precipitating a blanket ban on Russia's athletes at last year's Rio Olympics save for those who met stringent criteria -- which also implicated officials from the sport's governing body the IAAF had left a lot of people feeling let down.
"We are not proud of the decision (by the IAAF) to ban the Russian team taken in Vienna in June last year but we stand with it because it shows we don't accept cheating in our sport," said Hansen.
"I think last year's European Championships in Amsterdam was a real game changer," he added before delivering the keynote speech to the Sport Integrity Global Alliance (SIGA) Forum.
Hansen, elected to his post in 2015 after years as director of the historic Bislett Games meet, continued: "The stadium was full, there were good performances and a good atmosphere.
"European athletics is moving forward and we have put in a lot of things such as good governance.
"When I travel around Europe it is clear we are not a sport in crisis, we are not in Europe at least.
"We have so many people working so hard for this and they feel let down by what happened especially in Monaco (IAAF headquarters) and we are awaiting the outcome of the police investigation for real answers."
Hansen said the criteria was in place -- as stipulated last June in Vienna and then further measures were laid down last November -- for a gradual return to athletic continental competition of Russian athletes this year.
"They (Russia as a nation) have to come back at one stage," said Hansen, who will learn more about the progress being made by the Russian authorities at next Monday's IAAF Council meeting when the team report back on their findings from a trip there last week. AFP

The suspect was arrested on November 2016, under the Public Property Act.
He is currently out on bail. Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara in the meanwhile, decided to relax bail conditions imposed on the former Deputy Minister and permit him to appear before the CID every last Sunday of the month instead of every Sunday.

Finance Minister orders probe on smuggled timber inquiry delay

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has orderedChulananda Perera, theDirector General of Sri Lanka Customs to probe the incident in which the inquiry into a large stock of timber that was to be smuggled out of the country, was delayed for three years.
A large stock of timber wasseized by Sri Lanka Customs in 2014 but due action had not been taken during the previous regime, denying the government due penalty or proceeds, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka said.
Minister Karunanayake pointed out that the Customs Department should be held full responsible for the liability.
The Minister said that an inquiry had not been made regarding this issue by certain Customs Department officials, in an attempt to embarrass the government.
It is a scam to create new topics by the Joint Opposition minor politicians, the Minister said.
The current government led by the President and the Prime Minister are taking every measure to end corruption and other misappropriation in the country and, under such circumstances, if the Department of Customs, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Finance, has disregarded legal procedures in connection with this incident, stern action will be taken against those responsible, the Finance Minister said.

Finch to captain Aussie Twenty20 team against Sri Lanka
Sydney Tuesday: Opening batsman Aaron Finch will lead the Australian Twenty20 team in the upcoming series against Sri Lanka with captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner resting ahead of the tour of India.
Finch, who was stand-in captain in Mondays one-day international against New Zealand, will take the helm for three matches in February, Cricket Australia announced Tuesday.
Its very exciting to be back and leading the side in Steves absence, said Finch, who has captained the national Twenty20 side on six previous occasions.
Its been a rollercoaster from being captain leading up to the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2016), being injured and then Steve taking over the reins for that tournament, but its something that any time you get the chance to captain your country in any format, youre very chuffed about.
Finch captained the Melbourne Renegades in Australias domestic Twenty20 Big Bash competition and believes selectors will be spoilt for depth in the absence of some of Australias leading playmakers. There are some extraordinary players around the country that will now get an opportunity and I think thats only a good thing for Australian cricket, he said.
Smith and Warner have been left out of the Twenty20 squad as they prepare for the four-test tour of India which begins on February 23.
Former opening batsman Justin Langer will step in as acting head coach for Darren Lehman for the Sri Lanka Twenty20 series which kicks off at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on February 17. AFP

Armed Forces personnel will be deployed to cultivate cannabis in the future. Several local Ayurveda drugs are imported from India which includes Opium, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Dr. Senaratne said the Maha Sangha did not oppose cultivating cannabis and therefore it can be done in the future. There is no issue in using cannabis as an Ayurveda drug. Problems occur when it is used for smoking like cigarettes, the minister said at the launch of 12 Pranajeewa Ayurveda products produced by Dr. Sujeewa Vithanage.
The ceremony was held at the BMICH, Colombo. Dr. Senaratne said annually herbal products worth US$ 54 billion are sold in the world market.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa supported the programme to export local Ayurveda products. Bottles containing Pranajeewa still carry photos of him and myself, he said.
Twenty Ayurveda products produced by Seth Suwa institution are exported to 20 countries. This helps promote Sri Lankan indigenous products in the world market, the minister said.
The minister said an international Ayurveda Trade Fair will be held in November while a summit of Alternative Medicines will be held in Colombo. The WHO has granted US $ 50,000 for this. India has produced drugs using papaya juice. The drugs will be imported to Sri Lanka soon and distributed through the Ayurveda Department, he added.

France win sixth handball world title
Paris: France won the handball world championships for a sixth time on Sunday with a 33-26 come from behind win over Norway, who made the hosts sweat by leading for most of the first half.
At a packed and partisan Bercy Stadium in Paris, Norway's 22-year-old goalkeeper Torbjorn Bergerud held the defending champions at bay until just before half-time.
However, after going 18-17 in front at the interval, France then raced ahead and never looked in danger of defeat.
The turning point came in the closing minutes of the first period as France's two stars, Nikola Karabatic and Valentin Porte, grabbed quick-fire unanswered goals.
"Words cannot describe the feeling, after all the pressure this month hosting the tournament, I feel deep pride at the level of support from French handball fans, they made us dream," Karabatic said after a game watched by 15,000 fans.
Karabatic and Porte went on to rack up six and five goals each as rank outsiders Norway looked on powerlessly as the side which choked in the Rio Olympic final against Denmark rose brilliantly to the occasion.
France came out for the second period with all guns blazing and quickly scored a flurry of goals, forcing a five-goal lead and panicking the Norwegians into a time-out within five minutes of the restart.
The runners-up, however, did have two outstanding performers in keeper Bergerud, man-of-the-match in their semi-final win over Croatia, who was again excellent, and Kent Robin Tonnesen, 25, who scored five times and was a constant physical menace.
Luka Karabatic, the team's injured pivot who partnered elder brother Nikolas to the 2015 world title, said it had been agony watching the game from the bench.
"Norway had a great first half and it was very difficult to watch, but when we went in at the break a goal up I knew it would be okay," he said.
"We were carried by the crowd and they cracked."
France keeper Thierry Omeyer, who was in the French side which won the title on home ground back in 2001, also thanked the fans.
"We are all really proud to fill these stadiums, it's just been huge having our families here and all our handball friends," said the 40-year-old stopper, who is now mulling retirement.
Slovenia claimed third place on Saturday with a 31-30 win over Croatia, overturning an 18-13 half-time deficit to make the podium for the first time at the world event. AFP

Gammanpila commends actions of Auditor General
The government is trying to remove the Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe to continue with its fraud, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila. He said this yesterday at a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head Office in Pitakotte. He said it was due to the honesty and dedication of the Auditor General that the COPE Committee could reveal the fraud behind the Treasury Bond issue. He added that the fraud behind the Coal transaction too could have been revealed due to the Auditor General working in line with the law. "The greatest obstruction for this government's fraudulent activities is the Auditor General and the ministers and members of the government are attempting to sling mud at the Auditor General."
He said Minister Kiriella had said the World Bank was of the view that the audit report on the Treasury Bond issue was not up to global standards. He added that the World Bank would not have made such a statement and knew that such a statement could only be made by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
MP Gammanpila said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake criticised the Auditor General for giving a report to Parliamentarians without a copy to him first. He added that the Auditor General was only answerable to the Parliament and not to the Executive.

Green light for SAITM
Putting an end to a long-held dispute, the Court of Appeal yesterday informed that medical degree holders of SAITM private university Malabe could register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Reproduced here are highlights from the landmark judgement.
Petitioner to the present application Dhilmi Kasundara Malshani Suriyarachchi a MBBS Graduate from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (hereinafter referred to as SAITM) has filed the present application before this court making the Sri Lanka Medical Council (hereinafter referred to as SLMC) the lst Respondent and had sought the following relief as against the said lSI Respondent;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse registration as a medical practitioner to the Petitioner as evidenced by letter dated 26.05.2016 marked P-27;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to register the Petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition preventing the Sri Lanka Medical Council agents and/or its employees, agents and servants from refusing to register the Petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse provisional registration to the Petitioner as evidenced by letter dated 26.05.2016 marked P-27;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to register the Petitioner provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition preventing the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse to register the Petitioner provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
Apart from the preliminary objections raised, which I will discuss at a later stage of this Judgment, one main argument raised by the Learned Presidents Counsel was based on the; Degree Awarding Institute Order made by the then Minister of Higher Education.
In this regard the Learned Presidents Counsel argued that there was no specific date given in the said order, for the said order to come in to force and submitted that in the absence of such date, the said order has not come into force at all. However in this regard our attention was drawn to another Degree Awarding Institute Order issued by the then Minister of Higher Education under section 25A of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the same institution SAITM, on 26th September 2013.
As far as the case in hand is concerned, this court is therefore satisfied that SAITM has been declared as a Degree Awarding Institution and continued to be a Degree Awarding Institution at all times relevant to the present application under the provisions of the Universities Act No 16 of 1978 (as amended) Section 70A of the Universities Act explain the powers of a Degree Awarding Institute as follows;
70A A Degree Awarding Institute recognized by an order under section 25A shall, with the concurrence of the Specified Authority have the power;
* To admit students and provide the instructions in such branches of learning as are specified in the order made under section 25A in respect of such institute.
* To hold examinations for the purpose of ascertaining the persons who have acquired proficiency in the courses of study in such branches of learning
* To grant an confer degrees, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions onpersons who have followed instructions in the course of study in such branches oflearning and passed such examinations.
* To grant and confer degrees on persons who have conducted research under its supervision and subject to conditions specified by the Specified Authority. (emphasis added)
In the said circumstances we see no merit in the second argument placed before this court by the Learned Presidents Counsel and therefore the question of deciding the Specified Professional Body will not arise for the purpose of this Judgment.
Apart from the applicability of the provisions in the Universities Act and the regulations made there under, the provisions of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) was also relevant to the application in hand but one of the main issue raised before us was, the extent to which the Medical Ordinance (as amended) was applicable to the case in hand.
As already submitted by the Petitioner, the Petitioner had visited the 1st Respondents office with a Senior Lecturer of SAITM to submit her application under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance for provisional registration as a medical practitioner.
This court will now proceed to go through the relevant provisions in the Medical Ordinance (as amended)
Apart from the several objections raised, the 1st Respondent had heavily relied on its powers under the Medical Ordinance (as amended) during the arguments before us.
In this regard the 1st Respondent had further relied on a report prepared by a panel of prominent medical consultants appointed by the SLMC, chaired by Professor M.H. Rezvi Sheriff. As observed by this court the said committee has been appointed by the SLMC to inspect and report on SAITM in terms of section 19A of the Medical Ordinance.
Apart from the provisions under which the said committee was appointed, the 1st Respondent relied on Regulation 31 of the Regulations made by the Specified
Authority under sections 137 read with section 70C and 70D of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the obtaining a Compliance Certificate from the Special Professional Body.
In this regard specific reference was made to Item No 5 of schedule II of the said Rule which provides that ...... in the case of study programme in Medical Sciences, the Teaching Hospital to which the students have access and provided with clinical training must conform in to the standards stipulated by the SLMC and argued that the 2nd Respondent must abide by the standards stipulated by the 1st Respondent and is subject to the supervision of the 1 0; Respondent.
As discussed earlier in this judgment, this court does not see any controversy over the regulations Gazetted in 1R4 but as observed earlier, the said regulations were Gazetted under section 70C and 70D of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the powers of the Specified Authority and if there are violations of the regulations, it is the duty of the special professional body which empowered with such supervision to bring it to the notice of the Specified Authority for the Authority to take appropriate Action. However as observed earlier, such powers of the Specified Authority can only be exercised subject to the directions and control of the Minister in Charge of Higher Education.
Therefore, with regard to any power (if any) conferred upon the SLMC under Regulations promulgated under section 70C and 70D read with 137 of the Universities Act (as amended) is subject to the powers of the Minister in Charge of Higher Education and in the absence of any action taken by the said Minister under section 27 of the Universities Act (as amended) the 1st Respondent SLMC is not entitled to relied upon such provision as a ground and/or objection to the case in hand, to refuse provisional registration under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended).
This court will now proceed to consider the powers vested with the SLMC under section 19A of the Medical Ordinance (as amended). As observed by this court SLMC is empowered under section 19A (1) to appoint a committee for the purpose of examination and investigation in order to ascertain,
As observed correctly in the case of Thajudeen V. Sri Lanka Tea Board 1981 2 Sri LR 471 disputed facts will have to be considered before a trial court where witnesses are permitted to testify on the disputed issues.
In the said circumstances this court accepts the report submitted before this court marked P-19d by the Petitioner as the report submitted by the investigation team under section 19A of the Medical Ordinance 23 (as amended) but, another question arises whether the said report was available before the SLMC when it was said to have considered the said report at its 5561h meeting held on 28th August 2015, since the last signatory to the said report had dated his signature on 04.09.2015. None of the other signatories have dated their signatures.
In this regard the 15th respondent submitted an affidavit from the Chairman of the investigating team The report prepared by the said team was presented to the Medical Council at its 556th meeting held on 28.08.2015 duly signed by all the members of the team except Dr. L.B.L. de. Alwis, Prof K. Sivapalan and the coordinator of the team Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath. I state that I directed the coordinator of this team Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath and signed and date the said report only after the above two members place their signatures. Even if the above position is accepted as correct, it is clear that three members of the said investigation team had not signed the report, when it was considered at the 5561h meeting held on 28th August 2015.
Based on the observations made in the said report including the main areas the investigating team had identified the following as the main deficiencies at SAITM.
1. General inadequacy of clinical exposure in all areas in terms of numbers and case mix is of grave concern.
2. Lack of facilities for training in practical clinical Forensic Medicine e.g. to examine and report l on clinical medico- legal cases to the Police and Courts of law; and no provision to carry out medico-legal post-mortem examinations
3. Deficiency in exposure to preventive care services in the state sector i.e. the MOH office activities and filed services When analyzing the above deficiencies along with the observations made it is clear that the investigation team had studied the functions at the SAITM with the intention of the improving the study programme by making recommendations to expose the under graduates to the state mechanism as identify under E6 highly recommending to the Ministry of Health, the access to state JMO system and under E5 recommending suitable field practice area to develop a working relationship with existing public health service.
However, the investigating team in their conclusion had surprisingly recommended that the SLMC does not recognize graduates who have completed the study programme currently provided by the faculty of Medicine SAITM, as suitable for provisional registration. When considering the observations made by the investigators as referred to above it is clear that the above observations does not match with the final recommendation made by them.
However, submitting that the above conclusion was made in mala-fide the Petitioner submitted before this court another evaluation made by the SLMC with regard to another Degree Awarding Institute namely Kothalawala Defence University, to establish the mala-fide of the SLMC.
The report said to have prepared by the investigating team of SLMC comprising of the president SLMC and four other members including Prof. Rezvi Sheriff who headed the investigating team to SAITM and Prof. Ranjani Gamage another member of the investigating team to SAITM in a two-page report on their preliminary investigation had concluded as follows.
When considering the two reports referred to above, it appears that one report has been made after inspecting SAITM and the other after inspecting FOM-KDU, but two different standards have been used, when preparing those reports.
However as observed above in this judgment, when the SLMC submits its recommendation to the Minister under section 19C (1) of the Medical Ordinance the role played by SLMC ends at that point, as they are not empowered under the Medical Ordinance to take over the functions of the Minister and declare that the Degree Awarded by SAITM should not be recognized for the purpose of registration under the Medical Ordinance (as amended) since the legislature had thought it fit to be given not to the SLMC but to the Minister.

How digital business enables   customer and business process
Digital services play a vital role in synchronizing digital customer and business process. Operating in a modern business today, by and large, has become a software affair, with the socially connected mobile consumer segment, and therefore enterprises explore ways to service the customer based on their personal preferences and personas.
Following last week's discussion on Synchronizing the Digital Customer and Business, hSenid Mobile explores further how digital business enables the FinTech industry.
What does the customer want This is the question that every business executive asks and the savviest executives are asking more frequently than ever before. Technology has placed an unprecedented hype on customer user experience management. More and more, customers expect the levels of expectation set up by technology leaders such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Uber -and they expect this from even the dormant corners of markets across all industries.
Digital technologies in many ways have created the opposite impact for consumers and businesses. Consumers have been empowered by the use of smartphones, IoT and social media, via digitalization. Companies, on the other hand, have been urged to adopt digital strategy and has become a core cog in overall business strategy with redefined business operations; more sophisticated omni-channel user experience and increasing points of interaction-in-store, online, social media, and mobile apps
One of the greatest challenges in the banking industry today is to understand the technologies that are reshaping and will continue to reshape the future of banking; and understanding strategic investments.
In today's context, technology enables businesses to tackle four key customer demands:
1) Value for money through direct to customer
2) Seamless customer experience
3) Quality products and services
4) Understand customer emotions and personas through advance analytics.
Digital disruption in banking is not only limited to bridging the customer and the bank, it has evolved into many banking functions such as, retail and commercial lending, payments, back-office, remittance and consumer banking.
We have seen a trend where financial institutes are converging with other industries and especially technology to innovative and create distinctive products to meet customer expectations. For example, banks and technology companies have converged to provide seamless payment solutions to its customers.
Banks strive to associate with technology companies either through investment, partnership or acquiring technology companies that invest in technologies to compete with future market dynamics. According to CB Insights, approximately a third of financial technology investments were bank led Venture Capital investments.
With complex and changing macro environment, banks continuously explore ways of using technology to redefine banking and converge with industry- wide partners. In this context, leading banks have identified an unique space, where they open up Banking as a Service (BaaS) to external service creators to co-create innovative financial services using banking infrastructure and banking assets.
In order to successfully integrate with multi dimensional stakeholders, it is vital that banks have an API strategy. Today, APIs have become indispensable and a new dawn for the banking industry is fast approaching, with the advent of the open API economy. Emergence of the open API economy in the banking industry is not simply a short-lived phenomenon.
In today context, API strategy is a must and not an option. Banks should strive to create a fully integrated, unique end-to-end journey for their customers and partners.
The technologies being developed that revolve around API's will have an everlasting impact on the future financial and banking industry, as well as the customer behaviors, thus pushing banks to adopt change or face destruction.

India,Singapore FTAs  will not lead to major  FDI inflows  - IPS
Trade agreements with India and Singapore will not lead to a major turnaround in FDI inflows to Sri Lanka, Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka Deputy Director Dr.Dushni Weerakoon said.
Highlighting economic impacts of the proposed China - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, Dr.Weerakoon noted that the FTA will have a different impact on Sri Lankas economy as under the China-Sri Lanka trade agreement model, state-backed investors follow the government while both governments play a major role in bringing those investors to Sri Lanka.
In the case of India and Singapore agreements, the respective governments will leave it to the private sector to decide whether it is worth to bring FDI into Sri Lankan with potential trade agreements in place.
However it will depend on whether Sri Lanka has a convincing story to tell in terms of its labour pool, talents and infrastructure and so on.
Noting that trade agreements play a vital role in opening up economy and the market penetration for local exporters, she claimed that a large number of agreements dont open up sufficiently to attract foreign direct investments and raise exports.
Weerakoon revealed that Sri Lanka has been very hesitant to sign up to anything over the past several decades.
While the country still has market access to a larger degree, we are not addressing supply constraints on the part of our domestic exporters in order to access those market penetrations, Weerakoon said.
According to her most agreements are only addressing one aspect and much needed reforms are not linked to these trade agreements, as a result those kinds of agreements with certain deregulatory measures are not sufficient to raise the competitiveness and efficiency of export sector.

JOs only motive is to obstruct govts development march: Marikkar
The motive of the Joint Opposition (JO), which has no work, is to obstruct the forward march of the country, Colombo district UNP Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar said.
He added that the Hambantota Industrial Zone will receive foreign investments amounting over Rs. 750 billion within a few months.
The MP said with these investments, the entire country will benefit with thousands getting jobs. The Hambantota harbour and airport cannot be developed as there is no production from the area. But once the industrial zone commences, the entire area including the port and the airport will benefit, he said. Speaking on the protest by the JO against the commencement of the industrial park at the Hambantota port area, he said the protest was launched by the JO with hired persons from various parts of the country. The participation of the Hambantota people at the protest was minimum, Marikkar said.
The JO does not want the people of Hambantota to enjoy benefits. Therefore, they are always trying to block the countrys forward march, he said. Parliamentarian Thushara Indunil said state officers should also think of the burning issues of the people.
Speaking on the recent issue relating to Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka and an AGA, he said Ramanayaka did not intend to hit the officer but was against persons who ruin the environment.
We had a history during the last regime where state officers were physically punished. A politician forced a female teacher to kneel down in her school. A High Commissioner in UK was slapped by a politician of the then government, he said.
The Deraniyagala AGA was assaulted by the then Deraniyagala Pradeshiya Shaba chairman as the AGA refused to offer a permit to transport timber for the chairman. This is how the then political leadership and henchmen behaved, he said.

Johnny Depp money worries blamed on lavish lifestyle

Johnny Depp's financial troubles are caused by his lavish lifestyle, claim the former business managers he is suing for mismanaging his earnings.
They say the star spent more than $75m (59.6m) on 14 homes and needed 12 storage facilities to house his collection of Hollywood memorabilia.
The Management Group are countersuing Depp after the Pirates of the Caribbean actor sued them for $25m (20m).
Depp, they claim, is "fully responsible for any financial turmoil" he faces.
"He has refused to live within his means, despite... repeated warnings about his financial condition," their countersuit claims.
Their legal action,obtained by the Deadline website, also accuses the actor of spending:
$18m (14.3m) on an 150 foot (45 metre) yacht
$4m (3.2m) on a failed record label
$3m (2.4m) to blast Hunter Thompson's ashes out of a cannon
$300K (238,600) a month to maintain a staff of 40 people
$200K (159,000) a month on private planes
$150K (119,330) a month on round-the-clock security
Last month, Depp claimed The Management Group owed him more than $25m.
His lawsuit also alleges the company failed to file him taxes on time, costing him $5.7m (4.5m) in penalties.
Depp's latest legal tussle comes in the wake of hisdivorce to Amber Heard, which was finalised in January after months of wrangling.
The 53-year-old will be seen later this year as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge.

## Title: LankaClear unveils  JustPay  to facilitate  retail payments

LankaClear unveils  JustPay  to facilitate  retail payments
LankaClear unveiled another groundbreaking initiative, JustPay to drive 20% of retail payments via smart mobile devices by 2020.
The JustPay initiative will facilitate retail payments via disruptive technology innovations.
The newest addition to the national payment network, a brainchild of LankaClear, is a facility that is backed by the Central Bank and all the member banks of LankaPay Common Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFTS). It typically aims to facilitate secure real-time retail payments below Rs.10,000 under an extremely low tariff scheme.
Accordingly, it is acknowledged that JustPay will enable customers to make retail payments from their bank account by using smart mobile phones and other smart devices.
This latest innovation will utilise two factor authentication and end to end encryption, according to LankaClear CEO Channa de Silva. He noted that such additional measures will further strengthen the security efforts of banks when enabling mobile payment applications by adhering to Central Bank (CBSL) prescribedbaseline security standard for mobile applications.
De Silva said that due to convenience, highest level of security and the extremely low transaction costs, the newly inaugurated service JustPaywill soon become the de facto payment option for Sri Lanka's retail payments segment.
In order for JustPay to be accepted by the masses, the mobile payment applications must be extremely easyto use, secure and need tosupport local languages. The aim is to make it a huge success by extending the usage to a point where even a farmer or a milkman in the rural most villages would be comfortable in opting for the service, said de Silva.
An analysis of the current status of the country's retail financial transaction volumes indicate that although the option of facilitating a transaction through an electronic platform is available, a good majority of payments are still carried out using cash.
Global statistics reveal that despite the surge in Internet usage, cashless retail transactions account in between 2 to 5 percent of the total transactionvolumes in this region. A total number of 125 million transactions per year happen in Sri Lanka via electronic mode as per CBSL statistics, which essentially means that somewhere between 2.5 to 6 billion retail transactions arestill carried out using cash.
Even if we assume that only 95% of the transactions are being carried out using cash, de Silva stressed it is imperative to create a shift in the near future if the economy is to reap benefits by reducing money in circulation since some of the cash even remains completely outside the banking system stored in vaults and other safe locations.
This shift would not only benefit the banks by increasing theirrevenue by Rs. 6 to 10 billion through transaction fees and interest, but also help to pull-in the masses to adopt electronic payment modes. The ultimate aim is to get a majority of the public involved in the development process, said de Silva.
Studies have shown that the printing and distribution of cash cost a nation nearly 1.5 percent of its GDP. While this is the estimated worldwide average, the percentage is expected to be notably higher for developing economies such as Sri Lanka.
If we can attract at least 20 percent of these cash-based payments into electronic mode, this alone will drive a huge surplus in electronic transaction volumes. It potentially could save the country a significant amount of money since the usage of cash would be reduced, which would result in savings via less cash handling. The second objective to be fulfilled is the possibility of cash currently sitting in someone's cash box or a vault coming back into the banking network. That could potentially create a huge advantage to the economy reiterated the chief.
The solution
As a solution to fast track the country towards reducing the usage of cash, LankaClear sought after to identify a futuristic instrument that would drive the initiative forward.
With Sri Lanka standing out in the region for its high mobile phone penetration rate, and increasing usage of smartphones, the company recognised that the ideal delivery channel of choice would be the smart devices.
After much deliberation, we felt that the smart devices would be the preferred instrument for this initiative.
As it is, there are over 4 million smartphones and a significant number of other smart devices used in the country, thus we were convinced that this is the most appropriate channel in enabling banks to accommodate the general public to make electronic payments even at their grocery store, de Silva expressed.
The infrastructure required to drive this initiative forward is to enable the payment of a customer to be made to a merchant. If a customer can make a payment through a smart phone and the funds gets transferred from his bank account to the merchant's bank account in real time, then one doesn't need to exchange or even have cash in his wallet he added.
Currently banks charge Rs. 50 per transaction to make a realtime payment to another bank, immaterial of the value. However, when we are looking at the retail space a transaction fee of Rs. 50 would be unacceptable to a common user especially for low value retail payments.
In an effort to encourage the usage of the facility, LankaClear and the respected banks have agreed on a low transaction tariff structure for paymentsup toRs. 10,000 where the transaction fee would be extremely insignificant such as a fee of Rs. 1 for a payment up to Rs. 1000. In time to come, we are anticipating either some banks or the merchants might opt to absorb this fee and provide the service free of charge to the customer.
Challenges to overcome
While the servicesto general public would be delivered via a smart apps, the most successful apps would belong to the acquiring banks that sign up the most number of merchants, which will give customers enough options to make payments. The primary issue addressed by this concept, which was designed by the banks together with LankaClear, is the scale of adoption where both customer and merchant account doesn't require to be in the same bank.
If the customer and the merchant are in the same bank then there is no scale for growth. As we are trying to reach 20 percent cashless transactions by 2020, the other problematic issue is in the area of adoption, said de Silva.
He stressed that the ICT industry in partnership with banks have been encouraged to come up with extremely convenient apps that addresses different needs of consumers and facilitate a one click payment option.
"The biggest challenge is in gaining the confidence and trust of the public to use Smart devices towards making payments".

Light carrier
The title of the book by young Piyadeep Kaur, a Punjabi Speaking Sikh near adolescent, has many meanings I guess.
She sees Millions of Faces in a Face. Does it mean attributes of several deities in only ONE God in the Hindu Pantheon The reason for this assumption is she shows a bias for spirituality, though it is not obvious. Or, she sees millions of faces in her home city Banaras that all belong to one humankind. Or, it maybe she sees the faces of her two male friends as belonging to one species.
In her acknowledgements, Priyadeep Kaur concludes with this line: Lastly, the light inside all of us, Shiva. Om ShanthiHer book is immensely popular with her readers, particularly the younger generation, judging by the fact that last year it has two imprints. The 256 page book is published by Mahaveer Publishers, 4675A-21, Second Floor, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi-11002 and priced at 175 Indian Rupees. This is her maiden book. Recently she had presented her book to the Indian Prime Minister Modi and received his blessings too.
I met this young personality in Udaipur in Rajasthan at a Literary Festival, where she gave this book to me. She is a Commerce graduate, a musician on stage, and a teacher to kids in villages. As the blurb says, Apart from creativity, spirituality, meditation, love, and virtues are what she dies for.
This novel is both erratic and erotic in some places. It is erratic because the structure of the novel is done in a haphazard manner that a conventional reader might get confused. Although the main female character, Dimple Ahluwalia, remains chaste and shocked in seeing Mangesh, a Marathi speaking lover half-naked, she and he engage in frank and erotic dialogues. The novel is dramatic and in most places the story is narrated in the form of dialogue.The novel begins with her 5th standard class mate, Sumit Sharma and Dimple admits she had a crush on him. Later she encounters her undeclared love affair with Mangesh. While the latter lets her down, Sumit appeases her. The end is inconclusive to my mind.Speaking of the languages used, one reads little passages in Hindi, Marathi, and other languages. But the novel is in English.The writers use of English brings to the realization of the fact that there is a variety of Englishs we know. This novel is a good example for academics to dissect the regional accents and nuances found in contemporary usage of English in India. The characters in the novel are all affluent people behaving like any other young people in the world.To me it is a fascinating short novel to understand the mindset of young people. Irrespective of the grammatical errors and the employment of slangs, the novel is a study case for psychiatrists.
I congratulate Praiyadeep Kaur for her imaginative novel that underscores the idea of love.

Mayor confident LA 2024 bid to be judged on merits
Los Angeles: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday he is confident the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic bid will be evaluated on its merits even in the wake of US President Donald Trump's new immigration ban.
A temporary ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations was imposed Friday by an executive order from Trump, sparking protests around the world.
There has been concern about what impact that might have on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its September 13 vote in Lima, Peru, to decide a 2024 host between Paris, Budapest and Los Angeles.
"LA 2024 has assembled an outstanding, responsible bid on behalf of our city that strengthens the Olympic movement for the future," Garcetti said in a statement.
Concerns over the state of American values and the United States' ability to bring nations together has become a haunting issue in the wake of the travel ban but one Garcetti did not touch upon.
"If selected, we will show the world a sustainable and low-risk Games that gathers nations together, showcases American values, and brings benefits, not burdens, to our community.
"I am confident that the IOC will evaluate our bid on these merits, and I am more committed than ever to bringing the Games back to LA in 2024."
Trump would be in office in 2024 if he were re-elected in 2020. AFP

Minister calls for immediate investigation, relief
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne had instructed Labour Commissioner General Chandani Amaratunga to investigate into the recent death of a miner inside the Bogala Graphite Mine and to take all necessary action.
Amaratunga said she had sent the Avissawella Assistant Labour Commissioner General to the mine as soon as the incident had occurred. The management had explained to the Assistant Commissioner General the measures they would take, she said.

Most difficult part in legalising SAITM achieved during my term: S.B.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake yesterday said the most difficult part of legalising the SAITM was done during his term as the Higher Education Minister.
The minister said his decision to publish the gazette recognising the SAITM as a degree awarding institute was a difficult but correct decision.
All the deans of medical faculties and the University Grants Commission had given their consent for this gazette. I went ahead with this move because I was aware of the difficulties and large sums of money our students spent to obtain medical degrees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Russia among other countries, he said.
The minister was addressing a press conference at his ministry. While congratulating SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando, the minister said the Sri Lanka Medical Council had no right to deny registering the SAITM medical degree holders.
He said 55 percent of those who gain admission to the state universities for medicine were selected on district quota while another 5 percent get admission because of the quota system given for underprivileged districts. Only the rest, 40 percent, gain admission on the marks they score.
Therefore, some students who had obtained three A passes failed to get admission, while some with three S passes could get admission from areas like Killinochchi and Mannar, he said.
About 450,000 students learn at international schools now. They cannot enter state universities. Private universities must be there for these children to have higher education, he added.
He said the SAITM is ahead in quality wise compared to the Jaffna and Batticaloa medical faculties.

NCE launches 25th anniversary Annual Export Awards
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) launched the revised application of the 25th Anniversary Annual Export Awards Ceremony, which will be held on September 29 at the Grand Ball Room of the Hilton Colombo.
The NCE President elect Ramal Jasinghe in his address at the AGM stated that he will provide leadership to the Annual Export Awards, particularly as the forth coming event marks 25 years of an unbroken, consistent, and yet a dynamic awards scheme which is probably unique in the country.
Shiham Marikar the Secretary General of the NCE said the NCE Awards recognise and reward achievements of Sri Lankan exporters in International Markets, is the most looked forward to event in the Sri Lankan Business Calendar.
He added that since its inception in 1996 this Annual event has been conducted without a break, and had seen an increase in the number of applications received from exporters each year to be an Award winner. He said the Application Form of the awards scheme itself has become a living document, since an export enterprise which applies for an award has to fulfill many requirements related to its operations, which gives the opportunity to improve weak areas of the enterprise to conform to international standards.
Further, winners of export awards benefit not only by being considered as the best performing successful exporters, but also by differentiating themselves from others, giving them an advantage when competing in the International market place.
The Chamber will be celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the event and one of the main innovative aspects that has been introduced to the scheme this year is the Outreach Program to recognize the achievements of provincial enterprises in the field of exports, especially in the SME category, who may or may not be direct exporters, but Service Providers to Exporters by being part of the Export Value Chain.
He added that provincial participants will receive special awards to motivate them, and that the Chamber will work with the Regional Chambers of Industry and Commerce to achieve this objective. He welcomed representative of Regional Chambers who were present on invitation to symbolically receive the application for distribution to their respective members. In this regard their assistance was sought to identify their member companies who could apply and compete for anaward.
WaruniAmunugama, Joint Director and Creative Head of Triad spoke passionately regarding the role Women Entrepreneurs should play to uplift the economy of the country. She stated that Women Entrepreneurs, especially those who have built their enterprises painstakingly from small beginnings should not hesitate to come forward to showcase their achievements, and especially their brands, to be recognized and rewarded. In this context she emphasized the value of benchmarking their enterprises, and competing for export awards to savour their own successes and also to inspire others to follow suit.
She cited the example of Ramya Weerakoon current Vice President of the NCE, as a shining example of a person who built her enterprise from scratch to what it is today, diversifying into other areas such as horticulture, from the garments sector.
She also cited the example of Lakmini Wijesundera who built her enterprise in the field of Information Technology which is a man's field and who was recognized as the Woman Entrepreneur of the year by the Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industry last year and also as the most outstanding Woman Exporter at the Annual Export Awards of the NCE last year.

According to Dr.Herath, the new species of mosquito, Anopheles Stephens discovered in wells at Pesalai, Thalaimannar is harder to eradicate than the ordinary Malaria mosquitoes. The mosquito larvae was found during a routine mosquito eradication programme.

Nile is the worlds largest river and throughout the Nile river alluvial deposits The success of the Egyptain kingdom could be attributed for the administrative resources special agricultural produce and labour. Gods compelled the rulers to behave like Gods.
There was a staunch belief prevailed in the Egypt kingdom under the Pharos that the kings were compelled emulate serene, orderly, merciful and perfect. In Egypt no individual had possessed private property. Ancient Egypt Civilization was civilization located in the lower reaches of the Nile river. In 3150 the first Pharo Narmer (menes) unified upper and lower Egypt. Narmer was the founder of Memphis near modern Cairo.
Pyramid fields of Caza are found in the western side of the modern -day Cairo. Of Khufe. In the Old Kingdom , the Pharos built their eternal resting places surrounded by the smaller pyramids.

During the rule of Akhenzton, his wife Neferttiti played and indispensable political and religious role in the monotheistic cult of the Sun.

PMs clarion call
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again emphasized on the need for the continuation of the UNP-SLFP unity government, if the economy is to move forward. Speaking at a public function in Bandaragama, the Premier said it is essential for the UNP and SLFP to stay together so that there will be a powerful government to see the economy through.
A united front, no doubt, can overcome any obstacles, and what is more, is a sign of stability so important to inspire investor confidence. It is political acrimony down the years that has stifled development and undermined progress. It has been Sri Lanka's experience that the Opposition had always opposed ambitious government's programmes merely for the sake of opposing. Had J.R Jayewardene not had the steamroller majority he commanded it is doubtful if development programmes such as the Mahaweli would have got off the ground. Now, with the Unity Government enjoying a two thirds majority in parliament it is hoped that development projects in the pipeline would be pursued with unhindered. It is because both the UNP and SLFP collectively stood its ground that the Hambantota port project was flagged off despite opposition. Hence, the Premier's emphasis for a continuation of the present arrangement between the two parties.
In the past there were a few occasions where the two major parties could have coalesced for the well being of the country. But these opportunities were squandered due to partisan politics. One recalls Opposition Leader J.R. Jayewardene during the 1970-77 unity government extending his support to the Sirimavo Bandaranaike administration. But the Left leaders in that alliance, due to their prejudice against JR, would have none of it. More recently, there was the ideal opportunity presented by the Tsunami catastrophe for both parties to unite during a national tragedy. But, like before, those who should have known better let slip this golden opportunity too for selfish political reasons. Even the three decades long terrorist war failed to bring the parties together due to the failure of political party leaders to act as statesmen. As a result the country had to suffer dire consequences by way of retarded growth and economic decline.
Hence, the Premier's view that both parties should join forces to lift the country from its present morass should be heeded by all. It is time for all political leaders, at least now, to act with maturity and foresight setting aside all selfish motives and parochial considerations. Hitherto, it was the practise that with every change of government the incoming regime dispensed with all the development programmes undertaken by its predecessor. The vicious cycle continued, with the end result that the country was bogged down without moving ahead. The contentious and divisive nature of the politics, practiced, was the sole reason for this.
The status quo is bound to continue far into the future if at some point this retrograde politics is not called to a halt. The country can no longer afford the luxury of divisive party politics, with the economy burdened as it is by a mountainous debt. There should be a collective effort to resurrect the country from the depths it had fallen into socially, culturally and economically. The country's future cannot be surrendered at the altar of vituperative, contentious party politics. This is the long and short of the Premier's appeal, which is more or less a clarion call for unity.
The SLFP need not have any misgivings in working with the UNP. It has today many things in common with the Greens. The differences between the parties on economic policy no longer exist. The SLFP has already shed its inward looking, indigenous economic concepts and embraced the UNP's market economy. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga of course should be credited for this transformation in the SLFP thinking. Both parties are also on the same wavelength even on the ethnic issue, another laurel that should go to CBK.
Investors, hitherto, had misgivings, coming to Sri Lanka, due to policy changes with the change of governments. Investors fear that their ventures would be nationalised with the arrival of socialist governments. Many had this bitter experience during the 70-77 period which saw the flight of foreign investments from the country. On the other hand, an inclusive government would not create such doubts in the minds of investors.
President Sirisena, like the Premier, does not lose an opportunity to emphasize the need for the continuation of the present arrangement for the benefit of all. Although the UNP is in the driving seat, by virtue of its majority in parliament, the SLFP need not feel inferior or have misgivings in cooperating with the Grand Old Party. In fact some vociferous SLFPers in government have shown their independence by expressing their views openly at what they see as infringements by their senior coalition partner. However they should desist in creating fissures in the alliance that would be exploited by the MR faction of the SLFP, giving it an opportunity to undermine the cohabitation arrangement.

Independence Day
Sri Lanka celebrates her independence Once again with added vigour And enthusiasm Why Because all Sri Lankans were free To be on par with the imperialists And other foreign rulers Now we are enjoying the full political freedom From foreign domination But are we enjoying full economic freedom Not all- We still depend on the foreign powers For our essential food items Like rice which is our staple food Our rice production is so low and insufficient To meet our needs We still depend on western system of education Without adopting our own national system Based on our own religions and cultures Then how can we celebrate full independence In this condition of our reliance upon others traditions We have added alien educational curriculum To our private degrees and diplomas At the cost of lakhs of dollars and pounds Depending on foreign employments Without any option for local vocations And without contributing or shares To local production for self sufficiency In economy. So let citizens of Sri Lanka be determined To free themselves from economic dependence In the future when we celebrate the next national Independence Day.

Poetry is joy forever
I am no pundit on poetry. To me, poetry is a beautiful collection of words. Kavi or Kaudihai gives relaxation, enlightenment and absolute peace of mind. It also helps in meditation poetry comes in many a name and could take us down memory lane to bring before our minds eye, events sad, happy sad, happy, enlightening, historical and soothing.
A poem could be called a story. It could consist of just two lines or many. They give us absolute joy when reading them, Ba ba black sheep have you any wool or Maa Veni Blinda are immortal lines we have learnt when we began our sojourn into the gesture. All countries on this planet have nursery rhymes composed with beautiful words and rhymes, in their respective languages.
Holy scriptures have been written in verse. The Vedhas, Dharamada, The Bible, the Quaran, Mannimaidhai, Mahabatatha and our own Mahawense have poetry in their manuscripts. The great epics were in verse. Homers Illiyad, 'Odessy', 'Ramayana' with our own Ravena and Bharath Rama as the main personalities kept the world enthralled. Sitha as the heroine.
Actually a poem makes a long story short without changing the gist. A poem is a listenable, loving, lilting, literary legend ancient architectural engraving have shown us that poetry was with our ancestors writings on papyrus had astrological predictions incstibad. Remedies for ailments, symptoms of ailments had been painstakingly written oriole- leaves by our Vedamahatmayas of yester year. All in poetry with its rhyming alliterations and metre.
Poetry to me, is lovely imagination. Treie, it is books that are the ladders that take us from in fancy to the very apex of learning. Poetry does the same in a more dramatic form. Prophet Homammeds words seek knowledge from cradle to grave' are for all time, Poetry makes us to seek this knowledge mart reverently. Poetry, brings to us what thoughts of the poet.
The verses in our old books the 'sivwpada' 'Malay maley aya naa mala kada vereng aththa bindai paya buruleng thaba vereng or the tear jerking badagini vela maa giya kala puthu geta puththe kiri dunnay mama numbata
The sagatious poet has his reasoner is writing this verses. It happens even now. It was just a handful of rice then. Today, fiew mothers have to bag for a handful or rice from those going to places of worship while seated on the pavement. Again koppemana gune kelath, dudhano novethi yahapath reminds us of Shakespeare' 'blow blow thou wintry wind, thou art not so unkind as mans ingratitude. These sayings are for all time.
Beauty is a vital component in poetry. Keat says thing of beauty is a joy forever. May I delve into this thing called 'beauty' ever so present in the English language.
Many are so very prophetic and thought provoking.
Tennysens for men may come and men may go, but I go on forever says the brook Tennyson little realised the men who come and go have done to our sweet Brooks Shakespeare incorporated a few lines in Julius Caesar that make readers to siglr spirit of caesar be still I killed not thee with half so good a will. Then again Gilded tombs do worms enfold, havent you heard that off be told. How true Dilsend siyalla ran noway. His seven stages of men are for all time the bards plays always ended with two lines that rhymed. There never was a tole of such woe. Than that of Juliot and her Romeo. Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink says the ancient Mariner in Coleridge. Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner frightening lines that could very soon be a reality to humans animals and blants. Gossiping end slander by women is made into just one line by Alexander Pope with every word a reputation falls. Beautiful lines in Ulysses to strive to seek to and not to yield. Howe money of us strived to seek and find but have had to yield due to politics and threats.
Shelly's sweet lines 'If winter comes, can spring be for behind' They are lines that give us hope, faith and the ups end downs in life's journey. Yes at times a cry of pain is the precursor or do a cry of joy to a lovely mother on seeing a new born. D.H. Lawrence who shook the literary world with lady's chatters lover, goes into the very depths of ones conscience in his poem 'The snake' when his 'education' tells him to kill the venomous snake, but his heart tells him not to. He bows to his heart. Both leave the well quenching their first after the 2004 tsumani.
On 24 December the muddy, murky, meandering, merciless murderous mermaids mansions manoeuvres made man to ponder, As to why this salubrious, soothing, saumiya, sea shell scattered sustinence showering, sunrise splashing serenading sea threw all on its way literally asunder.
The above liens are full of emotion. All in rhyme, alliteration and metre.
Of all these lines of wisdom. I think that the words of Thomas Grey in his elegy are gems Full many a gem is buried beneath the its lustre unseen. Full many a flower is blooms in the desert air unseen yes chill penury make some of our brightest humeri germs to whither away in the remote areas. However our blessed gem of an isle can be proud of a bevy of bright rural gems to glitter with the greats of the world.
Again a poignant thought of Gray, it is every mortals wish that there be someone to shed a tear by his bier, be the former person be a pavement dweller of a king.

Prime Ministers Independence Day message

Only a path that unites all, can pave the way for a stronger Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his message for Independence Day.
Only a path that unites all, can pave the way for a stronger Sri Lanka; a path that calls for what each of us can give of ourselves to our nation, to our common future and to a better tomorrow, the statement read.
As Sri Lanka celebrates the 69th Independence Day, I believe that we are also celebrating the 02nd anniversary of the election of Good Governance Government.
In order to make the spirit of freedom more meaningful to us all, the Government must take steps that reaffirm the liberties of the people with regard to their economic, social and spiritual well being.
During the last two years, we have been able to achieve many steps in the right direction; restore democratic values, rebuild relationships with friendly nations and affirm mutual trust...' '...while focusing on revitalizing the economy towards laying the foundation for a nation that has overcome various differences and is firmly anchored on principles of freedom and human values.
Only a path that unites all can pave the way for a stronger Sri Lanka, a path that calls for what each of us can give of ourselves to our nation, to our common future and to a better tomorrow.
May we as Sri Lankans possess the courage and the determination to choose that path this Independence Day, the Prime Minister said.

As a regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council is set to meet in Geneva in March, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Monday urged the Indian government to sponsor a resolution at the council that would ensure that there is an international investigation led by international judges into the alleged war crimes in the final stages of the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009.
He said that VCK, SDPI, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi, Tamil nationalist parties and Periyarite groups will soon protest outside Central government offices to urge the Indian government in this regard.
MDMK leader Vaiko demanded that a plebiscite be conducted in the Northern and Eastern regions of Sri Lanka, where Tamils are in a majority.
In an e-mail to the United Nations general secretary and the UNHRCs Commissioner, I have explained the history of the conflict and underscored how Sri Lankan Tamils have been subjected to injustice. In my statement, I have also presented evidence for the war crimes committed by Sri Lankan armed forces in the final stages of the war, said Vaiko.

PUCSL issues guidelines
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator issued guidelines to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company private limited (LECO) to pay an interest on security deposit of electricity consumers which CEB and LECO receive when providing an electricity connection.
Electricity consumers are entitled to receive a payment for the security deposits under Section 28 of the Electricity Act No.20 of 2009, where it describes the Distribution Licensee (CEB or LECO) to pay interest on such a sum at the rate approved by the PUCSL for the period in which security deposit remains in the hands of the licensee.
The interest payment on security deposit of the retail consumers (A tariff customer in any tariff category whose maximum contract demand is less than 42 kilo-volt-ampere), will be calculated yearly basis and credited to the consumers electricity bill in January of the following year.
Interest payment for the bulk supply consumer (A Tariff Customer in any tariffs category whose maximum contract demand is more than 42 kilo-volt-ampere), will be calculated monthly and will be credited to the electricity bill on a monthly basis.
In a termination of an electricity connection, PUCSL asked CEB and LECO to pay the interest up to the date of termination, together with the security deposit within a month from the date of termination, after deducting all dues to the licensee with respect to the billing account.
PUCSL has approved an annual interest rate of 8.93 percent for the security deposits (a monthly interest rate of 0.715 percent) for 2017 from January 1. The interest rate is based on the average weighted fixed deposit rates (AWFDR) published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. PUCSL will announce the interest rate applicable for the respective year in January each year.
Consumers can make complaints to the licensees (CEB or LECO) when they encounter any issues related to obtaining interest. If a customer is not satisfied with the solution given by the licensees, such disputes related to interest payment may be submitted to the PUCSL for mediation. PUCSL stressed that the non-payment of interest on security deposit would result as committing an offence under the provision the Electricity Act.

Punya Heendeniyas journeys
In 1957, a group of people climbed Sri Pada with cameras, lighting equipment, and strange costumes. They climbed all the way to Maha Giri Dambe and began shooting a sequence featuring a song by H. R. Jothipala. The film, an adaptation of a W. A. Silva novel, was a first since the cinema had not "touched" the Holy Peak before.
Now we dont know how the crew felt about the trek, but we do know that they ended up shooting that sequence 16 times, on account of the actors inability to articulate the song. This is not an article about that song or that actor, but about a simple village girl who found herself acting opposite all that for the first time in front of a camera.
I first saw Punya Heendeniya (as most of us did) in Lester James Peries Gamperaliya. I hadnt read Martin Wickramasinghes novel but knew the story (the kind that makes its way to our collective subconscious) and knew the characters well enough to understand the way they reacted to their surroundings. Punya played Nanda, whose character in my opinion was to not have a character. Before we get to that landmark performance that has never ceased to fascinate me, though, there are other stories to relate about the actress behind the role. Punya left the cinema, but because the cinema never left her, I fervently believe those stories should be recounted in their entirety.
She was born Heendeniya Vidanaralalage Punya Heendeniya in the village of Meerigama. From an early age, she was not overtly enamoured of the performing arts, at least not until she came under the influence of her dancing teacher, Panibharathi. According to Punya, he got her interested in the only two art-forms she dabbled in as a girl, dancing and ballet. I ask her as to whether she loved to act or sing, and she categorically denies it: I didnt act in any play at Meerigama College. Not one single play.
She had studied in the English medium and had therefore opened herself to the best of both Eastern and Western literature. It was during this time that Panibharathi called her to act in two dance sequences in Sirisena Wimalaweeras Asoka (1953), which wasnt really acting, just a couple of ballets.
Her first encounter with the cinema had intrigued her, however: I found it rather strange to reveal my character in front of an impersonal camera. This had been supplemented by her encounters with the Minerva Players, which through a series of theatrical films gave us the foundation on which our cinema would thrive. Of course, the Minerva Players were overblown in their acting. After watching them I realised that to break out and to make my characters alive, I should improvise my own style and method.
Her second encounter with the medium was more riveting. Apparently a cousin brother of hers was a lawyer and knew S. D. S. Somaratne. Somaratne was adapting W. A. Silvas Deiyange Rate, the kind of book that filmmakers, in their quest to turn our nationalist streak into box office dividends, opted for back then. He had wanted a girl to play the role of Catherine, and had asked Punyas cousin (Siri Aiya) to let him know about anyone who could fit the bill.
Needless to say, Siri Aiya mooted my name, and the two of them tentatively approached my father to ask whether they could have me. In the end he complied, and I was whisked away to the producer, L. S. Ramachandrans office in Hulftsdorp. Ramachandran had asked her to recite a few lines from the novel (which she had read in school), and with all the expressions, gestures, and nuances of emotion she could muster, put her heart and soul into the recitation. Not surprisingly, she was chosen then and there. She had just completed her O Levels.
Her career, like the film, literally began at the top of the Holy Peak. The song I mentioned at the beginning was Seetha Sunil Diya Dahara (one of P. L. A. Somapalas more memorable tunes), the song which practically forced the crew to climb up and down Maha Giri Dambe.
I was paired with Senadeera Kuruppu and Edward Senaratne. Edward was chosen to perform for the song. He was a teacher who taught at Ananda, but despite that he had trouble articulating his lines. That is why we ended up climbing the final, arduous few steps to the Peak again and again. Was it troublesome No, not at all! In fact my career began atop Sri Pada. During her stay at the top floor of a high-rise Colombo 7 apartment, moreover, she wakes up every morning to a faint silhouette of the Holy Peak in the distance: That's how I start my days here, she tells me, adding rather lightly that it has become a good omen for her.
After the excessive theatrics of Deiyange Rate, Punya found herself acting alongside D. R. Nanayakkara and Dayananda Gunawardena in Kurulubedda, often ranked alongside Rekava as the first native film made here. It was in Kurulubedda and Sikuru Tharuwa that I realised how radically different our actors were. They were emulating the stage, basically. I discovered that to become a realistic performer, you must live and breathe your character. That proved vital when Lester James Peries, after seeing me in Kurulubedda, approached a mutual contact and got me in as Nanda for Gamperaliya.
The making of Gamperaliya would probably fill an entire book, and Punya (one of only four people from the cast and crew who are alive today) attests to that at once. Back then, directing and acting in a film was different. Time didnt fly, it flowed gracefully. We didnt feel the hours passing by, we just came and acted and went on with our lives. What I personally value about my role as Nanda wasnt the fame or praise I got, but the fact that I was tutored under Dr Peries.
I ask her at this point as to how it was working under him, and she brightens up at once: Working with him is like living in a different world. He is a veritable reservoir of knowledge, and more importantly, he goes out of his way to help us understand the cinema. Punya is not the first person whos collaborated with him who tells me this, I note down as we move on with the interview.
Lester had been so enamoured of Punyas performance that he and P. K. D. Seneviratne, who saw her as the epitome of rustic innocence, selected her for his next film, Ran Salu. As Sujatha, Punya stood out in the most subtle performance in the film (in stark contrast to the histrionics spouted by the other characters), and she puts to me that she never wanted to work for another director after acting in it.

Pyre awaits
White sand is sprinkled along the path leading to the resting ground. Bare bodied few men, their sun burnt dark skin glistening with the perspiration are busily covering the home with thin white sheets, the edges being smoothly done with graceful patterns. From the distance, the drumming is faintly heard. Slowly it increases as it approaches the resting ground. Men and women clad in white are walking slowly as if in a procession, carrying a box of memories, rotting and cold.
Once there was life, sunshine and smiles, but no more, except a loneliness like the emptiness of a cloudless sky. Once it was a body, so carefully toned, moisturized, trimmed and well taken care of, but no more, except a coldness like an icy piece of refrigerated meat.
Soon there would be a lit torch. Soon there would be flames, overpowering the wind, diminishing the home of thin white sheets, along with its intricate patterns. The box of memories would soon be perished to ashes.

Revealing the rebel
In many ways, the book titled as Problematic Rebel by Maurice Friedman is enlightening. The image of modern man that grows out of this book is, above all, a produce of the meeting of philosophy of literature and literature. Friedman had been engaged in the teaching profession and at the university level. He had been teaching on the areas of research into the image of man in modern thought initially at Lawrence College and The Rebel and the Exile in Literature at the New School for Social Research and the Image Man and Psychotherapy at the Washington School of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology.
A reader who has read the works of such creative writers as Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka and Albert Camus may find the compilation of literary and social interpretations quite though-provoking and penetrative. Perhaps the attempt on the part of Friedman could be regarded as a new innovative direction in the understanding of the human experience as embedded in modern creative expression.
The four writers come from four types and four cultural diversions.
The image of man as a rebel seems a serious concept, where the image refers to not purely the human existence, but an unseen struggle both physically and spiritually. Friedmans is not a pure literary approach, concerned with tradition-bound literature as a goal in itself. But neither does he use literature as a mere illustration of readymade philosophical concepts and categories. Instead, an attempt has been made to interpret literature to discover what new understanding of man the literature he specifies gives us.
Thus, from a synoptic point of view it guards the wholeness of many types of fiction, drama, and poetry as most modern schools of literary theory do not. Friedman in his interpretation of the term and concept problematic raises several issues as a pioneer. As a starting point, he takes the Biblical Rebel and the Greek Rebel and tries to trace the lineage of terms such as average man, super man, insider, outsider, conformist and several others known widely and some rarely by schools of learning.
According to Friedman, the Hebrew Bible beings, if not with an act of rebellion, at least with an act of disobedience, that act whereby man became man. In eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Furthermore he states:
Adam and Even did not commit evil, since they did not know what evil was, but they disobeyed the injunction which protected them against this knowledge and through this disobedience left their existence as children within the Garden of Eden for the confusion and responsibility of the adult world.
The reader is made to feel that initially Adam and Even had been innocents who turned to be rebels, who moved into experience, from timelessness into history. The researcher Friedman, boldly states that Adam and Eve though banished from paradise, this first exile does not mean that they were abandoned by the god who remains with them in history as in the garden.
Followed by the literary concept about the Rebel, he goes to works like Paradise Lost. Quite a number of examples from various creative sources spring up as background laid to interpret the works of the main creators in the subject. Moving on to the other category drawn from the Greek sources, he takes an example of Sophocles hero Oedipus who too is a rebel.
The example of the age-old Prometheus is treated as the development of the modern man in his struggle to exist. Then comes the interpretation into Doctor Faustus and Faust where an age old legend is selected as a stepping stone in the analysis of the mind of the modern man. Selecting Melville is interpreted and the work Moby Dick includes both explicitly and implicitly the Greek, Biblical and Renaissance images of man, similar in nature to Prometheus, Job in the Bible, and Doctor Faust in both the German and English versions. According to interpreter Friedman, Melvilles work Moby Dick is a metaphysical novel. It is in the problem of point of view that the metaphysical dimension of Moby Dick is found. This is not the mere picture of what reality is but mans relation to that reality.
Friedman tries to interpret Captain Ahab, the hero of Melvilles Moby Dick as a godly ungodlike man. Like every hero, he says he is a mixture of that divine and demonic. In part three of the work, Friedman devotes space for the interpretation of several novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky. They include novels such as Notes from the Underground, The Devil, Brothers Karamazov and Crime and Punishment.
The alienation of modern man triggers off as an image in most works Dostoevsky. He brings both his exiles and his rebels to the dead end of isolation and inauthentic existence.
This is related and specified as the alienation of the modern man. Wherever the man goes he is bound by chains, exclaims Karl Marx. Followed by the interpretations of Dostoevsky comes Franz Kafka. In this, author Friedman says that in every line of Kafka has written whether is finished stories, unfinished novels, diary notes; the central problem is the image of the man torn between the reality and the fantasy. A lengthy analysis follows in the interpretation of the selection of fantasy as a creative expression in order to perceive the rebellious nature in reality.
In conclusion, Friedman tries to pave the way for a new dimension of literary analysis where the man is shown not as a mere living being instead a rebel of a type, perhaps seen partly or unseen completely. Dr Maurice Friedmans work comes to the literary scene as an innovative source book published as Phoenix book published by the University of Chicago Press.

For serene souls
Dr Nuwan Nayanajit Kumara is an individual with a wealth of acquired and innate wisdom. Writing and singing talents he inherited through his bloodline. Nuwan started writing his first book in 1999 when he was a lad. He learnt martial arts at a young age hoping to become an actor. Yet he otherwise fancied writing a huge book on cinema legend Dr Gamini Fonseka.
On identifying his greatest prowess, he positioned himself as an insightful writer and a scholar prior to maturing in age. He dedicates himself to develop a criticism methodology based on Buddhist philosophy. With this viewpoint he cuts an edge among other critics.
Dr Nayanajit made public his 12th book titled, Othapuwan Nuwana aka Wisdom of the Person who Fears Sin at the National library and Documentations Services Board on January 20. It was an evening that kindled wisdom of many.
The book has a compilation of movie critiques and articles on artistes appeared in newspapers, magazines written by Dr Nayanajit plus a cross-section of lectures he has delivered over the years on literature and varied subjects.
In his book Dr Nayanajit urges, a critic with an understanding towards Buddhist philosophy could do great justice to his criticism on literary or artistic works including cinema. This methodology that would be unique to Sri Lankans could go global due to its credible nature.
Wilhelm Geiger who translated Mahawamsa into English has used the word, Serene Joy.
Works of a critic based on Buddhist philosophy bequeath Serene Joy within the critic himself and the reader. Aesthetic detachment from the subject or the work of Art would enable the critic to do justice to his job. Only Buddhist philosophy paves way for this. One can indulge in unbiased criticism this way. Aristotle brought pity and terror to fore in his masterpieces. This gesture somewhat falls in line with Serene Joy, opines Dr Nayanajit in his book.
Dr Nayanajit stresses in his book, artistes should have a Sin fearing wisdom.
He says persons guised as critics who aim to tarnish works of Art with ulterior motives ruin themselves as well as sensibility prevailing in a just society.
Any individual has the right to enjoy an Artistic creation; however no one has right to call himself a critic if he doesnt know his onions. So-called critics who work with the intent of wooing someone or tarnishing someones image are societal parasites, he says.
Any world renowned piece of Art enables to project the creators identity as well as the identity of the nation. Leo Tolstoys Novels and the Russian society let alone Ingmar Bergmans cinema and Sweden society are credible examples. Yet core of their works have a universal appeal.
Dr Nayanajit insists an artiste must identify his best talent and stick to it. (In the subject of marketing, this is called Positioning) Intuition helps an artiste to identify his best area of prowess and one without intuition will let his talents go haywire.
A critic should have a birds eye-view, He should be able to glide on sky like an eagle balancing his wings and scan his subject well with a telescopic vision says Dr Nayanajit.
Core attribute of any form of Art is Communication thus a journalist automatically becomes an artiste. Journalists can benefit immensely from Buddhist philosophy.
The book launch was graced by prominent personalities in the sphere, Karunaratne Amarasinghe, Dileepa Abeysekera, Mahinda Prasad Massimbula and Dr Nayanajits soul mate Ashen Manjula.
Insightful speeches by them made the evening a memorable one.
Dileepa Abeysekera talked on innovative creations and said To indulge in innovation a writer should posses a wealth of knowledge. Dr Nuwan Nayanajit is an innovative creator.
Echoing Nuwans disclosure he said Lord Buddha had made emphasis on the subject of Communication thus writers and critics with wisdom could explore the core of Lord Buddhas words. He said the society should not have a wrong perception towards a criticism method based on Buddhist philosophy as a fraction of Jathaka stories or something that is opposed to free thinking ideology prevail in the western world.
Othapuwan Nuwana (Wisdom of the Person who Fears Sin) is published by Nugegoda Sarasavi Publishers, a publishing company dedicated to give readers nothing but the best.

SLs ability to benefit from Madrid Protocol hobbled  by local delays
Sri Lankas ability to benefit from the Madrid Protocol is hobbled by the delays in local trademark registration,Verite Research said.
Despite the significant growth in resident trademark applications during the last decade, the number of trademarks registered a year have stagnated, Verite Research Executive Director Nishan de Mel said in Colombo yesterday.
Sri Lankan businesses go through a lengthy and costly process to register their trademarks abroad. As a solution, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to join the Madrid Protocol. This is a centralised global system that simplifies the process Sri Lankan businesses go through when registering trademarks abroad.
Registering trademarks at home is an important first step for a company that seeks to register its trademarks abroad. Therefore, to get the full benefits of accession to the Madrid Protocol, Sri Lanka needs to first take measures to address the problems within the local trademark registration system, de Mel said.
Verite Research found that the National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) of Sri Lanka takes around 3 to 5 years to process trademark applications. The widening gap between local trademark applications and registrations significantly limits the countrys ability to benefit from the Madrid Protocol, he said.
Registering has a big demand and since the demand from 1995 was 2000, today it has passed the 6000 mark, it has grown three times, he said.
Further, Sri Lanka fairs poorly compared to other middle income countries like Philippines, Bulgaria and Vietnam. The number of local trademarks registered as a percentage of applications a year was over 50% in these countries prior to their accession to the Madrid Protocol, whereas in Sri Lanka it is as low as 14%, he said.
The requirement the Madrid Protocol imposes on Sri Lanka in return for its benefit is simple. That is, to demonstrate its ability to process foreign trademark applications within a short, fixed period of one and a half years.
However, the benefits Sri Lanka can gain from the Madrid Protocol is severely undermined by the slow process of trademark registration in Colombo.
In the 2016 budget, the government allocated Rs.100 million to speed up accession to the Madrid Protocol. This was a positive response to a longstanding request made by Sri Lankan exporters. It will assist and encourage Sri Lankan exporters to invest in branding and trademarks in their market strategy and growth.
The Madrid Protocol is a centralised, global system for registering and maintaining trademarks in foreign countries. It is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
There are two constituencies that directly benefit through Sri Lankas accession to the Madrid Protocol.
The first are international companies in Madrid member countries that are keen to supply to Sri Lanka but have not yet registered their trademark in Sri Lanka.
Accession to the Madrid Protocol will enable Sri Lankan exporters to develop their product and brand with confidence, knowing that the investment in consumer confidence is duly protected. This is the long term also encourages them to develop and sell products under their own trademarks/brand names in export markets, rather than being invisible to customers and remaining a supplier to bands/trademarks owned by others.

SLFP salutes Auditor General
The SLFP yesterday hailed Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe for withstanding government pressure and working resolutely and intrepidly.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said the SLFP admires the AG for standing strong for justice and lawfulness amidst threats and intimidation of some sections in the government.
The minister was addressing a press conference at the ministry mainly to discuss the SLFP position with regard to current political developments.
The AG was picked to that post by President Maithripala Sirisena. Appointments of Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy as the Central Bank Governor and Sarath Jayamanne as the Director General of Bribery Commission were more examples to prove that the President was correct in his choices he said.
Dissanayake said the Presidents recent interventions could prevent several harmful decisions being implemented in the country.
The SLFP and the UNP are working together in the government amidst difficulties, for the benefit of the country. The two parties have contradictory policies and the grassroots level party supporters of both parties are unwilling to work together, he added.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister also stressed that there is no move to deprive any member of Joint Opposition of their civic rights.
It was a tall tale by MP Bandula Gunawardena, he said.
Commenting on the decision of Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera to be an independent MP, the minister said it was his right and should be respected.
If anybody tries to expel him from Parliament because of this decision I think it is detrimental to good governance, Sri Lankan politics and people. Ven. Rathana Thera is still working closely with the government, he said.

Smart work!
Innovation has become the benchmark of success, particularly in the modern world. Companies and institutions in every field are stepping up their efforts to become more innovative in the way they work, communicate and produce the goods and services they sell. But with such an objective, the obvious challenge becomes, how to identify the individuals who possess the greatest potential to innovate. Hence nurturing young innovators has become a much needed task today.
Nalanda College, Colombo, established a Research Forum in 2013 as a means of filling this void. Nalandians from grade 9 onwards are eligible to join the forum. They already have around 150 members in the group who constantly engage in research work in various fields. These students are given the opportunity to take part in national and international competitions. They have already won accolades at competitions like the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), Science Olympiad, International Environmental Sustainability Olympiad, International Science Project Olympiad, Earth Science Olympiad, and the International Sustainable World Energy Engineering Environment Project Olympiad (I-SWEEP). Their work is supervised by well known academics from universities and institutes.
Rakindu Wickramarathne has excelled in this field and has come up with some important discoveries. His project is based on the disposition of air pollutants on pollen grains and the occurrence of respiratory allergies among humans. He will be getting the Queens Young Leaders Award for his research. Around 60 youth from across the Commonwealth countries will be getting the award and Rakindu along with Senel Wanniarachchi has been selected from Sri Lanka to be presented with the award in June.
Another feather in Rakindus cap is the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka at the International Conference for Young Scientists that will be held in Germany in April. Two Sri Lankan students have been selected to take part in the event. He also won first place at the competition held by the National Science Foundation. Around 842 schools took part at the event and 29 projects were selected for the finals from them. The top ten students will to display their projects at the Sri Lanka Science and Engineering Fair that will be held this month. From there the top ten researchers as well as the top ten inventors will venture to California to take part in the Intel ISEF.
Q: Tell us briefly about your project.
A: I started my project in July 2016 when I was in grade nine. It took around 6 months to complete. Pollen is microspores released from flowers. These pollen grains enter the human respiratory system and trigger a type of seasonal allergic rhinitis called pollen allergy/hay fever. The purpose of the study is to note the morphological differences of pollen grains from four different plant species commonly found in the Colombo city as well as in rural areas. The study attempts to identify the chemical composition of the deposits (if any) of pollen grains due to gaseous pollutants. Pollen was separately obtained from Samanea saman (Rain Tree), Delonix regea, Tabebuia rosea and Peltophorum inerme trees growing in the Colombo city and rural areas. They are observed through a Scanning Electron Microscope after processing through standard methods. Whenever the pollen samples with deposits and secretions were identified an energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis was carried out at the Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology to detect the chemical composition of the surface of the pollen grains with dispositions and secretions.
Dispositions were identified on the pollen grains of Samanea saman obtained from the urban area while it was absent in the rural areas. Likewise secretions in pollen grains of Delonix regea were more in the urban area than those in the rural areas. There was not much difference in the components in Tabebuia rosea.
The Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy showed mainly Carbon and Oxygen. Nitrogen 28.08 percent and Sulphur 0.15 percent was present in some samples.
Q: Why did you decide to do research on such a topic
A: I am a wheezier from my childhood. Therefore I really wanted to do a research on respiratory allergies. When I did literature surveys I found out that pollen grains are a crucial issue in many countries. Therefore I thought that if air pollutants can also be present in them the situation must be severe.
Also according to the Medical Statistics Unit in the Health Ministry asthma related mobility and mortality is quite high in Sri Lanka.
Q: What isyourconclusion
A: Air pollution such as ionic components and gaseous pollutants can be present in the surfaces of pollen grains as Nitrogen, Oxygen and Sulphur. This is evidence that pollen grains of plants can also carry air pollutants and contribute to triggering asthmatic conditions. Therefore when man harms the environment by creating air pollution the environment too pays back by harming humans by setting the stage for respiratory allergies.
Q: How do you propose to combat this issue
A: If air pollution is less these respiratory allergies can be minimized.
Q: What were the challenges you faced during your research
A: Electron Microscopic studies and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy has very limited facilities in Sri Lanka. I had to wait for the Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy results for a long time.
Q: Tell us a bit about your family.
A: I am the only child in my family. My father, Keerthi Wickramaratne, is the Senior Medical Laboratory Technologist at the Electron Microscopic Department of the Medical Research Institute. My mother, Jeevanie Gunasekara, is attached to the Blood Bank at Apeksha Hospital.
Q: Whosupported you during your venture
A: All this could not have been possible without the support of our principal Ranjith Jayasundara. Upeksha Abeysekara, the teacher in charge of the Nalanda Research Forum, has been extending her support and advice to me throughout the project.
My supervisors were the senior lecturer/ head of department of the Department of Plant Sciences at the Colombo University Dr S M W Ranwala, the Deputy Provincial Director of Health Services in the Western Province Dr Anil Samaranayake, Research Officer in the Electron Microscopic Department of the Medical Research Institute P G S M de Silva and Senior Medical at the Labortory Technology IT of the Electron Microscopic Department of the Medical Research Institute K Wickramarathne.
Everyone supported me at the school. I am especially grateful to the Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology, Professor K M D Nalin de Silva and A D M Damayanthi.
Q: How do you spend your free time
A: I play squash and scrabble. Engaging in this research motivated me to do literature surveys. That has become a bit like a hobby for me now.
Q: What isyourambition
A: I would like to become an aircraft engineer.
Q: What is yaour message to other youth who are vying to engage in research
A: I believe that the world needs more knowledge. Research is how knowledge is gained according to Joe Tye. I go by that motto. Research and inventions are very important. Try to do something innovative.

A word from the principal
One of the main aims of a school is to encourage the research skills of its students. This is the secret of success in many developed countries across the world. China has given an important place to research work in universities. They even consider research as a plus point when they are given salary increments. We established the Nalanda Research Forum with this goal. Our students have won a lot of glory by taking part in international events.
Rakindus work is a fine example for many other youth to motivate them to engage in research. There is always room for research in what is included in our syllabus. Upeksha Abeysekara anchors this project. She has taken on the task with immense dedication without limiting her time to her duties. This is what helped to reap such results and bring glory to Nalanda College.

State and the status of religion
The other day I was watching a panel discussion where an eminent scholar mentioned that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist nation. I do not treat his opinion as an isolated case because there is a segment of population, particularly within Buddhists, who wholeheartedly agree with him.
These Buddhists claim that we became a Buddhist nation when Arahant Mahinda arrived in Sri Lanka in 3rd century BC. According to their thinking, the status quo remained uninterrupted through centuries and even when we were colonised in 1815, the British gave a solemn undertaking to protect Buddhism, which was set out in Article 5 of the Kandyan Convention 1815.
Talking about the status to be accorded to Buddhism as the majority religion in our Constitution, Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera, the Lekhakadhikari of the Asgiriya Chapter, said recently that in their view the provisions of the present Constitution should be further strengthened. Ven. Thera also added that Sangha society recognises the rights of other religions which are guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution but Sri Lanka is and will be a country that protects Theravada Buddhism. Therefore, they will work for constitutional provisions to enable this task in the greater interest of generations to come.
Meanwhile, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Colombos Archbishop, had said that the status and respect reserved for Buddhism should remain intact in the Constitution. Justifying his contention, Cardinal Ranjith said that the teachings of Buddhism bring people relief whenever they are confronted with mental pain and discomfort. He emphasised there should be no change in the foremost place which it currently enjoys in the countrys Constitution.
Along with these thoughts, there are two opposing views pertaining to the status of Buddhism in our Constitution. Some claim that by proclaiming Buddhism to occupy the foremost place in Sri Lanka, Section 6 undermines commitments to state neutrality or non-discrimination. Others claim that Section 6 does not go far enough in its privileging of Buddhism, that it stops short of making Buddhism the official State Religion, as it is in Cambodia and Bhutan.
Relationship
The relationship between state and religion differs from country to country. Different approaches often appear in the constitutions. Article 1 of the French Constitution determines the secular nature of the French state. The establishment clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States prohibits not only the existence of an established church but has a wider meaning, as well. Article 140 of the German Constitution refers to some provisions of the Constitution of the Weimar Republic that, on the one hand, prohibit the existence of an established church but, on the other hand, lay down that religious denominations may be recognized by the state. In England, of course, the Anglican Church is the established church. In the Netherlands, the separation of church and state is assumed to be an unwritten principle of constitutional law, as the Basic Law keeps silent on this issue.
What does our own Constitution say about this Article 9 says: The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).
Article 10 indicates: Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice. Article 14 (1) e indicates: Every citizen is entitled to - the freedom, either by himself or in association with others, and either in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching.
The Constitution contains no mention of Buddhism being state religion but says the State shall give to Buddhism the foremost place.
State religion
Now, let us briefly consider what is meant by a state religion.
A State Religion (or official religion, as its sometimes called) is a religious body officially endorsed by the state. However, a country with a state religion need not be under the control of the religion, nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the country.
State religions have been known throughout the history in almost all types of cultures. They were adopted by most ancient states, and observing them was a requirement made to all citizens, and especially public officials. For example, King Asoka in 3rd Century BC made Buddhism the state religion and provided royal patronage for its propagation both within and beyond his empire. He helped promote the metamorphosis of Buddhism into a world religion that spread peacefully across the face of Asia.
In the Near East and Middle East, many countries with Islamic population have Islam as their state religion (in its Shiite and Sunni variety). On the one hand, rulers of Saudi Arabia join secular and religious power in their hands, and Iran's secular presidents since the revolution of 1979 are supposed to follow decisions of religious authorities, Turkey, which also has mostly Muslim population, after its 1920s revolution became a secular country.
The degree to which a state religion is imposed upon citizens in contemporary society varies considerably; from absolute as in Saudi Arabia to minimal as in England, Denmark, Iceland, Greece and Norway. In SAARC countries, Bangladesh has Islam as the state religion, but other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.
In Pakistan, the Constitution confirms Islam as the state religion. In Bhutan, Drukpa Kagyu (Mahayana) Buddhism is the state religion. In Afghanistan, the official religion is Islam. Constitution of the Maldives designates Islam as the official state religion. Nepal is a secular state and therefore there is no state religion. India does not have an official state religion.
Secularism
Secular laws would not permit particular religious doctrines to be dictated into law. A secular state has a justice system based on impartiality and not holy writ. It would not permit blasphemy laws that are so easily abused and misused. It would not contain privileges for one particular religion that put others at disadvantage. Although a secular constitution can make it illegal for the state to engage in religious persecution but it cannot stop religions going to war against each other.
Secularism, if to be successful, should have a mutual understanding between religion and state. They must each agree to respect the other's boundaries. Religions should respect each other's right to exist even if their doctrines are entirely contradictory.
Most of the countries (85%) allow citizens of any religious affiliation to be head of state. Pew Research analysis finds that 30 of the worlds countries (15%) belong to a unique group of nations that call for their heads of state to have a particular religious affiliation. In addition to the 30 countries in this analysis, another 19 nations have religious requirements for ceremonial monarchs who serve as their heads of state. Sixteen of these, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations with Queen Elizabeth II  also known as the Defender of the Faith  as their head of state. The other countries in this category are Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
Some analysts believe that Section 6 of our Constitution should be viewed as something of a compromise between secularism and Buddhist majoritarianism, if for no other reason, because it did not make Buddhism the state religion. In fact, it represents a milder version of the measures that the state would take to offer some privileges to Buddhism. On the other hand, it has not specified that the highest offices in Government (the President, Prime Ministers, etc.) should be held by Buddhists.
Indian experience
Asian countries today adhere to different models of religion-State relations, most of them recognizing one or another faith as the state religion, or otherwise privileged religion. Among those which do not, the most notable example is India.
The Indian Constitution does not recognize any of India's different faith traditions as the State or otherwise privileged religion. It describes and portrays the country as a secular State and yet there is no wall of separation between the State and religion. No religion is banished from public life and State functions, nor is the State precluded from playing any role in matters of religion - only all religions are equal in the eyes of the State and all religious communities enjoy equal State patronage.
This is the Indian concept of secularism; and it constantly finds expression in the policies and practice of all three organs of the State - legislature, executive and judiciary.
The Indian Constitution contains some specific provisions relating to the religious practices of the Hindu majority. Of course, in general terms, it ensures for every religious denomination the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion and for each religious minority the right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice.
The exercise of these rights is not subjected to any formality of registration of religious communities for which there is no provision in the Indian law.
Legislative enactments in India regulate construction and use of religious places. There are laws separately controlling the management of shrines, both in general and of particular shrines of eminence, belonging to various communities and also to regulate inland and foreign pilgrimage.
Existence of a large number of statutory bodies for these purposes, all constituted and controlled by the State authorities, points out to an official establishment for various religions. The judiciary in India often decides religious issues and resolves disputes between various religious communities or sub-communities.
On the whole India is a unique Asian country legally swearing by the ideals of secularism and religious neutrality and yet preserving its age-old spirituality. How this is done, is something worth exploring.

Student charged in Quebec mosque attack
CANADA: A Canadian political science student known to have nationalist sympathies was charged Monday with six counts of murder over a shooting spree at a Quebec mosque -- one of the worst attacks ever to target Muslims in a western country.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned as a terrorist attack Sunday nights assault on the Islamic Cultural Center in a busy district of Quebec City, which sent terrified worshippers fleeing barefoot in the snow.
Eight people were also wounded in the crossfire, and five of them remained in critical condition in hospital Monday.
Alexandre Bissonnette, who made a brief court appearance after surrendering to authorities, was charged with six counts of premeditated murder and five of attempted murder, police said.
More indictments are expected later, police added.
There are search warrants underway, a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a press conference.
We hope to obtain the evidence to reach the point where we will be able to lay terrorism and national security charges, she said.
So far, authorities have shed no light on what may have prompted the attack.
Local media said Bissonnette is a Quebec nationalist and anti-feminist who recently liked US President Donald Trumps page on Facebook. He also has reportedly expressed support for French far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
Both police and witnesses had initially described two masked men opening fire inside the mosque, where worshippers were gathered for evening prayer.
But authorities said Monday that a second person detained had only been questioned as a witness.
Explaining how one suspect was eventually let go, the RCMP said: This morning and last evening we had reason to believe that two individuals should be arrested, that two people had participated. After investigating, they said: we reached the conclusion that we should focus on one single suspect. And there was no reason to believe that the other individual had participated. Some 50 people were in the mosque at the time of the attack.
The dead are all dual Canadian nationals: one Moroccan, two Algerians, one Tunisian and two Guineans.
Quebec has traditionally attracted Muslim immigrants from North Africa. Bissonnette, who is a student at Laval University, surrendered 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside the city after calling an emergency services hotline an hour after the attack to reveal his location.
It is a domestic investigation at this time, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Inspector Martin Plante said.
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the nations security threat level remained at medium -- requiring security forces to be on guard but having no specific information about an imminent threat.
It was raised to this level in October 2014 after a lone gunman attacked parliament. Police are continuing to collect evidence in a bid to identify exactly who is involved and what was their motivation, Goodale said.
Authorities, he added, dont have sufficient, hard facts yet to be able to draw conclusions. The Quebec mosque had already been the target of hate: a pigs head was left on the doorstep last June during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Other mosques in Canada have been targeted with anti-Muslim graffiti in recent months. Police stationed near the mosque told AFP that they had feared this type of attack because its happening all over the world. The shooting came as Canada vowed to open its arms to Muslim refugees after Trumps controversial immigration ban prompted travel chaos and outrage around the world.

Is there are a hidden pattern to cricket selections
The manner in which certain players have been picked for the national team since the current Sri Lanka Cricket administration took over leaves room for a lot of questioning as to whether it is being done to satisfy the voter base and thereby depriving the country of the best team to represent it.
The selection of players like Chaminda Bandara (Sri Lanka Ports Authority), Thikshila de Silva (Chilaw Marians), Kasun Madushanka (after he moved from Bloomfield to CCC), Chaturanga de Silva (after moving from Moors SC to NCC), the continuous selection of Kandy cricketer Sachith Pathirana and the presence of seven NCC cricketers in the current One-Day squad playing in South Africa are some glaring examples that have made the cricketing fraternity sit up and take notice that everything is not fair by way of national cricket selections. There seems to be a pattern to this selection that is currently going on and someone who is not aware of how the dynamics works will be blind to it.
The SLC constitution has provision where the ExCo has been empowered to give certain guidelines (not interfere in selections). But with the inaction of the Sports Law of the country in 1974, it supersedes all sports constitutions. It is the law of the land. So how can the SLC hierarchy state that they have taken a policy decision to include an under 19 player in every national team when they have no jurisdiction over it. It is the prerogative of the selection committee appointed by the Minister of Sports.
The Sports Law clearly states the constitution for the selection committee and what authority is vested in the chairman etc, etc. It is directly opposite to what the SLC constitution - where there is a law of the land which gives clear directions as to how selections should happen. The Sports Law supersedes all other constitutions. The Sports Law says that at any given time you have to pick the best team to represent the country. The question is, is it happening that way It seems the SLC is flouting with the laws of the land with people who are not mindful of what the Sports Law is all about.
The biggest injustice they have done to that dashing wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera is to bat him at no. 3 where he proved a complete failure in South Africa and thereafter abandoned him from the T20 and ODI sides when his style of play really suits the two shorter formats. Perera was being groomed as a no. 7 batsman and wicket-keeper for the Test team by the former selection committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardene when they were unceremoniously overthrown and replaced by an adhoc committee to satisfy the wishes of the SLC hierarchy. By sending Perera at no. 7 in the Tests there was certain thinking behind it. He could get quick runs although batting with the tail and also be batting in the middle when the second new ball arrives and the opposition bowlers are tired. By not properly utilizing his extraordinary talents Perera is not in the one-day squads today whereas he should have. It is a crying shame that a player with his talent is left to waste when the team is struggling to counter the South African bowlers.
Since the new SLC administration came into power at the beginning of last year through an election, there have been two instances where they had clashed with the selectors. The first one that took place was ahead of the ICC World T20 in April last year that resulted in the selection committee headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Kapila Wijegunawardene being replaced within a matter of hours by an adhoc selection committee headed by another former Sri Lanka cricketer Aravinda de Silva and which also included former captain Kumar Sangakkara.
This committee fulfilled the needs of the current administration making changes to a team that had already been approved by the Sports Minister and even sent to the ICC to meet the original deadline. Subsequently SLC managed to get permission from the ICC to extend that deadline so that they could make late changes to the squad which surprisingly the international body agreed to.
The changes saw two young cricketers Niroshan Dickwella and Jeffrey Vandersay who already had their air tickets with them to travel to India, being replaced by Lahiru Thirimanne and Suranga Lakmal and the captain which the previous selection committee had picked as Dinesh Chandimal being replaced by Angelo Mathews. They had done that knowing Mathews long history with injuries. They had also left out the injured Lasith Malinga from the squad as he was uncertain of his match fitness. However the adhoc committee took a risk and included Malinga and eventually had to eat humble pie when Malinga failed to regain fitness in time and was forced to return home without playing a single match. He was replaced by Vandersay which the previous selection committee had already picked and to add insult to injury Mathews got injured and Chandimal eventually had to take over the captaincy in the latter matches. This comedy of errors certainly had an effect on the team performances and Sri Lanka needless to say failed to successfully defend their World T20 title being knocked out after failing to get beyond the group stage.
The second instance involved the present chairman of selectors another former Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya whom reports indicated had a clash with the administration over the SLCs refusal to allow a selection committee member to join the national cricket team on tours abroad which has been the practice in the past.
The issue was however resolved with the intervention of the Sports Minister and discussions which Jayasuriya subsequently had with SLC officials who eventually agreed to allow a selection committee member to join the team on overseas tours beginning with the current tour to South Africa.
Its not about individuals its pride. We are a proud cricketing nation and we have come to five World Cup finals whereas South Africa has not even made it even to one. At the end of the day it is the country that is suffering because of a few individuals who take decisions to remain in power.

Tilko Jaffna  City Hotel to add spa, karaoke bar
To invest Rs 100 mn on Chatty Beach theme park
For the first time in the Northern Province, a high quality spa and a karaoke bar will be introduced by Tilko Jaffna City Hotel before April end.
Tilko Managing Director Thilak Thilagaraj said they are now on the lookout for a good operator to introduce the spa at the hotel premises.
Tilko joint Managing Directors, Thilak and
Kohila Thilagaraj. Pictures by Saliya Rupasinghe.
In addition they are also looking at opening a beauty culture school which is a much sought after self employment avenue in the peninsula.
Recalling his past he said that it was a free push cycle ride that he offered in the early 1973 that changed his entire life.My parents were government servants based in Jaffna and the family of five was educated under strict Hindu culture.
He said that the family fell in debt when they had to raise capital to give his two sisters in marriage. We were then under tremendous stress and it was this mental agony that made me wile away most of my time in play grounds just gazing at the sky.
It was one of the football matches that a boy, Manoharan from Hindu College who was injured in the match wanted a lift in my bicycle to his house which was in the opposite direction of my home. Though I knew that I could not meet the deadline of being home before 6.30 p.m. and having to face punishment I volunteered to drop him. After I dropped him he gave me the second application to a London technical college and said they were offering scholarships and wanted me to apply.
I came home with this news and the application and my parents encouraged me to apply and we typed the application and mailed it without expecting much. In two weeks Thilagaraj said he received an aerogram from London stating that his application was accepted and to join the college in two months. We then got a passport and went to the British High Commission with the aerogram.
However Thilagarajs' hopes were shattered when the female British visa officer said that more documentation like sponsorship letters and sources of income were needed.
When he was called for the second interview he was once again in line to meet the same female officer but somehow managed to skip this and go to another officer. I told him that I wanted to go to London, to learn engineering and then come back as soon as possible to help my people with knowledge.
The visa officer was convinced and stamped me the London visa and Thilagaraj said that had he gone to the female visa officer no one would have known of the Tilko City hotel in Jaffna. He said when he entered the London College with a borrowed suit from a friend he noticed that most of his fellow students were from Asia and he felt at home. I did three odd jobs and in one year brought down my brother and three years later brought his family. Thilagaraj said that after passing out as a civil engineer he met Kohila who was a Singaporean. Though we had objections from her parents we married and started real estate business in London.
He said that he never forgot the promise he made to the British visa officer and as soon as the peace accord was signed by then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe he came to Jaffna and bought several lands for investments.
He said that then he constructed Tilko Hotel in Jaffna as a holiday bungalow with great difficulties. Even during that time I bought a bag of cement for Rs.2,000 and other building materials too were very expensive.
He said that there were restrictions of movement by the LTTE but he never paid any money to them for his business' survival. Soon after ending the war, I built Tilko as a three star hotel adding 40 rooms and it was the first star class hotel in Jaffna.
He said that he offered employment to youth in the area and also conducts many CSR projects to keep his promise. I want to offer more entertainment for youth in the area and this is the reason I am introducing some new features like Karaoke, Spa to the peninsula.
He said in addition I will also invest around Rs.100 million to build the province's first Theme Park at Chatty Beach with water sports and other activities to keep the Jaffna people engaged in leisure activities.'
He said that last week's Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF) was a success and more events of this nature should be conducted.

Tilko Jaffna to invest Rs 600  million on expansion, hotels
Tilko Jaffna City Hotel is looking to build a city hotel in Colombo and have expanded their foot print in Jaffna as well with three new hotels.The company which has interests in London is also looking at acquiring a travel company.
Tilko Managing Director Thilak T. Thilagaraj speaking to Daily News Business said with the increasing number of local and foreign travellers to Jaffna they bought two bungalows and converted them to hotels in Jaffna.
The Park View Hotel offers 10 rooms while Fortway hotel has seven rooms and these are created mainly to accommodate budget travellers.
He said in addition they would add 40 more rooms to Tilko Jaffna City Hotel this year. We are also in the look out for a good operator to introduce a spa which will be a first for Jaffna. A karaoke bar is also on the cards which will also be another first for the region.
The second expansion they plan is to their beach front property Charty Beach in Jaffna. Here we are looking at adding ten more rooms. Thilak said that he together with his wife, co-investor, Kohila, will also invest to convert the existing Katunayake Airport hotel to convert it to a city hotel. We are planning to add another 20 rooms and a swimming pool and other facilities to elevate it to a three star status.
We also have a land in Balangoda and hope to build a ten roomed eco lodge there by end of the year. Total investment for these investments will exceed Rs. 600 million. One of the biggest plans of the company this year it to create their own travel and tours arm and for this purpose they hope to acquire Experior Travels in Colombo 3.

Toyota Lanka launches Toyota Genuine  Battery TGB at Ceylon Motor Show
Toyota Lanka launched the Toyota Genuine Battery at Ceylon Motor Show on January 28. Exclusively engineered and individually designed for each Toyota model, this battery is able to withstand harsh conditions and requires little or no maintenance.
The Toyota Genuine Battery (TGB) is designed to harness optimal performance by catering to a vehicles specific requirements. Generic vehicle batteries available at present are designed to be compatible with many types of vehicles of varying requirements, and are therefore not tailored to a specific vehicles requirements, losing out on its capacity for power and efficiency.
Toyota engineers have equipped TGB with high quality calcium alloy-grids, segregated into several sizes depending on the Toyota vehicle type. This allows the battery to function at peak performance, as it fits the exact specifications of the vehicle. The battery fights corrosion with a thick cast positive grid, stronger alloy components and double dip protection. It can also combat fluid loss and vibration, and enables superior cycling for optimal performance.
With the TGB, Toyota vehicle owners will receive free maintenance services, a two year warranty from the date of purchase, free monthly inspection by Toyota or authorized dealers and free of charge replacement and rectification of battery failure within the warranty period in the unlikely event of a manufacturing defect. The battery can be purchased from all island wide Toyota Lanka branches and authorized dealers.
At the launch, Toyota Lanka Priyantha Perera introduced the Toyota Genuine Battery to attendees, noting that their battery maintenance troubles were now over. The typical car battery requires regular maintenance, and often doesnt perform at optimum capacity as it hasnt been designed for a particular vehicle, he noted.
With TGB the idea is to bring a superior quality product to our customers to yield the best performance from their Toyota.
The launch was attended by Managing Director Shungo Yoshioka, Director and CEO Manohara Athukorala, General Manager Spare Parts, Lubricants and Car Care Priyantha Perera, and TGB Team Leader Anton Roshane.
Toyota Lanka is renowned for unparalleled after sales services across the island, even being recognized as the Best Sales Provider in the region by Toyota Tsusho Corporation in 2015.

VAT increases on alcohol has no effect on consumption - Fitch
Fitch Ratings believes firm demand will absorb higher prices caused by the introduction of value added tax (VAT). The government introduced VAT of 15% on alcoholic beverage manufacturers on November 1, 2016.
We feel that the inelastic demand for refined alcohol and rising per capita income should allow companies,including Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka and Lion Brewery.Successive Sri Lankan governments have consistently used excise taxes as a tool to boost revenue to bridge budget deficits. Excise tax on alcohol constituted around 7% of government revenue in 2015. Alcohol consumption appears to be inelastic to higher taxes, but if this reverts we believe the government may hold back on further tax increases, especially with the importance of the sectors contribution to government revenue.
The sector is also heavily regulated, with restrictions on advertising and limited issuance of new retail licences creating high entry barriers that benefit entrenched players like Distilleries Company and Lion Brewery. Fitch expects hard liquors share of the alcohol market to continue to rise in 2017. Taxes on a unit of pure alcohol of strong beer surpassed that of hard liquor after back-to-back tax increases in October and November 2015.
As a result, revenues of Distilleries the largest spirits maker,grew by 36% in 4QFY16 (three months ending March 2016), while gross revenue of Lion the largest beer maker contracted by 12%.
Spirit makers had previously been facing heightened competition from beer producers, given the competitive pricing on the basis of pure alcohol content, growing popularity of beer among the younger population and rapid urbanisation in post-war (post-2009) Sri Lanka.
Fitch expects Lions financial leverage to improve in FY18 (year ending 31 March 2018), benefitting from lower capex and normalised returns, bringing its leverage ratios below Fitchs negative triggers, having weakened in FY17 due to the floods.

Vehicle accidents killed 215 in last two years: Nimal
The prime duty of the National Road Council for Road Safety is to assist road accident victims and try to bring down the number of road accident victims in the future, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister said 215 have died of unidentified vehicle accidents in 2015/2016 and 400 others had been seriously injured during that period.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony at the ministry to mark the awarding of compensation payments to persons seriously injured in vehicle accidents and the next of kin of those who had died of such accidents.
The event was held on January 30.
The minister said the victims of vehicle accidents become helpless when those responsible for committing such accidents go unidentified.
Those receiving compensation on that day belonged to that unfortunate category, he said.
The minister said this system of compensation payments had operated since 2008.
He said they had been able to pay a total sum of Rs. 765,000 for 137 seriously injured persons and Rs. 11,555,000 in respect of 165 persons who had died of such accidents since 2008.
De Silva said he had suggested that the compensation paid to a seriously injured person be increased from Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 100,000 and the amount be paid in respect of a person who had died be increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 200,000.
The minister said his suggestion had now been implemented and they were awarding Rs. 1.8 million in respect of 18 seriously injured and Rs. 2.8 million in respect of those who had died, at the ceremony.
However, the value of a life of a road accident victim could not be really assessed in monetary terms, de Silva said.
The minister said the non  implementation of safety networks and poor standard of roads were also major contributory factors towards vehicle accidents.
Similarly, failure to wear seat belts and wearing of interior helmets by motor cyclists were other factors contributing to such accidents. On the other hand, negligence on the part of pedestrians was another factor leading to road accidents, he said.
De Silva said drivers and pedestrians should make it a point to observe road signals before crossing the road.
He said the regulation relating to wearing of quality helmets would be enforced from April 1.

Vehicle assembling gimmick to cost  coffers heavily
Revenue loss to country could exceed Rs 700 billion 
A ministers effort to obtain cabinet approval to provide duty rebates for used vehicle parts imported to the country to be used by an automobile assembly company has raised alarm bells in the industry.
A top official of the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) told Daily News Business they are very concerned about the amnesty proposed to be given to the auto assembling company situated in Minuwangoda.
The company had received BOI approval in 2009 to assemble motor cars with used spare parts. About 400 cars were assembled and after an individual filing a court case the operation was barred.
However, in the last budget the government had given them an amnesty to register those vehicles with the RMV.
The official said in addition to that they have now been given an additional approval to assemble 750 units per year for three years which amounts to 2,250 units.
The official said that already eight containers full with used vehicle parts has arrived in the country and the Customs has detained these used vehicles spare parts containers as they were more than three years old ranging from 5 to 10 years.
He said that according the countrys law, vehicles more than three years old cannot be imported into the island. There is a serious issue here because these used car parts imported are very old they are basically Toyotas and Hondas and will be assembled and sold in a different brand name.
This is a violation of manufacturers rights as these cars will carry the chassis numbers of the original manufacturer. This will also be an environmental hazard and against the governments policy of having cleaner air.
The official said that the CMTAs main concern was that the public is being misled, given false information and moreover the colossal loss of revenue to the country if this vehicle assembling was allowed to continue with amnesty in Customs duty on scrap vehicles imported to the country.
Further the CMTA is also very concerned about the safety factor as there is no quality checks which can lead to accidents and loss of life, further one cannot accept any safety factors from a vehicle that had run for over 10 years.
Therefore, the CMTA requests President Maitripala Sirisena to appoint a committee and immediately check the status of this business to prevent innocent people getting affected by this.
