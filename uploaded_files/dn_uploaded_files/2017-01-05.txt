Minorities get a good deal from the Sri Lankan electoral delimitation panel
Minorities have got a good deal from the Electoral Delimitation Committee, panel member Dr. P. Balasundaram Pillai said on Tuesday.
The minorities have a good deal whether the constituency concerned is to elect a representative on the Proportional Representation System or the First Past the Post System, Pillai said.
The interest of the parties of the majority community has also been safeguarded, he noted, and added that the proceedings of the multi-party committee showed complete agreement on the principles adopted.
Any issues that still remain will be sorted out when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe meets all the political parties in parliament on January 9, Pillai said.
However, the process was disrupted when two of the five committee members representing the ruling United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Sirisena faction), did not sign the report.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the committee, Asoka Peiris, decided to submit the report because the majority of the members had signed it.
He also wanted to meet the criticism that the committee was taking too much time over the report.
But when it was submitted to Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha he refused to accept it saying that two members had not signed it.
According to Prof.Pillai, the Minister said that the two members must say in writing, why they did not sign, or submit a dissenting note.
I expect them to sign or do as the Minister said, in the next few days. However, I I believe the matter will be sorted out when the Prime Minister meets the political parliament in parliament on January 9, Pillai said.
Trick to Delay Elections
The Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP, which goes by the name Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), views the development as nothing but another trick to delay elections to the local bodies which have been due for the past year and a half.
SLPP chief, Prof.G.L.Peiris told Express that the UNP-SLFP (Sirisena) coalition government has been trying every trick in the book and outside the book to thwart the local bodies elections.
These elections have been delayed by an year and a half only because the UNP-SLFP (Sirisena) coalition is scared of losing them, he said.
Indefinite postponement of elections is a gross violation of a citizens fundamental right because suffrage or franchise, is a basic right in a democracy, Peiris said.
He accused the leaders of the UNP and SLFP (Sirisena) of asking their representatives in the Delimitation Committee not to sign the report. He also recalled committee chairman Asoka Peiris telling a local newspaper that the government had been asking him to go slow on the report. When it was to be submitted at the end of December, nobody from the government was available to take it, and when it was submitted this month, the Minister refused to take it, Peiris said.

Rural libraries which were initiated by the government under the Local Government authorities are in a deplorable state causing immense difficulties to readers.
They said the majority of these libraries are not functioning properly due to the lack of supervision.
Librarians are not there on time and these libraries are being neglected but the management is not aware of this situation.
Over 30 such rural libraries have been established by the government in the district. But, no improvement is visible, the readers said. The daily newspapers are also not available in some libraries. Therefore, those using the libraries urge the government to rectify this as soon as possible for the benefit of the people.

Driving away the wild elephants was difficult because these elephants frequently enter the village in search of food, he said.
Kumara said the forest was being used for various development projects and people engage in cultivation near those areas. He said this was the main cause of wild elephants entering the viillage, he added.
According to Kumara, a separate elephant reserve should be established as a solution to overcome this issue.

COPE to probe coal tender, rice scam
Investigations to be based on AGs audit reports:
Two reports handed over to Speaker, COPE:
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will start investigations into the recent coal tender controversy and the massive scam related to rice importation in 2014/2015, COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said investigations would be based on the audit reports of the Auditor General. He said the Auditor General on Tuesday handed over two reports pertaining to the above matters to the Speaker as well as the COPE.
Handunnetti said the copies of the audit reports would be distributed among all COPE members during its meeting scheduled on Monday. We have to give time for the members to study the contents of the reports.
In our next meeting we will fix a date to take up these reports for consideration, he said.
Meanwhile, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon issuing a press release yesterday said the Auditor General in his report had stated that the controversial coal procurement tender had resulted in a loss of Rs 4,145 million to the Government.
The CaFFE had written to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday and on January 2 urging his intervention to terminate the controversial tender to supply coal to the Lakvijaya Power Plant.
The Audit report in its conclusions had questioned the conduct of the Lanka Coal Company over the past years and had called on the authorities to study whether it is necessary to continue with it.
The other Audit report is related to importing large stocks of rice in 2014 without Cabinet approval or following the tender procedure.
Handunnetti revealing full details of the rice importation scam in Parliament on December 2 said a staggering amount of Rs 18,597 million had been spent on importing these rice stocks when there was no shortage of rice in the country.
Handunnetti said the loss the Government had incurred by selling these imported rice stocks at cheaper rates amounts to Rs 2,359 million. These stocks which were stored in warehouses for a long period were declared as animal fodder after those were found to be unsuitable for human consumption.

FTZ will complement Mattala Airport and Htota port: Rajitha
A free trade zone is a must for the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota Port cannot function without oil bunkering, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday as he defended the governments decision over the Chinese backed projects in Hambantota.
The government has announced that on January 7, it would sign an agreement with the China Harbour Engineering Company on a public-private partnership to develop the Hambantota Port along with the establishment of a 15,000 acre free trade zone.
It was wrong to have made Mattala. The airport should have gone to Weerawila but because of protests from Chamal Rajapaksa, it was taken to Mattala,Minister Senaratne said addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Hambantota however needs a Port and the first feasibility report done in 2002-2004 found the area suitable. But, it would only work to attract ships for bunkering purposes. When Mahinda Rajapaksa was told of this, he ignored it. He built the Port for political gain not for any benefit. Today we are spending Rs.600 million a year on the Port and earn Rs 10 million. Where do we get the rest from Its the tax payer that pays for all this,he added. Hitting out at the former President and the JVP over criticism that the government was giving away land to the Chinese, Minister Senaratne insisted that the land was only been given on a 99 year lease and that they needed the Chinese to build the Free Trade Zone to make Mattala airport work.
During Mahinda Rajapaksas time too I said we would build a 15,000 acre free trade zone and that the airport and port would complement the industries that function within. Then he had no problem, it is only now that he has found one, Senaratne stressed.
When Norochcholai was first suggested by the UNP government at the time, there were many protests, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga promised to shut it down but she too brought it back when she was President. In the end Mahinda Rajapaksa built it despite continuous protests. Now it has helped us. No project in Sri Lanka has been started without a protest,he added.

When the minister refused to accept the report with a majority of the committee members signing it, Peiris revealed that United National Partys A.S.M. Misbar and the United Peoples Freedom Alliances K. Saliya Mathew refused to sign the report.
However, Mathew had signed the report yesterday and the UNP representative has not signed it as yet. I dont know why Mathew delayed in signing the report and I have no idea what UNP representative M. Misbar is going to do, Peiris said.

Talk of toppling govt., a play to the gallery: PM

Talk of toppling the Yahapalana government is but a play to the gallery, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was briefing the media at Temple Trees on the second stage of the governments development framework A Balagathu Sri Lankawa, yesterday evening.
A Balagathu Sri Lankawa is a framework dealing with the governments plans for development and issues connected with the process, the Prime Minister explained.
Former-President Mahinda Rajapaksa was aiming for the post of Prime Minister. But soon, he will be in a state where he has to fight for his seat in Parliament. the Premier said while pointing out that the new development framework is to focus on the southern region as a primary economic corridor.
The PM also said, with major development projects and a boosting of employment in the south, especially in the Hambantota area, Rajapaksa and his followers will not be able to secure a single seat in the Hambantota District in an election.
He further said that Rajapaksa along with the Joint Opposition is trying to stop foreign investors coming into the country by making up stories about political instability and toppling of the government.
The comments by Rajapaksa on becoming the Prime Minister soon, was just news made up for the Christmas season, where there wasnt much political activity ,the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also pointed out it was not him who gave out the Colombo Port City to China on free hold.
I am not the one who tried to divide the Malwathu sector. I am not the one who planned attacks on the Dalada Maligawa. Rajapaksa took loans and let the public pay them on his behalf , he said.
The two parties in the National Unity Government are the two leading parties in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is but natural for them to have disagreements. They will argue with each other and thats the end of the story. The government, I can assure, is politically quite stable. People appointed Maithripala Sirisena as the President and me as the Prime Minister with high hopes. he further said.
Speaking on the development framework, the Premier said the only way out from the economic deadlock that the country is in, is but to develop ourselves.
But how do we do that,he questioned.
We are, after all, a small country. We havent got the markets of China or India. So we have to use our countrys strategic location which is in the fastest growing economic zone in Asia. With this strategic location, we could become a center of communication, for shipping, airlines, logistics and business. the Premier stressed .
Then we can expand our market through free trade agreements into the GSP+, China Free Trade Agreement, ECTA and Singapore, all with which, we could get around a market of 4000 million dollars. We shall not focus only on apparel, but on electronics, manufactured goods, IT services, tourism, he explained .
Last year we had two main issues. The first one was the high national debt. We have spoken with the IMF and come up with a programme for economic stabilisation, planned for the next two years. The next issue is the imbalance in expenses and income. Our incomes are insufficient to cover our expenses. the PM said.
The Premier said;  with A Balagathu Lankawa the government is planning to bring foreign investments worth 50 billion or more dollars.
In 2017, the government is expecting to receive 2-3 billion dollar worth of foreign investments, he said.
We are hoping that young Sri Lankan professionals will receive a monthly income of 300 dollars within the next five years, the Prime Minister said.
He also said that, concerning the social development, the government is to make 13 years of school education to be compulsory.
Asked on the Development (Special Provisions) Bill,the Prime Minister said said that the it was introduced to clear the legal blocks that discourage the foreign investments.
The Bill was sent to the Provincial Councils in order to get them into this process. We do not need to remove their powers. We only wanted them to cooperate with us. the Premier added.

The report has not indicated whether the number of seats in Local Government bodies has to be increased under the new electoral system and if so what steps should have to be taken in that regard. It has also not dealt with the changes necessary to the electorates as of the population ratio.
It has also been revealed that the number of elected members would significantly vary as of the new system despite the population of those electoral divisions does not differ much. Comparatively, a small number of seats are given to electoral divisions where a large number of Tamil and Muslim people live in.
For example the population of Dehiatthakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha is 58,937 and the allocated number of seats is 23, whereas only 12 seats have been allocated to the Samanthurei Pradeshiya Sabha which has a population of 68,591. The number of seats allocated to the Uhana Pradeshiya Sabha is 17 and the population is 52,137.
The report has also neglected the purpose of establishing multi member constituencies. As of this system small political parties will not get any representation. Government sources said the report has been hurriedly compiled without adequately addressing the prevailing problems.

Govt. adopting various ruses to put off LG polls
The real reason for pointing out various issues such as the Delimitation Committee report etc in connection with holding the Local Government Election is for the purpose of delaying it, Front Line Socialist Party Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Jagoda said all political parties, especially the two main political parties very clearly know that they are going to be defeated at the next Local Government polls.
Only the TNA is confident of winning it. Other political parties are scared of the people because they face rejection at the polls, he said.
Jagoda said the main intention of political parties is not bringing in a more democratic and people friendly electoral system. Their intention is retaining power with it. Purely, it is a power struggle and they have placed their last bet on it.
Now they do not have any more tricks to play to mislead and cheat the people. Therefore, they are delaying the LG polls, he said.
The Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms is just a joke and a tactic used to mislead the public because nobody can expect that ordinary people will take leave from their work and travel to the place where this committee sits spending their money and time,he said.
No previous Constitution in Sri Lanka has been approved by the people through a referendum. There is no legal requirement for that. But, it is an ethical requirement. Definitely, this so called new constitution framed without the peoples active participation will be passed without the peoples approval. There is no doubt about it, he added.

The government may shake but it will not fall, Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said, refuting claims of government instability at the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
The claims come amidst former President Mahinda Rajapaksa vowing to topple the government in 2017 along with State Minister Priyankara Jayaratne resigning from his post to join the Rajapakse camp.
Mahinda Rajapaksa made the same promise in 2015 and then in 2016. Nothing happened, the minister said. Commenting further on remarks made by the Kurunegala MP that the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) was supported by the opposition; namely Champika Ranawaka and Rajitha Senaratne to defeat him, Minister Senaratne said the BBS was always Gotabhaya Rajapaksas puppet and that they worked for him. It was Gota who asked Anura Senanayake to let the BBS hold the meeting in Aluthgama. He got them to set fire to Aluthgama. Mahinda has always been scared of Gota. I smell a conspiracy here if he says that the BBS supported us. It is Mahindas nature to get people to sling mud at him for political advantage. So I am not surprised, he said.

A man who stabbed his wife and cut off her sister's wrist following a family dispute was arrested by the Peradeniya Police yesterday.
The incident has taken place in Muruthalawa, Dehi-Anga, Peradeniya last Monday at around 7.30 p.m.

The woman's relatives have brought the amputated limb to the hospital on medical advice.
A special medical team of the Peradeniya Hospital has performed a reattachment surgery on the hand.
"As the limb was brought to the hospital late, the success of the surgery cannot be assured," Peradeniya Hospital said.
The family dispute had been over the ownership of his wife's house.
The suspect's wife who was stabbed, had also undergone surgery.
The suspect was produced before the Kandy Magistrate and was remanded until January 13.

The website is now in order and steps would be taken to prevent such attacks in future, Ekanayake said.
He further said that an investigation was already on regarding the cyber attack.
The 13th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice says, cyber crime is an emerging form of transnational crime and was fastest growing.
According to the UN, developing countries lack the capacity to combat cyber attacks and also other forms of cyber crime. It is therefore not surprising that the victimization rates are higher in countries with lower levels of development.

Govt. firm on not appointing foreign judges to any special court: Minister Senaratne
Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, reiterated that the government would stand firm on its decision of not appointing any foreign judges to any Special Court which would hear crimes which occurred during the war.
The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms in its final report launched on Tuesday, however recommended that an Office of the Special Counsel and Special Court be set up with the appointment of international judges. They further recommended that there should be International technical involvement in the Office of the Missing Persons, including foreign personnel, specifically with regard to forensics.
Bearing in mind the need should be for active international participation from judges to the Office of the Special Counsel, investigators and staff, the selection criteria for the appointment of national and international judges to be set out by the Constitutional Council in consultation with professionals and civil society organisations and in the case of internationals, with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as well. In both instances, appointments would be made by the President, while the criteria should be made public, further stated the report.
The TNA too has called for foreign judges to be appointed to prosecute allegations of war crimes, citing the recent jury verdict in the murder of former TNA MP Nadarajah Raviraj, where all suspects were acquitted.
It is not only the TNA, even I have questions about that judgement and even the Attorney General has appealed against it. This shows that our system does work and we dont need foreign judges, said Minister Senaratne, when he addressed the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department. The minister also stressed that though the recommendation came from a government appointed committee, the final decision on the matter would be made by the government, Committees can recommend many things, it does not mean that we have to abide by it, he said.

Report on Vilaththikulam Reserve deforestation ready for submission
The report on deforestation at the Vilaththikulam Reserve near the Wilpattu North Sanctuary is ready for submission to the President, Forest Conservator General Anura Satharasinghe said.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said this report was based on a site visit he made along with a group of Department officials last Saturday.
The Forest Conservator General stressed that there had been no new felling of trees in the area, adding that the constructions were going on in the 270 hectares released for resettlement in 2013.
The report to be submitted to the President proposes removing already released 270 hectares from the Reserve status.
The Forest Conservator General said,the Vilaththikulam Reserve was declared in 2012 before the surveying of forests in the area was completed. At that time, it was done as a proactive measure to safe guard the forest cover in the area. Now the surveying is in progress and after it completes we proposes declaring Mavillu, Weppal, Marichchikadi and Vilaththikulam Reserves in the Silawathura area as one Reserve. All these reserves are interconnected. When that
happens, the 270 hectares already released for resettlement of war affected families will be out of the Reserve.
As of the information in the report, 944 houses are to be constructed on 270 hectares. Since 2013, 438 houses have been constructed in this area to resettle the displaced people. Another 506 houses are to be constructed. All these beneficiaries are in possess of land development permits given in 2013 the report said.
Satharasinghe also pointed out the State Timber Corporation had been asked to cut down the trees with a commercial value in this area in 2013.
This had been done during the same year and the area now has the trees without any commercial value.
Some of those remaining trees are also being cleared for constructions. Except for these, there is no new felling of trees in the area,
he stated.

He made this observation addressing a press conference at his Ministry premises yesterday.
The minister said those who spread falsehoods about this venture were trying to arouse the public and Buddhist monks by getting them on to the streets to create a clash with the Police and Security Forces.
I believe the Buddhist monks would understand this reality and refrain from making any directive against the Government. These are politically motivated agitations he said.

Rabada pushes Sri Lanka to brink of defeat
Cape Town: Kagiso Rabada took two wickets in successive overs to send Sri Lanka plunging towards defeat on the third day of the second Test against South Africa after Sri Lanka at Newlands on Wednesday.
Set a massive 507 to win, Sri Lanka were 130 for four at the close.
Kaushal Silva and Dhananjaya de Silva defied the South African bowlers for more than an hour in a third wicket partnership of 41 before Rabada dismissed both batsmen in the space of seven balls.
Silva was caught off his glove at short leg off a ball which reared up at him. He made 29.
In the next over De Silva (22) was struck low down on his front pad by a full toss from Rabada.
Umpire Rod Tucker immediately gave him out leg before wicket and neither De Silva nor his batting partner, captain Angelo Mathews, thought it worth calling for a review. De Silva was almost back in the pavilion when replays showed the ball would have missed his leg stump.
Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal batted well during the last hour, putting on an unbeaten 61 for the fifth wicket.
But South Africa will expect to wrap up the game -- and the three-match series -- reasonably early on Thursday with Sri Lanka having only one recognised batsman to come, followed by a lengthy tail.
Rabada finished the day with two for 22, while Vernon Philander had two for 34. South Africa declared their second innings on 224 for seven in mid-afternoon.
Opening batsman Dean Elgar hit a half-century to add to his first innings hundred, while fast bowler Suranga Lakmal restored some pride for the tourists, taking four for 69 and ensuring that South Africa did not bat with complete freedom as they sought to set up the declaration.
Elgar, who made 129 in the first innings, reached his fifty off 82 balls with seven fours but was out soon afterwards for 55, caught at slip off left-arm spinner Rangana Herath.
Faced with an almost impossible task, Sri Lanka got off to a poor start when Philander bowled Dimuth Karunaratne for six in the sixth over of the innings with a ball which swung back between bat and pad as the left-hander attempted to drive.
Kusal Mendis made four before he was out to a poor shot for the second time in the match, driving at a ball from Philander, which was well outside his off stump, to be caught at third slip. AFP

Federer loses to teenager Zverev
PERTH, Wednesday: Roger Federers comeback from injury struck its first hurdle on Wednesday when he was beaten by teenager Alexander Zverev at the mixed teams Hopman Cup in Perth. In one of the highest quality singles matches ever seen in the 29-year history of the event, Federer showed plenty of the class which has won him a record 17 Grand Slams, but couldnt quite hold off the bold 19-year-old German.
He was left to rue his failure to serve out the first set when leading 5-3 as Zverev took a match ultimately decided by three tie-breakers, 7-6 (7/1), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/4) in two hours and 30 minutes. In the end, two booming first serves from Zverev, the first teenager to make the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006, closed out the match in front of a record Perth tennis crowd of 13,785. It was Zverevs second straight win over the Swiss champ, having beaten him in Germany last June, and the result also mirrored that of an unofficial match on the practice court on New Years Eve. Federer was upbeat despite his defeat to a player he believes will be a star for the next decade.
It was good to play for two and a half hours, he said.
Sasha (Zverev) can serve big and showed what he can do, but I was happy how I hung around and I had some really good moments.
As long as I am injury free and feeling good.
It was only the 35-year-old's second match since a six-month layoff due to knee and back injuries following his win over Englands Dan Evans on Monday.
But Federer -- who is out of the top 10 for the first time since late 2002 -- said he was on the right track for the upcoming Australian Open.
I am very happy, I have played five good sets so far, he said.
I am very pleased, practice has gone great, the matches have been a lot of fun and I am playing good tennis. AFP

South Korea speeds up creation of 'Decapitation Unit'

South Korea is ratcheting up its rhetoric against Pyongyang, with a new threat: Come at us, and we'll cut off the head of the snake.
The country is speeding up plans to set up what some call a "decapitation unit," a brigade specifically tasked with targeting North Korea's "wartime command," including leader Kim Jong Un, according to a South Korea Defense Ministry official.
The unit will be activated in the "event of war," the official said. Technically, South Korea and North Korea are still at war; they signed an armistice in 1953 but not a treaty.
The brigade was initially supposed to be ready in 2019, but the Defense Ministry now says it'll be established "by this year."
The move comes after a series of provocations by Pyongyang, includingbroadcasting imagesof Kim leading a combat drill targeting the South Korea's presidential residence, the Blue House.
The South Korean Defense Ministry says it believes North Korea will stage more nuclear and missile tests in 2017, despite sanctions and pressure from the international community.
Kim promised as muchin his New Year's speechwhen he said that the country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
It's a worrying development for Seoul, though many analysts say the country's missiles aren't yet developed enough to deliver a nuclear warhead.
It has been rumored for some time that South Korea has so-called "decapitation units," said Professor Choi Jong-kun from Yonsei University.
He said by making what would seem like a sensitive military tactic public, South Korea is sending a message to the North.
"It's a signal game," Choi said. But he also says it's a mistake.
"We do not have the leadership yet," he said. "We need to essentially maintain a defensive posture while essentially maintaining a low profile."
South Korea's in the midst of a leadership crisis afterPresident Park Geun-hye's impeachment, making many South Koreans nervous, a concern voiced by a significant portion of the South Korean left.
The Defense Ministry, by contrast, is made up of more hawkish elements, Choi said.
"The pattern has been such that the Ministry of Defense tends to be more aggressive, they tend to be much more in control of South Korea's national Korea's policy," he said.
"Often times, their decisions and announcements tend to be much overblown."

Diana letters about William and Harry to be sold at auction

Prince Harry was "constantly in trouble at school", candid letters written by Princess Diana reveal.
The notes, sent to ex-Buckingham Palace steward Cyril Dickman, also describe how a young Prince William "swamped" his new baby brother with "an endless supply of hugs and kisses".
The handwritten correspondence is to be sold at auction later.
Photos, Christmas cards and cake from the Queen's wedding will also go under the hammer.
The letters form part of about 40 lots from Dickman's former estate, which is due to be sold.
The lots are each expected to fetch 80-900.
Cheffins, a Cambridgeshire auction house, said the letters formed part of "a unique collection of Royal memorabilia".

In one letter - on headed Kensington Palace paper - dated 20 September 1984, Diana thanked Dickman for "such a lovely card" following the birth of Prince Harry.
She wrote: "William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!"
"The reaction to one tiny person's birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!"
In another, dated 17 October, 1992, she says how both young princes "are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble!".
The letters are expected to sell for between 300 and 900.
The items are being sold by the family of the late Dickman, who was head palace steward for more than 50 years.
Described by Cheffins as "a favourite of every member of the Royal Family", he received handwritten notes from other senior royals dating back more than 30 years.
The auction also includes letters from the Queen, written on Windsor Castle headed paper.
In one, she thanks Dickman for his "thoughts and sympathy", following the death of the Queen Mother.
Unopened boxed wedding cake from the Queen's marriage to Prince Philip in 1947 is also expected to sell for 200-300.
Several Christmas cards from the Queen, as well as from Princess Diana and the Prince of Wales, are also due to be auctioned.

Serving  the  deserving
Rosy Senanayake is one of the most influential women in Sri Lanka. She is in politics for one purpose and that is to serve the people. Outstanding Personalities feature Rosy, a remarkable woman who strives to create change.
Q. You are a woman in politics. You were the former State Minister for Child Development. You are also an activist on several issues. Currently, you are the Prime Ministers Deputy Chief of Staff. Do you find it challenging occupying such positions of power
A. Being Prime Ministers Deputy Chief of Staff is a job. I dont consider it a power base. Deputy Chief of Staff is a responsible position. And there is an absolute amount of dedication and commitment, loyalty and sincerity that goes into the job. It is a demanding job. I dont look at any of these jobs as a power base. Once you take on the role of being a politician, I suppose sometimes people lose the right perspective of a politician. They lose sight of the graveness of the title.
A politician is someone who is involved in making decisions with regard to an entire nation. It is a very responsible job. You cant take it haphazardly and cant think that this is a power base. For me every position that I have held, whether it has been the High Commissioner to Malaysia or President of the Lak Vanitha Movement (Womens Wing of the United National Party) or the organiser for a constituency or a Member of Parliament or the State Minister for Child Affairs or being a goodwill ambassador to the UN, whatever position that has been bestowed upon me, I have always looked at it as a responsibility, as a commitment that I have made to that particular institution or the people. I need to fulfill it to the best of my ability.
I dont look at this as a power base. It is a job that has been given to me and I basically fulfill my job to the best of my ability. Sometimes you dont realize the capacity you have within you until you have been given that responsibility.
So no matter what I have undertaken, I have done my best. There are instances when I felt I could have done things better if I was given another chance. I suppose these are defined as power jobs, maybe because politics has been perceived in this country or by certain people as a powerbase. I suppose there is a certain amount of power bestowed upon you with the job. That power is basically to do your utmost.
Q. You have had so many portfolios. From these portfolios, what has been the most rewarding for you
A. I would say the most rewarding thing about being a politician is to understand peoples needs, desires and aspirations, and to try to reach out to them to fulfill their needs, dreams and aspirations. The most rewarding for me has been the fact that I was a Member of Parliament and I was able to voice the peoples voice, especially when I was in the Opposition and to be able to represent people  their hopes and aspirations.
Out of all the positions I have held, the most rewarding would be fighting for womens rights. Because I believe in this country there is much to be done with regard to uplifting the dignity and giving women equality and power-sharing. There is yet a lot to be done. To be able to be a part of that movement that is fighting for their rights is to me, very rewarding. Eventually to see positive results and to have positive change for the betterment of women is gratifying.
Q. You are a champion for womens and childrens rights. Do you feel that as a political personality and a public figure, you have made a difference Do you have a particular concern for children
A. I think I have. In the six months I was State Minister for Child Development, I made quite a bit of change with regard to early childhood development. I managed to get a fair portion of funding from the World Bank to improve early childhood education. We are now working on the curriculum and methodology to improve early childhood education.
Medically, it is proven that the first five years of a child is the most crucial. In these very formative years, if you do not take care of childrens nutrition, health and education, there will be a lost opportunity. Early childhood education is of paramount importance. If we as a State do not take care of the most important aspects of a child, we would fail as a State.
I managed to bring new policies and push forward certain things with regard to early childhood development. I was also able to do something with regard to eradicating malnutrition among children and pregnant mothers.
I think we all should have a concern for children. When you look at the world today, there is very little respect for humanity. People will kill in the name of religion. When we grew up, we had compassion and forgiveness, giving and embracing people of different races, cultures and customs. We always put others first.
But today, people have become so selfish and self-centered. You look at others according to their culture, religion, caste and creed. God is no respecter of man. We are all created equal. It is we who bring divisions  the colour of the skin, the community and religion we belong to. There is so much conflict in the world. We are not thinking that we are equal anymore. We tend to segregate and look down on people. In order to change this, we must start from childhood. We need to place a lot of emphasis on kids  how they should be brought up, the values that should be instilled in them and the education they should be given  to make them think equal and have respect for others.
Equality to me is the key here. Molding children and giving them the right perception, cultivating their way of thinking and behaviour should start at a very early age. We should mold a child to be empathetic and respect humanity, no matter who the person is or where a person comes from. You have to create a responsible human being who cares for everyone and teach children to put others first. We live in a highly competitive, commercial world. We have lost sight of how to treat and respect others.
I am appalled hearing cases of violence against women and children. To harm a six-year-old or a two-year-old child - that is how cruel the mind has become. Especially in this country there is very little respect for humanity. We need to have a total change of thinking, change of mindset and attitude. That can be done from younger years. Molding a child to think differently and to be empathic is important.
Q. How do you evaluate your political career What do you consider your milestones
A. You know, I have never stopped evaluating my political career. I dont even look at this as a career. To me this is my calling. This is a service I am doing to society. This is what I can give to the people. I believe I am truly blessed and I have the capacity to serve the nation through politics. I will do my best as long as people need me. This is not something I planned to become. It just fell into place. One thing led to another and then the next thing I know, I was in politics. I did politics for all the right reasons, because I felt there were changes that needed to be done. I will work as long as I have the strength to make changes. I am there if you want me, I will serve you, the day you tell me to go home, I will go home.
Q. As a woman in politics, have you faced daunting obstacles How did you respond to them
A. The biggest obstacle has been the mere fact that I am a woman. Women are taken very lightly. How many women are in politics Look at the Parliament. Fifty percent of those in Parliament are not fit to be there. They are there for all the wrong reasons  power based! Politicians should be servants of the people. I go out to serve because I strongly believe that that is my calling. That is why God has created me and put me on this earth. If people have trusted you and put you in a particular place to serve them, then you are the peoples servant. But I find it strange that in this country, women are perceived as people who would be doing menial, labour-oriented low paid jobs and they are only suitable to do household chores, raise babies and be tagged housewives. You take education, most teachers are female. But if you take principals, how many women are principals at schools If they can put a male principal in a girls school, they would do that!
How many women in the public service department are at key positions in boards as directors or chairpersons, additional secretaries, secretaries to a Minister Not even 10 percent! Why What is the reason The biggest hindrance and stumbling block I have faced in political life is the mere fact that I am a woman and I have always been considered as second best to a man. I have been in politics for almost 28 years, but if ever I go to a political rally, the announcements will go as  here comes the beauty queen! I am not considered for the work I have done in society and titles I have held. To me it is so strange! So we need to change this.
Q. Who has been your greatest inspiration
A. This might sound very clich, but my inspiration comes from God. I read the Bible and I fear God very much.
I believe I have been put on earth for a particular purpose. And that purpose is to serve the people, to reach out and give, and have compassion.
That is where it comes from. We are here to give love, compassion and be empathetic to others.

Tomb rider reboot begins shooting soon
We are still waiting for the great video game movie to be made. There was a lot of hope that it would come with either Warcraft or Tomb Raider reboot is giving fans hope that maybe, just maybe, it can crack the code. And we'll get some idea of that sooner rather than later as the movie is going to be shooting very soon.
According to My Entertainment World, Tomb Raider is scheduled to roll cameras this month, meaning that the movie is going to start filming next month. After lining up Walton Goggins as the villain, it looks like things got moving very quickly. They also have Oscar winner Alicia Vikander playing the lead as Lara Croft, which is most definitely promising. However, having good actors is no guarantee. Assassin's Creed had Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons and Marion Cotillard and they couldn't even come close to saving that movie from a critical thrashing. But having talent on board certainly can't hurt anything.
This new Tomb Raider is said to be based on the most recent reboot of the video game series, which was started back in 2013. Specific details on the movie are a bit scarce, but it is said to follow a young Lara Croft who is searching for her missing father. The first Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movie, which was released in 2001 and starred Angelina Jolie in the lead role, also had a portion of the plot centered on her father, with Jolie younger than Vikander in real life at the time. That movie did decent business at the box office, bringing in $274 million, which was good enough to justify a sequel. Tomb Raider:
The Cradle of Life didn't fare nearly as well, only grossing $156 million worldwide and neither movie was met with a ton of praise.
Outside of the acting talent this new Tomb Raider has going for it, they also have some seemingly promising talent behind the camera. Screenwriter Geneva Robertson-Dworet is penning the script and has quickly become an in-demand talent in Hollywood.
Outside of Tomb Raider, she also is working on the Harley Quinn spinoff movie Gotham City Sirens as well as the Dungeons & Dragons reboot. The director, Roar Uthaug, may not be a household name, but star Walton Goggins had some nice things to say about him in a recent interview with Yahoo! Movies, calling him an "extraordinary filmmaker."
Luckily with shooting starting soon we should be seeing some set pictures and probably getting some official information from the studio sooner rather than later, so we can get an idea of this new Tomb Raider will be the video game movie fans have been waiting to see. At least all of the right things are being said and the talent seems to be right. Tomb Raider is currently set to hit theaters on March 16, 2018. (Movie Web)

Kanagana's shocking adult film experience
Multiple awards, including three National Awards winner Kangana Ranauts life is a true rags to riches story and in a recent interview has revealed that she almost did a blue film.
Kanagana said that when she was a struggling actress, she was ready to take on any film and one such offer was obviously soft porn. She said that her situation forced her to accept the film just as she bagged her breakthrough role as Simran in Anurag Kashyaps Gangster. At that time she was seventeen and she said that when the director gave her a robe with nothing inside to wear she realized that she was in a wrong kind of film but still decided to go ahead to make ends meet. Of course Gangster changed her life and the rest as they say is history for this Dhaam Dhoom girl who is now one of the most respected leading ladies of Indian cinema. (India Glitz)

Dakota pursues art, family time for Jamie
Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson got the level of fame they needed to survive in Hollywood by starring in Fifty Shades of Grey. Now, it looks like the priority for them is to pursue more artistically sound movie projects. Dakota Johnson has purged her Instagram account and has two artsy movies on her docket. Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan, after releasing a new movie this fall, is taking the time to reconnect with his wife Amelia Warner and his baby daughters.
Unfortunately for the actors, Fifty Shades of Grey failed to get good reviews, receiving 25 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and many wins and nominations for Razzie Awards, given to worst performances and films of the year. However, since the actors were contracted to do all three movies, they did their part by wrapping the filming for Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed over the course of three-and-a-half months this summer.
This also meant that the Irish actor had to fly out to Vancouver, Canada just days after his wife, Amelia Warner, gave birth to their second daughter.
But since then, Jamie has been dedicating more time towards his family. For one, he has appeared with Amelia at various red carpet events, turning work into a date night affair for the two of them.
Jamie Dornan and his wife Amelia Warner made a date night out of the British Independent Film Awards in London on Sunday night, reports Daily Mail. The duo  who tied the knot in 2013 and have two daughters together  looked loved up as they attended the star student event at Old Billingsgate near the Tower of London. Keeping things casual, 34-year-old Jamie ditched the tuxedo in favour of a relaxed chino and t-shirt combo.
He also has been putting some good and controversial work into his TV show, The Fall. Most recently, the show, which ended with Christian Grey actor committing suicide, gave rise for a TV regulator to investigate whether the show complied with graphic content guidelines.
The grim finale portrayed serial killer Paul Spector, played by Jamie Dornan, kill himself by suffocation, reports Belfast Live. The TV regulator last month confirmed they had launched an investigation after receiving complaints from viewers.
We investigated whether a depiction of suicide in this programme complied with our rules, a spokesperson for Ofcom stated. While we recognise that this was a challenging scene that had the potential to upset viewers, we concluded that it was justified by the overall context and broadcast well after the watershed.
While Jamie Dornan is throwing himself into challenging work, Dakota Johnson also is dipping her feet into indie movies. According to IMDb, the next projects lined up for her are Suspiria and The Sound of Metal.
Knowing that Dakota comes from a line of Hollywood actresses, there might be a lot of pressure for her to leave her mark in the industry.
Her mother, Melanie Griffith, made a comment about their Hollywood legacy in a recent interview with Vanity Fair.
The three generations just made me think about Mom, born in 1930, and me, in the 50s, and Dakota, in the 80s, she said. The progression of life is really beautiful.
With Fifty Shades Darker coming out this Valentines Day, Jamie and Dakota are probably hoping that they get better reviews for their performance. If they are to continue to do well in Hollywood, the next two installments of Fifty Shades are critical.

Timely solutions
Architecture addresses life. It engages with the mind. Most importantly, it deals with human beings and their inconsistencies which are a part of life. Humans mature differently and their personalities are diverse which ultimately affect the rest of their lives and the environment around them. An architect needs to understand this wide and inconsistent spectrum and provide answers and solutions to lifestyles. Arch World met up with Architect Palinda Kannangara to find out how creative you need to be to provide answers to this grey area in life.
I like to have open houses with no hidden corners or isolated areas. When you have more open spaces, there is more interaction and visual connections. I also try to play with light and shadows and try and get some ventilation into the house, said Kannangara.
Knowing a clients occupation, number of kids, their background and social systems is necessary for Kannangara.
Some clients say, I dont want to have a TV, I just want to read. You need to create spaces that are more into reading and writing with little disturbance. I have to understand their lifestyles, their budgets and the context. When I consider all these aspects, I get a tailor-made, unique solution, stated Kannangara.
Kannangara relishes in challenges. This is because they ultimately result in answers.
I am not afraid of challenges. It is an answer to my next project. If you do not have challenges, it is difficult to design. If you just have an open canvas without any input from clients or from the site, you may not know what to do. So you need challenges to design. Challenges help you to be more creative and think out of the box. The more challenges the better as they give better solutions to designs, pointed out Kannangara.
Kannangara feels that if you are true to your designs, you can go a long way.
My designs are consistent with the peoples understanding of the world. In that respect, Sri Lankans are unique architecturally and admired by many people. In Sri Lanka, clients are advanced and knowledgeable. They can understand architects and architecture. This is a plus point for Sri Lankan architects, explained Kannangara.
Kannangara feels that his architecture strives to give identity, simplicity and a connection to nature.
Architects have to advise clients if they are going beyond the budget. Addressing deep human needs such as rest and relaxation, belonging, identity and security are part and parcel of the architectural service. I am always trying to give that to the client, in a way that matches their requirements but also giving value added things. When you understand their background, you can give them a personalized solution or answer, elucidated Kannangara.
The project stems from the clients requirements. Clients have different ways of looking at things.
They may want to have a rooftop because they want to entertain people. But the way a rooftop is used is different from person to person. Sometimes they may ask for things that are not within their culture. They may have seen a rooftop somewhere and they want it. The lifestyle must match requirements. Then you can deliver a unique design, added Kannangara.
The client should be open to the architect. You cannot hide things about your lifestyle. It is a bit psychological because you have to be frank and honest with each other. The only way you can come up with answers is by talking about it.
The consumerist culture is good in a way. The Sri Lankan consumer is family-oriented. They consider their parents. So we want to have a room at ground level. You need to consider culture, values and religion, informed Kannangara.
According to Kannangara, Sri Lankan architects have always been minimal.
We never had clutter. We never collect a lot of stuff. Contemporary architecture is the same, said Kannangara.
True architecture is timeless. It is not copied. Your answer to the client and context makes it true. Fake is doing something without knowing why you are doing it. If you are answering the context and client requirements, that makes it true and you have to be involved in that project. Then it becomes a timeless project, expressed Kannangara.
An architect needs to be open to new ideas because there has to be a next generation. You need to do new things creatively. Otherwise, you tend to repeat the past.
In other countries, Sri Lankan architects are greatly respected. We try to do something different always. But you still need to keep in mind where you live and to whom you are designing. You cant copy. That wont work here, clarified Kannangara.
It is not Kannangaras policy to negotiate or challenge tradition.
You need to understand how important your tradition is. I love my tradition and I love my past. But we still have to live in our present. I always believe that architecture should represent the times. But you have to respect the past. Some of them are masterpieces. We need to understand how it has evolved from then to now. We cant forget our roots. You have to cater to your needs, climate and context. That is how age old architecture has become masterpieces and timeless projects. If you consider all of this, then you are doing something unique and relevant to Sri Lanka, explained Kannangara.
If you try to follow styles and trends all the time, you wont be at peace. They come and go. Being open to new things is good, but you should not do this blindly. You cant be a follower without knowing what you are doing. New technologies or elements in the market are fine but we must not be a slave to it. If you know what you are doing, no one can take you for a ride. You must control your architecture, summed up Kannangara.

Tips for picking paint colours
Why do we find one place appealing and are uneasy in another Why are we attracted to one product over another Colourwhether architectural or in productsaccounts for 60 percent of our response to an object or a place. The buzz about colour is usually called colour psychology. But the effects of colour are subtle and significant; physical and psychological. Colour use is not something that results in a definitive equation between colour and our moods, as is a currently popular expression. Wherever we go we respond to colour, but the importance of colour is often underestimated. Colour use is important to us personally in our homes and in the places where we work.
Start small
If youre not sure where to begin with colour, experiment in a powder room or bathroom, a small hall or area between rooms, or an accent wall. If youre doing your own painting, pick an area thats quick to do so you can see your results sooner, and be happy with it or change it. Look at the process as an adventure.
To get started, select a favorite colour drawn from artwork, a rug, dishes and an accessory or furniture piece as a main colour or accent.
Think about your mood
When selecting a colour, consider the mood of a room. In a bedroom do you want the feeling to be restful and soothing or dramatic and intimate Soft, cool colours and neutrals usually create a quieter feeling while stronger colours are for drama.
Do you want a dining area to feel sociable and stimulating or appear formal and quiet Warmer, contrasting and somewhat brighter colours add to a sociable atmosphere; deeper blue-greens and neutrals will give a more formal ambiance.
Do you want kids rooms to create an active and exciting energy or an orderly and restful feeling Be careful not to overstimulate your children with intensely bright hues. You may not know it, but some brighter colours can lead to unrest and irritability.
Pay attention to lighting
The reason why paint stores have light boxes for you to test paint chips:
u Natural daylight shows the truest colour;
uIncandescent lighting brings out warm tones and yellows;
uFluorescent lighting casts a sharp blue tone.
So, a strong colour might be too bright and overpowering when used on all walls or next to a large window, but it might be effective when used as an accent wall with indirect light.
Learn the colour terms
It helps to understand the terminology used to describe colour.
uHue is what we call a colour. Red is the hue; blue is the hue.
uThe value of the hue is how light or dark it is.
uSaturation refers to how dominant the hue is. As we go from red to pink, the red hue becomes less dominant.
u Intensity is the brilliance of the colour. The pure colours such as red are more intense than the combined colours such as yellow-green. A stronger intense colour usually has a more dominant hue.
If you want a more active space, consider introducing stronger, more intense colour.
Even if you want a light-coloured room, choose colours that are slightly more saturated than off-white or light pastel.
Very light colour can feel bright and stark when it appears on all surfaces in a room. However, two or more medium-light, closely related pastel colours can create a luminous effect when used in the same room.
Test your colour choice
Boost your confidence by testing colours on poster board or large areas of a wall. Dont be afraid to go beyond your comfort zone: Consider strong, vivid colours or soft, deep neutrals like chocolate brown or olive green as main or accent colours. Or add drama with a stronger colour on the ceiling. Tinted ceilings can dramatically change the whole look of a room.
Add depth with decorative finishes
Transform flat, dull walls into interesting and personal spaces with subtle or dramatic visual texture and broken colour. Burnished mineral/metal finishes and layered coloured glazes add depth. Some examples of softly reflective metals are mica, copper, pewter, bronze and, of course, antiqued silver and gold.
Walk into another room
Consider walls as planes of colour, and see how they interact when viewing one next to the other in adjacent rooms. Approach it like a composition: Youre in one room, but youre going to see a piece of another room through it. So as youre choosing colours, consider how they will flow from room to room to create your picture.
Follow the colour wheel
A small colour wheel is a great reference tool for modifying and intensifying two or more colours. For example, red and green, which are complementary (opposite) colours, are most intense when used together. You may be surprised at how many combinations function beautifully together, and you may even become attracted to entirely new colour palettes. The colour wheel also illustrates the visual temperature of a colour. Draw a line from the yellow-green mark on the colour wheel all the way down to the red-violet; youll see that all the colours on the left are warm and the colours on the right are cool.
Play up monochromatic schemes
Think one colour is boring Create bold or subtle variations within one colour group with contrasting paint finishes. For example, use closely related colours, or try a single colour in different finishes, for walls and trim in one space.
For an accent colour, select a warmer (more toward reds) or cooler (more toward blues) colour to complement your main colour group. For a quieter ambience, make sure your colours are not extremely bright. White or an off-white tint can be a striking accent when used as trim with a monochromatic colour group.
Choose different paint finishes
A single colour used on walls and trim takes on new significance when applied in different finishes. For example, wall and trim colours can remain the same hue, but use an eggshell (matte and less reflective) finish on walls and a satin or semigloss on trim. The colour will appear slightly different on each surface. Its a good way to create a cohesive look in rooms with many windows and doors, and relatively little wall area.

Top 10 art exhibitions of 2016
01.Picasso Sculptures
Museum of Modern Art, New York
This was the best exhibition of the 20th centurys greatest artist that I have ever seen. I am so glad to have caught the last few days of the French version of a show originally staged by New Yorks Museum of Modern Art, for it was a sensual thrill, an imaginative helter-skelter, an intellectual blast.
Picasso is the most serious and flippant of artists. You couldnt escape the flippancy here. From carving primitive figures of his girlfriend out of sticks and bits of wood on their summer holiday in 1906, to making a baboon with a toy car for its head in 1951, he always seemed to treat sculpture as childs play.
That was probably because he thought of painting and drawing as his true arts, and three-dimensional stuff as a bit of light relief. The freedom this completely unpompous attitude unleashed is delirious. Picasso takes a glove, sticks it to a relief and covers it in sand. He makes a Cubist absinthe glass, does a bit of welding, whips up a ceramic faun  whatever he feels like, really.
At no point in this exhibition does Picasso look like a professional sculptor. What he does look like is the greatest sculptor of the 20th century.
His readymades are far more poetic than Marcel Duchamps, his abstractions more exciting than the much narrower art of Giacometti or Brancusi.

02-Hieronymus Bosch
Noordbrabants Museum, Den Bosch, Netherlands
The most mind-boggling marvel in this unprecedented, probably unrepeatable retrospective of one of the most imaginative artists of all time, at the local museum in his home town, was not a psychedelic altarpiece but a display of drawings. I had never seen a drawing by this medieval genius before, but the research project that made this exhibition possible has identified a surprisingly large corpus of sensitive sketches by him. To look at Boschs drawings, his most intimate, personal works, was to see the world through his paranoid, unhappy eyes. The paintings in which he enlarges on his private fantasies of monstrosity and mayhem were lent by museums all over the world  a fantastic array in every sense.
On the day I visited, it was carnival time. People were eating chips in the rain. In the art of Bosch the nightmare carnival never ends.
03. National Gallery, London
I have a confession. I would rather visit an old museum or stately home and explore its shadowy paintings than queue for most hot-ticket exhibitions. That is why I absolutely love this one, because it manages to recreate the fun of exploring old master collections for yourself, in an exhibition. The curators have uncovered a rich haul of half-forgotten works by Caravaggios imitators, from the bizarre to the brilliant, with Artemisia Gentileschi arguably the biggest find of all. Then theres the man himself. There are only a few paintings by Caravaggio here, but they include his sublime visions of the Taking of Christ and St John, and cut into your brain with daggers of light and threats of shadow.
04. Abstract Expressionism Royal Academy, London
The power and the glory of Americas greatest painters fits well into the palatial spaces of Burlington House. This exhibition made use of every inch of those grand walls to offer an encyclopedic history of one of the most ambitious, courageous, liberating adventures in the story of modern art. It made me see these artists in a new way, and while the revolutionary art of Jackson Pollock is powerfully celebrated (seeing his first really great painting, Mural, opposite his last, Blue Poles, is quite a moment), it also reveals the true brilliance of artists like Franz Kline and Ad Reinhardt. Yet the most sublime artist here, from his troubled early self-portrait wearing blue glasses to his majestic poems of uneasy colour, is Mark Rothko.

05.In the Age of Giorgione Royal Academy, London
This was a sensitive and subtle exhibition about a sensitive and subtle  and incredibly rare  artist. Giorgione was more famous than his friend Titian until, in modern times, a more scientific attitude to art history reduced his once abundant body of work to barely anything at all. Some of his undisputed masterpieces, including his brilliant, challenging painting The Old Woman, were shown here among works that may or may not be by him, and those of his contemporaries. The result was a truly beautiful evocation of the spirit of experiment that flourished in Venetian painting at the start of the 1500s. It may not be any easier to identify true paintings by Giorgione, but this important event put the Giorgionesque mood of delicate sensuality right back at the centre of western art, where it belongs.

06-Anselm Kiefer White Cube Bermondsey, London
Staggering stuff from the greatest living artist  I think hes clinched that title now  with an exhibition of new work that somehow manages to be even more impressive than his retrospective at the Royal Academy in 2014.
The theme is the death of the gods, and Kiefer makes of this Wagnerian stuff a mythology for our time  with eerie echoes of another time, 1945, the year of Hitlers Gtterdmmerung and the artists birth. Turning the gallery into a haunted bunker or U-boat, laden with the beds of dying heroes, Kiefer makes history new and horrible.
Then you discover his stupendous paintings that defy the difference between two and three dimensions. This is 21st-century art at its most pungent, shocking and valuable.

07.William Kentridge Whitechapel Gallery, London
History is a chaos of ever-changing images for Kentridge. Defining moments of the modern era haunt this compelling exhibition of film and video enflamed by his flickering sketches, and staged in playfully sculptural setups. Einsteins theory of relativity, the Russian revolution, the birth of dada at the Cabaret Voltaire and Mlis early film masterpiece A Voyage to the Moon are among the ghosts of modern times that haunt this comic and serious art. Kentridge himself is historys witness and helpless, hapless clown, appearing in these films as an ageing melancholic artist who could easily be the central character in a Paolo Sorrentino movie. His art is as suggestive and ambitious as an epic novel by a 21st-century Thomas Mann.
08.South Africa: Art of a Nation
British Museum, London
William Kentridge is one of the modern South Africans whose art is seen against a staggering historical and prehistorical epic landscape in this survey of three million years of art. Really.
The oldest work here, a found portrait, was picked up by an early human ancestor that long ago. Actually, its a pebble shaped like a face. Call that art Well, art here means not just creativity, but things that help people to live and struggle.
Spears and anti-apartheid badges tell as much about the anguished history of South Africa as masks and paintings do.
And yet, it includes a San rock painting that is among the greatest artistic masterpieces you will ever see.

09.Georgiana Houghton: Spirit Drawings Courtauld Gallery, London
Id never heard of this Victorian medium before the Courtauld Gallery put on a dazzling display of her paintings. Houghton believed the spirits of dead artists, including Titian, guided her hand to create her swirling spirit drawings. If so they must have seen into the future, for her mesmerising vortices of pure colour anticipate 20th-century abstract art. The definitive abstract artists Kandinsky and Mondrian would both see their art as spiritual. Houghton takes that idea even more literally than they did. These are ghost paintings, if you like  or in modern eyes, the brilliant works of a woman whose creativity was liberated by her identity as a medium. How many more Victorian women artists are waiting to be discovered in the archives of spiritualists and old botany journals

10.The Scottish Endarkenment
Various venues, Edinburgh
I loved this gothic romp through modern Scottish art that managed to put todays feted artists, including Douglas Gordon and Christine Borland, alongside sculpture and painting going right back to 1945, on the provocative basis that they all share a taste for the dark stuff.
The city of Burke and Hare and Robert Louis Stevenson is full of evidence of Scotlands cultural obsession with evil and madness. Here, close to the atmospheric depths of Edinburghs Old Town, Gordon turned himself into a monster with Sellotape, Borland spookily filmed a robot baby, and the late great Ian Hamilton Finley mused disconcertingly on the god Pans connection with Panzer tanks. Unreasonably good fun.

AVIC Astoria unveils first tower
AVIC International Hotels Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and a Global 500 company recently launched AVIC Astorias Tower 1 to the public at an event which took place on December 21.
Chief Representative of CATIC Sri Lanka, Zhuang Lizhou commented about the status quo about the real estate sector in Sri Lanka and said, I encourage clients and prospective home owners to grab this opportunity and own a prestigious property in what will be one of Colombos best city locations. Considering growing demands for luxurious living spaces in Sri Lankas capital, I believe the future is bright for Sri Lanka. AVIC Astoria will be the hottest living spot in Colombo.
AVIC Astoria is aspired to be the most unique condominium project that has been introduced into Sri Lanka and has been scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017.
Apart from the fact that the investment in Sri Lanka will not only come in the form of a set of condominiums but will also include state-of-the-art and leading-edge technology being incorporated into the construction process of the Astoria.
A unique feature about the construction material that has been incorporated into the project has been the much hyped up and acknowledged aspect of aluminum formwork which would be the very first time this would have been utilized into a construction project in Sri Lanka. The use of the formwork helps in a quicker rise of the skyscraper, and the Astoria Condominiums will almost equilibrate the height of the World Trade Centre in Colombo Fort.
Tower One is currently ongoing and prospective homeowners will receive the opportunity to own a property overlooking a grand view of the sea. During the launch, an announcement was also made for potential clients about the availability of a mock apartment that has been arranged for display purposes at the AVIC Astoria office located at Deal Place.

Finding Space
Paradise Road Galleries will be holding an exhibition by Kingsley Gunatillake titled Finding Space on January 5 from 6pm to 8pm at the Paradise Road Galleries.
Gunatillake states that everything seems to inspire him. Even bitter, depressive experiences have given me strength and shown me direction. You can take bitter-ness also as a taste, and then you will understand that taste is a very complex thing. So, I try to understand the complexity of small, mundane things through abstraction and in the abstract, he said.
Love, affection, sweet music, nature and wilderness, even window-shopping in the city, have inspired me. I think I have been affected and my art is shaped by associating and getting exposed to all kinds of other art forms, he added.

Lankan art at Kochi Biennale
T. Shanaathanan participated in the Kochi Biennale 2016 and the exhibition 'Insecurities: Tracing Displacement and Shelter' at MoMa New York, recently.
The art project attempts to map one of several histories of resistance during the 30 years of Sri Lankan civil war by presenting the memory of so called minor artists or non artists. By inquiring how these artists/individuals appropriated or relativised their art practices under the conditions they faced during the war such as economic embargos, displacements, lack of communication facilities and travel restrictions, this project aims to register the innovative and alternative inventions that intertwined with the experience of war.
The collection of nearly 30 individual memories and stories in the form of testimonies and drawings are exhibited in a library card cabinet. The cabinet, as a physical form, and conceptual imagining, connects to the colonial cabinet of curiosities that led to the development of museums and archives. By employing this particular method of collection and display, this work attempts to play with ideas of archive, memory and indexing in relation to their connection to object and object making.

## Title: Exciting year for real estate investment

Exciting year for real estate investment
This year promises to be an exciting year for real estate investment. With more and more developments popping up in the world's key emerging markets, the eyes are away from Europe and the US and onto countries such as Mexico, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
These countries not only offer a more appealing climate zone but also the potential of better returns for real estate investors says leading property portal Lamudi Lanka.
Property and plot prices are generally lower, as well as material and labour costs, buying you more bricks, mortar and space for your money, not to mention the potential for better returns.
Investing in real estate carries with it a certain amount of risk but has the potential to be very rewarding if investments are chosen wisely. A key starting point is to identify the aim of your investment. Are you looking for something that will provide short-term returns or are you in it for the long-haul Are you looking to buy to live, to re-sell quickly, to re-sell in the future or to rent out immediately As well as identifying the desired purpose of your investment, a further key ingredient for success is staying on top of the latest developments and trends within the real estate market.
Real Estate developments and trends for 2017
One of the biggest developments in 2017 will be the use of drone technology and virtual reality in real estate. It will enable estate agents to show properties to potential buyers, without the need to visit the property.
This will save time and money for all involved but as the investor, beware; there are many things not visible to the naked eye, such as structural damage, damp, mould, noises in the neighbourhood, unpleasant smells and so forth.
This year will also feel the ramifications of events such as the Brexit and US elections, which left the global markets shaken in 2016. The announcement that the US Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 0.25% also threatens to stall the market in 2017, which could have a slowing effect on potential property investment returns.
On the plus side, 2016 has seen a boom in the sharing economy, such as car sharing services, taxi sharing, AirbnB and office space sharing, a trend which we predict will continue into 2017.
The sharing economy is based on the concept that the full price of purchase is often too high for the majority, so one person buys and rents out, to capitalise on periods when services or spaces are typically not used. Its effect on the real estate market is apparent, with more people buying to rent out easily through online platforms but be aware, there are little regulations on such free sharing and countries differ on their regulations regarding these services. It has also had an effect on real estate prices, in some areas leading to a superficial increase in property prices.
Identifying the key markets in 2017
Mexico City is an example of where rental and property prices have increased significantly in the last years, as many local entrepreneurs as well as foreign investors buy up property to rent out in the short-term and sell on in the long-term. However, these markets still offer some great investment opportunities and when compared with property prices in Europe or the US, are still reasonably low.
A good indicator of a lucrative market, is a metro with reasonably high rental prices but comparatively low purchase prices.
These areas offer potentially profitable investments but it is important to also take into consideration the potential growth and changes in the area, in particular if the area is undergoing mass development.
It is also wise to look into the history of the area, such as ground conditions, water supplies, earthquake history, gang trouble and flood history. Lastly but equally important is to become familiar with taxes, insurance obligations and interest rates of the area or country in which you wish to invest.
Whether you are looking to buy to live, to sell or to rent, here are some key markets to look into for 2017.
The emerging markets
The Philippines - The residential property market in the Philippines performed extremely well in 2016, due to healthy economic growth and the trend looks to continue into 2017, making it a lucrative market for potential property investors. According to the BSP National Bank, the real estate index rose by 9.2% nationwide in Q1 2016.
However there were emerging trends that the CBDs of Metro Manila were experiencing a slow in property prices, with some areas, such as Fort Bonifcio, increasing by just 2.6% compared with the National Capital Region (NCR) which experienced an overall increase of 9.7% and Areas Outside the NCR performing equally well, with an overall increase of 9.4% in Q1 2016.
Further Notes: If you are a foreign investor, it is important to note that foreigners cannot buy land in the Philippines, only lease it for up to 50 years, renewable for a further 25 years. It is however, possible to buy a house, as well as apartments and condos. In the case of apartments and condos in high rise buildings, foreign investment is capped at a proportion of 40% of the building.
Pakistan - Pakistan is another real estate market that has been steadily growing over the past few years.
Many developments that had been stuck in the planning stages for the past decade are now coming to fruition, putting some attractive housing on the market for the country's entrepreneurs and young business professionals. It also has a string of fresh architectural talent rising through the ranks, offering potential homeowners the ability to design and realise the house of their dreams.
One of the perks of buying property in Pakistan is that the buying costs are relatively low. It is often the hidden taxes that can sting a property investor. In Pakistan however, the buyer pays only around 8% of costs, which include Capital Value Tax, Stamp Duty, Registration
Fee and property transfer tax
Mexico - Property in Mexico remains a lucrative investment, with housing prices showing a rise of 6.38% during the year to Q2 2015. The Peso is currently weak but in comparison, the Dollar is strong, leading to much investment from abroad, in particular in the resort communities, according to the International Consortium of Real Estate Associations (ICREA). The country's capital, Mexico City, has seen property and rental prices boom in the last years, as the city becomes a popular long-stay destination for foreign visitors. Areas such as San Rafael and Santa Maria are being quickly bought up by local entrepreneurs, as well as foreign investors and there remains a healthy demand for renting from local, as well as foreign visitors, making buying to rent, a lucrative investment, with moderate gross rental yields.
Further notes: For foreign individuals and nonresidents, there is a withholding tax of 25% on gross rental income, a tax which many have been avoiding through the use of online property rental sites. Whether 2017 will see a clampdown on this is uncertain.
Sri Lanka - Since the end of the civil war 7 years ago, the country's economy has boomed and with the election of President Maithripala Sirisena in January 2015, many Sri Lankans are returning to the country. There has also been a boom in the tourism industry, creating a new demand for hotels and apartments, along with significant investment in transport links, in particular in Colombo, tourist attractions and general services, as well as an increased feeling of safety for foreign visitors. Following this increase in demand to buy, build and rent, the country is attracting the attention of many foreign real estate investors, who see the potential for a lucrative investment.
The biggest house price increases were seen in four of the country's provinces. The biggest was in the Northern Province, which saw house prices soar by around 23.47%. This was followed by more modest increases in the Central Province (3.1%), Sabaragamuwa Province (2.9%), and Western Province, excluding Colombo (1.2%).
The US
Detroit - The city has gone through some rough and tough times in the last decade but offers potential investors a tidy return.
Houses for sale are in abundance, prices low and rent prices reasonable, with a good potential investment recoup rate within the first year.
Chicago - Not quite as lucrative as Detroit but house prices are still reasonably low, with a steady rental price, offering potentially good returns on buying rental properties. (A lamudi release)

Knowledge sharing sessions by Lanka Hospitals
Lanka Hospitals hosted Clinical Sessions 2016, a forum created for medical professionals to share and upgrade knowledge, develop a learning culture and maintain continuous education among the medical fraternity in the country.
It was organised to establish quality medical care to local and international patients seeking treatment in Sri Lankan healthcare entities.
Organizing Committee of Lanka Hospitals Clinical Sessions 2016
The inaugural Lanka Hospitals Clinical Sessions comprised well-known consultant doctors and consultant surgeons of all medical specialties, medical officers, nurses and healthcare employees of private and government healthcare entities/hospitals such as Nawaloka hospitals, Asiri Central Hospital, Durdans Hospital, Hemas Hospital (Wattala), Ninewells Hospital, Dr. Nevil Fernando Hospital, Sri Jayawardenpura Hospital, Browns hospital, New Delmon Hospital, Police and Army hospitals and Centre for Diabetes and Endocrynology and Western Infirmary.
As Sri Lankan medical professionals are living in a globalized world where medical technology is rapidly evolving, we at Lanka Hospitals recognized the timely intervention to bring together the clinical fraternity where knowledge can be exchanged and uplifted for the ultimate benefit of the patients we all serve. Although there are many such activities carried out by the government medical authorities, this is the first time in Sri Lanka that a private healthcare entity stepped in with an effort to elevate service quality and patient care as a public service, said Director Medical Service, Lanka Hospitals, Dr. Erasha Fernando.
Lanka Hospitals hopes that through initiatives like the clinical sessions, the standard of medical care available across the country will improve considerably and Sri Lanka will be seen as a medical destination of repute internationally as well.

## Title: High demand for applied statisticians in the world

High demand for applied statisticians in the world
There has been a huge demand for Applied Statisticians in the world, specially in developed countries like the USA and Sri Lanka too should follow this trend said, Prof.Sarath Peiris, Fellow of the Institute of Applied Statistics Sri Lanka (IASSL), Professor in Applied Statistics and Head of the Mathematics Department of the Engineering Faculty of the Moratuwa University.
The availability of massive quantities of data coupled with enormous increase in computation power for relatively low cost has led to the creation of a whole new activity called, data mining, data science, big data analysis.
I think that the data revolution has been started.These data sets are complex and need to discover their hidden properties.
Some statisticians have stated that the sexy job in future will be the Applied Statistician and data analysis and communicate the results going to be an important skill in the next few decades.
Applied Statisticians should be excited and need to play an important role in such data. Statistical techniques are not data mining explicity, but they were being used long before the term data mining, data science were coined to apply to business applications.
From the users' perspective, it will be faced with a conscious choice when solving a data mining problem as to whether to attack it with statistical data mining methods or other data mining techniques.
Almost all methods used in data mining, data science, big data analysis are related to methods developed in statistics. Therefore applied statisticians have a major role to play in data science or big data analysis.
Peiris stressed that computer science experts cannot handle those data without the guidance of applied statisticians.
Due to the electronic world, billions of transactions are carried out daily in many organisations and such data are accumulating in very large data bases under data structures. How to handle data, which pattern can be found in data, what do they mean for others, how can data be looked at,
what methods can be used, are the main expectations from applied statisticians.
In Sri Lanka data science, data mining, are dominated by computer science experts, but my idea is that it is not a good trend. The applied statisticians must get involved in these problems.
Most government departments, private organisations and agencies hire applied statisticians to evaluate population, demographic and economic measurements. Many other environmental, scientific and agricultural agencies hire applied statisticians for similar type of work in their
respective fields. In Sri Lanka almost all the government departments should have a statistical unit with an experienced applied statistician. All government hospitals should recruit an applied statistician.
The United Nations has now declared 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by replacing 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) from January 2016. The 17 SDGs have 169 targets to be achieved by 2030.
We do not have sufficient data or a proper mechanism to collect the necessary data and as a result there will be plenty of data gaps in computation such as targets.Thus Applied Statisticians should be excited and ready to play an important role in developing new SDGs.
Demand areas
Commenting on some of the demand areas for Applied Statisticians he pointed out that big data can arise in all fields and from a big data analysis point of view applied statisticians are required in almost all fields.
Nevertheless, statistics are an essential part in medical science and it provides generalisation for the public to better understand their risks for different diseases. Applied statisticians in the pharmaceutical companies are the key players in drug development procedure in the developed
countries such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) procedure is totally handled by applied statisticians.
However, in Sri Lanka such statistical procedures are not practiced even though we produce some drugs.
There are massive data in the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), which have not been utilised effectively.
I suggest once again that DCS should establish a Statistical Research unit with experienced Applied Statisticians. The Applied Statisticians can produce marvellous information from such data which should correctly conveyed to the decision makers.
What is statistics In this world, everything is relative and nothing is absolute, but varying. No phenomenon can be explained perfectly. Statistics is the only subject which teaches us how to deal the variability in a scientificmanner. That is why statistics has been included as a course module/s in all degree programs in universities. The two important entities in statistics are population and sample. The statistics are generated from a sample which is drawn from a particular population. For example, mean time to recover from a drug. These statistics generated from a sample have wealth of information. I would say those statistics are valuable and beautiful. IASSL set up to support statisticians In 1999 fifteen statisticians including myself formed the Association of Applied Statistics Sri Lanka. (IASSL) The first meeting was held in the PGIA, University of Peradeniya. This has been incorporated by an Act of Parliament. We have about 400 members now. IASSL, the only professional organisation committed to promote and to assist the advancement of statistics for the furtherance of research,planning, development, education and training in Sri Lanka was set up. This was followed up with an Award of Fellowship in 2012 and the first fellowship was awarded went to Prof. R O Thattil, Emeritus Professor in Biometry at the University of Peradeniya. Since then another three fellowships were awarded. The selected nominee must have an established reputation; published papers, significant contribution to Applied Statistics and the IASSL. Asked how he could help engineering students to learn statistical skills he said that teaching statistics is a challenging task. It is much easier to teach theory of statistics to engineering students as they have a good mathematical background. The challenge is to statistical concepts and use of statistics to solve problems. I use various examples depending on the applications in particularly the engineering applications and explain the statistical interpretation. Students are advised about statistical thinking on how to learn about the clients problem and how to meet the clients requirements and interests. Students are advised to write a concise summary on the analysis without dominating technical details so that conclusions can be understood without statistical knowledge. Furthermore, we have initiated statistical advisory services for the university community. Steps to popularise Applied Statistics Most of the non-statisticians can easily handle statistical software because software has made so easy to use. But without a clear idea on the statistical concept the outputs generated from software cannot be interpreted. To understand the concept correctly you need to understand the theories in statistics in a simple manner, but study and proof of theorems is not required. Furthermore, there are many non-statistics graduates who want to enhance their knowledge in applied statistics. In order to fill this gap, I have started a Post Graduate Diploma and Master of Science in Business Statistics in 2010 in the University of Moratuwa. This course is open for any graduates who have done some statistics courses. We teach statistics theory and practicals at the same time and the students have more opportunities to analyse real data using statistical software. Furthermore, I used to conduct various training courses on data analysis from time to time at the IASSL. Advice for applied statisticians If one wants to be Applied Statistician they should be able to (i) understand theoretical aspect in statistics, (ii) understand statistical concepts correctly, (iii) look at data and its quality extensively , (iv) formulate the statistical problems, (iv) analyse data using correct statistical methods and (iv) summarise the findings in an effective manner. Prof. Sarath Peiris and old boy of Egodauyana Maha Vidyalaya and Moratu Maha Vidyalaya, Moratuwa and graduated in 1979 from the University of Colombo and later became a Statistician at the Coconut Research Institute (CRI), Lunuwila in 1980 and later became the Principal Statistician and Head of the Biometry Division. Later he joined the Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa and became the Professor in Applied Statistics in 2009. (SS)

Tsemach introduces the art of detailing with Chemical Guys
Tsemach Global Automotive, the detailing studio that revolutionised how one takes care of your vehicle recently introduced the world-renowned professional automotive detailing supplies brand Chemical Guys to Sri Lankan vehicle enthusiasts.
The state-of the-art product store was opened recently at Gregorys Road, Colombo 7.
Run by vehicle enthusiast and detailing promoter Ayesh Wickremasinghe, the store stocks a wide range of Chemical Guys car care products and professional detailing accessories. Being a hands-on kind of guy, Ayesh personally assists all his customers and makes recommendations based on the vehicle type, usage patterns and lifestyle of the driver/owner. Among some of the high profile clients (vehicles in this case!) that Ayesh services includes the likes of a Jaguar XJ, Mercedes S500e, Mercedes S400, Mercedes S300 and the American muscles such as the Cadillac Escalade, Dodge Challenger and Charger among many others. Speaking at the opening Wickremasinghe said what they provide is tailor-made vehicle services.
"Many have still not picked up on what detailing is all about and the importance of it for ones vehicle. With Tsemach and Chemical Guys we hope to revolutionise how people treat their vehicles, more like making it a life style.
Tsemach Global commenced operations in early 2016 as a detailing vehicle salon.
At the same time Ayesh began researching into vehicle detailing globally and stumbled on to an interesting website for Chemical Guys, a world-renowned brand for auto detailing.
Finding out that the founders of Chemical Guys shared his same passion for maintaining a vehicle and the process of care that goes in to it, Ayesh found himself in contact with Chemical Guys and early this year was invited to train with them.
The week long training programme was conducted by none other than the founder of Chemical Guys himself, Paul Schneider. As a result of the training, Ayesh is now the sole agent and distributor for Chemical Guys merchandise in Sri Lanka.
Speaking further Ayesh also notes, The ultimate goal for Tsemach and Chemical Guys is to create a culture where owners begin to value their vehicles and give them the right kind of treatment which in turn ensures longevity, a lifelong relationship with your vehicle, and a guaranteed higher resale value for those who wish to upgrade their drive with the times.
Over the last two years that Tsemach has been in operation much of Ayeshs loyal clientele has expanded via word of mouth.
A happy customer is as good marketing as you can ask for especially in a small city like Colombo.
Word travels so fast and as long as consistency and quality is maintained people keep coming back. This is what has worked for Tsemach.

Establishment of National science technology and innovation coordinating authority 
The proposal made by Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha, to establish the above authority to facilitate the coordination of research and development activities administered by 21 line ministries and about 80 research institutions and research centres, with the view of gaining the maximum outcome of investments made on science, technology and innovation for the socio-economic development, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Proposed national elderly health policy and strategies
Increase in elder population due to increase of expected lifetime and decrease in childbirths is a timely issue faced by Sri Lanka. It is expected that elder population over 60 years of age which is currently 12% will increase to 16% in 2020 and to 29% in 2050. It is essential to properly direct the elderly healthcare services to face this situation. Accordingly, the National Elderly Health Policy presented by Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
National policy on health information
When essential health services, prevention and treatment services are provided by government hospitals diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of outcomes, administrative decisions, planning and supervision should be duly performed. Availability of an accurate, reliable and easily accessible, cost effective information system is very helpful in this regard. The health information system in Sri Lanka is mainly consisted of government related information and information of private healthcare providers will be added in the future. Moreover, the existing paper based method of obtaining data should be improved with modern information technology. Accordingly, the National Policy on Health Information prepared according to national health services policy and presented by Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Development of infrastructures at University of Vocational Technology, Ratmalana 
About 1,600 students are reading for the Bachelor of Technology degree in the above university and applicants are increasing gradually for this course.

It has been proposed to upgrade this institution to a degree offering institution with the association of Lovely Professional University in Punjab, India for developing capabilities of students to face the competition in the job market. Accordingly, the proposal made by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the Sri Lanka Institute of Textile and Apparel and Lovely Professional University in Punjab, India, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Development of Sri Arahantha Maliyadewa Raja Maha Vihara in Vattarama 
The proposal made by Buddha Sasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to allocate additional funds of Rs. 35 million to complete development of the sacred place of Sri Arahantha Maliyadewa Raja Maha Vihara in Vattarama, in the Galigamuwa Divisional Secretary's Division in Kegalle District where the public Vesak Festival in 2017 is to be held, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Recommendations of the Cabinet Subcommittee on proposed registration of electors (special Provisions) bill 
Implementation of the Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Act No. 27 of 2013 has terminated on June 19, 2015 which provided for securing the voting rights of displaced persons who dwell in temporary settlements due to conflict situations in the northern part of the country. Accordingly, the proposal made by Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to publish the proposed Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) bill in gazette and subsequently present in parliament for approval which was prepared according to the recommendations of the above Cabinet Subcommittee to extend its validity period for further 04 years, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Rehabilitation of the Elphinstone Theatre
The Elphinstone Theatre which was constructed in 1925 and acquired by the government in 1988 is currently administrated by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation. It is currently being rehabilitated with a seating capacity of 600 and it will be opened for public within the first quarter of 2017. The proposal made by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, to obtain required additional allocations to complete its renovations, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Construction of Value Addition Centres for vegetable and fruits in Sri Lanka 
The government has taken steps to facilitate local farmers and entrepreneurs to export vegetables and fruits targeting foreign market to conform to standards and requirements of foreign countries. Accordingly, the proposal made by Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, to establish 03 Value Addition Centres adjacent to farms with public-private partnership with processing, packing and storing facilities, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Reconstruct the commuter shelters
With the development of the A6 road, 15 commuter shelters which were erected between Dambulla and Galewela were removed by the Road Development Authority causing inconveniences to the public.
Part of these shelters were set up to commemorate the fallen war heroes by their relatives during the war.
Relatives of the war heroes charged that by removing these shelters erected, the authorities have disrespected these fallen war heroes who sacrificed their lives to protect the sovereignty of the country.
However, due to the removal of these shelters, commuters waiting for buses are facing many difficulties.
They urge the government to reconstruct these commuter shelters in suitable places along this road.

Record income for CAA nabbing errant traders
Officials attached to the Southern Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority have collected a record income of over Rs. 679,000 from errant traders as court fines in sudden raids and mobile inspections conducted in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts during December last year.
According to investigation officials the total number of raids done in the Southern region during the same period was 264. Errant traders were prosecuted in Magistrates courts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts. Charges framed against them were sale and display of food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling food stuff which were decayed and eaten by rats and insects, altering set prices on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sale of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags and violating rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority. Complaints on frauds, malpractices and corruptions committed by unscrupulous traders are being received by the Authority daily.
The CAA has increased sudden raids and mobile inspections against fraudulent traders, investigation officials said.
Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being conducted by the Authority for school children, members of voluntary organizations, people and also the trading community.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, CAA investigation officers are conducting raids and inspections throughout the Southern region.

BIA expansion
The resurfacing of the sole runway at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA, IATA code CMB) which begins tomorrow was a long overdue measure. It was last repaired in 1986, exactly 30 years ago and in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) safety regulations, would have been safe for airliners only for one more year.
This measure will result in a temporary loss of revenue for Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited and SriLankan Airlines, in the form of flights and ground handling services for the period of closure  flights will take off and land only from 4.30 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. until April 6. However, we are told that many reputed airlines are literally waiting in the wings to start flights to Colombo once the runway overlay is complete. One prime example is Silk Air of Singapore, which will fly to Colombo for the first time just two days after the project is completed (April 8). This will benefit the airport and the tourism industry in the long run.
This is just one part of the massive US$ 400 million expansion project planned for the BIA in partnership with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which has helped the BIA on many earlier occasions. BIA, which was designed for just 6 million passengers annually, is already bursting at the seams with more than 8.5 million passengers. The expansion project that includes new international and domestic terminals, with facilities for the Airbus A380, will double the capacity to 15 million passengers. Furthermore, the terminal, to be opened in 2020, would use solar energy and recycled water from a sewage plant for the flushing of toilets. The project would be developed based on the concept of (an) eco-airport with Japanese advanced technology and know-how.
This is essential in the light of increasing tourist numbers. Just a few years ago, two million tourists a year seemed to be an impossible target but Sri Lanka will be able to surpass that number this year. The new target is four million arrivals per year. There should be more airline seats into Colombo to make this goal a reality. There are two ways in which this can happen  increased frequencies by existing operators (SriLankan, Emirates, Jet etc.) and new flights by all-new/resumed operators (Silk Air, Gulf Air etc.).
The losses incurred by the runway closure could have been mitigated if we had a second runway at the BIA. This has been discussed for decades, but political, logistical and environmental concerns have kept it on the drawing board. However, the Government should explore this possibility even now. Another option is to expand the Ratmalana Airport (IATA code RML)  again, there are similar considerations. Most cities, even in developing countries, are opting to have two or more airports as passenger numbers increase  Dubai, Manila and Bangkok have two, London has four and so does Moscow.
One may ask why Mattala (Hambantota Rajapaksa International Airport, IATA code HRI) does not come into this picture. Indeed, the authorities had requested airlines to use Mattala in the interim period and the response was a resounding no. It is easy to understand why  the Mattala Airport has a wrong runway orientation, there is no taxiway, bird strikes are possible and connectivity options to Colombo are still minimal. It is an airport built in the middle of nowhere. The money spent on Mattala, a staggering US$ 200 million, could have been spent on expanding Palaly into an international airport. Sri Lanka does need a second airport outside Colombo and Palaly is easily the most promising candidate, followed by Trincomalee.
Now that we are saddled with Mattala, the Government has opted for the next best option of making it viable again. In addition to enticing airlines to fly to Mattala, the authorities seek to promote it as Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) destination as well as a flight training centre. The idea is that Mattala will work as part of logistics chain linking the Hambantota Port and the proposed Hambantota Investment Zone. The extension of the expressway to Mattala and other road transport links will also lend more credibility to Mattala which can also be used as a domestic airport.
Sadly, very little attention has been paid to domestic flights in this country. Many developing countries that are much smaller than Sri Lanka have several domestic airlines offering inexpensive fares. That is a must to spur tourism, because many tourists do not have the time to spend 8-9 hours on the road. Moreover, many Sri Lankans will also opt to fly if the fares are reasonable enough. In neighbouring India, a one-way ticket from Chennai to Bengalaru (roughly the same distance from Colombo to Jaffna) costs around Sri Lankan Rs.10,000. If we have a few short-haul, sub-100 passenger aircraft a good domestic service can be launched after upgrading our airports. The authorities must give serious thought to this too to develop the countrys aviation sector which will receive an overall boost from the massive BIA development drive.

Test of strength
There is never a dull moment in the theatre of Sri Lankan politics, or so it seems, as the government and the opposition continue to lock horns with both camps set for renewed battles in the New Year.
Several interesting developments dominated the political landscape over the past few days, notwithstanding the holiday season. Interestingly, they all appeared to relate to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) camp.
Among the more intriguing developments was the resignation of Piyankara Jayaratne as State Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils. Jayaratne claimed he found it difficult to work in a government in coalition with the United National Party (UNP).
Jayaratne hails from a political family in Chilaw and it is no surprise that he is a staunch SLFPer. His father, S. D. R. Jayaratne also served as a parliamentarian and ended his political career as Minister of Fisheries in the government of Sirima Bandaranaike.
Piyankara Jayaratne himself is no novice to national politics, first entering Parliament in 2000 and also serving as Deputy Speaker from 2008 to 2010 in the government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Following his resignation, Jayaratne was to declare that some SLFP MPs who are holding Ministerial and State Ministerial posts in the Unity Government were planning to resign their portfolios. Elaborating further, he said that three of these ministers were from the Galle, Matale and Gampaha districts. He said that accusations made by some UNP ministers led them to take this decision.
Jayaratnes predictions
Jayaratnes predictions are yet to become a reality but his resignation has certainly led to speculation that there is more to it than meets the eye. The big question in political circles was whether Jayaratnes resignation was his individual decision or whether it was a move orchestrated in conjunction with the Joint Opposition (JO) to test its strength.
Aiding and abetting this speculation was a pronouncement by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Since his defeat at the presidential election two years ago, Rajapaksa, though frequently entertaining the media with voice cuts whenever he attends a public event, has not been keen to hold formal press briefings.
Recently though, he met with foreign correspondents and elaborated on his political strategies, earmarking 2017 as the year when the government would be toppled. Much was made of the fact that hoppers- the famous meal he shared with President Maithripala Sirisena before the latter defected from the SLFP- were served at the briefing but more serious matters were also discussed.
Though Rajapaksa was expressing thoughts of toppling the government, it was pointed out that the Constitution precludes a premature dissolution of Parliament or an early presidential election. Rajapaksa countered this by saying he was willing to serve as Prime Minister under President Sirisena. It was the first time he had given such an undertaking. Even though it is said that politics is the art of the possible, this is wishful thinking right now. The UNP-SLFP combine presently commands a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The UNP by itself has 106 seats in the legislature while the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) commands only 95 seats.
Enjoying privileges of ministerial office
Any plans to make Rajapaksa Prime Minister would mean that he would need to muster the support of the majority of parliamentarians- at least 113. Even if the UPFA supported him en masse, it would still need to find 18 parliamentarians from other parties to endorse Rajapaksa. With 22 of the 24 seats held by other parties being from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), this is almost impossible.
That leaves Rajapaksa with the prospect of finding 18 parliamentarians from the UNP to support him. Although he has been a past master at wooing MPs from the opposition and engineering their defections, that was when he was in power and called all the shots.
Now a mere backbench MP, Rajapaksa does not have the pulling power to entice all the SLFPers into his camp, let alone seducing UNPers into joining him. Parliamentarians from the UNP are in office after a long lapse of more than two decades- barring a brief interlude in 2001- and are quite content with their lot, most of them enjoying the perks and privileges of ministerial office.
With politics being all about arithmetic and getting the required numbers, Rajapaksas claims of toppling the government in 2017 appears to be wishful thinking, even if a minister or two were to resign.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said as much. He was to respond to Rajapaksas remarks saying that he would be in Switzerland soon and that Rajapaksa was welcome to try his hand at toppling the government then.
Very much the elder statesman in the current Parliament, Wickremesinghe would not have uttered those words lightly, having undergone a similar experience before: in November 2003, then President Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three ministers- Defence Minister Tilak Marapone, Interior Minister John Ameratunge and Information Minister Imtiaz Bakeer Markar- while Wickremesinghe was on an official visit to the United States.
Adding even more controversy to the political events of the week was the decision by Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Mustapha to refuse accepting the report of the Delimitation Committee for Local Government elections, on the grounds that it had not been signed by two members of the committee. There was indeed some drama attached to the issue.
Ministers refusal
A press conference was organised at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry and the media informed that Chairman of the Delimitation Committee and former Commissioner-General of Lands Ashoka Peiris would hand over the report to Minister Mustapha then.
However, at the given time, Minister Mustapha refused to accept the report, adding that he would have to look into the legal provisions of accepting the report without the signature of two members in a five member committee. It was reported that the UNPs A.S.M. Misbar and the UPFAs Saliya Matthew had not signed the report at the time.
Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris however contradicted the statement made by the Minister, saying that the report can be accepted if it has been signed by a majority in the Committee. The Ministers refusal could have been prompted by earlier remarks of Committee Chairman Peiris who had taken the unusual step of criticising the minister publicly in an interview with a weekend newspaper, alleging that he received little support in his work.
The matter is however likely to be a storm in a tea cup: a fourth signature has reportedly now been obtained and it would only be a matter of time before the report progresses to the next stage when Local Government election can be called.
Amidst all this controversy, the end of the last year also saw the departure of a onetime political heavy weight, former Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake. Wickremanayake was known as a loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and it was to him that she turned to when her mother Sirima Bandaranaike had to step down from the Premiership due to ill health in 2000.
However, Wickremanayakes integrity and loyalty to the SLFP came to the fore five years later when Mahinda Rajapaksa, by then at loggerheads with Kumaratunga, entrusted him with the same job which he held for the next five years.
His tenure may have been a low profile one, but it was bereft of scandal as well and he was reputed as incorruptible over five decades of public life- a plaudit that few politicians of the present era can boast of. His demise robs the country of one of its most senior politicians as well, having entered Parliament way back in 1960.
As the old guard makes way for the next generation and the New Year dawns bringing the curtain down on 2016, the year 2017 will surely generate more political heat- although it may not in the manner predicted by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa!

UNPROTECTED RAILWAY CROSSING
It is a surprise to us that there isnt a protective device at the point of crossing the railway near Mulgampola. As a result, there are possibilities of dangers for the people who frequently pass that way to visit the Keels Food complex situated on the lower road of Kandy. It is shocking to hear that once there occurred an accident at the unprotected railway crossing. Why is the Government heedless of this unsafe crossing while the next point of crossing is fully protected
Nowadays, the media focuses upon the frequent occurrences of accidents from motor cars and buses as well as trains in various parts of the country. Then why are the authorities not taking preventive measures in order to reduce the rate of such accidents in future. The loss of life due to lack of proper government measures cannot be justified at all. It is the bounden duty of the rulers to protect the precious lives of citizens by taking special care and caution in facilitating the people to live safely and comfortably.

The Laws delays: causes and remedies
[Point of View]
Part II
Continued from yesterday
Melvin Silva an Advocate friend of mine who essentially practices in the outskirts of Chilaw and Marawila, told me that most land cases would disappear if Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance was repealed. By this section, we are increasing the number of cases filed in the District Court as Sri Lankan people are one of the most litigious people in the world. This is what Lord Cameron observed. Sri Lankan citizens would pay heavy fees in order to establish their property rights.
My friend told me that one would feel that any licensee (a person who occupies your property with your permission and approval on condition that he is willing to vacate the land when the owner requests him), would do so and that if he refuses to vacate the land, all you need to is to go to court and file an action. Then, within a matter of time you obtain a writ to eject him. But within no time, the owner realizes the long drawn out legal battle, the licensees claiming that he has been occupying the land for so many years, and the license was given not by the present owner, or owners but his ancestor in title, and the answer filed in the case would reveal that he was not the licensee but his grandparents and that he by uninterrupted occupation is entitled to the land. The Licensee would not only claim the Defence or Prescription either to the whole land or at least a portion of it and invariably, plead that he has caused improvements to the land and claim compensation. Thus, the landowner would invariably enter into litigation with the licensee who was allowed to occupy a house at the pleasure of the owner.
In order to counter the plea or prescription, the Plaintiff will have to get involved in Laws of Prescription such as presumption of ouster and counter presumption of ouster. Is this justice Where is justice to the owner who has on sympathetic grounds permitted his servant, his watcher to occupy his house and to look after his estate There are many instances where the unscrupulous trespasser, in a litigation, would assert that his ancestors had come into an agreement with the landlords ancestors who, according to him, had promised to give a portion of the land and plead prescription, for that portion of land. There have been many instances where the landlord is forced or coerced by the delay in litigation that he agrees to give the licensee a part of the land occupied by him.
Similarly, Section 66 of the Primary Courts Ordinance protects the trespassers. When a trespasser discreetly breaks the boundary fence of another and uses the gap he illegally created to proceed to his house, and when the owner having discovered the indiscretion of his neighbour and mends his fence, the trespasser files an action under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Ordinance, and the court will invariably permit the trespasser to use the path, which according to evidence, could easily be established as having being used for two months. Being frustrated by the order of the Primary Court, the owner files action in the District Court, requesting the District Court that he be entitled to his land free from any servitude, the trespasser will plead prescription and the matter will most probably end in the Supreme Court thus preventing the landlord from repairing his fence. If eventually the landlord is granted his prayer only his grandchildren or his children would be able to enjoy the fruits of the land.
Illegal or unlawful acts
Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, has that whatever the movable intentions of the legislature was at that time, today, it would appear the law of prescription is intended to grant legal rights to persons to commit illegal or unlawful acts in respect of other peoples property. Therefore, the Law of Prescription in relation to land litigation, whether it is ejectment, boundary definitions, servitudes or partitions should be removed. Large volumes of land cases pending in courts will disappear from the role and the people will greatly benefit. We believe that if new laws are introduced to recover the possession of his land, where the person needs only to prove his title, and a law similar to the recovery of possession of State property or having boundaries defined by means of a commission, issued to the Surveyor and the Courts determine the boundary or the co-owner being able to have his co-owned land, partitioned without the harassment brought about by the Prescription Law, the people would be served better.
The Civil Procedure Code should either be repealed with a new code or it must be amended to permit pre-trial proceedings to be incorporated. The Plaintiff should be asked to file, with his plaint, all documents, including evidence of witnesses by way of Affidavits. Then the Defendants should be given copies with the dossier filed in Court by Plaintiff so that the Defendant would be in a position to file his answer and his cross claim, in the form of supporting documents and evidence by Affidavits. Similarly, replication would follow the same procedure. Thereafter the issues would be claimed and the roll judge, before whom these documents are filed, will narrow the issues and permit only a few witnesses to be subjected to cross examination. All documents, whether they are photocopies or machine copies, should not be objected to, unless one-side claims they are forgeries or the impossibility of proving the authority of the documents. If such objectionable documents are to be proved to be genuine or the objections are vexatious, a heavy penalty should be taken against the person who has taken such objections.
The Pre-Trial Judge ought to be a senior judge, quite conversant with the procedure and should endeavour to settle the matter, as he is privy to the information and to the issues that have been raised by all parties.
All objections are taken by parties on what we construe to be an archaic, anchoretic called the Evidence Ordinance and then whatever ruling that a judge takes, objection made purely to delay proceedings should not be permitted. When a judge makes an order on whatever grounds, and if the order is wrong in law, then proceedings must take place irrespective of the objections and conclusions a judge may be asked to deal with it, so that there will not be numerous appeals but only one appeal on all objections.
A few days ago, I was in the High Court, where the main prosecution witness had failed to attend Court on a number of occasions. The Prosecution had informed Court on the previous day that the case cannot proceed without the witness and after postponing the case for several days, the Court fixed the case finally to be disposed on the next date. The witness was absent again and the Court was unable to discharge the Accused even if the Court is satisfied that the Witness cannot be apprehended or brought before Court, to proceed without the evidence of the witness being led. Though there is provision in the Magistrates Courts to discharge an accused, if the Prosecution is unable to proceed with the case. This discharge is not final. The Prosecution, within one year, could bring a fresh claim or open the case if the witness is available. Similar provisions must be brought into the procedure in the High Court.
Similarly, if the Accused cannot be apprehended, there is provision for the Attorney General to file indictment and proceed with the case and even convict the Accused in absentia. Prabhakaran could not be apprehended nor could summons be served on him. Yet the Attorney General filed indictment against him and he was convicted and sentenced to jail. But in the Magistrate Court only a B Report could be filed and warrants be issued to arrest him, but no plaint could be filed against him. An immediate amendment to the Procedure Code should be brought in to permit the police to file a plaint against the absent accused and convict him in absentia.
Plight of a State Counsel
One of the important reasons for the delays is the Attorney Generals Department, which is presently overburdened with work. The plight of a State Counsel could never be understood by a member of the Private Bar. Everyday a State Counsel, prosecuting in the High Court, will have to get ready for at least 5 or 6 cases. Thereafter, in the evening he will not only have to get ready for the next days trial, but also study thoroughly the briefs sent to him by the office to make recommendations whether indictment should be filed or not. Every Friday, a Sate Counsel has to travel to Colombo and inform his superiors the progress of cases submitted to him for a ruling. This is a herculean task; no reasonably prudent man would expect the State Counsel to concentrate on cases without eating, sleeping or drinking and earning a well deserved rest, and make just orders after carefully analyzing and evaluating the facts and the law. Therefore, one way out of this is to decentralize the Attorney Generals Department and recruit more competent members so that every judicial zone or district could be under a Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) and 3 or 4 police stations should come under the supervision of a Senior State Counsel like the District Attorney System in the USA.
Similarly, when a large haul of narcotics is taken into custody, it takes a long time for the Government Analyst to submit a report on the actual quantity. Like in the Fingerprint Department, if the Government Analyst could be strengthened with modern equipment to enable them to be summoned to the spot and analyse the sample before the Accused and the Investigation Officer. His report could be obtained immediately, there should be an amendment which would be admissible in court.
Similarly, all offences that could be compounded should be referred to the Mediation Board and the Mediation Board must be given additional teeth to summon parties to the Mediation Board and if they fail, to issue warrants to have them produced before the Mediation Board. Today, though a large number of cases are settled at the Mediation Board, yet a fair number of cases that are referred by Court are sent back to Court, as parties are advised by unscrupulous intermediaries not to go before the Mediation Board.
Finally, I would like to summarize the points raised by me to minimize the Laws Delays in our country, which I believe is a crime committed against humanity and Democracy, which might lead to the alternative:
1. Repeal or Amend the Civil Procedure Code;
2. Bring back the pre-trial procedure where parties are compelled to file their plaint and
1. the pre-trial should be a complete package where the parties are compelled to file all the documents and evidence by way of an Affidavit.
2. and the Registrar should be a Senior Judge who will endeavour to bring about a settlement.
3. only highly contentions matters should be brought before a trial judge.
4. all objections taken by the Counsel, in the course of a trial, be addressed by the judge at the end of the trial. This would eliminate all unnecessary appeals in the midst of a trial or an inquiry.
3. Evidence Ordinance should to be amended to be permitted to lead secondary evidence of documents whether they are photocopies or machine copied, unless serious objections are taken by a party asserting that they are fake or forgeries and if they are proved to be otherwise, a heavy penalty should be imposed, on the person whose assertions is proved false.
4. Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance should be repealed;
5. A provision, which is equivalent to the State Land Recoveries Ordinance, should be brought into to operation to eject unlawful squatters, licensees and other trespassers who occupy others land.
6. The AGs Department be decentralized with a Deputy Solicitor General in charge of each District or Judicial Zone and a District Attorney be in charge of 4-5 police stations and investigations be conducted under his supervision. This will eliminate delays and corruption.
7. The Criminal Procedure Code be amended, to discharge an Accused if the Prosecution is unable to begin and conclude for want of witnesses.
8. Similarly, if the Suspect is absconding or had gone broad, the police be permitted to file a plaint and proceed to trial in absentia like in the High Court.
9. Mediation Board be strengthened, permitting an offence like grievous hurt, misappropriation and other offences with a monetary value of Rs.50,000/= or below be referred to the Mediation Board and the powers of the Mediation Board should be enhanced, so that the Chairman of the Mediation Board be issued with power to summon the parties or issue warrants to get them to come before the Mediation Board.
10. Debt Recovery Law be amended, so that the entire transaction, even running into Millions of Rupees be permitted to be recovered in the Magistrates Court.
11. Government Analysts Department be summoned, to places where heroin or drugs are detected, so that on the spot the Government Analysts Department could issue a certificate that it is Heroin or some other narcotic.
These are some random thoughts that came to my mind. Laws delays and the agony and the anxiety that litigants undergo is a crime. If these matters are not addressed, the people would lose faith in the entire judicial system. We must think out of the box. There may be various objections raised if these reforms are introduced, like most of the Members of the Bar Association were in the forefront in the abolition of AJL introduced by Felix Dias Bandaranaike. We, as juniors, supported this movement and we managed to re-introduce the Criminal Procedure Code with non-summary proceedings. But, the disaster had to be averted with an amendment to restrict the non-summary inquiry to record evidence of witnesses.
If there was a District Attorney, he would, with the concurrence of his Senior, file direct indictment in cases where there is tremendous interest among the public.
But, I believe that the most progressive suggestion was made by Nihal Jayamanne PC, when he said that in India, there is a very widely popular legal concept called the Advanced Decree, where parties to any contract go to Court and stipulate the conditions and the failure of any one of which is entitled to the other party, to obtain an advanced decree and enforce the contract. For example, any person who leases out his premises and on proof of non-payment of the lease rental, as stipulated in the contract, the advance decree, that has been obtained, could be enforced and the defaulter could be ejected.
Similarly, there are many instances where people enter into Mortgage Bonds and other contracts that could be enforced on default, as the parties would have obtained an advance decree, before they even entered into a contract.
Laws Delays have threatened our Institutions for a very long time and if no remedial action is taken it would result in people losing faith in the system and would resort to Kangaroo Courts for Swift Justice.

Donald Trump: Making the world safe for dictators
For 100 years, the United States has championed democracies around the world. Trump is about to undo this pillar of American security and decency.
On April 2, 1917, in the course of a speech asking Congress to declare war on Germany, Woodrow Wilson delivered one of the most resonant lines in the history of the presidency: The world must be made safe for democracy. A generation later, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill issued the Atlantic Charter, committing the World War II allies to protect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live. Since then, all U.S. presidents have insisted that Americas national security depends upon the spread of democracy and individual rights abroad.
National security team
But Donald Trump, who will take office on the centenary of Wilsons famous address, may be the first president since America became a world power who simply does not believe that. We should tremble for the consequences. The president-elects unstinting and often ugly attacks on journalists, critics, and political opponents show clearly enough his contempt for democratic norms. He has demonstrated zero regard for such principles of international law as the obligation to accept refugees, or to refrain from the use of torture. His interest in democratic rights abroad is even more negligible. The foreign leaders he has most consistently praised, including Russias Vladimir Putin, Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Egypts Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, are strongmen who put their critics in jail, and sometimes in the grave. Trump is already such a pal of Sisi that he was both willing and able to persuade him last week to drop a Security Council resolution condemning Israels ongoing settlement building.
Trump has now nominated or appointed the key members of his national security team. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis are retired generals, while Trumps choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is the chief executive of a giant oil company. Any of these three (and especially Mattis) may prove sympathetic to the Wilsonian claim, but their experience has taught them to pay far more attention to the military and economic strategy of foreign leaders than to the domestic political arrangements those men fostered. None of them may be prepared to hinder Trumps intuitive fondness perhaps envy is the right word  for dictators. This really would be something new in American life. Both the neocons who supported George W. Bushs Freedom Agenda and the advocates of Barack Obamas far more chastened rhetoric of long-term institution-building have much more in common with one another than with the coldly transactional mentality that may guide the Trump administration. As Henry Kissinger wrote in Diplomacy, we are all (except perhaps Kissinger himself) children of Wilson. All but the most hardened realists accept the premise that it is in the interests of the United States to shape a better life for people in other countries, even if they disagree about which instruments to use and how effective they are likely to be.
Virtues of democracy
Some skeptics of Americas self-assigned global mission of reform, like the diplomat-scholar George Kennan, have argued that the United States will serve its interests better by practicing democracy at home than by promoting it abroad. That may be so; but its not a proposition that a President Trump  with his nonchalance toward the First Amendment and his newfound devotion to the Second, as well as his steady promotion of crackpot theories and outright lies on Twitter  is likely to test.
In all likelihood, the United States in years to come will neither seek to incarnate nor to inculcate the virtues of democracy. - Foreign Policy

Saturns north pole basks in sunlight
US: NASAs Cassini spacecraft has captured a stunning image of Saturn, showing the whole northern region of the ringed planet bathed in sunlight.
The image from late 2016 obtained at a distance of about 1.2 million kilometres from Saturn shows a hexagon-shaped jet-stream which is fully illuminated.
The planet appears darker in regions where the cloud deck is lower, such the region interior to the hexagon, NASA said.
Mission experts on Saturns atmosphere are taking advantage of the season and Cassinis favourable viewing geometry to study this and other weather patterns as Saturns northern hemisphere approaches Summer solstice.
The view looks towards the sunlit side of the rings from about 51 degrees above the ring plane, according to NASA.
The image was taken with the Cassini spacecrafts wide-angle camera on September 9, last year using a spectral filter which preferentially admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centred at 728 nanometres. - PTI

Serena follows sister Venus to Auckland exit
Auckland: Serena Williams suffered a shock second-round defeat at the Auckland Classic Wednesday following her sister Venus's earlier withdrawal with an arm injury.
Top seeded Serena blamed the wind for a string of unforced errors in her first event after a four-month layoff as she was sent packing 6-4, 6-7 (7/3), 6-4 in a two-hour, 14-minute arm wrestle with world number 72 Madison Brengle.
"I'm trying to think of a word that's not obscene but that's pretty much how I played," Serena told reporters.
"I just couldn't get used to the wind. My opponent played in the exact same conditions so obviously she was used to it and her game was more suited to it but it was just really annoying me for whatever reason."
Second-seed Venus decided to quit after suffering a sore right arm during her struggle to a 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 first-round victory over 18-year-old New Zealander Jade Lewis playing in her first WTA tournament. Serena, playing in her first tournament since losing in the semi-finals of the US Open in September, was looking for a bold showing in Auckland, both to prepare for the Australian Open and to celebrate her New Year engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.After blaming rust for her sluggish first-round win over Pauline Parmentier on Tuesday, she succumbed in abject fashion a day later with a double fault on match point at 4-5 in the third set in the blustery conditions.
"I didn't hit any returns in the vicinity of the court," lamented Serena. "I've never returned like that in my life -- a little frustrating especially since I worked so hard in the offseason.
"I can take solace from the fact conditions won't be like this in Melbourne."
Brengle dropped her second service game but at 4-1 down reeled off five consecutive games to take the first set. In the second set she saved five set points before losing the tie break to Williams and in the final set she held her nerve as games went with serve until Williams double faulted on match point.
"Probably my least favourite conditions I've ever played in," said Serena. "I really abhorred the conditions. It was way too much for me. This is almost not a great opportunity to assess your game.
"At this rate at least I can get out of these conditions and get to somewhere better, some warm weather."
Brengle goes through to meet seventh seed Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals while Venus's withdrawal gifted Japanese teenager Naomi Osaka a berth in the final eight where she will play eighth-seed Croatian Ana Konjuh.
The 36-year-old Venus Williams had complained of "feeling old" after dropping her serve four times and serving eight double faults against Lewis who was half her age.
"The first match of the year is never perfect," she said after the match but before deciding to pull out... I'm just feeling old." AFP

Natural flair and living your skills!
Let me kick off this edition of our regular Thursday yards with a warm ...'hug-us maximus' to all rugby hearts for an inspired new season, infused with strength, wellness, belief and much natural instinct.
The island game has certainly provided its share of exception and amazement in round 1 ...but 2017 has been far more predictable with Havelocks, Navy and Kandy holding their rankings from 2016and tantalizingly with 40, 40, 39 - not a stat that will please either camp or coach at Havelock Park, Welisara or Nittawela
There has to be a sense of deliberate purpose and steely belief for Sean Wijesinghe to visualize the next few encounters ...starting with CR in Colombo this weekend.
I rather anticipate some cautious optimism in Kandy with Seans grasp on his team living up to expectations, especially given the quality and rugby pedigree of his wish-list squad that boasts more national caps than any other side. On paper it is an intimidating read to all rugby hearts and rival fans but that has not been the case with the opening rounds this Dialog season. Coach Sean would shudder for an instant and grab a few breaths at the unforgiving thought of another upset at their Nittawela cauldron of pain . Our experts and speculators will cautiously contemplate a flutter or two on the form, availability of specialists and current list of injuries. These are the apex that dictates, as to how the team responds under pressure, and are able to follow their game plan to its desired conclusion at full time.
The million dollar question will Kandy bounce back and have the combination to win the league championship Or will it be Havies or Navy writing their own history Naturally this contemplation, is the justified right of those rare species ...the self appointed experts. A little nudge will get them on the soapboxes, waxing lyrical about their game intel and why, so and so, cost Havies the game in Nittawela mortals like us, not 'game smart' enough to reiterate the facts and float amongst the players, big hand to them for their persistence, special mention for google, whats app. and other known search engines for having the content. All hail their versatility and social visibility!
So many have stepped up to the mark, but only few succeed at the highest, the pride of place in wearing the badge and upholding our traditions ....still a curious and wonderful fact . ..Great captains who have always been under pressure and managed to survive ...something we did for years without much fuss...lining up for the flag against the biggest and the best, travelling around Asia was particularly fun and some outrageous memories to boot. Saman Jayasinghe, Priyantha Ekanayake, Hisham Abdeen are 3 exceptionally talented and skilled players who never gave up when the odds were stacked against us. The pride to wear the white and green shirt with our SLRFU elephant will always be a handy reminder of those warrior days in the sun.
I did mention the start of the schools season Feb/March 2017 with the 7s and a chance for rivals and contenders, to size each other up during the tournament...will S Thomas' have the strength, stepping and petrol to go all the way...Isipathana will mark that card with much happiness, as well Science College, St Peters and the lions from Trinity. Royal with the home advantage will be expected to go all the way. Interestingly Sri Lankas juniors were outstanding and dominated the Asian 7s circuit. Big hand to the U18 and U20 7s teams for playing our island brand of rugby all the way to the Cup.
Does this automatically ensure a new environment and a repeat performance Not so, unless we learn, plan and studiously aim to replicate conditions and skill levels ...the sole responsibility of the governing body.
Rugby in Europe is all about the Feb kick-off of the RBS 6 Nations ...and how England is on such a winning streak. They ended the year on 13 straight wins and coach Jones understands the mental strength that has set England apart last year. NZ coach Hansen thinks England will break the All Blacks 18 straight winning streak and sketch their own history. A delightful prospect for one and all. Expect a storm all 80 mins with our gladiators in the middlebetween Ireland, France, England and possibly Scotland....well worth grabbing the wooly warmers and braving the crisp Feb winter air in Britain ...wonderful packages on offer by all the big tour operators here in; city by the sea...
There are varying schools of considerable thought about the skills and natural born players ...we have had the privilege of seeing during their peak, and against all the odds. The magical few who single-handed, turned games on its head with such scintillating ability that defied science and sliced defences with absolute disregard for man or reputation. The measure of such a being is not just playing here in Sri Lanka but also repeating that razor sharp reaction skill against Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Japan and Samoa ...and a remarkable appetite for scoring tries.
Hisham Panther Abdeen has certainly got genetics on his side and that rare quality to smell the try line from the half waythe privilege of playing against him at club and later together for Sri Lanka is forever etched in my mind.
He was a colossus amongst all players and certainly deserves his pride of space in the hall of fame there has not been a spark to match that command, and wonderful to see his HARFA Academy sharing skills and inspiring a new generation.
Let me wish all of you, (as I did at kickoff) an inspired new season ahead, makes it an exceptional one, with renewed vigour and determination to defy the odds ...bigger, better, faster, sharper!
Bula bula islanders and blessings to all rugby hearts in 2017.

Football in Kandy in the doldrums
Will this year be a good one for Kandys club football This is the question on every football fan's lips. There are plans, by some of the keen football lovers to help kick back football to its former glory days when Kandy produced top class players who went on to sport national colours. If that is to happen then it is essential that a new set of competent promoters should serve in the committee.
Today football in Kandy is in the doldrums, from 1988 to 2001 the sport flourished, but sad to say, the sport is now at a low ebb. Last years tournaments have sadly still not started.
If not for some schools games, there is hardly any football in Kandy. Thanks to the Central Province Education Department they held tournaments. Kandy today is finding it difficult to keep the game alive at club level. Football at club level is breathing its last or almost dead. The talent is there and the administrators should organize tournaments.
The Kandy Association Football League is 92 years old and some of the football lovers who served as officials and players have planned to celebrate it in a big way.
Though football has been played for over 150 years in Kandy, the KAFL was formed in 1925, and Kandy is one the founder members of the football governing body. A look back into Kandy football reveals that the sport in Kandy had its origins in the mid-1920s. This was during the 2nd World War when the British Units were stationed in Kandy. Onetime Commander in Chief of Allied Forces in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had his headquarters in the hill capital and saw to the growth of the game.
At one time the Kandy League was only second to the Colombo League team wise, with over 40 teams participating in three groups A, B and C. Today, even the people who are involved in Kandy football are ignorant as to when football started in Kandy. Sad to say there are not even ten clubs in action, no tournaments at domestic level are being played. At one time football was one of the most popular sports in Kandy. A few days back an under 14 tournament was held at the Deyanawella playgrounds, which turned out to be a flop.
From the early years of barefoot competitions to the present age of sophisticated football, Kandy has played a vital role in its growth, but today football is not on a good footing. The FFSL, made a big show in Kandy, saying Kandy will get a modern football stadium at Dangolla, through FIFA and the foundation stone was laid in 2013. But it is nearly three years and nothing has happened only the stone remains which are a sad indictment on those who govern the game. Football is in doldrums in Kandy mainly due to the alleged mismanagement of FFSL over the years. A few years back, the controlling bodys president of that time messed up Kandy football. In a surprise move the hard working committee was dissolved and a new committee was appointed. From that day, they have failed to complete a single tournament in a proper manner. An English football coach who visited Kandy, after watching rugby recently said that when he was here some years ago, football was the most popular sport in Kandy. But today rugby is more popular.
Kandy won the All Island senior and junior league championship for the first time under the presidency of B.M. Liyanage and H. Marikar. With this win Kandy toured Nepal, the first time a team went overseas. What the controlling body should do is to appoint an interim committee and run football in Kandy until it is properly organized. They should obtain the support of those who have done great service to this game in the past. In the good old days, the winners of the league and the knockouts were presented with Rs. 150,000 cash award.
In the FFSLs competition, it is sad to say that no team from Kandy is participating. Holding office for prestige sake is not what is required now.
People must come forward and serve football. Most officials holding office are only keen on coaching and refereeing for financial benefits. If football in Kandy is to improve the controlling body must put the leagues on the correct path.

Governor welcomes greater powers for CBSL

The government has announced its intention to restructure the Central Bank to give greater powers to the Central Bank to regulate the financial system, Central Bank Governor, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said addressing media in Colombo on Tuesday.
The Governor said they very much welcomed a re-structuring process which would upgrade processes and result in the reform of the Monetary Law and the Banking Acts to give greater powers to the Central Bank to regulate the financial system.We are confident that such a move will be instrumental in enhancing the credibility of the Central Bank while preserving the independence it needs to perform its role effectively, he said.
The Governor further said the stability of the economy is broadly on track. However there will be significant downsides from the global economy which the country should be aware of and respond proactively, the Governor said in Colombo on Tuesday.
As a facilitator we need to support the new road model of the government which focuses on the central role of the private sector, he said.
The Governor said they will be concentrating in improving the investment climate.The initial impetus to harness the countrys considerable potential must come from the domestic private sector particularly in the next year or two.The government has drawn its plan for a megalopolis development project and the development of Hambantota, Trincomalee and Kandy and various regional development programs which will all open up major investment opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors. The overall development thrust is on track, the governor said.
Having a strategic plan is vital for the Central Bank. It is good for economic agents to know what the Central Banks plans and programmes are.
There were significant downsides but it is too early to say how severe the impact will be. But the fact that the economy is stabilising we hope will result in greater investment activities both domestic and foreign.

Defending the rupee with foreign reserves not sensible
The most dangerous thing for a Central Bank Governor to do was talking about exchange rates fluctuating, CB Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.We are trying to make a framework and within that have a comparative exchange rate, he said.
The fundamental problem is the out goings are more than the inflows in terms of foreign exchange, which means that there is an underlying pressure on the rupee all the time. So the way to get over that is to either increase our exports of goods and services or get more non debt creating inflows as FDIs in to meet the import debt servicing that go out of the economy. Most months there is a deficit which keeps the rupee constantly under pressure.However defending the rupee with foreign reserves was not sensible because it always led to a sharp depreciation of the rupee. He pointed out that the Central Bank spent $ 4.2 billion in 2011-2012 which led to a 14% depreciation and US$ 2.1 billion in 2015 that followed with a 9% depreciation of the rupee.

Teejay first in the industry to develop Green Fabric
Teejay, South Asias leading fabric manufacturer, has taken the lead in producing green fabric for some of their key customers. The Company who was named among the 2016 Forbes list of Asias Top 200 Companies under a Billion US dollars, announced their new identity last month and the sustainability initiative is one of the long term goals under Teejays new direction.
This green initiative is an initial step by Teejay, who wants to drive the sustainability agenda in all aspects of their business. The Company has entered into a partnership with The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC) to calculate the product carbon footprint of a selected range of their fabrics. CCC who has calculated the emissions of a selected range of Teejays fabric has been able to completely offset the carbon emissions associated with their production through their partner, Natural Capital Partners (NCP), UK the worlds Best Offset Retailer for six years running.
Teejay has brought together one of the leading Apparel Groups in the Island and their client UKs Marks & Spencer (M&S) to quantify, measure and offset carbon emissions associated with a garment produced using a CarbonNeutral fabric from Teejays Spring / Summer 2017 collection. Employing both local expertise and international standards, Teejay & M&S are working together to refine the calculations and aim to complete the work in time for the up and coming product lines for their spring/summer 2017 season.
Teejays Marketing COO Rodney Arland says, Sustainability is a key pillar on which we build our strategy, and this revolutionary new product is yet another demonstration of our leadership in this arena. We are proud to work with these global partners to make the world a greener place.
Having already developed an outline carbon footprint for one of its garments - including the fabric and raw materials, production and transportation process, i.e. to the end of Teejays responsibility in the supply chain (called a cradle to gate assessment) - Teejay is now working with CCC and M&S to extend this initiative to encompass the retail, consumer use and disposal phase of the garment; otherwise known as a full Life Cycle Assessment.
Teejay has already secured through CCC, a sizable stock of carbon credits from NCP, and this stock of credits will then be retired against the production runs of the garment.
CEO of CCC, Sanith de Silva Wijeyeratne says that the steps taken by Teejay to create a CarbonNeutral product is creditable.
He says, This is the first time such a product is being developed in this region and all credit goes to the Teejay team for conceptualizing it and the level of coordination, they have managed to achieve.
CCC who has a team of qualified professionals with global expertise has received several accolades for their outstanding work in the field. Their work is guided by Senior External Technical Advisor Dr. Sampath Wahala, from the Sabaragamuwa University a highly reputed Environmental and Sustainability professional.
The COO Marketing for Teejay says the next phase of the project is to work more closely with M&S, to better understand and calculate the retail, distribution and consumer use and disposal phases of the garment (i.e. domestic washing and recycling patterns). Over the next months the partners will liaise closely with M&S to ensure that the balance calculations are carried out in a manner that is in line with the brands sustainability standards. He added that plans have already been drawn to work with a leading US retailer in the new year.
Currently Teejay is in talks with a number of top international brands who have expressed interest in the product in order to reach their long term goal of driving the green initiative across their supply chain. CCC will work with them through Teejay to calculate emissions up to the production of the garment, covering the end use state i.e. the ultimate user of the product.

High powered delegation to Tehran soon
Sri Lankan officials began work on formulating one of the strongest ever national business delegations to Iran in Colombo on Tuesday.
President Maithripala Sirisenas forthcoming tour of Iran could open many new doors of opportunities for Lankan businesses, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
Bathiudeen was addressing a team of officials from Industry and Commerce Ministry including the Department of Commerce, EDB, the BoI,Tea Board, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, National Chamber of Commerce and the Foreign Ministry at his Ministry premises. The objective of the visit is to explore bilateral trade, investment and tourism potentials topped up by a Business Forum. Joining the session was Deputy Head of Mission of Embassy of Islamic Republic of Iran in Colombo, M. R.Ahmadi. Minister Bathiudeen is scheduled to lead the Lankan business delegation.
Iran - Sri Lanka relations have strengthened in the recent years but bilateral trade growth has not met our expectations despite end of sanctions.In 2015, our total trade with Iran was $162 mn, a small amount in comparison to previously higher trade levels. President Maithripala Sirisenas forthcoming tour of Iran could open many new doors for Lankan businesses and get bilateral trade levels back on track.
Therefore let us collaborate for a strong trade delegation to Iran consisting of representatives from Lankan exporters, importers,manufacturers and service providers so that Sri Lanka can leverage thisopportunity.
I believe that we should not send only a business delegation and just make speeches but also should make joint business presentations with our Chambers to Iranian investors and also schedule several B2Bs so that this visit is leveraged well for the business sector of the country. Iranian Embassy in Colombos Deputy Head M R Ahmadi stressed of the surging interest at Iranian side on the forthcoming meet. We look forward to explore a wide range of sectors for cooperation during this meet.We believe the planned Business Forum during this event could also bring innew openings. Prior to sanctions, bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Iran stood at $1.6 billion (2011), but in 2015 it totaled $162 mn, of which $155 mnwere exports to Iran from Sri Lanka.

Lankan develops special barn automation system for tobacco drying
Sri Lanka entrepreneur cum inventor has designed a special barn automation system powered by electricity and paddy husks to dry tobacco leaves.
This is the first time such a system has being introduced to the world tobacco industry.
The inventor, H. J. Weerasinghe from Dambulla has been engaged as a supplier of tobacco (in dried form) to the company.
Unlike with most other crops grown locally, CTC pays an average price of Rs. 400 per kilo for tobacco produced, ensuring farmer families with a guaranteed monthly income and hence there is keen interest to grow tobacco.
He said traditionally paddy husk is being manually fed to the machine and due to this sometimes leaves get overheated. Hence I designed an automated system which automatically takes in the paddy husk and heats up the leaves to the required temperature. Due to this system environmental pollution too is minimised. A unique feature of the system is that there is no paddy husk ash for disposal and only a liquid is left behind. In addition more leaves too could be handled per day due to the new machine.
He said that he is now commercially ready to market this product at a price of around Rs. 65,000. CTC Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Michael Koest said they are amased with the invention and will certainly help it to be marketed overseas where traditional methods are being used to dry tobacco.It would help him (Weerasinghe) to earn foreign exchange through the machine sales.
Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) has a history of over 100 years in Sri Lanka during which time it has become an integral part of the countrys agriculture and business sectors.
The companys involvement in the agricultural sector extends over 70 years with leaf growing operations starting as far back as the 1950s.
CTC offers tobacco famers the assurance of purchase through the forward contract system meaning that the full crop of tobacco grown by them is purchased by the company at a pre-agreed, competitive price, he said.

Further, many of them are engaged in businesses such as micro scale food processing, running tea and spice nurseries, running grocery shops, and collection of tea leaves and cinnamon quill.

Power struggle causes defeat of Development Special Provisions Draft Bill: Pubudu Jagoda
The Development (Special Provisions) Draft Bill was defeated in Provincial Councils because of a power struggle and not because of the content of the Bill, Front Line Socialist Party Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Jagoda said the neo-liberal economic policy cannot be implemented within a democratic system and needs a dictator. It is brought to Sri Lanka through the Development (Special Provisions) Draft Bill. This is a failed strategy in other countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. It failed 40 years ago, he said.
According to Jagoda, the car assembly company in Labuyaya, Kuliyapitiya, is not a positive move. The foreign company will take the profit.
Environmental damages, health issues and suffering will be left to Sri Lankan labourers.
This company had troubles in connection with violating environmental laws in the US and in Europe in 2015. The company has a bad international reputation, he said.
Jagoda said governments earn income through taxes and other non-tax revenues. In Sri Lanka, the government also has lotteries. People sell lotteries because they do not have other jobs.
The government is trying to exploit people more and more by increasing the price of lotteries, he said.
The Front Line Socialist Party will educate the people and organise people against Wilpattu forest destruction.
The officials should stop misleading the public by telling lies and providing inaccurate and fabricated information, Jagoda said.

Megapolis and Western Development Ministry outlines development plan
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has to face challenges as it was a new experience for the country, the ministry issuing a release said yesterday.
Identifying development projects and completing them are the main challenges faced by the ministry, the release said.
The release: A number of projects are under way. It will take a few years to complete them. Investors do not agree to invest on projects which do not have formal and viable reports of feasibility studies.
