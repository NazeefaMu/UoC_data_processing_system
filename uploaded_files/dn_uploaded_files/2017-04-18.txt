Eyes speak!
The idea is present in his mind. He sees through is eyes, he has the eyes, and his fingers remember their strength. They do the rest. Daily News features Chandrasena Perera a photographer who has won international awards and also displays skills at painting.
I began my career as a newspaperman, starting out as a freelance photojournalist in 1965, at the Independent Newspaper. After it closed down I became a proof reader at the Government Printing Department. I have received numerous accolades for my photography at an international level. You need a good eye for photography. Even though technology has advanced rapidly, it is important to master the basics of photography and all related areas. At school a lot of Art Photography is taught. Wedding photography is altogether a new area, pointed out Perera.
However Perera the all- round photographer has even ventured out in to the challenging area of Wedding Photography.
My photography is the result of careful contemplation, hard work and dedication. Now what I do is teaching photography to school children and sharing my knowledge with them. I am also involved in clubs. I am also hired by teams to take photos of visits. So I have built my business and I have a demand, said Perera.
Now a pensioner, he has not abandoned the vocation which brought him such rich dividends.
Before entering the field of photography I had this interest from my school days. I had a box camera and I took pictures. I found this very interesting. I had a great interest in Arts which was not for an interest of money. I had this love. This is the reason for where I am now. I do not have a particular theme that I shoot under. I take all types of photos. I dabble in all aspects in the field. I even do wildlife. And I have received awards internationally for my work in the spectrum, explained Perera
So this is currently an ongoing process for Perera. This is why he teaches and this is why he still plays the game.
He is not stingy about knowledge and shares it openly and fully. He teaches some leading schools in Colombo.
Now I am 75 years old and still fit as a horse! When I look at the photography industry in Sri Lanka, the quality is low. Today, because of the digital camera and technology, the techniques of handling the camera manually is not what it was. In our times we had to learn so many things and apply it into our vocation. That was how we produced high quality photos. When we learnt, we had to know about light and shading and so many different aspects, added Perera.
Art is subjective and perceived differently. It is subtle.
I have received many awards/medals from France. I also have an aptitude for painting. I am a self- taught man, but to qualify as a photographer and to get a certificate, I attended the Art Society. I finally got my diploma and I have also received certificates internationally. Technology has transformed the industry. It is relatively easy now. I do portrait, glamor and wildlife, informed Perera.
Perera sends his work to international exhibitions. He does this online. Work is not only sent to France but to India and other countries as well. From the exhibitions Pereras work receives many awards. The work is sent under various categories.
There is a judging panel that deliberates and awards the medals. When it comes to presenting my works, I have already done four exhibitions and the fifth is coming up. This I am planning to hold at the Lionel Wendt. I am satisfied with the life I have led. I do not create problems for myself in life. I am patient and can endure. I am not shaken by cut throat competition. I have around 100 medals. I teach at Sirimavo, Devi Balika, Gotami and Janadhipathi Balika. I want to raise a new generation of photographers.
Pereras hand is not hidden. His knowledge and experiences are freely shared. He visits schools daily, on all five days of the week working directly with the photographic societies with the teacher in charge being present.
The children are really enthusiastic and show a keenness. Technology has taken up a lot of the work done by a photographer in this day and age, tasks we needed to perform taking great pains. But with this comes a certain responsibility and a need for ethical conduct. Students have to be brought up to the correct standard, so that when they leave school they will carry with them the professionalism of a photographer. When it comes to interschool exhibitions my students receive many awards, stated Perera.
A man who has lived life to the fullest, Perera has everything to look forward to. He is a global traveler visiting countries with the intention of immersing himself in photography.
I have gone to so many countries like Dubai, Vietnam and Myanmar and taking part in Workshops in India, going there eight times for eight photography workshops. There I learnt much. I went to Taiwan with some friends of mine for the festival and also to take pictures. Some of these excursions were invites. I still savor the memories, summed up Perera.

Rising sun for Japan-Sri Lanka maritime relations
By Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives, Pathfinder Foundation
The Indian Ocean is the third largest water-body on planet earth. There are two billion people living in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).
This ocean has played a strategically significant role in the history. Its strategic significance has now become even more important in this Asian Century. The IOR connects the world through an extensive shipping network that links Asia, Oceania, Africa and the rest of the world. Hence, the developments in the IOR do not only affect the regional countries, but also the world at large. The IOR has gained importance as the worlds Energy Highway and an area of emerging economic and military power rivalry. The economic interactions across this ocean have increased in the recent past and there is a new world economic order shaping upon its waters. The IOR has attracted attention of major naval powers of the world and this ocean has now become the most militarized ocean in the contemporary world.
In about 2009, piracy in the Horn of Africa compelled major naval powers to come to this ocean to safeguard their merchant marine from this menace. Piracy, which threatened the maritime commerce in the Western Indian Ocean has declined over the years, but not been completely eradicated. Yet, international navies are still there.
There is an unofficial maritime cold war brewing up in the Indian Ocean. However, confrontations involving major maritime powers are unlikely at this juncture. Nonetheless, threats to freedom of maritime commerce can come from a variety of non-state actors. Violent extremist groups; human smugglers; illegal weapon and narcotic traders, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishermen as well as pirates are focusing their attention on IOR to carry out their illegal activities. Therefore, guaranteeing freedom of the high-seas and maritime security has become a critically important factor governing international maritime activities.
Potential Flash Points and Choke Points
Maritime security in the IOR has now become a dynamic and multifaceted concept due to the complex nature of players, their networks and motives. There are few unstable states within the IOR. These potential flash points pose a serious threat to the freedom of maritime commerce in this ocean. There are also several choke points at key entrances/exits to and from the Indian Ocean.
The choke points at Bab-El-Mandeb and the Strait of Hormuz in the middle-east have the potential to seriously impact on the freedom of navigation. Further, as the connector to the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean is not totally immune from the developing security situation in the Western Pacific Ocean and the spillover effect of that is clearly seen here.
Japan and the Indian Ocean
Japan has become a major Asian naval power in the Indian Ocean and the presence of Japanese Maritime Self Defence Forces (MSDF) can be mainly attributed to the need to enhance security for the Japanese as well as international merchant shipping.
When analyzing the country of origin of foreign warships visiting the Port of Colombo from 2008 to 2017, it is observed that 65 Japanese MSDF ships have arrived in Sri Lankan ports, mainly the Port of Colombo. This is rather a high number and second only to Indian warships visiting Sri Lanka. Although this figure is not a scientific derivative of the presence of warships in the Indian Ocean, it provides an indication as to who is there.
A paradigm shift has taken place in the Japanese foreign policy in the recent past. In September 2015, Japan amended its constitution to allow its military forces to play a more effective role in maintaining world peace and a more robust role in the maritime domain to ensure the safety and freedom of maritime commerce.
This change has paved the way for the Japanese MSDF to participate in number of overseas operations in the recent past. This is a move away from the mere protection of homeland role for MSDF. Japan has a greater dependency on the Indian Ocean for its energy supplies to maintain its economy and industrial capacity. Although Japan is dependent to a large extent on nuclear and alternative energy sources, the mainstream of energy requirement still comes across the Indian Ocean. Japanese foreign policy has a special focus on the long-term stable supplies of energy. Japan is the worlds third largest consumer of crude oil after the USA and China.
Compared with other large consumers of crude oil, Japan possesses virtually no indigenous energy resources. Hence, Japan is dependent on the supply of more than 80% of its energy requirement from abroad and virtually all its crude oil requirement is from overseas, specially from the Middle East. This situation makes Japan as one of the most energy insecure states in the world today. As such, the increased Japanese MSDF activities in the Indian Ocean can be attributed to their heavy dependency on crude oil.
Japans Strategic Focus on the Indian Ocean
Although Japan is a major economic power in the world, it did not pay much attention to the Indian Ocean till about year 2000. Reforms in Japanese national security policy since the Persian Gulf War since 1990 allowed the Japanese MSDF to participate in many overseas operations. Japans concern over the Western Pacific Ocean involving Chinese military activities and Chinas People Liberation Army (PLA) Navys increased presence in the Indian Ocean compelled the MSDF to venture in to and carry out operations in the Indian Ocean. Japan also found that India and the USA having similar interests in the IOR and established closer ties on the maritime domain with those countries.
This Trinity of maritime forces found convergence in their maritime strategies and over a period enhanced tri-lateral cooperation to a new level. Japan established close ties with India by concluding several security agreements and treaties including Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and India in 2008 and now participates in several multi-lateral and bi-lateral naval and coast-guard exercises involving India. These exercises include Malabar and JIMEX.
Japan- Sri Lanka Maritime Cooperation
Japan has been a major bilateral aid donor for development of Sri Lanka. Japan has now expanded its cooperation in maritime activities with the Sri Lankan Navy and the Coast Guard. Sri Lankas geo-strategic location, situated just 12 nautical miles north of the busiest East-West shipping lane in the Indian Ocean has attracted Japanese attention significantly expanding the economic cooperation to military sphere as well. Japan considers the Port of Colombo as a convenient transit and rest and recuperation harbour for their counter piracy operations.
This is the reason for the visit by a large number of MSDF ships to this port. Japan has now stationed a Defence Attach in Colombo, who is coordinating visits of MSDF vessels and other military cooperation with Sri Lanka.
When the Japanese Prime Minister visited Sri Lanka in 2014, recognizing islands enormous potential as a maritime nation in the Indian Ocean, the two leaders expressed their determination to elevate Japan-Sri Lanka relations, which have matured and diversified based on the long-standing friendship, into a new partnership between maritime countries; and further strengthen cooperative relations to play significant roles in the stability and prosperity of the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Prime Minister Abe expressed his gratitude to Sri Lanka for facilitating port calls by MSDF ships. The two leaders welcomed the cooperation between two coast guards in the fields of maritime law enforcement, Search and Rescue (SAR), disaster risk reduction and environment protection. Sri Lankan President expressed his appreciation for the dispatch of Japanese experts to assist Sri Lanka Coast Guard and expressed the hope for further assistance for capacity improvement through provision of patrol vessels. Prime Minister Abe reaffirmed the importance of capacity building on maritime safety in Sri Lanka, and stated that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) would conduct a survey and will coordinate the projects.
The joint statement noted the strategic geographical location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean straddling Asia and Africa. Japan also expected Sri Lanka to enhance cooperation not only with limited number of countries but also with other countries as well.
Later, in 2015, when the Sri Lankan Prime Minister visited Japan, both leaders reaffirmed that strengthening partnership between the two countries can contribute to prosperity of the two countries as well as the Pacific and the Indian Ocean Region.
The two leaders also reaffirmed the importance of the freedom of navigation and overflight of the high-seas. Prime Minister Abe assured that Japan would continue to extend its cooperation to contribute to capacity building on maritime safety of Sri Lanka in such fields as maritime law enforcement, Search and Rescue (SAR), mitigation of disaster risks and environment protection, including examining the feasibility for providing patrol vessels.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe welcomed this initiative and both leaders recognized the importance of cooperation and exchanges between the two defense establishments on maritime security, including through port calls by vessels of MSDF.
In May 2016, the Sri Lankan President and the Japanese Prime Minister met in Japan and recognized the importance of port development and mutual cooperation for development of maritime capabilities of Sri Lanka.
In 2016, The Government of Japan granted 1,830 million Japanese Yen (approximately Rs. 2.4 billion) to the Government of Sri Lanka for implementation of the Maritime Safety Capability Improvement project. This project aims at contributing to the improvement of maritime safety capability of Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) by enabling SLCG to procure two petrol vessels to help safe navigation and freedom of merchant ships, counter-piracy operations, prevention of transnational crime and protection of marine environment and resources. This grant aid will be utilized for procurement of two 30-meter patrol vessels, including construction of vessels, sea transportation from Japan to Sri Lanka, and familiarization training for coast guard personnel. These two vessels will certainly enhance organic capabilities of SLCG in discharging its duties. Until now the SLCG totally depends on seconded vessels provided by the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), other than having a few small boats on their own. This project is coordinated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Beginning of 2017, the SLCG also placed an order for construction of two 85-meter Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) with the Colombo Dockyard (Pvt.) Ltd. (CDL) to enhance its capabilities in deep sea surveillance. This project too will be undertaken by a loan provided by the Japanese government. These two OPVs will have the capability to launch and recovery of helicopters and small utility boats at sea. These two ships when completed, will be the biggest ships of the SLCG and will enhance its capability to a higher level. Building of these two OPVs by CDL is also a boost for the local ship building industry in Sri Lanka. The two ships will be based on a European design and SLCG and SLN marine and electrical engineers and ship building architects will be able to gain valuable practical experience by engaging in this project.
Further, SLN and SLCG will be able to utilize their experiences in countering maritime terrorism in the construction of these two ships. CDL is having more than 40 years of experience in ship building and has already built two OPVs, two Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and large number of Ultra-Fast Attack Craft (UFAC) for the Sri Lanka Navy and the Maldivian Coast Guard. If this project succeeds and it should, there is a possibility to construct the same model of ships for other international navies as well.
There had been many high-level visits by Japanese maritime delegations to Sri Lanka and SLCG has benefitted immensely from these visits and is receiving higher level of training and skills development on maritime disaster measures, particularly on oil spill combat skills, from the Japanese Coast Guard. Japanese marine environment protection and oil spill measure experts have been conducting regular courses and drills with the SLCG to enhance the latters level of competency in emergency response procedures in maritime pollution activities. Japan has also donated equipment along with skills training.
The Japanese Training Squadron has been visiting the Port of Colombo at regular intervals and engage in bilateral passage exercises with the SLN and SLCG. These exercises provide much needed international exposure to SLN and SLCG. The last such visit was in October 2016 by MSDF ships Kashima, Setoyuki and Asagiri.
The MSDF also participated in Pacific Partnership 2017, a multilateral exercise with the participation of military and non-military personnel from the USA, Australia and Sri Lanka. This is the 12th year of this exercise and the first time it was conducted in Sri Lanka. The aim of this exercise was to enhance regional cooperation in the fields of medical readiness and preparedness for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) situations.
Conclusion
The maritime relations between Japan MSDF and SLN and SLCG have moved to a new height in the recent past. Japan is focusing on their maritime interests in the Indian Ocean and is keen in protecting its energy supplies, specially crude oil and maintaining freedom of navigation for maritime commerce and overflight in the Indian Ocean. Japan has focused its strategic attention on the geo-strategic location of Sri Lanka and is keen to in partnering the island nation to ensure maritime security as well as maritime safety.
The major beneficiaries of this renewed Japanese commitment and interest are the SLN and SLCG. Japan has pledged to build ships and craft for the SLCG to perform its role in maintaining a rule based maritime order in the Indian Ocean and to respond to possible disasters in the region. Japanese and Sri Lanka maritime cooperation is riding very high in the present context, mutually benefiting both nations.

1977  2017: A political revue
Ranil Wickremesinghes political narrative begins in 1977 with his election to Parliament at the age 28. His political path runs parallel to Sri Lankas triple lane highway to the Executive Presidency, Market Liberalization and the ethnic firestorm that engulfed and nearly consumed it. A study of his political biography is a discovery of the compelling complexities of our era. It is a vicarious witnessing of our descent in to a cruel ethnic inferno, suppression of a Sothern insurrection with a state brutality that has few parallels in human history, a firsthand experience of political obscenity with the Lampu Kalagedi referendum, the near total collapse of the rule of law and lastly our discovery and realization for a return to political civility and good governance. There remains another hurdle. The military resolution has not appeased memory and prejudice.
The four decades between 1977 and 2017 had different periods. There were periods of hope, change, experiment and promise. There were also periods of decay and degeneration. These multiple periods constitute the era that is mirrored by the political biography of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The time context
When Ranil entered politics the Minster of Telecommunications (He later became Prime Minister and President) was a popular and coveted Minister. He could allocate telephones. He dispensed connectivity. He was the Czar of connectivity.
Today, we review his political biography at a time when the current incumbent of the same Ministry is wrestling with Googles Internet Booming Balloons. Phone reloads are accessed at every street corner. In this age, connectivity is everybodys entitlement and nobodys business. But some things have not changed.
Monks Elle Gunawansa, Medagoda Abayatissa, Bengamuwe Nalaka - a random selection of a larger drift, are still in command and control of memory and prejudice of the majority community. To make matters worse Marxist political scientists have discovered that the Cholas invaded Lanka in 2nd century BC.
The politics of the project
The grand launch of the book Ranil Wickremesinghe  a political biography at the BMICH is evidence of the earnestness of the enterprise.
The presentation of the first copy to the President, the introduction of Ranil  the subject of the book by Rajitha Senaratne the keeper of the conscience of the good governance government (Assuming that it has one) demonstrates that it is a sales pitch for a failing endevour now in its last lap. (This writer has given up hope)
There is an uncanny, spectral similarity to another political biography- Premadasa of Sri Lanka, brought out at a time when the siege ring was tightening around its protagonist.
Judging Ranil against history is not easy. Marx said  men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please, but under circumstances encountered, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living...
A study of Ranils politics demands empathetic imagination. Concocted history does not help.
Yet, the book serves a serious purpose. It compels us to search for a more authentic account and an honest explanation of events in the period from 1977 to 2017. The sum total of Ranils political biography is captured in the sardonic fatalism of poet W.B. Yeats. Life is a long preparation for something that never happens.'
A dispassionate assessment
Ranils bold bid to reach a final negotiated settlement with Prabhakaran by signing a ceasefire agreement testifies to the mans political courage. A military victory is only a respite. It does not erase or remove the memory of multiple layers and levels of sovereignties that existed before the emergence of the modern nation state. The illusive civic nation made of competing tribal components needs cohesion that can be achieved only through negotiation and accommodation.
Ranil was right in seeking a negotiated settlement. That he failed in the attempt does not diminish his logic of resolving post-colonial nationalisms.
Ranil, a product of history
Historical necessity made Ranil a leadership contender. The populist President Premadasa had little patience with the establishment. He picked the remarkably, unremarkable D.B. Wijetunge to be his Prime Minister. He picked Ranil, the relatively junior prototypical UNP figure and therefore less remarkable, to be the Leader of the House. That was Premadasas way of telling Lalith and Gamini Up yours.
Ranils real ascendancy to leadership begins when random events made him Prime Minister on May 7, 1993. These events of the past continue to haunt us in to the present. The fragments discernible to this day, of those traumatic events defy either accurate reconstruction or our reasoned comprehension.
Clarifying distortions
Ranils political biographer while chronicling events since independence resorts to some distortions that need correction. On page 20 in Chapter 2 Political Background he writes It is said that after D.S. Senanayake, independent Sri Lankas first Premiers death in 1952, the premiership of the country should have been passed on to JR. However Buddhist priests vehemently objected to the arrangement, resultantly the premiership ultimately passing to Dudley. Buddhist priests wanted the leadership transferred to Dudley because JRs father was a Christian.
This is pure fiction. At the time of the death of D.S. Senanayake the first Prime Minister, the next in line was Sir John Kotelawala, who was the Leader of the House.
He continues the fiction further on page 20. In the case of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike (a Christian by birth but who changed his religion for politics) who swept the polls four years later, in 1956, the story was different. S.W.R.D. triumphed primarily under the Sinhala Buddhist card, making race and religion his clarion call, thus appealing to the then 72% Sinhala Buddhist majority in Sri Lanka. The same strategy Mahinda tried to pull off in January 2015, but failed. Emphasis mine.
Ranil Wickremesinghe has been and will remain a consequential leader. He deserves a better and a more balanced political biography.
That said, we cannot let the gains of January 8, 2015 to be hijacked by philistine pamphleteering. SWRD looms large even today. The rivalry of Maithri and Mahinda to claim title to the doctrinaire endowment and political mantle of S.W.R.D Bandararanaiake is sufficient proof. Accusing SWRD Banaranaike of playing the race card is as bad as accusing the Pope of playing the God card.
The present day UNP apparatchiks need to learn post-independence history. S.W.R.D Bandaranaike did not play the Sinhala Buddhist card. His was by far the sharpest intellect of any leader since independence.
That his call for social justice and equity resonated more with the Sinhala Buddhist majority was due to another post-colonial phenomenon  the rise of a vernacular oriented middle class. His emissaries to the people were the quintet of Sangha, Veda, Guru, Govi, Kamkaru. This quintet was institutionalized post 1956 and its residual remnants still manages to hold the SLFP wobbly but standing.
JRJ made Ranil a deputy minister in 1977 not because of his kinship with Ranil. In appointing the manifestly bright and brainy son, to ministerial office, JRJ was acknowledging and repaying a debt he owed to Esmond Wickremesinghe, his trusted consiglieri during his lonely years of waiting.
Once in power, JR wasted no time. His destiny was to shape destiny which he did forcefully and furiously. He dragged out a centrally planned economy from its insulated socialist cocoon. He hurled it in to the turbulence of a market economy at one fell swoop. Foreign trade was deregulated overnight. The Rupee was devalued by nearly 45%. Food subsidies that once made a UNP Prime Minister to resign were removed. Export processing zones were introduced. The changes were so swift, that JR redefined progress which was now measured in terms of speed in implementation.
These were not suddenly discovered policies. They were conceived in long hours of deliberations, when lesser men were exercising power and dispensing remedies, when lesser men were taking refuge in orthodoxy and resisting innovation.
Two men of destiny
Esmond Wickeremesinghe and JRJ were ardent free marketers. They strongly urged Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to open up the economy in 1965. At the time it was a heretical idea. It had no precedent except in Lee Kwan Yew's Singapore. Dudley demurred.
He demurred, not because he feared political opposition. Opposition to JR and Esmond came from within.
Dudleys trusted economic advisor Dr. Gamani Corea was a disciple of Ral Prebisch whom he later succeeded as Secretary General of UNCTAD.
They were different times. The Chicago school was yet to make its presence felt. Milton Freidman was yet to discover the cost of a free lunch. The conventional wisdom as advanced by Prebisch and his followers was that third world economies had a way out through internal reforms and not by excessive focus on external trade. The way out for poorer countries was not trade but import substitution. That eliminates the need for manufactured products from richer countries. They should export primary produce to richer countries but save the foreign exchange.
To audacious and exuberant Esmond Wickremesinghe, the dependency theory was positively repugnant. He detested controls that inhibited entrepreneurial initiatives. To him the sedate highbrow economist Gamini Corea was a control freak. JR was an equally enthusiastic collaborator and an unhesitant free market missionary.
Already, Cousin Upali Wijewardena was showing signs of an entrepreneurial Ninja. He took advantage of the Open General License Scheme that Dr. Corea had grudgingly acquiesced in. He assembled a modern Mazda car by importing its components under OGL. JRJ liked his Mazda and used it with fond care.
Esmond scoffed at the Dependency theory experts who allowed the import of Mini Mokes ostensibly to grow more food but used by the affluent class to take children to school.
The differences between J.R. Jayewardene and Dudley Senanayake had more to do with their respective approaches to power than their personal ambitions.
Autopsy of a nation
Once in power, JRJ had to pay a heavy price for those market reforms. He had to ensure that his economic reforms will not be subverted by chauvinist segments who could and would construe opening of the economy as adulterating pristine values of an imagined heritage.
Dr. Rajesh Venugopal of the London School of Economics has made an incisive analysis of the Jayewardene years when Sri Lanka adopted a market economy. He captures its internal contradictions with dazzling clarity.
Why did the UNP, a party identified primarily with the interests of Sri Lankas capitalist class and committed to market reform, become a key participant in the escalation of a brutal civil war that was counter-productive to their material interests
The answer is profoundly penetrating. Market reforms had the latent potential of provoking Sinhala nationalist opposition. (Listen to present day GMOA lunatics on India Sri Lanka ETCA agreement)
In JRJs zeitgeist, Market liberalization held the key to nirvana. The UNP decided to outflank the insular nationalist forces. His fears were genuine.
He never comprehended why his dear friend and classmate Colvin, the Bolshevik Leninist, ended up drafting a constitution that conferred constitutional primacy on Buddhism. If a doctrinaire Trotskyites can be tamed in to an ecclesiastic enthusiast, anything was possible.
He was not ready to allow chauvinist racist elements to hijack his economic agenda.
The Tower hall melody Danno Budunge appeared to be popular at national and presidential events. The President, however was quietly humming to himself I did it my way.
In Cyril Mathew, JRJ found what he thought was the perfect counter to the opposition he feared. That the antitoxic was more toxic than the perceived threat is the story of the four decades from 1977 to 2017 less the five years 2010-2015  the brazenly neo fascist Rajapaksa rule.

Aamir is interested in doing a film on Mahabharata
The director of Baahubali: The Beginning and its to-release sequel Baahubali: The Conclusion, SS Rajamouli, is keen on making a movie on Sanskrit epic Mahabharata and, in an exclusive with Bollywood Life, he has admitted to discussing the possibility of a cinematic collaboration with superstar Aamir Khan.
According to the website, Rajamouli was ready to start with the shooting of the film by the end of 2018 with Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal and Aamir Khan in lead roles. It is also rumoured that the film would be made that Rajamouli on a mega budget of 400 Cr in three different languages- Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.
The ace director told Bollywood Life that the plan is very much on and that he has already spoken to Aamir about the movie. I want to do Mahabharata and I have said that many times but definitely not immediately after Baahubali. Mahabharat is such an epic that I need to up my craftsmanship to handle such a subject. Yeah I met Aamir ji once quite sometime back, we spoke about Mahabharata. I know that hes very much interested in doing the film. But as I said, at present I am not thinking anything beyond Baahubali. Mahabharata is definitely not after this.
As far as his upcoming movie Baahubali: The Conclusion is concerned, it is releasing on a record 6500 screens across India on April 28. The first instalment of the franchise had earned accolades for its gripping content and was a commercial success as well.

Anura Kumara says it
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna is no friend of the government and is a sworn enemy of the UNP. It is also in the bandwagon of the groups opposing SAITM, is going hammer and tongs on the Treasury Bond issue and is fiercely opposed to ETCA. But when its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that "toppling government to be replaced by whom" he certainly has come to grips with reality. This sober reasoning on the part of Dissanayake no doubt is well grounded. The JVP has not known to be complimentary towards either of the two major parties, although, it once was part of the government led by CBK.
Responding to a journalist, at a media briefing, the other day, Dissanayake, who is also the Chief Opposition Whip in parliament, said there was no point in talking of toppling the government when there is no alternative to the present one at the moment. It must have been a bitter admission for Dissanayake, whose party is hoping to form a government of its own in 2020. Nevertheless the JVP leader has clearly addressed his mind to the ground situation, and, most importantly, the players in the field who are aspiring to form a government.
In other words, what the JVP leader is saying is, the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa is certainly no alternative to the current dispensation although the JO keeps on talking of toppling the government within the year, or, as MR keeps saying, in another two full moons thawa poya dekai.
Dissanayake has good reason for his contention. To begin with, the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government is barely into its second year (it will be two years only in August) and the people are not prepared for a change in regime just yet - if at all. True, there are many things that have gone wrong for the government and it has not exactly endeared itself to the general public. Resentment is welling up due to the high cost of living and the slow progress in honouring election promises is certainly a major aspect that has made the government unpopular. Acts of profligacy such as the import of luxury vehicles for Ministers and the Rs. 100,000 allowance to MPs have certainly not gone down well with the voters who elected this government. There is also the spate of strikes and agitations that seems to have gone out of control with the public viewing the government as being impotent to tackle the issues that have given rise to these protests.
But, for all that, the people would not want to replace the present administration with a government where the Rajapaksas will be at the levers of power. They have shown the door to Mahinda Rajapaksa not only for misgovernance but also due his lust for power in trying stay put for another term by manipulating the constitution. That government became stale and the voting public desired a compete break from the shackles. Even the war victory failed to influence the voter. The public would not want to bring back a ruler they have already rejected. The peoples' memories are not short. They drove away the power drunk Rajapaksas because they resented their arrogance and the impunity with which acts of corruption took place during the decade of Rajapaksa rule. The voters had enough of a decade of Rajapaksas at the helm. They will not want a repeat of the same. The murders and cover-ups under the former regime and use of the state apparatus to commit these crimes surely must have caused revulsion in the minds of the general public. The abuse of state property, the money laundering by VVIP brats, the free use of the national budget by the ruling family are all factors that will mitigate against a return to power of the Rajapaksas which must have been factored in by Dissanayake when he made the comment that an alternative to the present government is nowhere on the horizon.
The public may be enduring difficulties. But this will be a small price to pay compared to the terror and the white van culture that prevailed in the recent past. There is no denying that the people are today free of the siege mentality they were under. They will certainly not want family rule to return. Besides, the public would not want a tainted ruler to lord over them once again. The acts of mega corruption of the former VVIPs now being unraveled in all its details can only cause grave resentment among the public ruling out the likelihood of a return of the Rajapaksas. The JVP leader could well have weighed the pros and cons when he made his assessment. Besides, there is certainly no alternative to the present government so long as the UNP-SLFP alliance prevail. There have never been governments formed outside the two party system, singly, or in alliance. The return to power of a formation led by a ruler who was deposed barely two years ago is doubly impossible.

Ban on regifoam boxes, lunch sheets soon
Draft regulations to ban regiform lunch boxes and extend the ban on lunch sheets less than 20 microns up to 40 microns will be presented to the Cabinet approval next week, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) sources said.
He said the regulations once finalized and approved by the Cabinet would be published in a Gazette and implemented within two months.
He noted if necessary a grace period would be announced for the manufactures, sellers and consumers to adapt to the new regulations and find alternatives. 
A Committee of Experts appointed in September last year to prepare a national policy and an action plan on the use of polythene, plastic and bio-degradable plastic recommended banning regiform lunch boxes and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) small bottles of water and other drinks.
The Committee was appointed as of a Cabinet paper submitted by President Maithripala Sirisena. The Committee also recommended increasing the ban on polythene less than 20 microns up to 40 microns.
However, the CEA has decided not to proceed with the ban on PET bottles, but to manage them introducing Extended Producer Responsibility concept to the producers and sellers. He said as of this concept the producers should bear the responsibility and cost of collecting and recycling the post-consumer products.
He said this same approach would apply for the disposal of yoghurt cups. He said the CEA in the coming months would take stern action to manage the waste that largely contributes to the dengue menace.

Cargo volumes rise  at Port of Los Angeles
Californian Port of Los Angeles has seen its volumes increase by 10 percent in the first quarter of 2017 as it handled a total of 2.23 million TEUs in the three-month period, compared to 2 million TEU seen in the same quarter a year earlier.
While cargo volumes in January increased by 17 percent to 826,639 TEUs, the port saw its volumes drop in February to 625,381 TEU, representing a decrease of 12 percent.
Port of Los Angeles March cargo volumes saw a strong return as they jumped by 29 percent compared to the previous year, and stood at 788,523 TEU at the end of the month. The port said that the robust numbers came through a combination of strong export volumes, which were up by 20 percent, a post Lunar New Year surge of cargo from Asia, and US retailers shipping merchandise ahead of the new vessel alliance deployments that began this month.
We are pleased to end the first quarter of 2017 with strong volumes and continually efficient cargo handling operations, Gene Seroka, Port of Los Angeles Executive Director, said.
We continue to earn the confidence of shippers and are encouraged by the strength of our supply chain partners. In the coming months, we will remain laser focused on infrastructure improvements, technology solutions, and a strategic use of resources to ensure that we meet the needs of our marine terminal customers and the carriers they serve, Seroka added.
March 2017 imports surged by 30 percent to 373,549 TEUs compared to the previous year, while exports increased by 20 percent to 191,772 TEUs. Total loaded volumes of 565,321 TEUs increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year and empty containers grew 34 percent to 223,203 TEUs.

Chinese state-owned corporation China Merchants Group (CMG) is looking to spread its footprint in Brazil as the company is reportedly in negotiations to buy Advent International Corps 50 percent stake in TCP Terminal de Contineres de Paranagu SA, local media informed.
Namely, the conglomerate is preparing to acquire the stake in Brazils second-busiest container port, which was put up for sale in 2016.
The negotiations with the Chinese group intensified after the Dubai-based DP World decided to back out of the race for the terminal stake.
Local media cited undisclosed sources close to the matter as saying that the value of the share in question stands at some USD 1 billion.
The negotiations are allegedly in the advanced phases as the parties are set to resolve final details on the matter and could soon sign a binding agreement on the sale.

I am quite amazed and encouraged to observe that the present government under large-hearted President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has been successful in offering solutions to the crucial problems of Tamils and Muslims related to restoration of their own lands, religious buildings and other rightful possessions in the North and East.

Other cabinet ministers, including Muslim and Tamil, also joined this long-awaited task. Muslim and Tamil organizations have shouldered this task with a sense of peacefulness and harmony.
We can now afford to rejoice as President and Prime Minister both have fulfilled their election pledges. The Tamil and Muslim voters can now rest assured, as the bulk of their problems are being addressed to.

CMC denies Champikas claim
Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner V.K. Anura yesterday denied that the UDA had asked the CMC to stop dumping garbage at Meethotumulla, despite the Minister in charge Champika Ranawaka stating so.
We were not asked to stop dumping garbage at Meethotumulla, said Anura speaking to the Daily News yesterday.
Minister Ranawaka in a Cabinet paper submitted in February had stated that the Urban Development Authority (UDA) formally informed the CMC in September 2015 to stop dumping garbage at Meethotumulla and to identify a suitable dumping yard in order to mitigate unrest of the community in the surrounding area.
He further stated that the Kolonnawa garbage dumping yard had reached its carrying capacity and the yard had grown to a 40-50 metre garbage mountain, turning it into a hazard prone region.
The Cabinet paper also mentioned that with the first formal notice not being responded to by the CMC, they had sent a second formal notice in December 2015. In a press release yesterday, Minister Ranawaka noted that the CMC had indeed published notices and found a few places but due to protests in the relevant area, they were not able to move garbage there.
By stirring emotions of the people thus, we are simply going to create another Bloemendhal or Meethotumulla, he said.

Dennis the Menace my brother the bother!
Dennis, the menace, he's a bundle of dynamiteOh, the things he says and the things he doesWill make you shake with fright(Beware of) Dennis the menaceThey never know what will happen nextA cyclone, flood or rotDennis the menace, though he makes your hair turn grayHe'll steal your heart awayLast night I got a spankingI don't know what to think'Cause all I did was fill my water pistol full of ink
I believe it was about two weeks ago that I wrote about how kids were encouraged by a popular comic strip in the 50s to make contact with their inner Dennis the Menace image. I also mentioned that my slightly older sibling whose name Denis is spelt with a single n was far more menacing than his comic book counterpart as a kid.
Long before the Beatles were invading America, and astronauts were walking on the moon, both the fictional Dennis as well as his Sri Lankan counterpart were wreaking havoc on everyone in their neighbourhoods. Despite changes in the social and political landscapes things remained pretty much the same in both Dennises little universes.
All in all, the 50s were a very adventurous decade for us kids! To tell the truth I was no alabaster saint either during that era. Coincidentally the sibling Denis was around the same age as the American cartoonist Hank Ketchams pint-sized hero when he first hit the news-stands. It was synchronously a sort of unexpected phenomenon. However, it did occur and in a universe as big as ours strange coincidences are bound to happen.
As I explained in my last column the comic book Dennis was the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy with a touch of innocence that appealed to readers. I must admit that my brother Denis, the bane of my childhood life, was far more anarchical and riotous in his outlook than his comic book counterpart.
Brother Denis was chubbier at the time than any of the De Rosayro siblings and was regarded by my mother as her angelic offspring. In her eyes at the time he could have got away with cold-blooded murder and she would have pleaded culpable homicide in any court of law on his behalf to get him off the hook, or the hangmans noose.
But he couldnt pull the wool over my martinet grandfathers eyes who sarcastically referred to him as the angel child. My mother and his kindergarten and primary school teachers assumed he was good because of his cherubic looks and extremely fair complexion. Ok sure, he could turn on an innocent, compassionate and virtuous look when he got into all kinds of scrapes and was let off scot free when he should have been subjected to horrific punishments.
I was quite chagrined when he was often chosen during the kindergarten Christmas concerts to be cast in the role of an angel. I was always cast, in what I imagined was the less starring role as the narrator. How a delinquent roughneck fitted into the character of an angel was beyond my comprehension.
But I must admit that he was a darned good soccer player in addition to being an accomplished pugilist. When it came to sports we played them all. Cricket, soccer and boxing in season or out were anytime and anywhere games. And we taught ourselves the finer points of all these games with no adult coaching guiding us. By the time we formed a pre-teenage club we ran circles around adult mens clubs while we were equipped with real footer and cricket boots. Despite my brother Denis objections I played in the left-striker position and to his mortification was the chief goal-scorer on most occasions.
If the truth be told his passes were fairly accurate and his tackling of bigger opponents mean. He set me up for most of the strikes. His problem was that being an incurable show-off he tried to be everywhere on the field at the same time although he was supposed to be a centre-forward. In later years he played college and club soccer at the highest level and was picked for the national youth team.
He was also renowned as the family prize fighter and defended his siblings and cousins with fierce opposition even from bigger and heavier antagonists. But he never lost precious time in holding grudges. His philosophy: Don't ever hold a grudge, ... Just belt them and forget about it. When my mother was expecting my kid sister Ann who was about five years younger than he was and wanted another brother he consoled me saying: Havin' a sister might not be too bad... 'specially if she's trained to kick people in the shins when you're losing a fight.
He was a spectator when I took on a bigger bully in a fight at school. He sidled up to me and gave me some of his expert bashing advice: Get the first shot in ... and afterwards there will be separation. I followed his advice to the letter and gave my opponent an unexpected straight left on his kisser. He bled profusely but sure enough the separation came soon after and I was hailed as a hero.
From an academic point of view I considered Denis as not being the brightest bulb on the family Christmas tree. His early primary school reports had him nearly at the bottom of his class, while I managed to remain at the middle of the rung. But that was only until he was around eight when he fell off a tree, we were all rough-housing on. He was rushed to hospital and remained unconscious for a couple of hours. Following the fall we were both enrolled in a new school. And astonishingly his report cards revealed he was mostly at the top of his class, proving that a fall could both damage ones brain and reversely perk it up as well.
Well, Dennis the Menace cartoon character was created over 60 years ago  so obviously our little Denis has grown up quite a bit! He's some three score and ten or so now and he's just as insufferable as he was when he was a kid! So there you have it, Our Denis the Menace is all grown up. Makes you feel old doesnt it

Erdogan hails referendum victory
TURKEY: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the Yes vote in the referendum to amend Turkeys constitution and grant the countrys presidential office new executive powers.
We have been attacked by other nations of the world. You have seen how the West attacked us, Erdogan told cheering supporters in Istanbul on Sunday.
We have not been divided We have already been on our way, now we will gear it up [with the new system], he said. We have so much work to do in this country.
The constitutional changes were backed by Erdogan, the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) founded by him, and the leadership of the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), whose parliamentary support was vital to take the amendments to a public vote.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan waves to supporters after his victory.
Speaking before Erdogan, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim thanked the Turkish people for their decision to back the constitutional amendments.
We are all brothers and sisters in a single body standing against traitors, Yildirim said, speaking at the headquarters of his governing AK Party in Ankara.
Thank you Turkey, thank you my holy nation The nation said the last word and said Yes, he said.
The Yes campaign won 51.4 percent of the vote against 48.6 percent for No, the election commission said in figures quoted by state news agency Anadolu, in a count based on 99.5 percent of the ballot boxes. Turnout was a high 85 percent.
The new constitutional changes transform Turkeys governance from a parliamentary system to an executive presidency, significantly expanding the powers of the top office.
The result gives the president to be elected in 2019 new powers to appoint vice-presidents, ministers, high-level officials, and senior judges.
It will also allow the president to dissolve parliament, issue executive decrees, and impose state of emergencies. Speaking to Al Jazeera outside the AK Party headquarters in Istanbul, Erdal Erdinc Durucu, 37, said Erdogan has started a new age for Turkey, and ended another.
Until today, our hands were tied. Our president has been trying to do many good things for us. But different powers tried to prevent him from doing so, Durucu said.
The recent coup attempt was the latest example of this. God willing, we beat this attempt like others Turkey is ready to rule the world now. The Ottoman Empire is coming back.
Another supporter, Yasemin Ozgen, a 43-year-old housewife, said: Good days are coming. With this result, Turkey will break away from Europe as a strong power by itself. An independent Turkey will take its own decisions and will use its resources.
There is growing negative sentiment against the European Union in Turkey as Ankaras relations with the bloc, particularly member states Germany and the Netherlands, have been tense since last month. Those two nations barred Turkish ministers from holding referendum campaign rallies within their borders, where millions of Turkish voters live.
Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a group in the Turkish army tried to overthrow the government in a failed coup attempt in July 2016 that killed around 300 people in total.
In recent years, bomb attacks claimed by, or blamed on, Kurdish fighters groups and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) have killed hundreds of security forces and civilians. Turkeys Presidency has traditionally been a largely neutral and ceremonial role, without many political responsibilities, as specified under the current constitution.
However, Erdogan has effectively transformed the office into a more politically active one after he became Turkeys first president to be elected by popular vote in 2014, following prior constitutional changes passed in a similar referendum in 2010. - AL JAZEERA

Finance sector to face tough conditions - FC Research
FC Research expects finance sector to face moderately tough conditions to operate with thinning margins and new LTV regulations leading to slower and previous but moderate credit growth.
Despite slow economic conditions rise in NPLs are likely to be slow amidst price appreciation in vehicle prices as bulk of the lending is attached to vehicles. We believe the larger finance companies have an advantage with lower cost of funding and large conversion levels from leases to loans which improves re-pricing abilities at times of rising interest rates.
With rising interest rates and bulk of the lending attached to leases finance sector is likely to experience a dip in margins while credit growth is expected to remain moderate around 16-18% despite deceleration from 2016. New LTV regulations also likely support the slower credit in 2017E.
Despite rise interest rates and slower economic conditions FC Research expects NPL provisions of finance companies to continue to stay on the back significant price appreciations in the second hand vehicle market.
Higher vehicle prices are likely to deter related borrowers from default while even if defaulted higher vehicles prices ensures finance companies of eliminating losses and recovering bad debts.
Finance companies with better rating and larger asset base tend to have a lower cost of funding while some finance companies have already converted significant portions from loans to leases enabling them to re-price part of the assets in line with interest rates. These two conditions being satisfied enables selected finance companies specifically identified as PLC, CFIN, LFIN, COCR and LOFC to perform better in tough environment. We expect the selected companies to provide an average total return on equal weightage of c.51% during a 12 month period.
Finance sector compriss of licensed finance companies (LFCs) and specialized leasing companies (SLCs) represent 6% of assets of the Sri Lankas financial system and consists of 46 LFCs and 7 SLCs with a network of 1,259 branches.

Firmino on target as Liverpool climb to third
LONDON, Sunday - Liverpool reclaimed third spot in the Premier League after Roberto Firminos header sealed a hard-fought 1-0 victory against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday.
West Brom created the best chances in a largely uneventful first half before Firmino nodded home Lucas flick on to register his 11th league goal of the season just before the break.
The visitors could have extended their lead after halftime but James Milner blazed a glorious opportunity over the bar and Divock Origi had a goal ruled out for offside.
Simon Mignolet made a crucial late save to deny Matt Phillips but, as West Brom piled on the pressure in the closing stages, Alberto Moreno missed an open goal after Ben Foster had come up for a corner.
Liverpool have 66 points from 33 games, although they have played one more game than Manchester City who sit two points adrift in fourth. West Brom, meanwhile, lie eighth with 44 points.
If you come away to West Brom you know what to expect and you must deal with it, Mignolet told Sky Sports.
We are very pleased with the performance and the three points is massive today. You feel the pressure after you see the other teams and their results but we have to look at ourselves and do our jobs.
After Manchester City were impressive 3-0 victors against Southampton on Saturday, Liverpool needed to respond in kind against a West Brom side who are notoriously strong at home.
The hosts, however, had failed to score in their previous three league fixtures, but carved out a couple of promising chances through Hal Robson-Kanu and Nacer Chadli.
A goalless halftime beckoned at the end of a cagey first half before Firmino rushed in at the back post to convert Lucas flick-on past goalkeeper Foster.
Liverpool started the second half brightly but as the match progressed the hosts slowly started to assert themselves with their best chance falling to Phillips, whose attempted chip was blocked by the onrushing Mignolet. Liverpool held on to claim a fifth victory in seven games but could have added a second goal in a bizarre finale after Foster was twice caught horribly out of position.
First Moreno shot wide with the goal gaping then Daniel Sturridge dwelled in possession before seeing a wayward pass intercepted.  Agencies

Fitch upgrades Continental Insurance to A(lka)
Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka-based Continental Insurance Lanka Limiteds (CILL) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating and National Long-Term Rating to A(lka) from A-(lka). The outlook is stable.
The upgrade reflects the non-life operators improving underwriting performance, satisfactory capitalisation, improving market franchise and prudent investment policy.
The company continued its disciplined approach to underwriting, which has resulted in an improved non-life combined ratio of below 100% for the last two years (2016 and 2015: 98%). CILL started booking net profit from 2012 - its third year of operation.
CILL has satisfactory capitalisation, as measured by its risk-based capital (RBC) ratio of 274%, compared with a regulatory minimum of 120%.
The rating upgrade also factors in Fitchs expectation of RBC being maintained comfortably above 200% in the medium term.
Management expects capitalisation to further improve amid continued profitability and low dividend pay outs.
CILLs franchise continues to improve and is supported by its expanding branch network and association with its corporate group -Melstacorp PLC and Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DIST, AAA(lka)/Rating Watch Negative (RWN)). CILLs market share by gross written premiums (GWP) improved to 4.3% at end-2016, from 3.6% at end-2015. Management expects further growth to moderate from the previous high levels, given the higher GWP.

## Title: Frozen Ceylon

Frozen Ceylon
In 1969, Colombo Cold Stores, the popular supplier of dairy and other food items marked its diamond jubilee by bringing out a short souvenir book titled Ceylon in our times 1894- 1969. While reporting various social/political/personal events of the seventy five years, the book gives numerous snapshots of the people and the temper of the era; invaluable insights to the lives and thoughts of years gone-by.
For instance, ice was a novelty to the Ceylonese then, its acquisition celebrated with rumbustious parties by the well to do.
We quote herein randomly, with minimum introduction or comment.
In 1894, the idea of a broad education was slowly spreading in the country. John M Ferguson observed thus twice as much is annually spent on intoxicating drink in Ceylon as on education and the teaching of Christianity-it is an English education that the nation, both Sinhalese and Tamils crave after.
The chief handicap to the spread of Buddhist education was the quarter mile rule introduced by J B Cull, the Director of Public Instruction, which prohibited new schools within  mile of an existing school.
In the field of Archaeology, the indefatigable HCP Bell climbed Sigiriya. Mr. Bells coolies went up like cats, carrying his camera fixed on their backs, and he took photographs of two pokunas at the top and a view of the Matale hills from the highest point.
These were the days when Indian labour spilled into the country. To the many gruesome and horrifying stories of the conditions in which these labourers came over can be added the personal reminiscence of Colonel Olcott of a sea voyage from Tuticorin to Colombo. Olcott had a cabin for himself but of the Indian labourers he says - The Indian coolies going over to work on Ceylon plantations, some hundreds of them, were all lumped together like a tin of worms for bait.
Electricity was introduced in the billiard room at the Bristol Hotel in 1894. The electricity was produced by a gas engine driven dynamo. The Grand Oriental Hotel successfully carried out experiments with incandescent gas, while a gas engine was fitted in the offices of the Observer.
Unannounced power disruptions
Without all the hot air generated by todays rapidly multiplying political caste, perhaps they were cooler times, and we did not need the life-saving fans and air-conditioners then! Talking of fans and air-conditioners, these modern conveniences were typically made futile once again by our Electricity Board on the 14 of April (New Year Day) when power went off in parts of Colombo from 2 p.m. to about 6 p.m.
Unannounced power disruptions are now a near everyday occurrence in our Capital city, often damaging electrical equipment. I am told that in Kandy, now sweltering in the April sun, power disruptions are a daily event. There are no explanations, and of course no apology from the Electricity Board. The people, the customers (really victims) of the monopolistic Electricity Board, are pushed to desperation in the murderous heat. In 1894, we did not have a designated Minister of Power nor graduates and PhDs from our universities running these things, and the government was able to introduce electricity to the country successfully.
Labour costs were low. In 1894, Ferguson wrote, In the Galle districts we have heard of Sinhalese women glad to pluck tea leaf for so low a wage as 12  cents a day. This must be the lowest rate in the island.
1894 saw the completion of the work on the Kelani Bridge, the river being spanned earlier by a bridge of boats. Carriages were the main mode of transport between towns. In Colombo a ferry service was operated between Slave Island and the Pettah. The ferry operated every five minutes and the fare was 2 cents.
In 1894 railway lines were extended from Haputale to Bandarawela, from Polgahawela to Kurunegala and from Ambalangoda to Galle. Ferguson observed with satisfaction How much railways have done here and in India to breakdown caste, dispel ignorance and even foster brotherliness.
Surveying the first decade of the present Century (20th ) EB Denham observed in his census report that earlier a gun, a cart or a hackery had been the sign of the well to do villager but these symbols have been gradually replaced by sewing machines and gramophones as the hallmark or respectability and wealth in the village.
Many of the imposing clubs of today started as tents or Cadjan sheds. A tent pitched on Charsley House, the residence of Ralph Tatham, was the first club house of the Colombo Garden Club. The Ceylon Turf Club which was started in 1848 was largely responsible for the formation of one of the Islands oldest clubs, the Colombo Club. Planters in Kandy had started the ABC Club in 1870; which later became the Kandy Sports Club.
The 1890s saw the birth of another of Ceylons oldest clubs, the Ceylon Kennel Club which held its inaugural meeting at Temple Trees, then a private residence; after the first ever dog show at the Race course in 1899 had attracted 203 entries. 1894 saw the formation of the Colombo Ladies Golf Club. The big match as far as the European planting community was concerned, was Dimbulla vs. Dickoya. The first ever European-Ceylonese cricket match had been played in 1887.
Meaningful careers
The things that did not happen in a countrys history are sometimes of more significance that events that took place. How different Ceylons present position would have been if the proposal to import Chinese labour for the plantation materialized, or if the Colonial Office agreed with the idea that Ceylon should be federated or annexed to India - a view that prevailed till as recently as the thirties.
Modernity was an imposition by an alien occupier, yet, its benefits were apparent to the natives; money in the pocket was redesigning the universe for them, property rights were enjoyed, new things were available plentifully in the market while new ideas were coming into their consciousness; meaningful careers were opening up.
But not everything that changed.
As the late JP De Fonseka observed there are meats and there is fish, but these are dependencies, mere colonies sub-serving the great empire of rice. He recalled Prof. Haeckels saying that the Sinhalese mans vision of heaven was a place supplied with an infinite variety of rice and curry.

Garbage disposal techniques : Lessons from the world
Sri Lanka disposes of the majority of its solid waste in landfills. This practice is cheap, but it comes with hidden costs, the most recent example being the landslide at Meethotamulla.
Many low-income and developing countries use landfills in favor of recycling or incinerating garbage, since it is the most cost-effective option. Developed countries, however, dispose of garbage in myriad ways that generate electricity or keep harmful waste out of the environment.
The following are short explanations of four different countries methods for managing their solid waste.
India
Indian urban areas alone produce over 100,000 metric tonnes of trash per day, and urban local bodies (ULBs) are generally responsible for collecting, separating, and transporting this garbage. But the majority of ULBs are under-equipped and underfunded, and they struggle to fulfill their trash-related duties.
Indian cities do not charge for waste collection, which puts financial pressure on the ULBs. In order to cut costs, the ULBs rarely separate trash and only pick up garbage from comparatively small areas. Very rarely is biodegradable waste separated out, and public awareness about recycling practices is very low.
Furthermore, waste collection from dumpsites is rare, and processing of garbage is rarely carried out. The ULBs often transport waste in open trucks and dump the garbage in open areas without treating it, leading to adverse environmental and health affects.
Hordes of rag pickers, or informal workers who come from the poorest sections of society, often provide the only real recycling in India, and they are vulnerable to adverse health effects due to their work and poor conditions. These people recycle up around 20 percent of the waste generated in the cities.
Solid waste is often dumped on the outskirts of cities, and, since urban areas in India have rapidly expanded, these dumping sites have become part of cities.
India has undertaken several projects to improve its waste management practices during the past ten years, and many cities have begun implementing better techniques, such as community-based waste collection and investments in improved technology.
Bhalswa Landfill in New Delhi, India
Singapore
Singapore faces particular difficulties in waste management and disposal since it simply lacks the space for massive landfills.
Though the country faced a garbage crisis in the late 1990s, by 2000, Singapore was producing 7,600 tonnes of waste per day, and its landfills were stuffed to the limit.
But in 2001, the government started a program that encouraged people to reduce the amount of waste generated, reuse what they could, and recycle the rest. On top of this, the government set up waste sorting and recycling programs for residences, schools, offices, and factories.
As of 2015, Singapore sent just 2 percent of its solid waste to landfills, recycled 60 percent, and incinerated the remaining 38 percent to generate electricity, according to the Wall Street Journal. The country boasts four waste-to-energy plants, which produce about 3 percent of the countrys electricity.
Waste sorting in Singapore
Sweden
That Sweden diverts 99 percent of its waste from landfills sounds great on paper, but the reality of the countrys waste management program is a bit less rosy.
It is true that less than 1 percent of household waste ends up in landfills. The governments assertion, however, that 99 percent of the countrys waste is recycled simply is not true.
Swedens waste management system relies heavily on incinerating trash in order to generate electricity and heat homes. 2.2 million tonnes of Swedens total of 4.4 million tonnes of annual household waste are converted to power using waste-to-energy technology. This technology burns trash to produce steam, which is then used to produce electricity. Sweden has drained its landfills of useful trash, and it has recently started importing garbage, primarily from England and Norway, to maintain its energy generation system.
The results of this practice are somewhat mixed, as it reportedly takes more energy to incinerate waste and manufacture replacements than it does to recycle and reuse. Also, the burning of trash produces a large quantity of carbon dioxide, more so than the burning of coal. Critics of the practice have complained that converting waste to energy actually makes it more difficult to implement more sustainable waste management practices. But others laud the Swedish system, saying that it solves the issues of waste buildup and energy production simultaneously.
Experts have lauded Sweden for recycling and reusing around 50 percent of its annual household waste.
Waste recycling in Sweden
Japan
Japan has some of the strictest waste sorting procedures around. In some cases, paper must be separated from envelopes, and food waste must be segregated from other biodegradable material.
Furthermore, trash sorting and collection is carried out at the municipal level, so each town has its own system. For example, Tokyos 23 wards have different waste-sorting systems.
You might think that sorting trash is necessary for fostering a robust recycling programme, but this is not the case; just over 20 percent of Japans solid waste is recycled. The lions share is burnt.
Japan is yet another country that depends on waste-to-energy systems to generate power. Historically dependent on nuclear power plants for electricity, Japan has increased investment in waste incineration systems to solve its energy shortages and solid waste buildup.
The average person generates around 356 kilograms of solid waste per year, and Japan produces 45,360,000 tons of municipal waste per year. Since Japan does not have much land, burning the trash has presented itself as a viable waste management solution.
Critics, however, claim that Japan can do better with recycling, as evidenced by its PET plastic bottle-recycling scheme that has reduced Japans need to import petroleum-based resources to make PET bottles by 90 percent.

I have completed a modeling course at Zsaid Images Modeling Academy which was headed by Rozanne Dias and I have walked the runaway for top designers such as Michael Wijesuriya and choreographers like Lou Chin. So the tips, advice and guidance I have received during my journey as a model are numerous. One expert tip from Lou Chin for the runaway was Your shoulders should stay still as you walk and they shouldnt move much at all.
What is your greatestcontribution to the community
Being generous and giving dana. I will contribute to the needy, animals and donate to religious places in anyway thats possible for me on a regular basis.
If you become the winner of TopInternational Model of the World, what would you do
Top International Model of the World is an international organization specialized in model pageants and the goal is to recognize the top/super model among its contestants participating from all around the world.
If I win a title from the pageant this year in Bulgaria, I would excel in my modeling journey, support young models in going forward, participate in events contributing to the country and try for the next best title.
How do you see your futurefrom now
In 5 to 10 years I will be happily married with children, a successful businessman with my own brand, a super model with international recognition and representing Sri Lanka whenever I am given opportunities.
What are you currently involvedin and what is coming up
My recent work was a few runaway fashion/bridal shows for industry veterans such as DhanajayaBandara, PremasiriHewawasam and Ramani Fernando. I also won the title of Mister Sri Lanka 2017. So currently I am taking some time off to prepare myself for the international pageant  Top International Model of the World in Bulgaria. However I accommodate modeling work as it comes and I will be shooting for a press campaign shortly.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will take place after Infinity War and more details

WithGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2soon to hit cinemas, there's one question bound to arise from the film's publicity tour: what aboutVol. 3
A question James Gunn decided to preempt and answer onFacebook, by confirming that he will return to both write and direct a third instalment of Marvel's space-adventuring franchise.
"Much of whats happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading, in a big way, to the AvengersInfinity War," he wrote. "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3will happen after all that. It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond."
He also wrote about how his decision to take on a third film wasn't one he boarded idly, as: "In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula  and some of the other forthcoming heroes  goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit. And, like in both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, we will work on creating the story that goes beyond what you expect."
"I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far."
"I couldnt do it for the money, and I couldnt do it because it was what other people wanted me to do. I needed to do it because it was what I needed to do. I have never made choices in my career based on anything other than passion and love for the stories and characters, and I didnt want to start now."
The film sees the return of Chris Pratt's Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana's Gamora, and Dave Bautista's Drax; alongside Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lending their voices to Rocket and Baby Groot. Michael Rooker's Yondu and Karen Gillan's Nebula also return, potentially as new members of the Guardians; while Pom Klementieff and Kurt Russell join as Mantis and Ego the Living Planet, thelatter happening to be Star-Lord's dad.
The sequel is set two-to-three months after the first film, as the Guardians come face-to-face with a new threat and Elizabeth Debicki's Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and leader of the Sovereign people.

Harden powers Rockets past Westbrook's Thunder
WASHINGTON Monday: James Harden scored 37 points as the Houston Rockets routed Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder 118-87 in the opening game of their NBA playoff series on Sunday.
Harden outclassed fellow MVP candidate Westbrook also delivering nine assists and seven rebounds for the Rockets who take a 1-0 lead into game two on Wednesday.
Tonight was a good game but it is just one win, Harden said. We have to be ready to go for Wednesday. Westbrook tallied 22 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists but he also made nine turnovers and missed 17 of 23 shot attempts.
Harden and Westbrook are considered the frontrunners in the league MVP race. But Westbrook's individual brilliance doesn't always translate into Thunder victories.
The Rockets held Westbrook to just seven points in the second half as they stretched a five point halftime lead to 33 points.
As good as Harden was Sunday he also got plenty of help from a strong supporting cast.
Patrick Beverley scored a postseason career high 21 points while Nene chipped in 15 points off the bench for Houston. Beverley also shut down Westbrook defensively when it mattered the most.
Houston shot 49.5 percent from the floor while Oklahoma City shot 37 percent from the field.

The Akkaraipattu Municipal Commissioner A. L. M. Azmi has informed that any hotel or eating house situated within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council area found to be hazardous to sanitation and health, serious action will be taken against such hotels or eating houses.
The Municipal Commissioner further said that if hotels and eating houses are not hygienic, action will be taken to close down such hotels or eating houses. Some of the eating houses and tea boutiques within the Akkaraipattu Municipal area are unhygienic.
They let the used dirty water flow to the drain bordering the main road which gives a bad smell. The stagnated water in the drain can lead to the spread of dengue mosquitoes. The hotel owners have been repeatedly notified of the unhealthy condition of their eating houses and hotels in writing as well.
These hotel owners and eating houses have been warned by the Municipal Council with regards to sanitation and maintenance of hygienic condition in the hotels, said Municipal Commissioner Azmi.
He also said final notices will be served on defaulting hotel owners. Following this there will be a final inspection of hotels and eating houses and the assistance of police and court have been sought to implement this programme.
The defaulting hotel owners will be blacklisted and their hotels will be closed down permanantly.

IMF warnings of US protectionism rubbish, says Ross
Warnings of US protectionism by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, and others are rubbish, Donald Trumps top trade official has said in a new attack on the big trade surpluses of China, Europe and Japan.
Speaking ahead of the arrival in Washington of global finance officials for this weeks IMF and World Bank spring meetings, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said those accusing the Trump administration of protectionism were firing at the wrong target.
The billionaire investor, who Trump has put in charge of trade policy and tasked with finding ways to reduce the USs $500bn trade deficit, said veiled criticism by Ms Lagarde and other defenders of multilateralism about rising protectionism were clearly aimed at the new administration.
It is! It is! And the response is very simple: we are the least protectionist of the major areas. We are far less protectionist than Europe. We are far less protectionist than Japan. We are far less protectionist than China, he told the Financial Times in an interview.
We also have trade deficits with all three of those places. So they talk free trade. But in fact what they practise is protectionism. And every time we do anything to defend ourselves, even against the puny obligations that they have, they call that protectionism. Its rubbish.
His remarks came amid signs that Trump is beginning to adopt a more moderate tone on trade, choosing last week not to label China a currency manipulator despite campaign threats to do so. That has been taken as evidence by some that the internationalists within his White House, such as former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, are winning hard-fought policy battles against the economic nationalists.
But Mr Ross, who straddles the two camps, insisted that, despite any apparent softening, the Trump administration remained intent on pursuing its America first agenda while shaking up Washingtons global trading relationships. He also made clear it saw the Bretton Woods system as partly responsible for what it considers to be the unfair state of things. www.ft.com

Of lyrics and tunes
Inscriptions on his soul through the passage of time by time itself have made him a sensitive young man. Daily News features Tharindu Weerasinghe a poetic and aesthetic young man.
Q: How did you develop the aesthetic part of your life
A: Yes I have a good record both in academics and extracurricular aspects. When it comes to aesthetics (writing, compering, singing) I improved them by constantly engaging with them during my school days as well as undergraduate days. I was more focused on announcing and writing more than any other aesthetic aspect as I loved them a lot. I improved myself by doing more of them (with experience I guess)
Q: You are into writing songs and recently have done a song for WD Ariyasinghe. Can you tell me a little bit about that song
A:. Yes, I consider this as an achievement too, because I am lucky to pen a song which was sung by a famous artist such as W D Ariyasinghe. Darshana composed this song and he came up with a lovely melody, and then we decided to ask W D Ariyasinghe to sing it, and he accepted the invitation and sang. The end result is very good.
Q: You are a lyricist, prose writer and poet. What inspires you in life How did you become so creative
A: I think my surroundings made me a writer more than anything else. (the things happening around me and society; how people suffer, how people celebrate, how people sacrifice, how people become selfish. I normally write about us, which means human life. So I have enhanced the born-in-talent of writing with these surroundings.
Q: You are a multi-talented individual. From where does this genius come from
A: Well, if philosophically speaking, I might have inherited them (or some of them) from the earlier existence.
Q: You are a master of ceremonies/ compere. How did you build up your reputation
A: I was engaged in announcing during my school days. We had a media club that conducted a broadcasting program. At Maliyadeva College during my school days I built up my reputation. Also during my university days also I was a renowned compere. The climax in my announcing career came when I won the best announcer (Sinhala) in the University of Peradenya in 2005. (In the Literary Festival organized by the Peradeniya Students Union) Because of that, I got a chance to be a part time presenter at SLRCs Educational Programs which was named as 3 to 5.
Since I was compeering in many functions (professional gatherings, indoor musical shows, felicitation programs, product launches) both during and after Peradeniya era, I think I earned a good reputation. I compeer both in Sinhala and English medium.
Q: You have written for many newspapers including the Daily News. How did you acquire your enviable writing skills
A: Yes, I was a freelancer and I think even now I am a freelancer. As I have mentioned earlier as well, I improved by continuous engagement.
Q: What is the latest in your life
A.: During the past five to six years I have been very focused on my professional career. With this new song with WD Ariyasinghe I feel I have made a break through - sort of breaking any shackles that may have been there.
Q: How big a strength has your family been to you
A: My parents and my wife and my one and only sister are the pillars of my success. (Not to forget my beloved teachers and helpful relatives) Without them, I am nobody. Personally, I am lucky to have good wife who is supportive and understanding. She is Sunimali and we are blessed with a lovely daughter of 5 years, Senulya.
Q: To whom or to what do you credit your achievements
A: Well, it is obvious - my parents, teachers, wife and sister and also my close friends who are always with me through it all.
Q: What do you count as your unique strengths What do you feel are your strengths What are the challenges you have encountered in life and overcome What are your triumphs
A: In lay-terms, I think my unique strength is handling multiple things at once. Sometimes it is my downfall as well, but I see it as a plus point. There is a saying: If you want to get something done, then give it to a busy person I think I would like to be this busy person.
But philosophically my strength is the attachment I have to Buddhism. Well, we call it as Shraddha. I think I am on the correct path.
Q: Do you have any spiritual beliefs
A: I always try to follow Buddhism and its the Philosophy that can show us the path to enlightenment one day. At least I am trying my best to keep in touch with the philosophy.

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has decided to prohibit the dumping of garbage on any State land owned by it with effect from May 1. However, if any Municipal Council, Pradesheeya Sabha or a State institution needed a plot of land to dump garbage, it will have to settle the cost involved from its own provisions. A press release by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry issued yesterday stated that the UDA has come forward to rehabilitate the Kolonnawa garbage dump and the adjourning land with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army.
It is reported that 69 houses had been destroyed up to now from the Meethotamulle tragedy. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said steps would be taken to provide a new house in place of those destroyed if the government provided the funds.
Although some are blaming politicians, government officers and State institutions for the recent tragedy, this was not a problem which cropped up in recent times. Whenever intervention was made over the last two decades to resolve this problem it had to be abandoned in the face of political and public protests.
The Ministry submitted a special cabinet memorandum on the Meethotamulla garbage dump in February this year. The Colombo Municipal Council had been advised to stop dumping garbage in Kolonnawa and identify alternative places.
When then Mayor of Colombo Karu Jayasuriya joined hands with them, Chief Minister Susil Premajayantha brought a proposal to create a systematic garbage dump for Colombo in Meepe with World Bank assistance but it was abandoned when politicians of all hues in the area joined hands and protested saying they did not want Colombos garbage. When they tried to set up an alternative dump in a forest area in Waga with CEA Koika aid, that too had to be abandoned due to political protests. A proposal to use the limestone mines in Puttalam to dump Colombos waste too had to be abandoned.
Alternative places selected by the CMC to dump garbage too had to be similarly abandoned due to public protests.
The Meethotamulla tragedy is not a natural disaster but a process caused by social problems. People had continuously objected to the dumping of garbage in this place and as such, the government had a responsibility regarding it and it was acting accordingly.

Military ready to release lands if govt. gives orders: Army Commander
Military does not have the authority to forcefully acquire lands and permission of the government authorities<U+200B> is required<U+200B> to release these lands, the Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Chrishanthe De Silva <U+200B>informed <U+200B>the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday.
He said if the government authorities give the orders, lands can be released immediately. He was speaking at a meeting held between Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, TNA MPs and military officers yesterday.
Another two meetings will be held on April 19 and 20 in Mullaitivu and Jaffna between the TNA MPs,<U+200B> <U+200B>representatives<U+200B> of the protesters<U+200B>, military and government officials to discuss the issue of lands under the Army. The officials will also visit the lands.
People in Koppapilavu and Mullikulam have continued to protest over the lands. The Opposition Leader said it was fair for the people to protest over the lands held by the army. He added that the meeting was organised to provide quick solutions to the continuous protests held by the people.
Its been years since the war ended. We insisted that it is the responsibility of the government to protect the rights of the people. They have the right to live in their own lands, he said.
He further said he and MP M.A. Sumanthiran had discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena last Saturday with regard to releasing these lands. He said it was following the meeting with the President that a meeting with military officials was arranged.
The Army Commander said they do not have the authority to acquire the lands. The lands were released following the instructions of the government authorities and they are ready to release the lands if the government authorities <U+200B>give the <U+200B>order<U+200B>s<U+200B>, he said. Sampanthan said the Army Commander pointed out that they need some time to shift their camps from peoples lands and the government has to allocate money to do that<U+200B> as well.

Moments and musings, cuts and glances
This article was written based on the book Australian Cricket Anecdotes by Gideon Haigs, I hope the readers will bear with the strong words used at times which is typical of the Aussies.
The book states as follows, More gruesome fun was had at the expense of the Sri Lankans, whom Australia met in their next World Cup match in 1975. When Anura Tennakoons team showed unexpected resistance, Chappell gave Jeff Thomson carte blanche to retard their progress.
Anyway I hit this bloke Mendis (Duleep) on the head. They are only little fellas so you couldnt call it a bouncer exactly. He fell down face first, and when they brought him around, his captain was saying: youll be right or something or other.
But Mendis just says: Oh my God I am going. He went and he was not coming back! They took him to hospital.
But the real trouble came when I hit Wettimuny on the foot. He was waltzing around and he wanted to go too. That was enough for him. Id already hit him in the chest. As I walked past him at the end of the over I said to him: Look its not broken you weak bastard. I said: Ill give you the tip------if you are down the next over it will be!
His captain gives him the pep talk, you know, stick around, Ill look after you sort of caper. Then the captain obligingly just blocked out Dennis to make sure he wasnt going to get down to my end!
So this poor bastard was facing me again, and the ball landed in exactly the same spot and whacked him straight on the instep.You should have seen him---jumping around he was.
This is where the plot went to action. The ball had come straight back up the pitch to me, and as I collected it, the boys are yelling out Throw down the stumps, two up throw down the stumps!
I am saying No, no, no, I cant do that, noall in a split second. Then I thought bugger it! and threw the ball and knocked the stumps over. I jumped up and shouted an appeal, but no other bastards moved. They all sat or stood there with their arms folded! They had done me stone cold on purpose. Tommo (Frith) pp 56-7.
An Unusual Congregation
Chappells Australians were renowned for their pranks, Doug Walters frequently their instigator. Journalist Peter McFarline recalled this one from the night after Australia beat Pakistan in the opening match of the 1975 World Cup.
One fast bowler over indulged a trifle in his favorite drink and was kindly led to bed, non-compos mentis, by some team mates.
This did not miss the attention of Mr. Walters who was attending a party given by some local people. He promised them early morning fun, somehow found a lectern and a bible and set them up at the scene of the party.
In a super human effort, he half coaxed, half carried the inebriated fast bowler clad only in his pyjama bottoms to the party and demanded he read from the bible. Halfway through the amazing performance the bowlers only piece of clothing slipped quietly to the floor to the amusement of the congregation. Our fast bowler, stumbled on, blissfully unaware of his nakedness. - Cricketer, February 1980 p18
Crying in the Chappell
Ian Chappell played his last first class cricket in 1979-80, disappearing with little fanfare but with an unequalled reputation as a taskmaster. South Australian apprentice seamer Ross McLellan had this rueful reminiscence of his first match for South Australia against the Englishmen in November 1979.
I had a really good game. I played under the captaincy of Ian Chappell, failed to take a wicket and dropped Geoff Boycott. That was like dropping Jesus while playing under God.
The Australians by and large are friendly type of people but when it comes to sport, they have this win at any cost attitude. Although the country is large, and their numbers are small still they have produced fantastic sportsmen and women. They are superbly fit as well, and as Asanka Gurusinha has so rightly said our cricketers need to be fit and 100% fit first and foremost.
It would be handy to inculcate the go getter attitude to our young cricketers from early days. Gone are the days when we had to be submissive to the White Sahibs and the time has come to show them who the masters are. The road to recovery is long, hard and bumpy but a determined effort by the people up above could see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Mumbai Indians top table after fourth win
MUMBAI: Mumbai Indian cruised to their fourth win in five games and claimed the top spot in the IPL 2017 points table from Kolkata Knight Riders with a six-wicket win against Gujarat Lions at the Wankhede stadium on Sunday (April 16). Brendon McCullum (64 off 44) and Dinesh Karthik (48 off 26) struck crucial knocks for the visitors but Nitish Rana (53 off 36) and Kieron Pollard (40 off 29) ensured Mumbai Indians emerged victorious in front of the partisan crowd.
The match was neatly poised in the chase with 71 needed off last seven overs. Mumbai had just recovered from a mini wobble where they had lost Nitish Rana and Jos Buttler (26) in quick succession. With concerns mounting over Rohit Sharmas form, this was his chance to guide the team home. Rohit played a sensible innings of an unbeaten 29-ball 40 while Pollard smashed his way to 39 off 23 to create an easy passage to the win.
Lions had been put under pressure throughout the game but did well to absorb it and fight their way through. However, Mumbai Indians bossed the last seven overs to snatch the win.
Nitish Rana has been the find of the IPL 2017 so far. Two half-centuries in the tournament has helped him become the highest run-getter after 16 games this season. After the failure against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rana gave Mumbai the perfect platform to launch an assault in the end.
Rana walked in in the very first over after Praveen Kumar dismissed Parthiv Patel for a duck. He was dropped by Jason Roy, when on 9, off the bowling of Basil Thampi. The score was 11 for 1 at that stage. By the time Rana was dismissed in the 10th over, the score had swelled to 85, with Rana contributing to 53 off those.
On a dry Wankhede surface, Lions had lost Dwayne Smith early after being asked to bat. Both Brendon McCullum and Suresh Raina found it hard to get going as Mumbai made a good start with the ball. Thats when McCullums resilience came to the fore. While Raina continued to chug along, McCullum collected the crucial boundaries to take the score to 46 for 1 at the end of the powerplay. It was then that the former New Zealand captain gave the inning the much-needed impetus even as he lost Raina from the other end.
He took on Harbhajan Singh and Lasith Malinga while Ishan Kishan, who walked in at No. 4, struggled against some quality bowling. McCullum stroked a 44-ball 64 before he was bowled by Lasith Malinga in the 14th over.
The scorecard at that stage read 99 for 3 and there was plenty of work left to be done considering the chasing capabilities of Mumbai. Dinesh Karthik has been exceptional for the franchise so far and carried on with his good form, smashing an unbeaten 26-ball 48. What stood out from Karthik was that he was able to take runs off the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah and Malinga, propelling the team to a very competitive total.
Malinga conceded 51 runs, the most he has given away in any IPL game, from his four overs for his one wicket while Bumrah leaked 45 runs from his four overs. Thats 96 runs from eight overs from bowlers who are accustomed to bowling at the death and have done it considerably well. This also highlights how crucial Karthiks effort was as he helped the team collect 41 runs in the last three overs.
Lions will return to home comforts after the loss and will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 18 in an evening clash. Mumbai, on the other hand, will travel to Indore to take on Kings XI Punjab on April 20. - TOI

Nawaloka Hospitals renews MoU, partnership with National Insurance Trust Fund
Nawaloka Hospitals renewed their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), which was signed in 2015 to provide a significant healthcare partnership to benefit Government employees.
This landmark partnership provides the 2.5 million beneficiaries of the NITF and their family members with access to the myriad of high quality healthcare services provided by Nawaloka Hospitals at concessionary rates. The MoU was signed by NITFs CEO Sanath C De Silva and Chairman Manjula De Silva. Signatories from Nawaloka were Director Harshith Dharmadasa and Head of Finance & Corporate Planning, Nalaka Niroshana.
We are pleased to renew this agreement with Nawaloka Hospitals this year. Their flexibility and high quality of services makes them an ideal partner. With the cost of medical facilities and claims escalating agreements like these are critical in curtailing those rising costs to benefit the recipient and ensure that the total fabric of their life, including their financial viability after leaving the hospital, is protected, said Sanath C. De Silva, CEO National Insurance Trust Fund.
Nawaloka Hospitals is a pioneer in the healthcare sector with the most advanced facilities in Colombo and Negombo. Driven by their vision to be the Hospital of Tomorrow, Nawaloka continues to innovate to provide their patients and their families with extraordinary levels of service. Their latest innovation, medical packages, takes away the worries of unexpected medical costs and lets patients know the cost of treatment from the moment they are admitted.
We see this partnership as invaluable to the betterment of our public service employees and our nation. As a provider of the finest healthcare services in the country, it is important that we remove any financial barriers people may face that would prevent them from seeking the best healthcare and help them focus on the sole purpose of getting better. And now, the services are available for residents of Wattala or Puttalam will be able to receive world class treatment at our Nawaloka Hospital in Negombo. This is yet another step we have taken to provide our services to patients with ease and convenience and quality healthcare wherever they may reside, said Harshith Dharmadasa, Director Nawaloka Hospitals.
Nawaloka entered the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985 and was set up to mirror reputed hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical care. With its entry the private healthcare system took root in Sri Lanka and people were provided with an alternative to seeking specialised treatment outside the country. The hospital was a pioneering initiative that built an impeccable reputation and has been at the forefront of the Sri Lankan healthcare sector for over three decades.

NFFCER takes Ceylon Electricity engineers to task
Ceylon Electricity engineers pay has increased by a whopping 113 per cent in just three years from 2012 while the Ceylon Electricity Board is running at a daily loss of Rs.50 million, the National Front For Consumer and Environmental Rights (NFFCER) yesterday disclosed at a press conference.
NFFCER President and lawyer Namal Rajapaksa said the boards engineers have worked out these increments by allegedly flouting the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEBs) pay increment rules and employment agreements. The press conference was held at the National Library and Documentation Services Board.
He alleged that the Ceylon Electricity engineers have unlawfully obtained two pay increments for the period between 2012 and 2015 creating a huge salary anomaly in the CEB.
This has created unprecedented tensions in the institution compelling some parties to pursue cases against CEB in Courts, he said.
The Attorney General, who would appear for state officials and government agencies in normal circumstances, has refused to appear for CEB in this instance, he said. .
The people in this country have been made to suffer the disadvantage of having to pay 10 to 15 percent of their salaries as electricity bills to the board because of the CEB Engineers Associations power mafia allegedly messing up things within the CEB, he pointed out.
Their mafia is even stronger than the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) mafia that has put poor patients at risk from time to time, he said.
The people are caught in the CEB engineers mafia 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. From the richest businessman to the poorest man is caught in this mafia.
It has been learned that they are presently trying to get another pay increase through a Cabinet paper by influencing Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, he said.
They planned this for the New Year for they are reflecting on the possibility that they might get an adverse Court ruling against their cases so that they may be gratified with their desired increments and perks at the end of the day, Rajapaksa said.
To our understanding, the mafia of the CEB Engineers Association has made most of the power and energy ministers in the country to be submissive to their whims and fancies except former Power and Energy Minister Champika Ranawaka,he said ,they however gave him a hard time.
He also criticised CEB higher-ups and engineers for preventing the influx of investors to the country. One way or the other, they will not let alternative energy investments happen so that they can continue to benefit from their lucrative earnings from existing coal power plants.
They have already established the dominance of a number of private energy companies within the CEB, he said.
NFFCER National Organiser Chameera Perera said with the change of the government in 2015, much was expected by the public in terms of reversing the situation that had taken place in state agencies, such as the CEB.
One wonders if elements of the former regime are still active at the CEB, and whether the country is being dragged to a political culture that had been experienced in the near past, he said.
NFFCER Women Activist Priyadarshani Ariyaratna said with over 1,200 CEB engineers getting abrupt 113 percent pay increase from 2012, a vicious circle has been created within the CEB. The engineers are recruited at an initial rate of Rs.97,920 with an additional vehicle payment of Rs.15,000, she said.
A laborer is recruited at a salary point of Rs.30,520.
Besides CEB engineers get what is called a post-graduate allowance, a disturbance allowance of 30 percent, a generation allowance, remote station allowance, coverage allowance which is one third of the pay a hardship allowance which is 15 percent of the pay, and an administration allowance  one third of the pay.
They even get a brain drain allowance, which is 30 percent of the pay among other scholarship allowances, vehicle allowances and housing loans, she said and added, this explains why that the consumers have to pay so much for their electricity bills, and why that the prices keep on increasing.

Oman opens premier free port facility for Lankan exporters
In a new breakthrough for Sri Lankan exports sector, one of the fastest growing free ports in the world, and one of the biggest free-ports in the powerful Gulf Cooperation Council has opened its doors to Sri Lanka.
This is with unparalleled incentives of entry hitherto not offered by other free ports in the world-and historic Ceylon Tea, and several other Lankan sectors, are the immediate beneficiaries in the proposed win-win play.
Sri Lanka has multiple benefits beyond exports when starting at Sohar which can be Sri Lankas main manufacturing and re-exports base in the Middle East, said acting Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry for Diplomatic Affairs of Sultanate of Omans Dr. Mohammed bin Awad Al Hassan on April 6 in Colombo after meeting Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
Omans four famous free economic zones are Sohar, Al Mazunah, Salalah and Duqm. We like to discuss the possibility of a Ceylon Tea Hub in Sohar Free Port and Free Zones newest phase.
You can process, blend Ceylon Tea and re-export to the entire Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, the Indian Sub-Continent and East Africa, almost duty free.
From Zohar, Ceylon Tea and other Lankan exports can reach 3.5 billion consumers in the Gulf region straight away. Sohar is Omans joint venture with the Port of Rotterdam and this is one of the fastest developing ports cum economic zones anywhere in the world. Sohar zone is more than 11,000 acres (4,500 hectares). Its first phase has been completed and almost all the space has been taken by 16 global companies. Vast amount of space is available for Sri Lankan exporters to set up with us in Phase II.
The GCCs logistics market is estimated to be one of the fast growing sectors at a valuation exceeding US $70 billion, with Oman playing a lead role in it with Saudi Arabia and UAE.

PM vows to strengthen SL, Vietnam relations
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes official visit to Vietnam has opened a new chapter in the history of mutual relations existing between the two countries, said Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
He was addressing the media after the Conclusion of Sri Lanka - Vietnam bilateral talks held at the Presidents House in Hanoi on April 17 morning.
He said he was thankful to Sri Lanka for the friendship and co-ordiality always extended towards Vietnam and its people.
The Vietnamese Prime Minister who emphasised that Sri Lanka is a strong nation situated in a vital and significant place in the Indian ocean, added that the two countries had reached an agreement to improve bilateral relations between them in fields of fuel, gas, infrastructure facilities, Information and Communication technology, textiles and garments, processing and destruction of agri and fishery products, renewable energy, airline services, education and tourism sectors.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out that relations between Sri Lanka and Vietnam were historic and long standing. It was due to Vietnam that the initial foundation was laid for the establishment of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Trade relations had existed between the two country from King Parakramabahus era.
Premier Wickremesinghe said as Asian countries they should take joint action to bestow a better future for the future generation, on the basis of past experiences. He who pointed out that both Vietnam and Sri Lanka had to face a cruel war, stressed that both countries had now reached a development path and become middle income earning countries.
The Prime Minister said Vietnam is a country which faced a cruel war 30 years ago. Vietnam had fought against French and US forces.
After protecting the country with great agony and suffering, it is now moving towards rapid economic development. We too who faced a 30-year-war are following in the footsteps or Vietnam to march towards rapid economic development with the objective of providing better living standards for the people. It is to have broader discussions regarding this matter that we arrived in Vietnam after accepting an invitation extended by the Prime Minister of Vietnam. This will be a good opportunity for the National Government set up under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Vietnam is not a new country but a country we had forgotten. It is due to Vietnam that we received Theravada Buddhism, said Premier Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister said they reached an agreement to increase trade and economic relations between Vietnam and Sri Lanka up to 1,000 million US dollars. Let us move forward by profiting from our experiences. This visit has helped to start a new chapter in the relations between the two countries.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also extended an invitation to the Vietnamese Prime Minister to undertake a visit to Sri Lanka in order to further cement mutual relations between the two countries.

Politics in garbage
The cracks on the walls were too large for Rasika Sanjeewa, 41, to ignore; a threewheel driver by profession and the father of three, he, along with his family, left his home next to the Meethotamulla garbage dump three weeks ago, wanting to spend his New Year in relative safety.
When he came home on Friday afternoon to check on the cracks, he witnessed his home being completely demolished an enveloped by a mountain of garbage.
We returned to check on our home after having lunch at a friends house. We stopped the vehicle on the street in front of the house when my daughter screamed that there was water flooding into the street. When we looked up, the mountain of garbage had collapsed, and the ground shook as it came tumbling down, shifting and burying the houses at the bottom, said Sanjeewa, who managed to escape a few feet away from his house, which used to stand 30m away from the dumpsite.
According to Sanjeewa, the Meethotamulla tragedy; a disaster which has thus far killed 28, could have been easily prevented.
The cracks in our homes were quite visible. Three weeks ago, we complained to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner and asked that we at least be given six months rent until more suitable accommodation is found or compensation given, said Sanjeewa.

Their request, however, yielded only partial results as only a few of the affected residents received aid and the rest were told to wait.
Sanjeewa said, The foundations of our houses were being raised over the last few weeks; the weight of the dump was too much. On 12th morning, we visited the Commissioner again and complained that we could not spend the New Year with children like this. On 12th evening, they called us back and said a solution would be given to us after the New Year. This is the solution we got.
The authorities just do not care for our neighbourhood. If they paid more attention, this would not have happened, he added.
Colombo Municipal council Commissioner V.K. Anura, in the meantime, blamed the recent heavy rains for the collapse of the garbage mountain and added that people had been warned to evacuate the area many times.
The CMC warned the people to evacuate the place and informed them that it was a high risk area, but they refused to listen. They assaulted the CMC workers and chased them whenever they went to Meethotamulla to clean the canals surrounding the dump so there would be better water flow. The drains were cleaned except the place where the garbage dump collapsed. The people there did not let us carry out our work, he said.
Anura further said that the people in that area, including the President of the Movement against the Garbage Dump at Meethotamulla Lawyer Nuwan Bopage, were partly responsible for the collapse as they refused to let CMC manage the place.
Sanjeewa, however, said they had tried their best to get the CMC authorities to clean the drains,
We had to force them to bring their backhoes down and clean it. We never beat anyone up when they came to clean, the authorities just dont care or come to our neighbourhood, he said.
Looking for solutions
The issue of garbage is not a new one, and for several decades, consequent governments have struggled with its management.
Prior to Meethotamulla, the site of contention was Bloemendhal where Colombos garbage found its way home since 1997. After several disasters and explosions, the Supreme Court ruled in 2009, that waste could no longer be dumped at Bloemendhal and needed to be shifted to another site; they asked the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to assist the CMC in acquiring a land for such a purpose temporarily until a more permanent solution is found. In 2009, the UDA offered two acres of UDA land in Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa, to be used as landfill site for waste from Colombo. The temporary solution, eight years later, refused to budge.
Over the last eight years, there have been around 60-70 projects brought to deal with the waste in Meethotamulla, but the UDA has rejected all of them. Even the Western Provincial Council Chief Ministers proposals were rejected," said Member of the Kolonnawa Urban Council Saliya Wickramasinghe as he stressed that the two acres in Meethotamulla was only to be used for two years, but has now extended to 17 acres, eight years on.
He further explained that the UDA, under the previous government, was controlled by then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and it was he who directed the whole project at the time,
Gotabhaya got the army to clean the surrounding canals and maintain the dump, but they did not stop dumping of the garbage, he said.
In 2014, the dumpsite collapsed on a minor scale and damaged 20 houses in its wake.
After the present collapse, however, President Sirisena had directed that all dumping in Meethotamulla be stopped and the sites of Dompe and Karadiyana be used temporarily for the next two weeks until a more permanent site is found. Shifting garbage from one site to another, however, has not been easy, and the last time the government proposed a site in Ja-Ela, protests from the public prevented garbage being moved there.
An uneasy CMC Commissioner tasked with getting a new landfill site said that there was no need to specify on a site or where the garbage wash going as long as Colombo City was clean.
This is a national issue. The President and the Prime Minister are looking for ways to solve this issue. This is not only Colombo garbage. People from all parts of the country come to Colombo. More than 600,000 people come every morning for work and they throw their waste here. We also clean Pettahs daily supply of vegetables and all the other items to other parts of the country. The waste remains in Colombo, said Anura.
Solutions offered
As the problem worsened, in 2014, the previous government proposed the solution of transporting the waste generated in Colombo and surrounding suburbs to Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam District by railway transportation. An amount of $107 million was allocated for the project by cabinet. The garbage was then to be used as fuel in the Holcim factory.
In 2015, the new government axed the plan due to various environmental concerns and public protest as a result of the plan. Minister of Megapolis and Western Province Development, Champika Ranawaka, said the Puttlam sites proximity to the Wilpattu Wildlife sanctuary had caused concern,
But if theres no solution, it will be not only Wilpatttu that will be destroyed but Colombo too if the Kelani river on which three million people depend for water is polluted by waste, Ranawaka said at the time.
Another solution which has been proposed for the last decade or so is the converting of garbage into electricity. In June, 2010, Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by the then Minister of Environment Anura Priyadarshana Yapa to use garbage from Bloemendhal to generate power. The project did not see the light of day.
To make recycling efforts more effective, the separation of waste at the point of collection is important. According to the CMC, 200 metric tons of waste can be reduced at the point of collection, if they are separated. Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, in July, 2016, decreed that all waste needed to be separated if it is to be collected but few local government authorities have implemented the decree of the central government ministry.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in the meantime, announced that in the next three years, the government would have a national strategy to deal with issue of garbage. He asked that priority be given to Colombo and suburbs given the amount of waste generated in these areas.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development this year received Cabinet approval to set up Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres to turn garbage into electricity. They also received approval to implement a feed-in-tariff (flat tariff for 20 years) of Rs 36.20/kWh for electricity purchases from these centres.
Garbage, instead of being dumped in Meethotamulla, would be moved to the centres to be established inThumbowila, Karadiyana, and Muthurajawela by Fairway Holdings Pvt Ltd and KCHT Lanka Jang Pvt Ltd.
Wickramasinghe, however, pointed out that this plan would not necessarily tackle the existing garbage in Meethotamulla,
The new centres will only deal with new waste that is generated. Ranawaka has no plan for the existing garbage, he stressed.
Minister Ranawaka, however, yesterday declared that dumping of garbage on lands owned by the UDA would be banned from 1 May.
He added that the municipal councils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and government institutions would have to bear the expenditure of disposing garbage themselves.
According to Ranawaka, a Cabinet paper was issued in February by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, which clearly stated that the CMC should refrain from dumping garbage in Meethotamulla, and they were advised to find alternative places.
Tug of war
For Wickramasinghe, who has seen the mountain of garbage rise every year in his electorate, the lack of solutions come from the inability of the central government to work with the local government to solve the problem.
A government official who wished to remain unnamed said that interference from the ministries attached to the central government, especially when it came to garbage management, was the main reason for the issue to remain unresolved over the years.
Whilst the Provincial council has the authority over waste management, different ministries come up with their own proposals. The Provincial council is responsible for the final disposal of garbage, he said.
He claimed that over the years, ministries often asked that local government authorities implement their plans, rather than that of the proposals put forward by the provincial council.
This is a clear violation of the law. In the meantime, certain ministers disregard the initiatives taken by the provincial council in trying to implement their own plans. The provincial council needs to be strengthened, he added.
He noted that waste management was a subject which needed to be constantly adapted to local situations and needed flexibility when implementing,
The proposed projects will take another two to three years to implement, but what are they going to do with todays waste he asked.
He further questioned that if the UDA and the Government did not want garbage dumped at Meethotamulla anymore, what did they propose to do with the existing waste at Meethotamulla
The Western Province produces 60 percent of the total waste produced in the country. The same procedure cannot be adopted in all the provinces as the type and the amount of waste generated differ from each province, said the official.
He suggested that if the ministries were to take initiative to deal with the garbage issue, they should rather focus on industrial and clinical waste while letting the provincial councils manage the municipal solid waste. Municipal waste is not as hazardous as the industrial and clinical waste, so the Central government would be better suited to handle more hazardous waste, he said.
Sri Lanka has 18 municipal councils, 37 urban councils, and 256 Pradeshiya Sabhas. These local government authorities are responsible for waste disposal in their respective areas and employ more than 8,000 employees to operate 172 special dumping trucks, 618 four-wheeled tractors, 205 two-wheeled tractors, 1,152 hand carts, and 83 other equipment for waste collection (Colombo Municipal Council, 2012). The question now is where are they heading with our garbage

Sangakkara (46) but Surrey follow-on : Cook century sees Essex to big victory
LONDON, Sunday - Alastair Cook marked his first match since resigning as England Test captain by scoring a century as Essex thrashed Somerset by eight wickets in the First Division of the County Championship on Sunday.
Cook is determined to continue his Test career under new skipper Joe Root and the left-handed opener, England's record Test run-scorer, was in excellent form at Taunton.
He eventually fell for 110 when he pulled a short ball from South African batsman Dean Elgar, bowling his occasional left-arm spin, to James Hildreth at mid-wicket.
Cook batted for over four hours, facing 214 balls and hitting 16 fours. The match was a personal triumph for Cook, who also made 52 in Essex's first innings 129.
His exit on Sunday left Essex 216 for two but by then the visitors were in sight of a victory target of 255, which they achieved without further loss.
Cook resigned as England's Test skipper following their 4-0 series loss in India late last year.
Now that he no longer plays international white-ball cricket, the 32-year-old Cook is not due to represent England again until the first Test against South Africa at Lord's on July 6.
- Carberry and Rossouw fall short -
While Cook had a hundred to celebrate, it was a different story at Southampton where the Hampshire duo of Michael Carberry and Rilee Rossouw both fell just short against county champions Middlesex.
Former England batsman Carberry, in his first home championship match since being diagnosed with cancer last year, resumed on his overnight 84 not out.
But on 98, Carberry was caught behind off Tim Murtagh.
South Africa's Rossouw got to within one run of a hundred while batting with a damaged left hand before he was run out by Australia-born ex-England batsman Sam Robson going for a non-existent second run.
Fast bowler Kyle Abbott, who like Rossouw has cut short his South Africa career to play for Hampshire, struck a maiden Championship fifty as the hosts made 438 in reply to Middlesex's 356.
Abbott then removed Middlesex's top three and at stumps they were 111 for four -- a lead of just 29 runs.
Meanwhile there was success for two spinners in south London as Lancashire slow left-armers Simon Kerrigan and Stephen Parry shared five first-innings wickets as Surrey were made to follow-on at The Oval.
The days when every county could be relied upon to field two specialist spinners, as Surrey did when the England duo of Jim Laker and Tony Lock ran through opposition batting line-ups on turning pitches at The Oval when the county won seven successive Championship titles in the 1950s have long gone.
Early season English conditions can often be unhelpful to modern spinners but Kerrigan and Parry played their part as Surrey were dismissed for 319 with former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fluent 46 and Rory Burns 91 in reply to Lancashire's 470.
At stumps Surrey were 55 for one in their second innings, still 96 runs behind. - AFP

Shakespeare lives in school days!
A group of drama students of Sparks: Centre for Creative Learning won a place in the final cut of a crowd-sourced video of Macbeth which was unveiled as part of Shakespeare Lives in Schools Day on December 2, 2016. The students were invited to the British Council Colombo for a screening of the video and receive their certificates on March 18.
In a discussion with the students, Tanya Warnakulasuriya, British Councils Arts Manager commended the students for being the youngest group to be chosen for the video. While some students enjoyed playing the roles of the witches so they could be mean, the others seemed to have relished the roles of Macbeth and Banquo; however, all of them have had great fun rehearsing a sword fight to depict the battle between Norway and Scotland.
Their drama teacher, Aroshe Ranasinghe, confirmed how much they enjoyed performing scenes from Macbeth. Aged between eight and eleven, this small drama group dived with enthusiasm to create scenes using movement, mime, makeup, costumes and even some creative writing. No childs too young to enjoy Shakespeare, she says. His characters and plots are exciting and theres always so much energy when children get hooked on Shakespeare.
Schoolchildren from the United Kingdom and countries across the world including Congo, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Croatia and Bangladesh, entered a competition to contribute to the retelling of Macbeth. They used video, photos, audio clips, illustrations, posters, presentation slides, comic strips, cardboard puppets and even an Instagram photo feed.
The competition attracted 79 entries from 29 countries with 10 schools making the final cut of the video.
Shakespeare Lives in Schools Day encourages schoolchildren of all ages to learn about Shakespeare as a playwright for the whole world, by joining in global celebrations of his 400th anniversary this year.
Shakespeare Lives in Schools Day aims to encourage schoolchildren to address challenging questions and themes about the human experience in a fun and exciting way.

## Title: Socio-economic challenges of our ageing population

Socio-economic challenges of our ageing population
The ageing of Sri Lanka's population has long been presented as one of the most serious challenges facing the nation in the coming decades. Whilst it is certainly a problem in need of attention, to label it a crisis is to overstate the case. The Government has a range of policy levers open to them to respond to the budgetary effects of ageing.
Let us first take a brief look at the problem. Statistics show that the Sri Lankan population above the age of 60 years was 2.5 million in 2012 which is 12.5% of the total population whereas projection shows that we would have elderly population of about 3.6 million by 2021, which is 16.7% of the total population. And, if the trend continues, by 2041, one-quarter of our population would be elderly.
Our current population, aged more than 65 years, is around 2.11 and by 2030, it is estimated to be 3.33 million, over 57 per cent increase.
These numbers suggest a very big increase in the dependency ratio and is consequently a cause for concern because with it will place a higher burden on the Government and the shrinking working population.
This is the crux of the problem. The question is - Are we prepared to carry the burden Or, do we have serious plans or innovations to mitigate the adverse effects of this problem
Independent living
At a recent seminar, themed Responding to the Global Challenge of an Ageing Population, Dr. Mahendra Gondsalkorale, retired consultant on geriatric medicine made some revealing disclosures. He said that most of our elderly people have developed age-associated illnesses like dementia and also Alzheimers disease. Above all, he added, they need support for independent living.
It means, greater need for adaptive transport, recreational facilities, adaptive housing products. And on the services, acute medical care, stroke and orthogeriatric services, hospital-based elders assessment units and rehabilitation, general surgical and psycho-geriatric liaison and specialist clinics. TIA Clinics, Parkinsons, Rapid Access Clinics, Community services, day hospitals and care home outreach services.
All these add up to big investments in the health sector. Of course, we can be happy that our people are living longer. It represents one of the crowning achievements of our health services but also a significant challenge to the Government. Longer lives must be planned for and programmes executed well.
On the other hand, societal aging may affect economic growth and many other issues, including the sustainability of families, the ability of the Government and communities to provide resources for older citizens.
No easy answers
There are no easy answers to this problem. Some Governments have already begun to plan for the long term. The window of opportunity for reform is closing fast as the pace of population aging accelerates. In some countries, the share of gross domestic product devoted to health care for older people is expected to more than double in upcoming years.
For a country like Sri Lanka with a struggling economy, the challenges may seem daunting, but a host of opportunities await us as well.
Retirement age
Many experts argue it is a mistake to base calculations for elders solely on a fixed retirement age of 60. If life expectancy increases dramatically, a sensible policy is to allow some increase in the retirement age.
Encouraging older workers to remain longer in the labour force is often cited as one of the viable solutions to fiscal pressures and macro-economic challenges related to population aging. Some countries have adapted what is known as phased-in-retirement system.
According to this method, an employee who is approaching retirement age continues working with a reduced workload, and eventually transit from full-time work to full-time retirement. This also includes part-time work for pensioners who wish to remain employed.
Mature influence
This method of gradual retirement can be beneficial to the society, employers, and employees. First, phased-in retirement allows continuity in tax revenues and reduced expenditure on retirement benefits, which holds particular importance for fiscal and macro-economic stability. Second, elders can be valuable to organisations and younger colleagues due to their knowledge and experience. And third, late-life work has positive health and perceived well-being consequences for older employees.
The mature influence of workplace societies is also a major achievement. Many business organisations which adapted this concept are happy with the results. The demographic change offers opportunities to harness the experience, expertise and creativity of such a large number of older people. Tapping into a wider pool of talent, experience and skills enables businesses to increase productivity, build competitive advantage and improve the bottom line.
Volunteer work
In cases where elders are unable to take advantage of phased-in retirement - due to health issues, family obligations, or skills mismatch  the Government could promote and reward volunteering, care work, craft and artistic work among the elderly. Such unpaid activities improve the quality of the social fabric, help the well-being of those engaging in them, contribute to the economy, and reduce healthcare and welfare costs.
Volunteering is among the most important pro-social behaviours with many social and individual benefits. It has been scientifically proven that late-life volunteers have lower rates of deteriorating mental and physical health and delayed mortality. Because of these benefits, national policies should seek to facilitate, reward, and adapt such opportunities for older individuals. And work undertaken by older people should be recognized for its value and rewarded financially.
Further, providing incentives and encouraging the elderly to engage in creative work related to painting, music, or creative writing can also be beneficial to society and prevent social isolation. Government can promote such activities by financing arts and crafts courses in social clubs or community centres for older participants.
Central Provident Fund
Transforming the present EPF/ETF into a mandatory Social Security Savings Fund has been suggested as another way of solving the Sri Lankas elder issue. Instead the current deductions  8 % from employee and 12% from employer  change to 12% from employee and 20% from employer. With such increased amounts available, we can develop a good social security system, which can serve to meet elders retirement, housing and healthcare needs. Singapore is a classic example to follow.
Short-term costs
Its also important to recognize that implementing these programmes and schemes may have short-term costs. Employers and older workers may face bargaining costs related to negotiating phased-in retirement options. Employers could also incur expenses related to restructuring or adapting tasks, while local governments may need to open community centres to accommodate volunteering and other activities for the elderly. Nonetheless, the long-run welfare benefits to society will likely exceed these short-run costs and improve fiscal and macroeconomic health.
Major concerns
A big factor in determining the impact of our ageing population is the projected rates of our economic growth. For instance, a decline in economic growth will increase the pressure on public finances from an ageing population.
At the same time, for the elderly individuals, the issues may focus on the shortfall of retirement savings. And if interest rates also collapse, it will affect those who had chosen to save over the past decades.
Irrespective of economic growth status, there are four major concerns of our ageing population. (1) They want a model of health and social care for the elderly in tune with the changing need and time. As no such model for older people exists in Sri Lanka, it may be an opportunity for innovation in the health system development, though it is a major challenge; (2) They want some type of part-time work to keep them productive and occupied. Much of the discussion about working longer has focused on expanding opportunities for phased retirement or part-time employment; (3) They want avenues for further education and lifetime skill formation. Learning is a lifelong process. An elder education program can be a highly successful if it is done with dedication. It can be online or group classes aimed at developing simple lifetime skills; (4) They want above-the-average return for the savings. At the moment, commercial banks offer 1 per cent which is quite inadequate.
These all require further funding, whether from the tax system, other public expenditure savings, public-private initiatives or economic growth. Ageing has an impact on all aspects of human life including the social, economic, cultural, and political domains. Understanding and providing for ageing is, therefore, an important issue for the twenty-first century.

Srinivasan cannot represent BCCI in ICC meet, says SC
NEW DELHI: Former BCCI president N Srinivasan cannot represent the Board at the ICC meeting next week as he has been held guilty of conflict of interest, the Supreme Court said today.
The apex court allowed BCCIs Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary to represent the cricket board at the ICC meeting on April 24 and directed BCCI CEO Rahul Johri to accompany him.
A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra said since Srinivasan has been held guilty by the apex court for conflict of interest, he cannot be allowed to represent the BCCI in the ICC meeting.
It is directed that Amitabh Chaudhary shall represent the BCCI in the ICC meeting and Rahul Johri shall accompany him and he (Johri) will also attend the meetings of the CEOs, the bench, also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and and D Y Chandrachud, said.
On April 10, the apex court had said that a person, who is ineligible to become an office bearer in the BCCI and state cricket associations, cannot be nominated to take part in the ICC meetings.
The observations came when the counsel for the apex court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) sought a hearing on the interim plea seeking clarification on whether persons, who are rendered ineligible to hold posts in cricket bodies as per the July 18, 2016 judgement, can be nominated as BCCI representative to take part in the ICC meeting.
Earlier, the apex court had accepted the Lodha committees major recommendations on reforms in the BCCI, including a bar on ministers and civil servants and those above 70 from becoming its members, but left it to Parliament to decide whether it should come under RTI and betting on the game should be legalised.

Stray dogs - a menacing social problem in South
Rise in the stray dog population poses a severe health hazard to the public of the Southern Province and at present it has turned into a grave social issue, Rabies Control Unit of the Galle, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital said.
Rabies which is considered deadlier than AIDS is a viral disease transmitted from dogs and other similar mammals such as cats and rodents etc. As per statistics available at the Rabies Control Unit of KTH in 2015, there were 147,530 domesticated and stray dogs in the South out of which 27,575 were wandering animals.
Rabies is most commonly transmitted from stray dogs to other animals. However, if a dog with rabies bites a human, he or she would be infected with the deadly viral disease. The government spends massive sums of money on vaccines given to patients with dog bites. As some sources reveal, the state had to spend about Rs. 400 million on vaccines for dog bites.
During last year, 9,685 people with mammal bites were admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital for treatment. An aggregate of 3,233 people were administered with Anti Rabies Vaccine (ARV) and Anti Rabies Serum (ARS). During January and February of this year alone 1,176 people were treated for dog bites at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital out of which 421 were given the Anti Rabies Vaccine.
About 90 percent of such victims came to hospital with stray and pet dog bites while 5 percent of them had been bitten by cats. The remaining 5 percent of sufferers were treated for squirrel, bats, mongoose and cattle bites, the Rabies Control Unit of KHT disclosed further.
Particularly, health authorities point out that stray dogs abundantly survive at public and religious places alone the coastal belt of the province.
The Rabies Control Unit of the hospital had referred brain parts and skulls of 98 mammals including those of dogs, cats and squirrels etc. to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) and 67 of them were found to be infected with Rabies. Moreover, during the first three months of this year 36 skulls of suspected mammals were sent to the MRI for medical tests and 23 of them were identified as rabies positive.
Patients with mammal bites from all three districts of the Southern Province namely Galle, Matara and Hambantota come to the unit for treatment. This is the only unit for such treatment. About 50 people with mammal bites come daily to this unit for treatment, Senior Medical Officer of the Rabies Control Unit of KTH Dr. Geethanjali Gunarathne told the media.
Making a public appeal Dr. Geethanjanli urged the people to make swift arrangements to dispatch the head of the dog to the Rabies Unit of KTH if it dies soon after it bites a human.
The skull should be delivered to the medical research unit within 24 hours following the incident. This is the only medical research unit for the whole Southern Province. In dispatching the head of the animal its skull should not come directly in contact with ice. Before it is put into an ice bag it should be safely deposited in a separate polythene bag first to avoid water absorption to the dogs head, Dr. Gunarathne further explained. When contacted, Southern Province Health Services Director Dr. P. Wijesuriya said continued preventive measures were being launched to control the stray dog population of the province. Provincial Health Ministry has allocated Rs. 3 million for a dog sterile project in 2017. Some organizers object to the killing of stray dogs. However we are trying our best to address the issue for the benefit of the people of the South, Dr. Wijesuriya further said.

Surprise package Leicester plot Atletico downfall
MADRID, Sunday - Leicester City remain a surprise guest at the top table of European football but a place in the Champions League semi-finals beckons if they can overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Spanish heavyweights Atletico Madrid.
The Premier League outfit have made a remarkable progression to the last eight and on Tuesday face a side who have thrived on adversity to compete in two Champions League finals in the last three years, having made it to four successive quarter-finals.
Leicester were outclassed for large parts of the first leg at a fervent Vicente Calderon Stadium but, crucially, return to the King Power Stadium on Tuesday with their storied opponents well in their sights after Antoine Griezmanns solitary goal.
I think they are betting everything on the second leg, Atleticos charismatic manager Diego Simeone told reporters after a tough first encounter with the Midlands side.
It was a hard-fought match. Its a good win for us but the second leg will be difficult. Its all still to play for.
As for the second leg, we anticipate a fantastic English atmosphere. The tie is still 50/50. Nobody sees us already in the semi-final.
In the last round, Craig Shakespeares Leicester side overcame a similar 2-1 deficit against Sevilla, winning 2-0 at home in the return to set up the Atletico showdown.
Once relative Champions League unknowns, however, Atletico are now true European giants and will provide the sternest test yet of Leicesters fairytale continental adventure.
We know we have to be more open because we need a goal and one of Atleticos plusses is their ability on the counter-attack, Shakespeare told reporters after the defeat in Madrid.
But we are still alive and we want to stay in the competition. I have seen enough throughout the squad. We know what we are about at the King Power and know what we need to do.
Atletico are a very good team, their work ethic is exceptional. We are aware of that, but we are still in this tie.
We know it is a going to be a very difficult return match, but we have very good record at the King Power.
Atletico welcome back striker Kevin Gameiro, who missed the first leg with hamstring problems, to the squad but are without midfielder Tiago, who returned from injury as a late substitute in Saturdays 3-0 Liga win over Osasuna but has been left out.
Atleticos Croatia defender Sime Vrsaljko and Argentina midfielder Augusto Fernandez are also missing through injury.
English champions Leicester, meanwhile, could be without several key defenders through injury and suspension.
Captain Wes Morgan has not played since the return leg with Sevilla and is doubtful, Robert Huth is suspended while Yohan Benalouane limped out of Saturdays 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace.

Nayanthara plays the female lead in the original.
It is a woman-centric film, and the lead character requires an actress with a potential to perform. Nayanthara fit the bill in Tamil but for Hindi, the makers required a familiar face and thats why Tamannaah was roped in, claims a source.
Tamannaah has already begun shooting for the film which also stars Prabhudheva and Bhumika in key roles. Deccan Chronicle

Not only do we poke fun and celebrate the show, we also get some jokes in about the actors lives.

Theresa May to seek snap election for June 8

UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced plans to call a snap general election on June 8.
She said Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership following the EU referendum.
Explaining the decision, May said: "The country is coming together but Westminster is not."
There will be a Commons vote on the proposed election on Wednesday - Labour have said they will vote with the government.
The prime minister needs Parliament's backing to hold a vote before the next scheduled date of 2020.
Explaining her change of heart on an early election, May said: "I have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election."
She accused Britain's other political parties of "game playing", adding that this risks "our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country".
"So we need a general election and we need one now. We have at this moment a one off chance to get this done.
"I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion. Since I became prime minister I've said there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and security for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions we must take."
In a statement outside Number 10, May said Labour had threatened to vote against the final Brexit agreement, the Liberal Democrats had stated they wanted to "grind the business of government to a standstill", the SNP had said they would vote against the negotiations and "unelected" members of the House of Lords had vowed "to fight us every step of the way".
"If we don't hold a general election now, their political game-playing will continue and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run up to the next general election," she said.

Transactions between SL, Vietnam to be raised to US $ 1 billion
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc agreed to increase commercial transactions between the two countries to one billion US dollars during the next few years.
They also agreed to further enhance cooperation between the two governments and the private sectors of both countries.
The agreement was reached during official bilateral talks between the two countries at the Presidents House in Hanoi on April 17. During these talks, an agreement was also reached to lay the foundation for the development and promotion of the investment and tourism section.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc who appreciated Sri Lankas advent into a development path in economic and social spheres expressed hope that the programme carried out by Sri Lanka to enhance national reconciliation would be a success.
The two Prime Ministers also reviewed activities undertaken by the Sri Lanka  Vietnam joint commission and decided that an intellectual forum comprising representatives of the government and private sector should be set up to further strengthen relations between the two countries.
Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake and Vietnams Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Quvc Dzung were named as co-ordinations for the setting up of this intellectual forum and its activities on behalf of Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
The two Prime Minister also agreed that apart from government to government and private sector relations, steps should be taken to promote inter-community relations between the two countries.

United offer hope to Spurs with 2-0 win over Chelsea
OLD TRAFFORD, Sunday - Manchester United opened up the Premier League title race with a convincing 2-0 home victory over leaders Chelsea on Sunday that leaves second-placed Tottenham Hotspur just four points behind.
Goals by Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera sank Chelsea and, with six games left for the top two, there is little room for any more slip-ups by Antonio Contes side who a few weeks ago looked like they were running away with the title.
While Chelsea remain favourites to win the league, Conte will be concerned about the manner of the defeat at Old Trafford where they were rarely able to turn possession into chances.
The west London side are top with 75 points, ahead of Spurs on 71, also from 32 games, Liverpool with 66 from 33, Manchester City on 64 from 32 and United with 60 from 31.
Manchester United deserved to win because they showed more desire, more motivation, more ambition to win this game, Conte told the BBC.
This league is not closed. Tottenham are on great form and playing with great enthusiasm but we are playing a great season and we must try to reach this target.
The strikes by Rashford and Herrera at the start of each half were enough for United who, despite resting several players against Chelsea ahead of Thursdays Europa League quarter-final return leg at home to Anderlecht, were good value for their win.
United manager Jose Mourinho started with top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the bench but delivered a tactical masterclass against his former club, largely nullifying the threat from the usually dangerous Eden Hazard.
Chelsea are the best counter-attacking team in the country and we controlled them very well. Im really happy with the boys. Im happy -- not because its Chelsea, its because we need these three points, Mourinho told the BBC.
I dont feel extra joy at beating Chelsea -- we beat the leader. It doesnt matter if the leader is Chelsea or another -- we beat them convincingly. Nobody can doubt our credit to win the game.
Chelsea got a warning after five minutes when United forward Jesse Lingaard robbed defender David Luiz and fed Rashford, but the 19-year-old striker dragged his shot wide.
Two minutes later, though, Herrera won the ball in midfield, possibly by using his hand, and delivered an inch-perfect pass into the path of Rashford who outpaced Luiz and fired low into the far corner of the net.
Looking confident and full of verve, United pushed forward with intent while Chelsea were unusually ineffective going forward, with Herrera doing an excellent marking job on Hazard.
There was another individual battle going on with Chelsea striker Diego Costa and United defender Marcos Rojo engaged in an often physical struggle for dominance and Costas frustration resulted in a yellow card for a foul on Paul Pogba.
United threatened to strike again before the break when Rashford found some space for a cross which Chelsea defender Gary Cahill headed just over his own bar.

Vettel wins Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Hamilton
MANAMA, Sunday - Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel forged seven points clear at the top of the Formula One standings on Sunday after winning a Bahrain Grand Prix thriller that saw Lewis Hamilton penalised for underhand tactics.
Hamilton, who had started the floodlit race level on points with the German, took second place for Mercedes after staging a late chase following the five-second penalty for driving deliberately slowly into the pits.
Hamiltons Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas was third after leading from his first pole position, struggling with his tyres and twice respecting team orders to allow the faster Briton through.
The victory was Vettels second of the season after the four-times world champion won the opener in Australia. Hamilton, who won in China last weekend, crossed the finish line 6.6 seconds behind.
Vettel's 44th win lifted him to 68 points, with Hamilton second on 61 and the championship looking ever more likely to be an evenly matched battle between the two with Ferrari and Mercedes a cut above the rest.
Yes guys, that's what I'm talking about, whooped the German, who was helped by a safety car after an aggressive early pitstop.
It was a really great day. It was on the last half of the out lap when all the fireworks were going off that I was like 'I love what I do', he said.
Hamilton's race, already compromised by Vettel passing him off the start for second place, unravelled further when he drove unnecessarily slowly as he came in for his first pit stop.
The move was a deliberate one to prevent Red Bulls Daniel Ricciardo getting the jump with a quick stop while Hamilton waited behind Bottas, already in the pits.
The Briton served the penalty at his second stop, frustration evident from his shaking helmet, before charging back and taking more than a second a lap out of Vettel's advantage. The task of making up 20 seconds in 16 laps was ultimately too great a task.
The pitlane was my fault and apologies to the team. I tried my hardest to catch up, said Hamilton, who thanked Bottas for his help.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said the Finn's hopes of a first win had been hit even before the start when a problem with a generator on the grid left him with the wrong tyre pressures.
From then on we were on the back foot, he said.
Bottas kept the lead for the opening laps, with Vettel close behind in a five-car train.
The safety car appeared on track after 18-year-old Canadian newcomer Lance Stroll, suffering his third retirement in three races, turned into Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz as the Spaniard left the pits.
"I got hit from the side," the Williams rookie exclaimed.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen had already crashed out by then, blaming brake failure after he trekked across the gravel into the tyre barrier on lap 12.
"It was a great team effort today and I felt like we are quick. I tried to put Valtteri under pressure. But the early pit stop worked," said Vettel.
"Lewis obviously was a very big threat again towards the end... but the car was a dream today."
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth with Australian Ricciardo fifth for Red Bull and Brazilian Felipe Massa sixth for Williams on the 75th birthday of team founder Frank Williams.
Mexican Sergio Perez finished seventh for Force India, his 13th successive points finish, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean eighth for U.S.-owned Haas.
Germany's Nico Hulkenberg was ninth for Renault, that team's first points of the year, and French rookie Esteban Ocon bagged the final point for Force India.
McLaren's nightmare continued with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne failing to start and Fernando Alonso retiring on the final laps but classified 14th.
I never raced with less power in my life, the Spaniard told his team.  Agencies

Woman takes center stage
When women come together tremendous obstacles can be surmounted. WOMAN is the story of a group of women who have the courage and determination to realize their aspirations. Daily News recently visited the Good Market to experience firsthand their initiative Rising Woman  Interfaith Women Collective. The stalls at the good market featured bedspreads and handicrafts collection. Co- Founder of WOMAN Dishani Jayaweera commented on this noble movement.
WOMAN is an interconnected sisterhood that ignites inner power of women by healing, celebrating diversity and womanhood through creative friendly efforts. WOMAN is a sister organization of CPBR (Center for Peace Building and Reconciliation)
I am a person who is exploring the role of women in healing, reconciliation and peace building, which is not only in Sri Lanka but as a universal community. Today I feel we are living in a hot plate, ecologically, socially, culturally, economically and politically we are burnt out. That is where my energy comes - to really explore the role of women to heal, because before you do anything else I have a strong feeling that the healing is the most important thing. It is not because of the war but because of everything around us, said Jayaweera.
For the last 20 years she has been working as a peace builder in this country under the roof of Centre for Peace Building and Reconciliation along with co- founder of CPBR, Prof. Jayantha Seneviratne.
We worked with women, youth and community leaders. Two years ago, me and two other colleagues of mine, Chandi De Silva (coming from mainly Colombo) and Chandra (coming from grass root communities). So we have given birth to a group called WOMAN. We are the co- founders, stated Jayaweera.
So under WOMAN they work with female religious leaders, to explore the role female religious leaders can play to heal the body, mind, soul and soil.
In that exploration we realized that it is really important to touch the lives of women in the ground level. So we have given birth to an initiative called  Rising Woman, to explore what kind of role they can play, to bring communities together, to heal their own selves and to heal their communities and heal the soil and the people.
We are working in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura and Pollonanaruwa. We are working with mainly 20  30 community leaders who are already doing many good things in their communities and we train them at an intellectual level to understand the topic of power and the dynamics of power in their relationships at a personal level and at a political level.
We are coming together and having fun and sharing our lives. The community leaders work with another 150 women at ground level who are living in their communities to share, their knowledge experience and exposure, explained Jayaweera.
community level relationships
Jayaweera pointed out the power of Economy. This plays a huge role when it comes to community level relationships. For women to feel confident and to really stand by themselves, economy plays a role. That is one of their main concerns. Half of them are sometimes single mothers for many reasons - their husbands have left them or their husbands are not supporting.
So we thought to ourselves, we will bring livelihoods, peace building and reconciliation into one cycle with the ecological well- being as well. So we are bringing ecological well-being and social well-being together. In that process we create things together to understand who we are. This self- discovery is made possible through many creations. So this makes them feel very confident as they search themselves. Giving that sense of ownership and sense of connection with your own self is the first step which was why we brought in this creativity into the process, pointed out Jayaweera.
The ladies have been designing bedspreads and bottles, doing many eco- friendly initiatives. So they did this by themselves setting up small stalls in their fairs under the name of Interfaith Women Collective to sell these things. It was very popular in Anuradhapura, Pollonnaruwa and Batticaloa with women from different faiths coming together, creating things together and selling things together.
I see this as a part of power sharing. As a believer of power sharing, I think as to how we can bring women from the periphery into the market, and letting them directly experience that. It is not like we collect their stuff and bring it here and sell it. For me it is again centralized power. I become the center or another becomes the center, or a few people become the center, added Jayaweera.
Jayaweera is a strong believer of interdependence. Nothing can be done alone.
There are so many people around me. It is a story of all of us. Not one single person. It is a collaboration. It is by all of us. And some of these women face great difficulties. Being with other women and having a space of their own and experiencing this new culture of being together, sharing together and living together means a lot to them, informed Jayaweera.
It is also about seeing how the power dynamics works.
So today here at the good market we are not launching a product, it is a whole process of love, care, sharing, creativity, self-esteem, self-confidence and healing. All the decisions are made as one team, shared Jayaweera.
Jayaweera also put things in a spiritual and philosophical point of view.
Bright and cheerful
Another persons sorrow somehow affects me. I am a part of you. Even though I dont know you, if you are next to me, if you are bright and cheerful, you give me energy. Even though I dont know you, I look at you and feel positive. If you are sad then that energy affects me. That is how I see the world.
As I said before I am a strong believer of interdependence. My existence means everybodys existence and everythings existence. Without this whole environment we are in now, I am not here. It is a story about all of us. That is why we have called this program WOMAN, it is a story of rising women. That is what I believe and that is what has made me do all these things, elucidated Jayaweera.
WOMAN has 30 community leaders and all are women. They work with 150 women who are affected by war as well different forms of violence who are located in Jaffna, Pollonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Anuradhapura. There are two Womens Hubs in Colombo and in Anuradhapura. The women meet here.

Into the Woods : Pure pleasure
At the start of Into the Woods, gnarled, moonlit branches wreath the familiar Disney logothat oft-chipper image of a pristine castle and its glittering moat. The tweak, of course, is meant to usher you right where the title suggests, but it doubles as a brooding harbinger of the darkest, ballsiest bit of entertainment released by the Mouse House in some time. Granted, thats not really saying much, as Disney has rarely been a place to turn for risky business, and purists are bound to be miffed by the relative tempering of sex and violence in this Hollywood take on Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Broadway hit. But for those who were reared on live-action fantasy cinema from the 1980s, or the various Grimm fairy tales on which the 1987 musical was based, Rob Marshalls Into the Woods film feels just radical enough to cleanse the palette, specifically amid Disneys new trend of serving up toothless self-cannibalizations, from Maleficent to Saving Mr. Banks.
Occasionally laced with innuendo to match, Into the Woods is a veritable orgy of some of your favorite bedtime stories, placing Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) alongside a blue-haired witch (Meryl Streep), two handsome princes (Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen), and pint-sized beanstalk-climber Jack (Daniel Huttlestone). Though perfectly harmless for whatever niece or grandchild tags along while you watch Streep dust off her Postcards from the Edge pipes, this PG-rated romp is, refreshingly, less notable for its happily-ever-afters than its oh-no-they-didnts. The woods itself isnt so much a Sleepy Hollow-style horrorfest as a labyrinthine den of desires, where Rapunzel canoodles with her beau, Jack nabs magic beans thatll summon a giant, Red gets stalked and swallowed by a very pedophile-y Wolf (Johnny Depp), and a bakers wife (Emily Blunt), while joining her husband (James Corden) on a quest to break the witchs curse and get pregnant, strays from her path to get all adulterous with Pines cheeky, philandering royal.
Again, this is tame stuff when compared to the majority of titillations in popular movies, but in a genre so increasingly bent on shielding young people from anything without a sugary coating, its heartening to see characters not only pursue their (sometimes) dubious wants, but also suffer their share of consequences (in grand Grimm fashion, folks are blinded, dismembered, and, in a few cases, even killedall with a condemning, yet frolicsome, wink). Adapting his own book into a script, Lapine largely finds a satisfying medium between the adult-oriented liberties of theater and the heavy-handed filters of the Disney machine, while Marshall, ever the director to cook up marvelous musical numbers amid a clunky whole, matches the tone with his smattering of showstoppers. Like James Marsden in the somewhat similar once-upon-a-time riff Enchanted, Pine is urged to go full-tilt in mocking his dreamy image, and Agony, his pretty-hurts duet with fellow heartbreaker Magnussen, is a campy, queer-eyed highlight, complete with bared chests and high kicks in a waterfall setting.

A world of Waffles!
Whatever is happening in Sri Lanka, the food scene is really developing. Some of the biggest players in the game are Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Chinese Dragon. And now there is The Waffle Caf. Now in Sri Lanka we are able access mouthwatering food which is available elsewhere in the world. Opening up the Waffle Caf in Ethul Kotte is a result of Durga Kennys travels and it was only a matter of time before this innovative young lady executed the plan. Today the Waffle Caf is growing in popularity due to its highly unique dishes. Daily News visited the Waffle Caf and sampled some of the best food available.

Normally Waffles are not the star of the show in other food outlets. It is a side dish. It comes with various other food items. At the Waffles Caf it is very much the star of the show. Normally at other food outlets it is a flat kind of Waffle. It is not this deep kind of Waffle. We are the only place doing the Liege Waffle now. Give it two weeks, someone else will do it! It is totally traditional. In Belgium you would get people selling these Liege Waffles on the road. Those are very traditional and authentic. When it comes to Savory Waffles, the Waffles need to be lighter because the savories are very heavy, said Kenny
At the Waffles Caf the Liege Waffle is made out of dour. It is a cooky bready feeling. It is also made from Pearl Sugar, which is a special ingredient. When it cooks with the melting of the pearl sugar you get that crunch. You get a glaze on the top. The pearl sugar is made by the staff of the Caf themselves.
I really want to stay true to Belgium tradition in creating Waffles. There are three types of Waffles served at the caf. One is the Savory Waffle, Vegetarian and the Sweet Waffles. The Sweet Waffles are served with the Liege Waffles. I have travelled to Europe and seen Vendors making it and the smell was amazing as it was winter at that time. I watched and then I learnt. There again they were serving the Liege Waffles. So the concept for the Brussels and Liege Waffles are from Belgium but made in Sri Lanka., pointed out Kenny.
Elsewhere Waffles would just be part of the regular Menu. Durga confessed she loves Waffles with Syrup and Butter and that too is available at the Caf.
The Waffles with Syrup and butter are so yummy! You can have that at any time of the day. There is no set time. You can have it for breakfast and you can have it for dinner. I just love Waffles. I am trying to stay true to traditional recipes. We are not just putting flour and milk and then saying  here is your waffle. We have really looked into using traditional methods. In the case of the Liege Waffles. It is full on the traditional method of making it. And that is the main thing. We want to make it the star of the show, so we have given it all our love and attention, making it really good Waffles. Not just any Waffle, explained Kenny
A lot of places may serve it but it is different. But it is not the same as Waffles Caf. It might be thinner and it wont be as crispy.
We sell Belgium style Waffles here  Brussels and Liege. And you should eat it, while it is hot! Customer favorites have been the Gini Kukula and Red Siam  which has the strong flavors of Thai Curry. We also do takeaways but eating hot hot is the best! The business has picked up already and the weekends are totally packed. We have so many repeat customers, so it has been very profitable. We also serve seeni sambol which stays true to the Sri Lankan cuisine. The Red Siam is thai curry with waffles and this is quite popular as well. So we are exploring so many possibilities, added Kenny.
So when it comes to Waffles, Durga instructed the staff for two weeks. They came with experience of their own, but they were trained for the Waffle side of it.
When it comes to Waffles I have been self -taught  traveled and from my readings. I love food as well. I am really interested in trying out new things. I did not take any cookery course or anything like that. It was mainly through trial and error. I also hope to open other branches which makes me really excited. I would love to! But sometimes as branches are really good, you sometimes tend to lose sight of the one you have. Then you dont give it your all. So it is something to think about! informed Kenny.
The choice of the location, depended mainly on the fact that the area has become so busy with Waters Edge. Lots of people have moved towards Battaramulla and Hokandara.
So I thought this place would have been a nice place to start. It is close to my home as well. So I can see to it most often. Initially I was nervous starting this, but people have been coming back and it has been a good response so far. And I am thankful for that. It really has caught up like wildfire! You know it is the right thing when you taste it, stated Kenny.
Lots of families and kids come in and everything is done from scratch by our local staff in Sri Lanka.
As much as I would like to expand the menu, the bigger the menu you lose track of how much energy you put into one dish. A lot of places do that, they have extensive menus and for example you find that their garlic bread is really good, but their soup is terrible. So I feel if we keep things limited we can always stay on track  how it tastes and looks. Sometimes people dont order from certain things so it is stagnant. But if at all, we might expand the vegetarian section. We have got a lot of good comments for our vegetarian side, explained Kenny.
They have quite a few foreigners coming as well, but more of a local clientele as well because of the spiciness of the food. But even the foreigners love the Gini Kukula because it is something different for them from what they are used to.
The caf starts from 10am till 3pm in the afternoon. And then from 5pm  10pm and Mondays Poya days it is closed.

WorldLiars.com School..!
With the internet reigning supreme and the media gradually moving into obscurity and oblivion, leaders the world over, find telling a lie well, makes it believable. People dont know what to believe anymore! said a teacher who worked in the newly begun School for Liars, So we teach leaders to lie so convincingly, it becomes gospel truth!
How I asked angrily.
Well, there are methods and there are methods! First the uttered lie is washed thoroughly of any extra trappings, like filthy words or tone, then we add spoonfuls of convincing rhetoric, a touch of genuine voice, gentle hand gestures, and voila, this mixture brings immediate belief!
So why a school, open a factory! I said scornfully.
No product is good, unless the producer is also good! said the teacher, Here we train leaders to be masters of bluff!
We walked by a class and I found students glued to their teachers with fixed smile. They are asleep! said the teacher, But have learned to keep their smile plastered on their faces as they sleep!
But the lecturer seems to be highly motivated and dedicated! I said.
No, he isnt! said the teacher.
Look at his smile. Listen to his words! I said.
Those words are from the mask hes grown over his face. Now listen to what he is actually saying
Suddenly the air was filled with the worst obscenity and coarse language Id ever heard. I saw the face behind the mask, cruel, filled with hatred and bias, staring pointedly at me with loathing and anger.
Lets get away from here! I whispered.
Its okay, said the teacher, Hell just put his mask back again. Now look at him!
It was the most angelic, cherubic face Id ever seen, and the words uttered were like sweet honey. But I turned away with fear. I had seen his true self.
And thats the true self all leaders today are taught to hide! smiled the teacher.
I wouldnt like to ask you to reveal your true self! I said looking at him, and for a moment I heard a snarl followed by a growl, and the distinct noise of a wild animal pawing the ground. But it stopped, as the teacher got control of himself. Since we also have an online presence, weve named our school, WorldLiars.com. School. Would you like to see the trustees of our school asked the teacher sweetly, as he led me to a glass cabin.
I looked in and saw a seventy-year old world leader with a now famous peculiar blonde hairstyle, talking animatedly to different faces I recognized. The talk was being translated by a bald Russian, whos movements showed a leaning towards judo, and also translated into Hindi, by a man with a white beard, white hair and familiar jacket.
All their looks, talk and gestures, appeared pleasing to the ear and eye..!
