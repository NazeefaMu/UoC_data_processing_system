Auditor General requests Govt. to gazette National Audit Bill
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe appealed to the Government to end the waiting game and gazette the long awaited National Audit Bill, observing that the inordinate delay in passing the legislation has hampered work of the Department.
The AG yesterday convened a press conference at the Government Information Department along with former Auditor General Sarath Chandra Mayadunne and senior officials of AG Department to explain the current status of the Bill and its provision on surcharges.
The latest draft of the Bill has tied all loose ends and got the Attorney Generals clearance. Yet the Government is bidding more time. The legislation has already been revised for 22 times. We have been unable to introduce a service constitution and give regular promotions due to this delay. The approved cadre of AG department has 15 deputy AGs, but today we have only one. I urge the Government to Gazette the draft Bill.
If the Government wishes to do more amendments those can be made when Parliament takes up the Bill, the Auditor General stressed.
Commenting on powers for surcharge, the Auditor General explained that it is not a punishment on a public servant. It is either a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to Government for which he is held responsible, he noted.
He pointed out as per the latest draft three conditions must be met in order to impose a surcharge. Those are, carrying out a transaction contrary to any law, causing a deficit or a loss to the auditee institution by a fraud, negligence, misappropriation or corruption and availability of adequate reasonable grounds with the Auditor General to confirm the above matters.
Wijesinghe clarified that the AG is only issuing a certificate and upon that the Chief Accounting Officer (Ministry Secretaries) has to impose a surcharge on the relevant officer. If the CAO failed to act on it within a month legal action could be taken against him, he added.
He stated that several CAOs have reportedly objected to the surcharge provision. When we study the instances of loss incurred by the Government over the past two to three decades, the CAOs had also been implicated in them somewhere in the process. Therefore the CAOs are reluctant to issue surcharge though they already have the power to do so, the AG pointed out.
He pointed out the Audit Service Commission, which was appointed following the passage of 19th Amendment to the Constitution, is inactive for two long years due to absence of legal provisions. However, we are spending large sum of money for the salaries and maintenance of the office, he added.
Former AG Mayadunne stated that only the officers who deliberately contravene the law objects to this bill. The officers without competency often tend to do anything to appease the politicians in order to get promotions and other perks. Surcharge is a hindrance for that practice, he noted.
He pointed out the proposed bill strengthens state finance control of Parliament and therefore Parliament and people at large should come forward to push this legislation through. He noted the Cabinet has no moral right to intervene into this legislation.

Govt will not sign any FTA detrimental to local industrialists: President
President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday said the Government would not sign any free trade agreement (FTA) which would bring injustice or challenge to the local industries and entrepreneurs.
He said some groups not related to the business sector were making the business community scared by giving them false information. The government is getting into the free trade agreements with foreign countries only by protecting local industries, he said.
The President was speaking at the annual Planning Award Ceremony of the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries held on Thursday at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo.
The President said the state patronage to develop local industries was not sufficiently done in the past. He said the government would implement a new programme soon to encourage and guide small and medium scale entrepreneurs.
President Sirisena said he decided to establish a national economic council to strengthen the economy by formalizing the economic management in the country.
"The NEC will increase the export income and develop the local industry," he said. He said the country has a need for a stronger programme to develop agriculture.
The National Economic Council aims at fulfilling the governments responsibility for the development of industries, he said.
The Council was established after the discussions with the representatives of World Bank, International Monetary Fund, local and international economic specialists and Sri Lankan specialists working abroad.
The President requested the support from everybody for the smooth operation of the National Economic Council.
The award ceremony was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for the 16th time. The awards were conferred upon 16 micro, small, medium and large business institutions under five categories.
Litro Gas, livestock and mineral oil industries received awards for state sector industries.
Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and Ceylon National Chamber of Industries Chairman Thissa Seneviratne were present.

Halt election violence
It is reported that compensation is to be paid to UNP supporters who were subjected to election violence down the years. According to Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan steps would be taken to grant compensation on behalf of all UNPers who lost their lives and to those who lost their property and belongings due to pre and post election violence. This will also include UNP members whose properties were damaged during the violent incidents in the aftermath of the Nalanda Ellawala killing in Ratnapura in 1995. Compensation will also be paid to the next of kin of the 28 UNP supporters killed alongside Major General Janaka Perera and his wife in Anuradhapura in 2008.
Compensating victims of election violence is well and good. But why does this have to be so Election violence has been accepted here as a matter of course. Post election violence has been the norm in this country, all along, since Independence. But this state of affairs took a serious turn in 1970 which set the tone for the nature and severity of post election violence that was witnessed since then. Not only were the houses and property of the UNP supporters burnt down, there were also killings and other atrocities committed on the vanquished. Not only that, UNP supporters were driven out of their workplaces and/ or victimized in the way of punishment transfers. The revenge continued in other forms as well and extended even to the artistes who were on the UNP election platform.
Things took a turn for the worse following the UNP's landslide victory in 1977 with post election violence surging to an unprecedented level. The greens, who were languishing in the opposition and the victimized in various ways, had clearly been waiting for their turn. Matters were not helped with JRJ declaring he would give the police one week's leave after the election.
This set the tone for things to come, with the public now accepting election violence as a routine happening in this country. The PR system has exacerbated matters, with post election violence that had hitherto been accepted as the norm giving way to pre-poll violence with intra-party battles for the manapey where members of the same party go for each other's jugular, often ending with violence and even killings.
It is time that something is done to put an end to this shameful state of affairs. Is the state planning to continue paying compensation to the victims after each election Is so, isn't this suggesting that post election violence is a natural phenomenon in this country and something that has to be taken in its stride Will there be no end to this Even in India, with a population of 1.2 billion, one hardly hears of post election killings, although elections are keenly fought in that country. Here we boast of a proud civilization dating back 2500 years and a country which is home to a religion that preaches tolerance and equanimity but whose citizens cannot accept the verdict of an election without killing each other.
It is time that something is done to put an end to election violence in this country. Severe punishment should be meted out to the perpetrators of election violence and the politicians who incite them. Compensation is being paid out of public funds and it is ironic indeed that the general public is called upon to pocket out on behalf of their own representatives who instigate the violence. The quality of the present day politicians too is a major contributory factor in the rising incidents of election violence. The thug, criminal, the bootlegger has taken refuge in politics and invariably find their way into the country's supreme legislature. The manner in which these elements conduct themselves in parliament, the language they use, certainly appeal to the baser instincts of their followers, egging them onto violence. Ironically these characters are indispensable to their party leaders for their muscle power that bring in the votes. What is more, their kith and kin, or progeny, are occupying seats in the provincial councils waiting in the wings to someday replace their papas and mamas in parliament. Things can only go from bad to worse.
The so called election monitors have proved impotent in the face of rampant election violence in recent times. They only mark their presence to earn their dollars, after producing reports that are far removed from the ground situation. Hence an internal mechanism is needed to combat this menace that keeps escalating in intensity. The irony of it all is that while supporters of political parties kill each other during elections the main actors give up their rivalries, once elected, and become bosom pals sharing in the spoils at public expense, ladling themselves the gravy liberally though outwardly posturing as political enemies. This duplicity is amply demonstrated in parliament when friend and foe join hands to vote in favour of the perks.
Be that as it may, concrete measures should be taken to eradicate election violence in this country and put an end to the violent political culture.

People of the Palagala Divisional Secretariat Division of Anuradhapura are affected with the threat of wild elephants. The Karavilagala village situated closest to the Divisional Secretariat Office is the most affected.
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayaka and officers visited the area recently. Illegal constructions were the main cause for the issue, they said.
Free movements of wild elephants have been obstructed with the illegally constructed houses. A new housing scheme was set up on an elephant passage. Wildlife officers said the elephant corridor should be protected with an electric fence. A few houses have to be demolished to erect the electric fence. But the villagers oppose the move.

Human rights, FDIs, tourism govt's main focus
Foreign Minister Marapana on assuming duties says:
Human rights ingrained in our culture:
Friendly relations with all countries:
Human rights and foreign investments were the key focus as newly appointed Foreign Minister and Minister of Development Assignments, Tilak Marapana took office yesterday.
If we want investments and tourism to flourish we need to project an image that we take our human rights obligations seriously. We want friendly relations with all countries, he said addressing the media at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
I have received this position most unexpectedly under unfortunate circumstances but I will do my best to fulfil my responsibilities, added the Minister as he took office at 10.05 am.
The Foreign Ministrys greatest challenge during the past two years has been dealing with the Human Rights Resolution against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC but the new Foreign Minister believed that they had successfully convinced the international community that they meant business.
My predecessors, Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Harsha de Silva have convinced the international community that we are not irresponsible and we are mindful that we must address human rights issues not to placate foreign countries but for our own benefit. Also as a Buddhist country human rights is ingrained in our culture, he explained.
Marapana was also confident that the government had ample time to fulfil the obligations cited in the Resolution and that they could ask for more time if they failed to complete all responsibilities.
You cannot do these things overnight. These are serious issues, reconciliation, takes time. Even countries like Bosnia and Sudan are still struggling, he said.
He further explained that the Resolution was in no way harmful to the country and that the international community has allowed Sri Lanka to decide on its own judicial mechanism to deal with war crimes.
I am there to implement the policy of the government. I will always be acting under the direction of the President and Prime Minister, I only play only a role in executing their policies, added Minister Marapana.
Marapana had previously resigned as Minister of Law and Order in 2015 and is the third Minister of Foreign Affairs in the past two years to take office.
Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera who was present on the occasion to invoke blessings on the minister asked that he take steps to improve the Foreign Service which has fallen into disrepute over the past few years,
Though only Sri Lankan citizens are supposed to hold diplomatic office, there are 37 people with dual citizenships working in the Foreign Service. A countrys embassy is supposed to come forward to help its citizens abroad but our embassies, I know through personal experience will never come to the aid of any Sri Lankan abroad. Finally most countries send their best to represent their countries abroad but all we send are retired ministers, cricketers and businessmen, Ven.Palitha Thera said.
I am not sure if you would be here for long but please take action, he added.
The Minister responded that he would look into all the issues raised by the Thera.
Even if I remain here for a short period of time, during that period I will make every endeavour to make the ministry and our embassies more productive and conducive towards the development of our country, he added.

Jantha Vikmukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake speaking at a rally, asked what the rationale was behind protesting the summoning of Shiranthi and Yoshitha Rajapaksa on suspicion of the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
"This jeep was donated by the Red Cross Society to the Disaster Management Ministry. Thereafter the Jeep was gifted to the Siriliya Foundation led by Shiranthi Rajapaksa.
The jeep was found abandoned in Habarana by the CID, after which investigations commenced" he said.
Dissanayake said that the CCTV footage showed a Defender Jeep following the vehicle of Thajudeen.
"Thajudeen stopped to get some water and after he got into the vehilce there is evidence that a Defender Jeep followed him similar to the one that was given to the Siriliya Foundation" he said.
He said that once the jeep was handed over to the Siriliya Foundation by the then Minister Felix Perera, the jeep was taken over by Yoshitha Rajapaksa.
" Yoshitha Rajapaksa was the one who used it.The colour of the jeep had been changed thrice and after the occurrence of the death, the jeep was left abandoned in Habarana" he said. He questioned as to if suspicion would not arise, given the circumstances.
"What is wrong with summoning them to the CID. If they have an explanation as to why the jeep was left abandoned all they need to do is provide that" he said.

The National Lotteries Board (NLB) and Development Lotteries Board (DLB) are to be removed from the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and placed back again as a subject under the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media.
President Maithripala Sirisena issuing Extraordinary Gazette No 2032/32 on August 17, 2017 has reassigned the two institutions back to their original ministry.
The two institutions had been assigned amidst much controversy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the last Cabinet reshuffle at the end of May of this year. It was reported that it was done at the request of former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Newly appointed Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana officially assumed office yesterday.
The NLB was established by Finance Act No.11 of 1963 with several sections of the Act amended in 1997 and 1998. Funds generated from the lotteries are send to the Consolidated Fund, Ministry of Health, Agriculture, Labour, Sports and the Airport Aviation Authority.
The DLB in the meantime was established on January 1, 1983.
The main objective of the Centre was to assist the Government to raise finances. According to the DLB; the income generated by the DLB is credited to the Presidents Fund, which in turn utilises 50% of it for the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund.
The balance generates various financial avenues to the poor people by way of uplifting their living standards, catering to the health, providing funds for the maintenance of religious institutions, welfare societies and sports and to the field of arts.

The council will be the apex body dealing with policy issues. There will be no misunderstandings or conflicts regarding policies of the government, he said.
He said the government decided to set up the National Economic Council to implement and speed up the economic activities of the government.

"We have come halfway in our term of office. We are confident that we will go until 2020. We have to implement many initiatives within the next half of the government," he said.
The minister said the government is a coalition of two parties. This is a first time experience on this scale. Political parties have their own approaches. It is necessary to discuss issues and have a win-win situation, he said.
"One unfortunate aspect we have seen is that Cabinet Ministers, other ministers and party officials express their views and versions which are not in keeping with basic principles of Cabinet responsibility," he said.

TERROR IN SPAIN; 13 dead, over 100 injured in attacks
SPAIN: A van driver ploughed into crowds of pedestrians on Barcelona's most popular street in broad daylight on Thursday, killing 13 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State Jihadist group.
Police announced the arrest of two suspects, identified as a Spaniard and a Moroccan, but said the driver was still on the run.
Hours later in Cambrils, a city 120 kilometres south of Barcelona, police said e they shot dead four suspected terrorists and left another injured in a possible terrorist attack. The incident in Cambrils took place in the early hours of Friday, but police gave no further details, nor did they mention whether the shooting was linked to the Barcelona attack.
Witnesses in Barcelona told of scenes of chaos and horror, with bodies strewn along the famous Las Ramblas boulevard as other people fled for their lives, screaming in panic.
The rampage in a city hugely popular with tourists from around the world is the latest in a wave of attacks in Europe where vehicles have been used as weapons of terror.
As world leaders united in condemning the carnage, the IS propaganda agency Amaq claimed that it was carried out by soldiers from the jihadist group.
We're united in grief, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised address after rushing to Barcelona, the biggest city in Catalonia,a region in Spain's northeast whose separatist governement is defying Madrid.
Above all we're united in the firm intention to defeat those who want to take our values and way of life from us. Regional interior minister Joaquim Forn said 13 people had died and another 100 were injured in what police were treating as a terrorist attack, warning that the death toll could rise further.
There were at least 18 nationalities among the victims who came from countries as varied as France, Venezuela, Australia, Ireland, Peru, Algeria and China, according to Spain's civil protection agency.
Belgium said one of its citizens had died in the Las Ramblas assault, while The Hague said 28 French and three Dutch were injured while a Greek diplomat reported three nationals had been wounded -- a woman and her two children.
Las Ramblas is one of Barcelona's busiest streets, lined with shops and restaurants and normally packed with tourists and street performers until well into the night.
When it happened I ran out and saw the damage, local shop worker Xavi Perez told AFP.
There were bodies on the ground with people crowding round them.
People were crying. There were lots of foreigners. Footage broadcast on Spanish television showed a white van, its front crushed, abandoned by its driver on a road surrounded by police cars. Tom Gueller, who lives on a road next to Las Ramblas said he saw the vehicle speeding along the boulevard.
It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas, he told BBC radio.
Spain had until now been spared the kind of extremist violence that has rocked nearby France, Belgium and Germany. But it was hit by what is still Europe's deadliest Jihadist attack in March 2004, when bombs exploded on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people in an attack claimed by Al Qaeda-inspired extremists.
Police said Thursday that one of the arrested suspects was a Spaniard born in Melilla, a Spanish territory on Morocco's north coast, and the other a Moroccan named as Driss Oukabir.
The Spaniard was arrested in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres south of Barcelona, the scene of an explosion in a house late Wednesday that left one person dead and seven wounded and is believed to be linked to Thursday's assault.
We suspect that they (the occupants) were preparing an explosive device, Josep Lluis Trapero of the regional Catalonia police told reporters.
US President Donald Trump condemned the terror attack and said the United States will do whatever is necessary to help, adding: Be tough & strong, we love you!
France's President Emmanuel Macron -- whose country has witnessed a series of bloody jihadist atrocities including a truck rampage in Nice in July 2016 that killed 86 people -- said his thoughts were with the victims of the tragic attack.
The Nice carnage and other assaults including the 2015 shootings and bombings on Paris nightspots were claimed by the Islamic State, but it is believed to be the first IS claim of an attack in Spain.
Catalonia has the highest concentration of radicalised Islamists in the country along with Madrid and the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco.
According to the Interior Ministry, more than 190 Jihadist terrorists have been arrested since 2015, most of them for propaganda, recruitment for extremist groups or glorifying terrorism.
On Thursday, the Radicalisation Awareness Network, created by the European Commission, warned that between 1,200 and 3,000 Europeans who lived with and fought for IS in Iraq and Syria could return home.
Meanwhile, Six civilians and one police officer were hurt when a car drove into people in the Spanish seaside resort of Cambrils early Friday, the regional government said, just hours after a similar deadly attack in nearby Barcelona.- AFP
