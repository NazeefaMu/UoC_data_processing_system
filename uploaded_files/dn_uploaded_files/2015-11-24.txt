All pledges will be fulfilled - Sajith
The sole intention of the President and the Prime Minister is to establish principles of good governance in this country. They will never shirk their responsibility of fulfilling the pledges made to the people in their election manifesto, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting which followed the opening of the Weerawila Grand Channel pipe borne water supply scheme recently.
Premadasa said all past leaders who promised to do away with the Executive Presidency failed to keep their word because they didn't want to shelve the unlimited powers vested in the presidency after gaining power.
But incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena had voluntarily come forward to remove the executive powers of the Presidency and hand them over to the Parliament as promised to the people, the Maha Sangha and the civil organisations. This showed that both President and the Prime Minister evinced good governance principles by deed.
He said the government of Good Governance would never harbour or protect fraudsters and corrupt individuals involved in various rackets. But certain politicians who depended on frudulent and corrupt individuals in the past were trying in vain to protect such individuals for their personal gain. Such politicians would have short shrift under the Yahapalanaya Government.

Berlin sets up refugee shelter at former Stasi HQ
GERMANY: Berlin has opened a shelter at the former headquarters of communist East Germany's feared Stasi secret police to help house a record influx of asylum seekers, weekend media reports said.
Nearly 500 people, most of them from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, have been staying in the foreign intelligence wing of the imposing former Ministry of State Security since late Friday, the daily Berliner Zeitung said. Up to 900 people will eventually be housed there temporarily.
The rooms will finally be used for something meaningful, it quoted a spokesman for the German Red Cross (DRK), Ruediger Kunz, as saying.
The Berlin social services agency could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.
The office block was once the fiefdom of legendary spymaster Markus Wolf.
Dubbed The Man Without a Face because Western intelligence services long lacked even a photograph of him, Wolf directed one of the world's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades.
A legend in his own lifetime, Wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the Iron Curtain during his tenure from 1958 to 1987, infiltrating countless moles deep into the West German government administration.
Wolf's wing was used by the national railway company Deutsche Bahn in the 1990s but had been vacant for a few years, the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported.
Up to six people per office will sleep in bunk beds at the site, where asylum seekers can spend three months until they are placed in more permanent housing.
The main Stasi headquarters, where the enormous agency kept vast records on East German citizens, would remain a museum, the Berliner Zeitung said.
Around 7,000 Stasi employees worked in the sprawling complex in the city's Lichtenberg district, which was stormed by protesters in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 to stop staff from destroying files.
German authorities are scrambling to find beds for up to one million asylum seekers expected in the country this year alone.
In October, the iconic airport Tempelhof, built by the Nazis and later the staging ground for the Berlin Airlift, was also converted into a temporary shelter.

FRANCE: British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande have visited the Bataclan concert hall in Paris where 89 people were killed on 13 November.
Cameron said on his Twitter account he had stood shoulder to shoulder to Mr Hollande at the venue.
The two leaders viewed the floral tributes placed outside the music venue, where fans of US rock group Eagles Of Death Metal were killed.
The only Briton to have died in the attacks in Paris was at the Bataclan.
Nick Alexander, 36, had been selling merchandise for the band. Cameron is meeting Mr Hollande as the French President starts an intensive push to create a grand coalition to destroy the so-called Islamic State, which will take him to Washington and Moscow in the coming days.
IS claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks in which 130 people were killed.
US President Barack Obama has pointed to an increasing awareness by Russian president Vladimir Putin of the need to eradicate the threat from IS as efforts continued to forge a co-ordinated response.
The US president also urged leaders to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business.
Cameron will present the case for escalating British military involvement against IS in the Commons later this week. - AFP

Essential Scrabble words
You can say you dont care if you win or lose at Scrabble, but you may very well be in the minority. Even President Barack Obama, one of United States most high-profile Scrabble enthusiasts, isnt above boasting about his wins. Its his favorite game to play, said White House communications director Robert Gibbs in a 2008 interview reported in The Independent. Hell play with his family and particularly his sister. And the winner gets bragging rights for a long, long time [source: McSmith].
And Obamas not the only famous Scrabble devotee. President Richard Nixon was an avid player. So is actor Mel Gibson, who plays the game while waiting on the movie set. Author Vladimir Nabokov, famous for his novel Lolita, was a skilled player. Even Queen Elizabeth II is reported to enjoy a royal game of Scrabble [source: McSmith].
Not bad for a pastime invented during the Great Depression. In 1931, out-of-work architect Alfred Mosher Butts came up with a game that he first called Lexiko, then Criss Cross Words. He spent several years tinkering before settling on the rules, now familiar to all Scrabble players: You draw seven letters and try to make words on a board with a 15-by-15 grid. Each letter scores specific points that roughly go along with how hard it is to fit the letter into a word. If an opponent challenges an unusual word, it had better be in the dictionary, or youll have to remove it and lose a turn.
Buttss game didnt meet with much success initially. But in the 1940s, another game maven, James Brunot, took over. He renamed the game Scrabble and by 1952, it had become a sensation [source: NPR].
Scrabble aficionados, like the ones mentioned above, may memorize long lists of unusual words to win their bragging rights. But casual players can improve their games by learning just a handful of useful entries. You can impress -- and even beat -- your friends by blitzing them with high-scoring words, or by sneaking in common but strategic words that get rid of unwanted letters. Remember to make use of the double and triple squares to leverage your score on almost any word. And always look for what players call a bingo, the 50 extra points you get for using all your tiles on one play.

Extra budget copy leads to commotion in House
Parliament sittings were suspended for half an hour yesterday due to a commotion created when the Opposition members demanded for an explanation on the copy of a budget speech that was placed on the members' desks in addition to the copy submitted last Friday.
When the sittings resumed, Leader of the House, Minister Lakshman Kiriella explained that there were no two budget speeches but one, and a copy of the same that was read by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had been placed on the members' desks.
"The Sinhala copy of the budget speech had been placed on the desks of the members on Friday sans three pages due to a flaw at the press," Minister Kiriella said. "But the minister read the full copy on Friday and the copy placed on the desks today is of the same speech the Finance Minister delivered on Friday. The English and Tamil copies had the complete speech," Kiriella said.
Minister Karunanayake apologising for the mistake at the press, said that at the wee hours on the budget day, there had been a mishap at the press and the Sinhala copy had three pages missing.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suspended sittings at 10.30 a.m. and the sittings resumed at 11.00 a.m.
Following the round of questions for oral answers, Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena said another printed copy of the budget speech has been placed on the members' desks.
"What is the difference between these two copies" Gunawardena questioned. "The government has to explain."
At this stage, Kiriella said there was only one budget and the same copy was placed on the table.
"Then you have to explain the difference between the two copies," Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. "There is no need to give us two copies".
At this stage Minister Kiriella said that the opposition members have to point out if there are differences between the two copies.
"If there are two copies, there should be an explanation," the Speaker said. "The Leader of the House or the Finance Minister would explain it during the course of the day".
At this stage, Dissanayake said the budget debate is very important.
"But the minister and the deputy ministers are not in the House."
Minister Kiriella said the Finance Minister would explain the reason for the two copies tomorrow.
Gunawardena said if the government side does not explain, the opposition cannot debate on an unknown budget.
As the debate turned to a commotion, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suspended the sittings for 10 minutes. The sittings suspended were at 10.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.

FR against UPFA National List re-fixed for support
The Fundamental Rights petitions filed by Former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri and former Minister Tissa Vitharana challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament were yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court and two petitions are to be taken up again on December 7.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Ewa Wanasundara, Buwaneka Aluvihare and Upali Aberatne, a counsel who appeared for a respondent moved for a further date citing his counsel was not present in Court.
In his petition, former MP Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as the Vice Chairman of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala, its former General Secretary Susil Premajantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The petitioner states the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties (MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP) and that the very inception the said Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner and all the decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all the constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajantha in his capacity as the Secretary of the said Alliance submitted a list of names including the Petitioners' for the national list.
He alleged that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala was subsequently appointed as the General Secretary of UPFA by the incumbent President without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He stated that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with some the persons, who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be the members of Parliament.
He is seeking Court for a declaration that he is entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a member of the Parliament submitted according to the 1st list.
He is also seeking the Court to cancel and or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.

France fears of a biological attack on water supplies
FRANCE: Paris stepped up security at key water supply facilities Saturday night amid warnings of bio-chemical attacks.
The move was part of a raft of security measures imposed by France and Belgium in response to imminent fears of further terrorist strikes.
With Belgium on its highest terror alert, Jan Jambon, the interior minister, ordered a search of every single address in Molenbeek, the Brussels suburb dubbed a terror den over its links to several of the Paris killers.
Some 85 of the 130 jihadists who have returned from Syria to Belgium live there.
With the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) promising fresh attacks on Paris following those that killed 130 nine days ago - and issuing a video showing a fallen Eiffel Tower and Air France plane - the capital tightened security in water storage and supply sites amid reports of the theft of biohazard suits at a Paris hospital.
Eau de Paris, the capital's state-run water company, has banned access to six sensitive sites to all but key personnel following the Government's decision to declare a state of emergency for three months.
Our eight security agents are the only ones to be accredited by the defence ministry and are in permanent contact with the terrorism cell of Paris police headquarters, a spokesman told Le Parisien.
The storage and treatment sites have protective fencing and special sensors to detect intrusion. To limit the risk of contamination, Eau de Paris has increased the amount of chlorine added to water at five supply sites.
The dose injected has been raised, said Celia Blauel, president of Eau de Paris. Chlorine is a key indicator of any anomaly in the water. When the chlorine level drops, it means there is biological contamination, she said.
It is tested all along the supply chain, meaning that water authorities can cut off supply in a contaminated area if necessary without stopping the entire system, she added.
Eau de Paris produces a million cubic metres of drinking water per day but the capital only consumes half of that amount. So we always have a day's lag in terms of consumption, said Ms Blauel, describing the system as extremely safe.
The heightened security came amid reports that a dozen protective suits against highly contaminative viruses have gone missing from Paris Necker hospital.
Three times as many protective boots made of polyethylene - resistant to chemical agents - have also vanished, along with gloves and anti-bacterial masks.
The hospital said: The disappearance of this limited amount of equipment was noticed on Wednesday and a complaint has been filed.
Philippe Goujon, mayor of Paris's 15th arrondissement, where Necker is located, said the theft was naturally worrying.
It emerged last week that hospitals and emergency services across France have been supplied with the most powerful antidote to sarin and other nerve gas chemicals for the first time.
Under a November 14 decree, the army's medical service was ordered to distribute stocks of the drug atropine.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that the country could rule nothing out when it came to terrorists bent on mass murder, including chemical and biological weapons.
Iraqi and American intelligence have warned that IS is aggressively pursuing development of chemical weapons, setting up a branch dedicated to research and experiments with the help of scientists from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the region. French intelligence agents are convinced that IS is producing mustard gas, after obtaining samples from in Syria. However, US intelligence officials do not believe that IS has the capability to develop sophisticated weapons such as nerve gas. With Paris trying to return to normal life but with all public gatherings banned until November 30, terror fears spread to Brussels after the Government warned of a precise and imminent threat of a Paris-style attack on the Belgian capital.

Govt will not realise budgetary targets - Vijitha
The 2016 budget introduced by the government is solely dependent on taxes for its income.
It will also increase the country's indebtedness, said JVP publicity secretary and parliamentarian Vijitha Herath. He said the government's estimated income is Rs. 2,047 billion and expenditure Rs. 2,787 billion.
"This amounted to a deficit of Rs. 740 billion.
These are only hypothetical targets which could not be attained," Herath said.
He said the government will not realise the expected income targets while expenditure too would escalate, forcing it to resort to supplementary estimates to fill the gap.
"Out of the estimated revenue of Rs. 2,047 billion, almost Rs. 1,584 billion is earned through taxes. The price reduction on goods and commodities was very negligible while many taxes had been introduced on the public. Everything from utilities like electricity and telephone charges would also increase heaping unbearable burdens on the masses," Herath said.
"Sri Lanka's total debt which was Rs. 7,390 billion end December 2014 increased by another Rs. 600 billion during the seven month period ending July 2015. This government too had obtained foreign loans at high rates of interest like the previous regime," he said.
Loans had been obtained despite the slump in oil prices in the world market, the MP said.

HC revokes travel restriction against Dhanuna
The Colombo High Court yesterday lifted the travel restrictions imposed against Dhanuna Tillekaratne over a period of several years in connection with the HiCorp case.
At a previous occasion, Dhanuna Tillekaratne had been acquitted and released from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Counsel Asela Rekawa with Ramalingam Ranjan appearing for Dhanuna moved Court that their clients passport be released since he had been already acquitted from the case. Taking into consideration the facts, High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena revoked the travel ban imposed against Dhanuna and ordered that his passport be released to him.
The Court had earlier directed the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent Dhanuna Tillekaratne from leaving the country.
Danuna Tillekaratne had been charged under Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$299,061.25 of public funds through the HiCorp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Sri Lanka Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after convincing the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) to deposit the money while appearing as an agent of British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was also named as an accused in the HiCorp case was acquitted from the case over a double jeopardy issue; where charges in the indictment in the High Court case were similar to that in the second Court Martial trial in which Sarath Fonseka was sentenced. Thus, no action could be instituted twice against an accused on the same charges.

How not to make a film
Ajasat (Ajatasatru) was the second encumvent of the throne of Magadha, which he secured by killing his father Bimbisara. Initially he was a follower of Devadatta. Ajasat was at first hostile to the Buddha and conspired with Devadatta to kill the Buddha. Devadatta was instrumental in misleading Ajasat to murder his father. Ultimately, like Devadatta, Ajasat too repented for his evil deeds. Although Devadatta was devoured by a hell fire, Ajasat became a devout follower of the Buddha. When the Buddha passed away in the eighth year of his reign, Ajasat was very disconsolate. Ajasat reigned for 32 years and was himself deposed and killed by his son Uda:yin. An encounter between Devadatta and Ajasat is narrated at length in Samannaphala Sutta of the Dhiga Nikaya. In the Milindapanna there is a discourse on the theme of admitting Devadatta to the Order by the Buddha. Devadatta was the son of a maternal uncle of the Buddha who had been coverted by the Buddha himself. After becoming a respected member of the Sangha, Devadatta started a series of plots including three attempted murders in order to take control of the Sangha. The enmity between the Buddha and Devadatta was not limited to this life. Each of Devadattas efforts to overthrow the Buddha failed.
The film Maharaja Ajasat is like an audiovisual flow chart based on the established context of religious texts. Finding good texts has not been difficult for the producer (Sunil T) as well as the director (Sanath Abeysekara) of this film and these texts have given what they wanted to make a flow chart like film. A flow chart is a way to map the sequence of procedures and processes with which we make even the most simple things happen. But a flow chart is like a skeleton that has to be fleshed out by the texts. The concepts are linear, rigid, conventional and traditional. The spectra are generalisable and convey conventional historic meanings. As such, there is no fresh communicative power. Where lies the range or depth of this monotonous film The restricted range of events impede a greater understanding and appreciation of the producers work. Unfortunately the pragmatic effectiveness of successful communication is very low because fluency, confidence, imagination and accuracy have been surprisingly sacrificed for lucrative realities. Why should the key characters talk so much Why is the film full of action Where lies the creators viewpoint or vision Superfine new technology, verbosity and overaction are sterile attempts to generate fluidity, novelty and imagination. Contrary to the basic view that meaning is non linear and multi-dimensional, this film forcefully encourages and promotes the establishment of a linear uni-directional meaning profile. Are coincidences casually dependent Are Devadatta and Ajasat notorious despots Are Bimbisara and his queen sacred divine ones There are brutal and horrible scenes in addition to unbelievable queer episodes which an enlightened intelligent audience would not accept to digest easily without questioning.
As in any other ordinary film there are well chosen characters, themes and issues of conflict, events, a beginning, a middle and an end. Messages are transmitted. There is an extensive waste of human, technical and temporal resources. But what is lacking is creativity. The director and the producer had nothing to discover or invent other than the extensive application of technical knowhow. The intelligent audience would cast a sympathetic eye on the submerged talents of Sabita Perera and Jeevan Kumaratunga. This adverse comment applies to other central actors too. If the focus of attention has been on the Queen Mother instead of on Ajasat, the film could have taken a metaphorical patterning, non-linear design and multi-dimensionally meaningful.

IGP should probe bribery claims-Champika,Rajitha

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had requested IGP N.K. Illangakoon to probe the allegations made by Avant Garde Maritime Security Services Chairman Major (Retd) Nissanka Senadhipathi that the two ministers had solicited bribes.
Writing to IGP Illangakoon they said that Major Senadhipathi had told the media that four ministers in the current government, who wanted money from him during the election timescharged that Rakna Araksha Lanka Limited (RALL) having control is merely a front and that they are mere bystanders while Avant Garde is actually in charge in the guise of administrators as he was refused to fund them.
He had also noted that he has enough recordsto prove it if they want to do so.
In some media Senadhipathi has mentioned the names of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka as the ministers who had solicited bribes.
The ministers said these allegations were baseless and they have never asked money from Nissanka Senadhipathi or anyone who attached to the Avant Garde.
We talked against Avant Garde Maritime security Services, because of its so-called maritime security procedure. Nothing against Nissanka Senadhipathi or his private deals and businesses, the ministers stated.
According to the letter that the ministers sent to the IGP, there is no veiled license to Maritime Security Services (Pvt) Ltd to keep firearms and explosives. They have noted that keeping such huge stock of weapons illegally can be a threat to the state security. The Avant Garde has involved in several agreements with foreign countries including Nigeria which government should be involved and it can be created diplomatic issues. They have taken money which should receive by local trainee sea marshals and they have grabbed huge amounts of money which should receive to the government.
Minister Senaratne and Minister Ranawaka are requesting IGP N K Illangakoon to probe the allegations made by Senadhipathi and the facts which they have mentioned in their letter and take immediate actions to put the law in to action.

Inflation for October rises to 3.0%
Sri Lanka's inflation in October 2015 determined under a new National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) rose to 3.0 %, the Department of Census and Statistics said on Monday.
The inflation, as measured by the change in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), rose to 1.7% in October.
Since the CCPI, prepared by the Department of Census and Statistics for the calculation of changes in the price level and inflation, only depicts the price changes in Colombo municipal area, the Department last month decided to introduce the National Consumer Price Index.

NCPI will have weights based on consumer spending in 2012/13, and will reflect new methods consistent with international best practices.
The NCPI declared on 21st of each month starting from 21 November 2015 would use 2013 as its base year.
Based on the NCPI, the inflation in September was steady from a month earlier at 1.9%.
On a monthly basis, the NCPI in October increased 0.7% to 109.2 from 108.4 in September.
Year-on-Year inflation of Food Group has increased from 1.1% in September 2015 to 2.3% in October 2015, while Non-food Group also increased by 3.2% to 4.4% during this period. (Govt. Info)

Krimiraja Ayurveda celebrates 66 years
Krimiraja is a household name in Sri Lanka. When it comes to Ayurveda and traditional medicine, that's the first brand and probably the only one which comes up.
It has created a niche for itself in the country, to the extent where it does not seem to have any competitor formidable enough to fight with. It's an enduring credit to Dr Amaratunga that he has managed to balance the needs of commerce with those of a country that has seen a resurgence in Ayurveda in recent years.
Dr Amaratunga was born in Kiriwaththuduwa, situated 30 kilometres or one and a half hours from Colombo, to a fairly well-off family. He was the fourth in his family, and his father, M. D. Liveris Amaratunga, was a prominent Ayurvedic physician. From an early age, he had seen stacks and stacks of medicines at home. He remembers that even at the age of four, he was helping his father in preparing these medicines and with his patients. It was only natural that when he grew up, he would take to his father's field like a duck to water.
Young Amaratunga was educated firstly at Kiriwaththuduwa Wijewardena MahaVidyalaya. During this time, he wanted to enter the Wickramaarachchi Ayurveda Institute in Gampaha, which he did while enrolling at Vidyalankara Campus. Admittedly he focused more on his apprenticeship at the Ayurveda Institute, which lasted five years as a diploma course. Admittedly, he focused more on his apprenticeship at the Ayurveda Institute, which lasted five years as a diploma course. He became a registered Ayurvedic doctor in 1971.
After leaving the institute at Gampaha, he threw himself into the family business. My father died when I was 15. He was a physician to the teeth and an excellent one. It was he who really began the Krimiraja brand, when in 1949 he concocted a prathyaksha (loosely translatable as efficacious) remedy for stomach ailments. That was when he began what I continued after he died. I was still engaged with my secondary education at the time.
Krimiraja was begun initially with three or four products.
Under Dr Amaratunga's oversight, the business portfolio has increased to about 300 products, from oils to mouthwashes to kasaya to pimple cures. We've targeted a wide customer base while keeping in mind that what we deliver should be based on traditional methods. But for millions of Sri Lankans, Krimiraja's signature would have to be the karalguli, a must-have and must-need for stomach ailments. That was my father's creation right through, and it remains our most popular product, he tells me, confirming how much of a legacy Liveris Amaratunga left behind with his business. It's sad that I never got to see what his vision was.
Currently, the success rate for a Krimiraja product would be anywhere from 70 to 80%. No medicinal system can boast of a 100% cure rate, he said.

Kumaratunga: Reconciliation will bridge Tamil-Sinhalese gap

Bridging the gulf that divides Tamil and Sinhalese population in Sri Lanka is essential for the wellbeing of the country, former President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, has said.
Ms. Kumaratunga, who was on a private visit to Alappuzha, toldthat she was involved in the national unity and reconciliation initiative being undertaken by the present government as part of confidence-building measures.
There is a huge gulf between Tamils and Sinhalese. There are schools for all communities and there are also schools of different communities. Many Tamils do not speak Sinhalese and vice-versa. Earlier, English was not encouraged or rather downgraded in the country. Unlike India, there was no link language, she said.
The reconciliation exercise would go a long way in establishing harmony, she said about the recently started process.
Unique experimentRecalling that there was a time when her life was in danger, Ms Kumaratunga said, My phones were tapped. My house was watched. A lot of people did not have freedom. Things have changed since the new government took charge. The ruling alliance is a unique experiment in Asia as parties with opposing programmes have come together. Members of former extremist groups, who have given up violence, have also joined the system, she said.
Asked whether women were enjoying freedom in the country, Ms. Kumaratunga said: Certainly. More women are getting into jobs than men. But when it comes to politics, there is no quota. But the new government is going to implement a regulation that at least 25 per cent of the nominees in elections should be women.
Having had overcome half-a-dozen attacks on her life, she is much more confident than ever. I am an atheist; but I believe in my principles, I have never violated basic principles. That has given me a lot of confidence, she said.

Lanka incurs $ 100 m annual loss due to EU ban on fish exports
The country incurs a US $ 100 million annual loss due to the ban on fish exports by the European Union, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the National Fisheries Day celebrations, Amaraweera said the EU used to buy 68 percent of Sri Lankan fish while Sri Lanka was still placed as the second largest tuna exporter to the region.
We are hopeful that we could get the EU ban lifted. The EU has made recommendations to Sri Lanka to re-enter the market. Establishing a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) was a significant recommendation, the minister said.
The European Commission announced a ban on imports of fisheries products from Sri Lanka from January 1 for the failure to tackle illegal fishing.
The minister said the new system would monitor the activities of trawler boats and curb illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters.
He said politicians in Tamil Nadu are responsible persons for this issue.
We will never let fishermen in foreign vessels catch fish in Sri Lankan waters in the future, he said.

Ochini and Nirmala clinch CP Table Tennis titles
Fourteen year old Ochini Dissanaike of Mahamaya Girls College came up with a stunning performance to win the Ladies Open Event while the same event for Men was grabbed by former National champion Nirmala Jayasinghe of MAS Holdings at the 4th Sakura Holdings Challenge Shield Central Province Table Tennis Championship organised by the Kandy District Table Tennis Association and sponsored by Sakura Holdings (Pvt) Limited and worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium, in Ganegoda off Peradeniya.
Over 400 paddlers ranging from the age of 8 to working class participated in this major event which saw many upsets including that of reigning Junior and Senior National champion Udaya Ranasinghe of Vidyartha College who could not win a single event. This was one championship he went winless since he started playing about eight years rose up to become the youngest National champion and the same year in 2014 he won the Junior National Title as well at the age of 15.
Ochini Dissanaike who won the Ladies Singles has a national ranking of 20 and has been striving hard often coming up with good performances at Junior Level but she at her age group level had high level performers like Samadhi Hettiarachchi, Thanushi Rodrigo, Sandamini Kularatne, and Janani Pushpakumara to contend with and often it is one of the those paddlers who grabbed the honours.
In the Ladies Open finals she beat the highly talented Samadhi Hettiarachchi of Mahamaya Girls College 3/2 after a gruelling battle a match which could have gone either way and the spectators were at the edge of their seats till Ochini Dissanaike finished off the raging battle with a 11/6 win after being led  at the end of the third set.
The battle started off with Ochini Dissanaike winning the first set 11/7 but Samadhi Hettiarachchi fought back in the second set to win 11/4 to level the match. The third set saw Samadhi Hettiarachchi forge ahead with a 11/6 win in the third set to lead 2/1. Came the crucial fourth set and a win by Samadhi could finish off the battle but if Ochini wins the match will go into the fifth set. Ochini won the fourth set 11/6 and the scores were level at 2 all. The decisive fifth set saw Ochini Dissanaike putting up a fine display while Samadhi Hettiarachci played some what a relaxed game and paid the penalty for it losing 6/11. In the semi finals the Central Province open event champion Kanchana Wedagedera of Sri Lanka Army and Sandamini Kularatne of Mahamaya Girls College fell off.
The Open Mens singles went to former national champion and Sri Lankas captain to the Asian Championship in China. Having a national ranking of number two Nirmala Jayasinghe scored a facile 3/0 win over Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College with the loser unable to meet the drops and smashed by the winner. But Chathura Gunasekera had the distinction of beating the national champion Udaya Ranasinghe in the semi finals.
The Girls under 15 event saw Tharushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya College defeat her schoolmate Sandamini Kularatne 3/1. The loser put up a good fight but could not polish off the sets with a win. But she did show good progress. The under 15 event for boys was won by the up and coming Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College who won 3/1 against Disanka Tennakoon of Dharmaraja College.
The under 18 girls singles event saw the reversal of fortunes with Sandamini Kularatne of Mahamaya College scoring a shock 3/2 win over her earlier vanquisher Thanushi Rodrigo. This was a match which saw alternating winning trend. Sandamini lost the first set 10/12 and won the second set 11/8. Thanushi won the third set 11/7 only to concede the fourth set 8/11. Sandamini exerting more power and placement of shots won the crucial fifth set 11/5 to wrap up the proceedings.
Krishan Wickremaratne was another Vidyarthian to prove his mettle when he won the boys under 18 title by toppling none other than the reigning national champion Udaya Ranasinghe 3/1 in the finals. Udaya Ranasinghe who appeared to be short of practice put up an unimpressive display winning only the second set 11/6 but the rest was won by Krishan in style and the match did not even go into the fifth set. The losers in the semi finals were Chathura Gunasekera and Tilina Wijesiri both good performers.
Tharani Galagoda of Hillwood College is turning out to be a bright prospect as she once again won the girls under 12 title by defeating Hasini Ikiriwatte of Hillwood College 3/1, Tharani Galagoda scored comprehensive wins in the first sets including a rare win in the first set but lost closely in the third set losing 1012.

Pakistan's Amir in Bangladesh on redemption road
DHAKA, MONDAY: Mohammad Amir's last appearance on a cricket pitch outside his native Pakistan led to a six-month sentence in a British prison for corruption.
Five years on, the paceman was the headline act in the opening match as Bangladesh's Twenty20 league staged its own comeback after a fixing scandal. But as Amir and the Bangladesh Premier League look to turn over a new leaf, one of cricket's most respected figures, Kumar Sangakkara, says the game could "die" if spectators are not convinced matches are clean.
Amir, playing for the Chittagong Vikings against the Rangpur Riders, took four for 30 on Sunday, delighted to be competing once more against stars such as Pakistan's Test skipper Misbah ul-Haq whom he bowled with a perfect yorker at Dhaka's national stadium.
Amir, now 23, was jailed in 2011 after admitting bowling no balls the previous summer against England at Lord's in exchange for cash. AFP

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday, said the government has to think twice on the proposal of amalgamating the EPF and ETF.

Govt allocated Rs. 121 bn for education - Ravi
The Government has allocated more than Rs. 121 billion, much more than the previous year for recurrent expenditure for Education, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that any member who was doubtful over the said allocation, could believe it when the money is utilized.
He made this observation yesterday, when the Opposition questioned him of the allocations made on education.
Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena stated that the allocation made to a ministry is spent under two heads, adding the day to day expenses come under recurrent expenditure, while allocations made to development projects of a ministry comes under capital expenditure.
He said, everybody including those of the opposition commended the allocation as historic.
The allocation for capital expenditure for 2015 was Rs. 17 billion, while the proposed allocation for 2016 is Rs. 18 billion, Bandula Gunawardena said. But day to day expenses of the same ministry for 2015 was Rs. 44 billion, whereas it has been increased by Rs. 121 billion for 2016. It was said altogether the allocation is Rs. 145 billion for the recurrent expenditure.
Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena stated that it is said in proposals Rs 124,883 million is allocated for provision of services, while the allocation for the same purpose last year was Rs. 2,994 million, However there is no explanation as to how that money is to be spent, Gunawardena said. At this stages, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake stated that schools have around 11,000 buildings. But if we were to pay a rent for them, it comes to accounts. But these buildings do not come to accounts. The ADB, UF and World Bank has such a mechanism to include them in the accounts.
The Finance Minister stated that as an initiation in the Education Ministry and Health Ministry, those proprieties have been brought to the accounts. They are clearly included in the appropriation accounts, the Finance Minister said. They should come into realistic accounts.
At this stage Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that it was a novel estimation of properties of relevant ministries.
However it is wrong to estimate and include them in expenditure heads and to say this much of money has been spent by the government during 2016, Anura Dissanayake said.
At this stage, Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that this matter should be clarified at the party leaders meeting. He said if not they could not sign a blank cheque.
At this stage Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the matter could be solved at the Party Leaders meeting.
I complained about misappropriation of Rs. 240 million to FCID - Thalatha
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale said in Parliament yesterday, that she had complained to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) concerning the misappropriation of Rs. 240 million in financial resources at the Foreign Employment Bureau during the previous regime.
She said that the Auditor General was in possession of the details of this scam following investigations conducted by him on the misappropriation of funds.
She further said that there had been misappropriation of funds amounting to Rs 9,119,909 for a road show in Gampaha, Colombo and Hambantota on awareness of foreign employment, Rs 2,854,000 as a payment made to Rawanaella Food and Caterers for the supply of meals for the road show at Gampaha and Colombo, payment of Rs 3,627,000 made to Tata Tailoring for the purchasing of T-shirts and caps for the road show, payment of Rs 925,309.40 made to Salacine for the purchase of banners and balloons for the road show and a payment of Rs 1,713,600 made to Salacine for materials purchased for propaganda at the road show in Hambantota.
Obtaining a sum of Rs 1,693,600 fraudulently by preparing forged documents and granting it to non-governmental organisations, payment of Rs 3.5 million for a series of pirikara for the family members of Rataviru, granting a relief of Rs 3,962,410 for the Rataviru family members of Hali Ela, in the Badulla district due to the earthslip on December 2014, expenses amounting to Rs 9,157,060 incurred from the ceremony for laying the foundation stone to the migrant resources center at Hali Ela, and misappropriation of Rs 9,559,884 for political activities.
The minister said so in response to a question raised by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti. The minister in her response mentioned a foundation by the name of an MP as one of the organisations which obtained the funds.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena stood up and said that it was against Standing Orders of Parliament to mention the names of MPs.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Minister Atukorale both said that they were referring to the Dilan Perera Foundation, but not to an MP.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that there was nothing wrong in mentioning the name of Dilan Perera Foundation and it was permissible.

Sexy Sounds of the Soul
There arent a lot of new bands in Sri Lanka that make you go wow  but The Soul is one. Its not just me, Ive been taking friends with me as guinea pigs to their gigs and every time so far, Ive heard them go wow.
Although The Soul is best loved for their covers of reggae classics (a la Bob Marleys repertoire), if youre at a gig thats more than an hour long theyll show you a variety of genres, including a handful of killer originals. Cover music is a popular thing locally  its how a lot of bands get paid, by doing covers at bars  but one of the things that sets this band apart, is the vocals. Some of the covers actually sound like originals. Dave Roberts, lead vocalist of The Soul, has a voice thats silky smooth. He varies enunciation to make it interesting  suddenly a vaguely Carnatic lilt of a note, or a baritone drop that commands your attention. One of those voices that you would instantly recognize if you heard it on the radio. The guy can sing the phonebook, and it would still sound beautiful.
Then theres Daves right-hand-man, Khazim Miskin on the guitar. Khazim is a wizard at the instrument, keeping pace with Daves vocal meanderings, sometimes deciding the pace himself, shifting suddenly and effortlessly from a consistent reggae beat to a complicated, emotive series of chords. You can tell he has a special relationship with his guitar. All the while youll see him smiling coolly, sometimes eyes closed, in a calm, zen-like state. The band has also got Pradeep John and Nisal Jayasinghe on guitar, Nisala Perera on drums and Uvindu Perera on bass  all following up closely, never missing a beat, buffeting the performance with a solid groove.
What is different about them is that they have excellent chemistry, and that is in fact, what makes some of the greatest bands (another local band that comes to mind with good chemistry is Thriloka). The band members know and love each other so well, that communicating through their voices and instruments with each other seems a seamless process, much to the delight of onlookers.
The band is only about a year old - we were told by Pradeep. But they seem to have shot to relative fame in the past few months, with gigs at Qbaa and The Long Bar among other popular hangouts.
Ive so far managed to stalk them to a handful of gigs, and Ive noticed that their songs seem to change at every performance  the songs arent treated as pieces with fixed chords and fixed ranges, but as organic, free-moving compositions, which can be played around with every time. The performances have a fluid nature and can change depending on the mood of the drummer or the vocalist or the guitarist, which makes it exciting to watch and listen, especially at the end of the song when it dwindles to an impromptu jam with a bit of jazz-scat.
One of my favourite covers are Bob Marleys Jammin  its one of the first songs Ive watched them perform, and it is an excellent exploitation of Daves vocals and stage presence  he is soulful with his reggae  and even as someone who appreciates Marley I can honestly admit I liked it better than the original. Bill Withers The Two Of Us and Gnarls Barkleys Crazy are two other brilliant covers re-made to sound fresh and new. Whats Up With All The Time and Alive are the fore-runners of The Soul originals. The first is a poetic reflection on time and the human struggle to survive it, featuring a killer reggae beat, clever lyrics and some interesting echo-effects on vocals.
Alive is more alternative rock, with a hauntingly evocative chorus, coupled with a series of catchy, unforgettable guitar chords. They have only a handful of originals so far, and they hope to bring out an album soon at the beginning of next year.
The band members themselves are so humble and relaxed and easy to approach. At a promotional gig at Majestic City once, they even took up a cover of a popular Sinhala song for a fan in the audience. I think the fact that they dont seem to yet be fully aware of just how talented they really are, makes them all the more endearing.
You can look for the band on Soundcloud, but the recordings are not the same as the live performances, so I suggest you stay tuned on Facebook.com/SoulBandSL for updates on their gigs. Its an exciting time for Sri Lankan music, when theres fresh new talent like The Soul making little waves. Heres hoping theyre paving the way for kindred spirits.

SLC gives greenlight to Pakistan to host India series
Sri Lanka Cricket's interim committee met yesterday and gave the greenlight for Pakistan to play India in a series of three One-day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals in December.
"The request came from the Pakistan Cricket Board who are the hosts to interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny," said Sri Lanka Cricket interim committee vice-president Kushil Gunasekera.
"The interim committee met today and was happy to accommodate such a series and gave its approval for it to take place in Sri Lanka. It needs to be ratified by the Minister of Sports," he said.
Gunasekera said that for Sri Lanka to host a series between the two Asian giants was huge and that it would generate revenue to Sri Lanka Cricket.
The matches are to be played at the R Premadasa Stadium and at the Pallekele International Stadium.
Sri Lanka had previously played host to Pakistan in a Test match against Australia which was played at the P Sara Oval in October 2002.
A PTI report from Dubai states that Sri Lanka has emerged as the likely venue for the much-awaited Indo-Pak bilateral cricket series and an official announcement may be made on November 27.
While BCCI made it clear that they will not play in the United Arab Emirates and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) refusing to play in India, the only feasible option left was the island nation, which will act as the neutral venue.
With only a month's window available after India finish their Test series against South Africa on December 7, the series is likely to be confined to three ODIs and two T20 Internationals instead of the original two Tests, five ODIs and two T20 Internationals, according to top BCCI sources.
The proceedings had been fast-tracked once BCCI president and current ICC chairman Shashank Manohar met PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and senior official Najam Sethi in presence of ECB supremo and chairman of 'Pakistan Task Force' Giles Clarke.
Without divulging any details, both Sethi and Khan had said on Sunday that the meeting with Manohar was "fruitful" giving an indication that the deadlock on the marquee series was broken.
"Since PCB will need the permission of Nawaz Sharif before going official, Shaharyar Khan will need to go back to Islamabad and seek the Prime Minister's permission. Once he gets the green light from the PM, he will again come back to Dubai and intimate his decision to Clarke. Clarke is likely to officially announce the series on November 27," the source told PTI on Monday.
It has been learnt that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has been approached by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and they seem to be keen to host the series.
This will be the first time that a Test playing nation has rejected playing a series in the UAE since it became Pakistan's adopted home after the 2009 Lahore attacks.
BCCI president Manohar is very much against India playing international matches in UAE. In fact Manohar was also a vocal critic when the first part of IPL was shifted to the UAE last year due to the general elections.
According to reliable sources, UAE has always come under scanner for being a haven for shady people and match fixers.
In fact, a recent ODI match between Pakistan and England came under scanner with former England captain Michael Vaughan expressing his suspicion through a series of tweets which he later removed.
However ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson downplayed the incident stating that there is no reason to be suspicious about the match.

Tactical battle as Australia, NZ look for Night Test supremacy
PERTH, AUSTRALIA : New Zealand are anticipating a battle of tactics as they venture into cricket's new world in this week's first-ever day-night third Test against Australia, coach Mike Hesson said Monday.
The cricket world is watching with interest as trans-Tasman rivals Australia and New Zealand face off with a revolutionary pink ball at Adelaide Oval from Friday. Zaheer Abbas, the new president of the International Cricket Council, hailed the day-night Test concept as "thoroughly enlightened".
The pink ball's capacity to swing freely and create collapses at night in preparatory matches means the final session of play has become more problematic than the first two sessions.
It leaves rival skippers Steve Smith and Brendon McCullum with big decisions to make this week.
Smith indicated his thinking when captaining New South Wales in this season's day-night domestic Sheffield Shield round by declaring on day one to utilise the swing of paceman Mitchell Starc, who grabbed three wickets in the evening session with the aid of some noticable in-swingers.
Hesson said the clamour to bowl at night could be a key battle at Adelaide.
"There's definitely something to that (declaring to bowl at night)," he told reporters.
"If you think that's the best chance to take a few early wickets. There'll definitely be some tactical plays throughout the Test."
New Zealand suffered a collapse of four for 30 in their two-day practice tour match in Perth on Sunday after dinner against Western Australia.
The Blackcaps' bowlers had created havoc by swinging the second new ball in Saturday's night session with WA losing five for 21. Swing-induced collapses have become a regular occurrence in day-night Sheffield Shield fixtures this season leading up to the Adelaide Test.
"At night with the new ball it swings and probably more so than it does during the day," Hesson said.
"That's been very consistent over the past couple of years with the pink ball.
"Obviously, things can change pretty quickly at night. That was good for us to experience. We head to Adelaide knowing not everything but knowing enough."
Hesson added that the Adelaide Oval pitch would shape the Test, especially when it came to the colour of the ball.
"All the talk is there'll be grass on the wicket," he said.
"Over the five days it's certainly going to dry out so it (the ball) might hold its colour a lot more at the start of the Test than it will at the end. "We'll have to see the wicket ... it's not a perfect science, is it" AFP

UN Chief urges Russia, US to cooperate on terrorism
MALAYSIA : UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged Russia and the United States on Sunday to cooperate in rooting out terrorism and said he would unveil a comprehensive plan to fight extremism and violence early next year.
United States President Barack Obama and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev separately called on all countries to coordinate and thwart Islamic State after its recent devastating attack on a Russian plane and on multiple targets in Paris.
Ban said he counted on their support to wipe out a common enemy and the United Nations was gathering ideas from members towards a joint counter-terror strategy.
All these terrorists and ideology extremists should be defeated in the name of humanity, he said during a meeting in Malaysia with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the annual East Asia Summit.
We need to unite. We need to show global solidarity to address ... the common enemy of ISIL, Daesh, some other extremists and terrorist groups, he said, referring to Islamic State.
US President Barack Obama at the same summit said Islamic State was a bunch of killers with good social media who would be thwarted by the United States and its allies.
Destroying (Islamic State) is not only a realistic goal, we're going to get it done, he told a news conference.
We will take back land they are currently in, take out their financing, hunt down leadership, dismantle their networks, supply lines and we will destroy them.
Obama said it would be helpful if Russia directed its focus on tackling Islamic State and he hoped Moscow would agree to a leadership transition in Syria that meant its President Bashar al-Assad stepping down.
The question at this point is whether (Russia) can make the strategic adjustment that allows them to be effective partners with us and the other 65 countries, he said.

Little Children:
Winslet wins them over!
Though you might think otherwise Little Children opens with a grave tone which lasts throughout the story. Sarah Pierce is an outsider in her stay-at-home-mom community. Though she seems to have it , Sarah is trapped in an unhappy marriage and has to spend time taking care of her daughter. Sarah visits a park daily with her daughter and there she encounters Brad, an attractive house-husband.
Little Children focuses on the ramifications of Sarahs affair with Brad. His life is no bed of roses. He is struggling to pass the bar exam and is in an unhappy marriage with a successful documentary filmmaker.
The film is a portrait of immature mothers and fathers who seem unable to take care of themselves let along their children! They follow their whim and almost end up in hot water. The need to confront and come to terms with ones own problems, accepting responsibilities, the virtue of remaining nonjudgmental and how innocent children suffer due to the decisions taken by grown are ups are some of the themes which are a part of Little Children. In other words, it is Sarah, Brad and the rest of the grown people who are the titular children. That is why they use Ronnie, a new arrival at town, as a scapegoat to unleash their personal pressures because he has previously been a sex offender.
Destructive effect
A good point to note down here is that director Todd Field has not been nave enough to portray Ronnie as a simple victim. Larry who heads Ronnies witch hunt actually ends up masturbating in a car and ends up threatening a woman with violence if she dares mention it. The underlying message here seems to be that you can engage in sex related acts in private but not expose in public.
But Little Children isnt just another tearful look at the destructive effects of lust. The question of sexual morality is blurred and twisted out of recognition by Ronnies plight.
Kate Winslet as Sarah Pierce with the child actor who plays her daughter
Parent-offspring dramatics are explored in the movie. The suburban society in the movie has been highly caricatured. You get instances like young mothers drooling over a hot looking young father and a man lusting over a prostitute he had located via the internet instead of spending more time with his attractive wife. Likewise a young mother lets her profession dominate her marriage thereby leaving room for her husband to engage in adultery.
Though the film is titled Little Children, it is more suitable for adults. There are quite a number of nude scenes in the film and a few characters even use foul language.
Misplaced heart
Kate Winslet heads the cast as Sarah. The talented actress puts her skills to good use in putting her talents to good use by portraying Sarah as a woman with a misplaced heart rather a slut or desperate psychopath. Patrick Wilson makes a fitting Brad. Jennifer Connelly is tolerable as Brads wife, Kathy. Jackie Earle Haley, Noah Emmerich, Gregg Edelman, Phyllis Somerville, Raymond J. Barry, Jane Adams, Ty Simpkins and Sadie Goldstein make up the rest of the cast.
Betrayal, fear, anger and guilt are not buried far within Little Children. Itis unsettling stuff, shifting from black comedy to bleak drama and back, even punctuated by the odd moment of slapstick and all overseen by a knowing, slightly arch narrator. However such apparently inconsistent touches add to a sense of realism. These characters may be prettier than your average, but they live in a recognisable, topsy-turvy world, riddled with fear of the unknown and an even bigger fear of failing to explore it.

World must not succumb to fear of terror - Obama
MALAYSIA: US President Barack Obama called Sunday for resolve in the face of heightened jihadist threats, insisting panicked citizens must not succumb to fear and urging world leaders not to abandon a climate summit in Paris.
With Brussels in lockdown, cities from Beirut to Bamako reeling from attacks, and Americans jittery that they too may come under assault, Obama said the world must show steel.
That starts, he said, with leaders who are scheduled to attend climate talks later this month in Paris, where 130 people were killed in one night of blood-soaked violence.
The perpetrators of the Paris attacks were not masterminds he said, but rather a bunch of killers with good social media.
Its absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business, he said.
They must also show that Paris, one of the most beautiful, enticing cities in the world, is not going to be cowered by the violent demented actions of a few.
Facing accusations that he has allowed the Islamic State group to spread by refusing to send US troops to Syria or step up the air campaign there, Obama made his most determined pledge yet to win the fight.
The American people in the past have confronted some very real, enormous threats. And we beat them. We vanquished them, he said. This will be no different.
But Obama sought to show that even as allies take the fight to the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, an equally vital battle will be fought on the home front.
In addition to hunting down terrorists, in addition to effective intelligence, in addition to missile strikes and in addition to cutting off financing, he said, the most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that were not afraid.
They cannot strike a mortal blow against France or the United States or a country like Malaysia, but they can make people fearful, Obama said, speaking in Kuala Lumpur and using an acronym for Islamic State.
Obama was ending a nine-day trip to Turkey and Asia that has been clouded by the Paris terror attacks and credible threats that prompted Belgian authorities to deploy troops and impose a lockdown as they hunt suspects.
Amid wall-to-wall and sometimes breathless television coverage of terror threats, Obama urged journalists to maintain perspective. He also addressed sometimes shrill calls for the United States to close its doors to refugees from Syria and Iraq, for fear jihadists may lurk among them.
He urged Americans against succumbing to the fear that allows us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live.
Obama, the son of a migrant mother and migrant father, voiced his personal determination to face down anti-refugee measures that he has already threatened to veto.
Remembering a Saturday visit to children from Myanmar at a refugee centre in Malaysia, Obama urged compassion.
If you are a parent and you saw those kids, and thought about what they went through, the notion we couldnt find a home for them anywhere in the United States of America... he said, trailing off into anger. That is contrary to our values.
