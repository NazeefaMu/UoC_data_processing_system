C.W.W. Kannangaras vision essential today
C.W.W. Kannangara, who is considered the father of free education, always devised and implemented plans targetting the welfare of future generations rather than the next election. Kannangaras vision is a practical vision which is applicable to the present day, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was speaking at the national ceremony to commemorate the 134th birth anniversary of the educationist at the Hewaheta Madya Maha Vidyalaya last Saturday.
The minister also said the school was the countrys first green school.
Minister Kariyawasam said that even though most politicians devised plans with an eye on the next elections, C.W.W. Kannangara eschewed such practice as he was concerned about the welfare of future generations.
He acted as a real state leader to ensure the security of future generations. Everyone should strive to create a knowledge-based society by adopting Kannangaras policies to suit present-day conditions and needs, he added.
Kannangara not only suffered election defeat due to his forthright polices, but also faced economic as well as other difficulties later in life. The free education system introduced by him has enabled children of even underprivileged families to excel in education and occupy important positions here and abroad, the minister said.
Minister Kariyawasam, who acknowledged the services rendered by past governments to develop the education sector, said that even though private education had come to the forefront today, the government had taken steps to strengthen free education during the past three years.
One aspect in the endeavour was the introduction of the Suraksha Insurance Scheme for the benefit of 4.5 million schoolchildren. Steps had been taken to establish two schools with classes up to G.C.E. Advanced Level, teaching all subjects in each divisional secretariat division, the minister said and added that he had also taken steps to provide necessary human resources to schools by appointing 4,000 principals, recruiting 852 persons to the Education Administrative Service, and appointing 1,190 new recruits to the teaching service.
There are plans to recruit another batch of over 800 teachers and over 1,000 persons to the Education Administrative Service. Provincial Councils too had been provided with the necessary funds to fill teacher vacancies in schools run by them. The teacher shortage in national schools would be solved by the end of this year, Minister Kariyawasam said.
Teacher transfers at national schools had not previously been carried out for 30 years. As the Education Minister, he said he had tackled that issue without any fear. Plans were also afoot to recruit over 3,000 teachers as student counsellors, as well as a batch of 3,800 sports instructors, the minister added.
Former Provincial Councillors Shanthinie Kongahage and Gamini Wijayabandara, Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, Provincial Education Director Tilak Ekanayake and Principal Kapila Priyantha were also present.

Export-oriented passion fruit cultivation zone inaugurated
Farmers to earn Rs.700,000 annual income
The inauguration of the export-oriented passion fruit cultivation zone of the country was held recently in Pelawatte, Moneragala, under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Under the first stage of the project, which has been implemented by the Agriculture Ministry Agriculture Modernisation Unit, 35 acres of land in Pelawatte, Moneragala, have been allocated for passion fruit cultivation, while an additional 35 acres of land have been distributed among 75 farmers as half-acre allotments.
A high-yielding passion fruit variety called Horana Gold will be cultivated in this zone.
A farmer would be able to receive an annual income of Rs.700,000. The entire passion fruit harvest of the zone is scheduled to be purchased by the private sector and there will not be any issue for farmers to find a market for their produce, the minister said.
Agricultural tool sets worth Rs.700,000 were distributed to all 75 farmers during the inauguration.
This zone was established under the Agriculture Development Project Api Wawalai-Api Kanne, implemented by the Agriculture Ministry with the intention of stopping the importation of vegetables, fruits, grams and other food products that could be grown easily in the country.

Former President forgets he had AG under his wing
The former President who accuses us of interfering in the affairs of the Attorney General forgets the manner in which he kept the Attorney Generals Department under his wing during his regime, said Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Talatha Athukorale.
The former President seems to have forgotten the manner in which he interfered in the Judiciary by issuing marching orders to the then Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake by giving her 24 hours to vacate office, she said.
The Minister was speaking at the opening of the Ratnapura  Mudduwa road, built at a cost of Rs. 12.6 million, recently.
Minister Athukorale said notwithstanding all allegations and challenges levelled by opponents, the government would continue its full term until 2020. The UNP would not remain idle despite losing the Pradeshiya Sabha elections. They had entered politics to serve the people with good intentions.
As Ministers, they always endeavoured to safeguard the honour and integrity of their onerous posts. They also believed in the principle that political power is transient and not eternal, she said.
They would not try to cling onto power by hook or by crook as some people tried to do in the past, the Minister said.

We need shift to invention strategy
Sri Lanka cannot steer its economy forward by depending on the export processing zone concept anymore. The only option is to change over to an invention strategy since it has intelligent people and affordable labour, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the second stage of the Aluthgama Central Bus stand development programme recently. The project, costing Rs 45 million, comes under the purview of the Urban Development Authority.
He said instead of a political culture which addressed 20 million stomachs, the country desperately needed an economic policy which addressed 20 million minds.
Minister Ranawaka said during the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime the garment industry which was restricted to Katunayake, Biyagama and Koggala was extended to the rural sector utilising affordable labour. But that concept lost its vigour by the 1990s, because affordable labour could not be found in Sri Lanka anymore.
Now not a single foreign investor would come over to Sri Lanka to invest even if the export processing zones were set up in each electorate. This called for a change in our strategy. The Sri Lankan economy was still stagnating by depending on traditional tea, rubber, coconut and garment exports, the Minister said.
As such, exports had not increased commensurate to the enormous amount of imports, he said.
In 1990, exports amounted to Rs. 5 billion in Vietnam and Sri Lanka. But Vietnam had surpassed us by recording Rs. 175 billion worth of exports, while Sri Lanka lagged behind with a mere Rs. 10 billion. To overcome this situation, we should change over to a new invention strategy, the Minister said.

Abans donates lap tops under Suhuru CSR initiative
The sixth stage of Abans Suhuru CSR initiative took place recently, at the Abans Head Office. Dedicated towards presenting deserving students with a laptop of their own to achieve their academic goals, the event represents the Companys overall aim of ensuring that every child of every socio economic background receives a worthy education.
Technology blended education is the key to developing skills and talents that the country needs in the future. Helping our young talent with devices which transform them into global students is of the utmost importance in todays context. So it is our responsibility to invest more in enhancing Sri Lankas educational standards, said Chathura Jayawardena, General Manager Abans PLC, remarking on the significance of the occasion.
In Sri Lanka, there are currently thousands of talented students whose ideas and minds have the potential to contribute significantly towards the economy. Yet, they lack the financial or social resources to engage in an academic career that will enable them to put their natural skills to use. To alleviate this issue, the Board of Directors of Abans Group has launched the Suhuru CSR initiative centered around helping underprivileged students excel in their education, which in turn enables them to experience a future that will benefit Sri Lanka as a whole.
Under the Suhuru CSR initiative, Abans has made significant progress towards accomplishing their goal by facilitating the distribution of laptops to low-income students across the country. Students, from the ages of 14 to 21, were given the chance to write to Abans on how a laptop would assist them in their education. Then the students, who Abans deemed the most deserving, were gifted with opportunity to receive a laptop. Each laptop provided by Abans offers durable hardware and advanced software features, so that students can bridge the technological knowledge gap and utilize key tools in support of their education.
From 2014 to present, more than 250 laptops have been donated through this CSR project, thereby, giving students the ability to turn their dreams into a reality. Over the years, Abans has earned widespread recognition as Sri Lankas largest IT hardware retailer island wide along with a reputation for making substantial investments in the local community. Abans is the market leader for IT, hosting the worlds best brands such as HP, DELL, Acer and Lenovo.
By launching Suhuru, Abans has taken a genuine step towards empowering the bright young minds that hold within them the potential to be future leaders of our nation.

The Lil Cake Toppers project began when Mun became fed up with giving impersonal wedding gifts.
I started customizing wooden cake toppers I discovered at a designers fair and gifted them instead, she reveals.
People loved them, and the more I made, the more I experimented with different topper designs, looks, accessories, and occasions.
Every hand-painted character is unique and designed according to information given by the buyer. When ordering a custom cake topper on Muns website, the customer is asked to fill in a simple form with the option to include a headshot of the subject, as well as pictures for referencing the desired outfit and accessories.
Design is in the details and small things like hairline, ear shape, and eye placement make a big difference in ensuring your cake toppers are two-of-a-kind, says Mun.
After all, wedding toppers dont have to be a gown and tux, theres a whole world of outfits, accessories and expressions to choose from!
So far, Mun has created over 900 toppers for clients all over the word. Her portfolio includes miniature brides and grooms representing a variety of cultures and styles.

Atlas Axillia empowers children at Colombo International Book Fair
The Atlas Axillia Activity Zone at The Colombo International Book Fair this year was based on the concept of making dreams come true; Atlas World of Dreams generated much interest and engagement among children with innovative and creative activations that gave children the opportunity to experience creativity first hand.
We at Atlas Axillia have always believed in empowering children through the mediums of self-expression and creativity says Ramani Samarasundera of Atlas Axillia, Creativity is a powerful concept that motivates children and brings out the best in them.
The Longest Drawing gave every child the opportunity to add his or her creativity using Atlas Pastels; it was a novel idea that caught the attention of many children and gave them a platform for participation and over 600meters of art expressions has been captured in the 10 days.
Magical Water World was yet another unique concept in which children under the age of 10 could draw a fish with Atlas Colour Pens, which was then visible in a three dimensional setting, as if their drawing came to life.
Dream Wall was another innovative activation that invited children to write their dreams and ambitions on a wall with Atlas Chooty pens; they could then dress up in a costume depicting their choice of a career and pose for photographs.
Uncommon Career Path caught the attention of children as a concept that featured the inspiring story of an uncommon professional  a personality who has risen to the top in an uncommon yet successful area of career. It was of importance for children and parents to be able to grasp the significance of all careers, especially those outside the traditional paths and review life hacks of those who have achieved success that way.
Children actively participated in pencil games, Bottle Ring Toss games with Atlas water bottles, write a story and many other activities that kept them enthralled. One such game, Guess the Career, invited the children to write their dream on a piece of paper while the parent was looking away. The parent was then asked to guess what the childs dream is  the matching answers won prizes. Under the Atlas Axillia Light a Dream CSR initiative, the Company invited all visitors to the Book Fair to hand in their used exercise books which would then be recycled towards providing new books for children from low income categories.

Attorney General makes oral submissions in case against Ven. Dhammaloka Thera
The Attorney General making his oral submissions in a case filed against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence yesterday told the Colombo High Court that there are legal provisions to charge three times the value of the elephant calf from Ven.Dhammaloka Thera as a penalty.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing for the Attorney General made the prosecutions oral submissions before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne.
He said that the elephant calf has been estimated to Rs.594,500
In his oral submissions, the SSC Bandara submitted to court that no application whatsoever had been submitted to the Wildlife Department by the accused to obtain a valid licence regarding the questionable baby elephant.
Further trial was fixed for October 25. The Attorney General (AG) had filed an indictment against Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence. This is the first time in Sri Lanka that an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without a valid licesce, following the amendments to Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 2009.

The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses in the case and three documents as production items in the case. Wild Life Department officials had taken into custody a two and half-year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Ven.Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence coming under the Fauna and Flora Act. The Attorney General further alleged that the accused had also committed a punishable offence under the Public Property Act since he had intentionally kept a baby elephant without a valid licence.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed this offence on or around January 28, 2015 within the Colombo High Courts jurisdiction.

Australia target first Asia series win since 2011 - Paine
Abu Dhabi, Monday: Australian skipper Tim Paine vowed his team would do its utmost to win the second Test against Pakistan starting in Abu Dhabi from Tuesday for a first series win in Asia since 2011.
The trying conditions of the pitches and hot weather have stopped Australia from winning a series since they beat Sri Lanka 1-0 in 2011.
Since then they have lost 4-0 in India (2013), 2-0 in United Arab Emirates to Pakistan (2014), 3-0 in Sri Lanka (2016), 2-1 in India (2017) and drew 1-1 in Bangladesh last year.
But Paines side snatched a morale-boosting draw on the fifth and final day in the first Test in Dubai, the skipper and number 10 Nathan Lyon seeing out the final 12.2 overs after being set a daunting target of 462 runs.
We want to win every series we are involved in, Paine said Monday. We are focusing on what we do and if we can do well for five days then we have a really good chance of winning it.
We are reasonably confident. After the last few days we got a little bit of relief and a little bit of mileage, so we know if we play our best cricket we have got a chance to win this Test match.
We are coming into this Test with a bit more momentum and guys know what to expect a bit more in these conditions, said Paine, who announced paceman Mitchell Starc will play in Abu Dhabi.
That is hint enough that Australia are likely to keep the same starting XI.
Paine admitted Pakistan were a very good team.
They have some good batters, particularly in these conditions. We know what we are up against and we know they are an excellent team and even better in these conditions.
Pakistan have been forced into making two changes after opener Imam-ul-Haq fractured his finger in Dubai. He will be replaced by Fakhar Zaman for his first Test.
They also left out fast bowler Wahab Riaz, who went wicketless in the first Test, and will pick one from uncapped pacer Mir Hamza or leg-spinner Shadab Khan.
Pakistans only series loss in United Arab Emirates -- their neutral venue since attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus in 2009 forced them to play here -- was last year.
They lost to Sri Lanka 2-0, their first series loss in 10 attempts.
But Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed dispelled any fear of losing.
There is nothing like that (fear) and you would see that with the way we played the first Test. Throughout we played good cricket but unfortunately we couldnt get across the line, Ahmed said.
The team morale is high, batsmen have scored runs and bowlers have also taken wickets so we are very much hopeful of performing well to win the series.
Teams (from):
Australia: Tim Paine (capt), Ashton Agar, Brendan Doggett, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Jon Holland, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Michael Neser, Matthew Renshaw, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc

Australia's Starc sees Abu Dhabi green-top as a mirage
ABU DHABI, Monday - A well-grassed wicket might have been the last thing Mitchell Starc expected to see after landing in Abu Dhabi but Australias pace spearhead was loath to get his hopes up ahead of the second test against Pakistan.
The left-armer was made to toil on a typically lifeless pitch in the drawn first test in Dubai, grabbing only a solitary wicket while conceding 108 runs for more than 40 overs work in broiling heat.So it would have been understandable had he hoped some relief was at hand when a green-top was revealed after the covers were pulled off at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium.
Instead, Starc felt it all just a desert mirage.
It might be completely different tomorrow when they cut the grass off, Starc said. If we were playing on it today, the fast bowlers would be pretty happy with the covering of grass.
A lot of us expect that grass to be gone by tomorrow and probably even less come game day. The grass was still plentiful enough for selectors to consider picking a third seamer, captain Tim Paine added.
Looking at it now, if that was in Australia you would be playing three fast bowlers, he told reporters on Monday, the eve of the second test.
With the heat around in the next 24 hours, Im sure it will change pretty quickly.
There was some talk of resting Starc for the second test to preserve him for the four-match series against India in the home summer after he bowled a heavy load in the first innings in Dubai.
Starc was in no mood to rest up, though.
Hope not, he said. I dont know what the team is going to be like but I wont be putting my hand up for a rest.
Im feeling pretty good, its only my first game back for a while as well so Im feeling pretty fresh and pretty happy with how the balls coming out. A strike bowler more used to crashing through in short, sharp spells rather than wearing batsmen down with sustained pressure, Starc said he had learned to tone down his natural aggression in the United Arab Emirates.
While one wicket in Dubai was small beer compared to his usual hauls in the southern hemisphere, Starc embraced the workhorse role more associated with pace partner Peter Siddle and kept the run rate stingy.
Should the pitch retain its grass, Starc and Siddle could be joined by a debutant paceman in Michael Neser or Brendan Doggett.
Paine said the batting order could also be changed, though there seems little need to move around the new opening duo of Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja, who piled on the runs in a pair of strong opening stands in Dubai. We may consider tweaking (the batting order), said Paine.
I know guys had their individual meetings yesterday and all that stuff was discussed.
Again, well come tomorrow and make a call on the team and batting order and stuff, probably tomorrow.

Bolt fumes over drug test notice
Sydney, Monday: Sprint legend Usain Bolt says hes stunned after being handed a drug testing notice despite retiring from athletics and having no professional contract as he bids to launch a football career in Australia.
The 100m world record-holder quit athletics last year and is yet to be offered a deal by Australias Central Coast Mariners, where he is currently on trial.
So guys Ive retired from track and field looking to become a footballer but look at this, Bolt said Monday via an Instagram video as he zoomed in on the notice.
The demand for the out of competition test -- to collect urine and blood -- appears to have been issued by Football Federation Australia.
How am I going to get a drug test today Im not even a professional footballer yet. Seriously, said Bolt.
So I asked the lady, Why am I getting drug tested when I havent signed for a club yet and she said they told her Im an elite athlete so I have to get tested. Okay then.
Despite his displeasure, it appears the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority guidelines mean he is eligible to be tested.
Their legislation defines an athlete as a person who competes in sport if the sport has an anti-doping policy.
The eight-time Olympic champion, who dominated sprinting after taking double individual gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, is now bidding to become a professional footballer.
He made his case on Friday by scoring two goals for the Mariners in a pre-season friendly.
The superstar, a massive Manchester United fan, has been handed a chance to train with the A-League side for an indefinite period in order to pursue his dream. AFP

Colombo meeting focuses on e-commerce growth in South Asia
South Asia is emerging as one of the fast-growing regions in the world and is expected to play a dynamic role in shaping the Asian Century.
However the share of trade taking place among South Asian countries is only 5% in comparison to South Asias overall trade with the world at 20%, Minister of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said
He was addressing the opening session of SAARC CCIs Regional Workshop on E-Commerce by Islamabad based SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SAARC CCI) at Mount Lavinia Hotel.
The was joined by South Asia Regional Director of Friedrich Neumann Foundation for Liberty (FNF) Ronald Meinardus, Country Representative of FNF, Sagarica Delgoda, President of SAARC CCI Ruwan Edirisinghe, SAARC CCIs former Senior VP Nawaz Rajabdeen and more than 20 representatives from SAARC countries.
Despite low trade within the region, there are great potentials for using information and communication technologies to contribute to social and economic progress across South Asian Countries. By international standards the e-commerce sector is in its early stage in South Asia. However it is growing at a fast pace and provides a profitable and untapped market for businesses and investors within and across South Asia.
The need of the hour is for countries in the region to embrace e-commerce fully as it will enhance their economic and social development. Inadequate infrastructure acts as a major obstacle for e-commerce in this region. The governments need to invest in legal financial logistical and telecommunication infrastructure which is the backbone of any e-commerce initiative. Despite the challenges, the e-commerce and related sectors in the South Asian countries offer huge business and investment opportunities.
This Colombo Session will explore best practices and how to creatively collaborate on strategies, and e-commerce landscape and current trends. Importantly the session evaluates the current policy frameworks on e-commerce and even devising of an e-commerce policy guideline, roadmap and initiatives for SAARC CCI. In 2015 the Sri Lanka e-commerce sector grew by a mere one per cent and is now expected to grow by four per cent in the coming years. The total revenue from Sri Lankan E-commerce sector was estimated at US$ 8 million in 2016. Sri Lankan e-commerce experts now say that it will grow to US $4 billion by 2020.

The world's largest all-glass underwater restaurant is located in Hurawalhi, Maldives.
The restaurant was opened in late 2016 and it sits 5.8 meters (about 19 feet) below the surface.
This huge construction weighs 400 metric tonnes and is 90 square meters. To access the restaurant, diners walk across a pier towards the resort's over-water Aquarium Restaurant and head down a separate path to a long, winding staircase.
Each of 5.8's 10 tables offers views of the outside action. The coral landscape, which stretches around the edges of the tubular structure, draws all shapes and sizes of sea life right up to the glass, leaving you with the inescapable feeling that you're the one on display and the sea life are actually looking in at you. Courses include a mix of unique meat and seafood-based dishes that emphasize the flavours of the local and imported ingredients. All courses - sent down via a tiny elevator near the kitchen above -are paired with a selection of top wines, selected by the resort's sommelier. In addition to the seven-course dinner menu there's a four- or seven-course lunch.

Djokovic cruises past Coric to win fourth Shanghai title
SHANGHAI, Sunday - Novak Djokovic continued his scintillating run of form as he breezed past Croatian Borna Coric 6-3 6-4 to win the Shanghai Masters title for the fourth time on Sunday.
With a clever mix of groundstrokes, the 31-year-old Serb broke Corics serve in the sixth game and made a series of forays to the net as he consolidated his lead.
The Serb grabbed the opening set with a hold to love, having dropped just four points on his serve overall.
Coric, who collected one of the biggest wins of his career by defeating Roger Federer in the semi-finals, looked far from his best in his first ATP Masters final as he dropped his serve in the opening game of the second set.
The 21-year-old saved three match points to hold serve in the ninth game before Djokovic served out to clinch his fourth title of the season.
This was definitely one of the best service weeks that Ive had in my career, Djokovic, who did not drop his serve during the tournament, said.
I was saying before that I have never played on faster courts here in Shanghai, so this year more than ever I needed a lot of success with the first serves in.
Djokovic, who has returned to his brutal best this season with Grand Slam wins at Wimbledon and the U.S Open, will surpass Federer as world number two when the next edition of the ATP rankings are released on Monday.
Obviously the last three, four months have been terrific for me, Djokovic added. Not many holes in the game in general, especially this week. Everything worked perfectly.
The 14-times Grand Slam champion extended his winning streak to 18 matches as he continues to chase Rafa Nadals world number one crown, with the Spaniard skipping the Asian swing to recover from a knee injury.  Agencies

## Title: Ending Global Hunger

Ending Global Hunger
Ours is an unequal world. Hunger kills more people than AIDS and tuberculosis - 821 million people suffered from hunger in 2017 - 11 percent of the world population. Sixty percent of them are women. Malnutrition accounts for 45 percent of infant deaths. The number of undernourished people in the world increased for the third consecutive year in 2017.
But there are more than two billion obese people in the world, mostly in developed countries, with a substantial number in rapidly developing China and India. More than 3 million people die each year for problems linked to obesity.
This is the background in which we celebrate the World Food Day today, under the theme End World Hunger by 2030 as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) will be leading this multilateral effort. This seems to be an ambitious goal, until one realizes that it is already possible to do so with a collective global effort. This year, the World Food Day aims to remind the international community of its fundamental political commitment to humanity -- the eradication of all forms of malnutrition -- and raise awareness that achieving a zero-hunger world by 2030 is still possible.
The problem is basically that much of the world does not care about hunger and malnutrition in other parts of the world. People have become desensitized and disconnected to the fact that millions of people are hungry. People need to adopt a new mindset by using the Earths resources more wisely, following nutritious diets, and also changing day-to-day actions with the aim of reducing waste and taking on a more sustainable lifestyle.
One fact is particularly alarming  one third of food produced is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year. This is more than enough to feed the populations of entire countries. In fact, Post Harvest Losses (PHL) are a major factor that denies access to food for more people. Losses incurred during transport and storage should be minimized by using the latest technologies for preservation. We have all heard horror stories about butter and cheese mountains in developed countries while some people in the developing world have to scavenge for food in garbage dumps. This is clearly an untenable situation.
This will be an even more crucial factor in the decades ahead, as the world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. That amounts to an extra 2.7 billion mouths to feed. The extent of land available for agriculture is not going to increase and there could even be a reduction as a result of desertification and Climate Change. This is a major challenge that could threaten global food security.
Scientists are already at work to address this problem. Vertical or high rise agriculture has been cited as one solution while plants that can grow without soil have also gained traction recently. This science is called hydroponics - where plants are grown without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.
There already are Genetically Modified (GM) plant varieties that can produce a higher yield from the same land extent. There is no proof yet that GM crops are inherently dangerous or unsuitable for human consumption  if GM techniques help end hunger, it is an option we should pursue. In many developing countries, agriculture has still not been modernized. The use of modern equipment can increase efficiency and productivity and ultimately, the yields.
There is also an increasing case against eating meat  and not just from an ethical or religious point of view. The meat industry gobbles up an enormous amount of water, food, energy and other valuable resources and is one of the top contributors to Climate Change. Given that up to 50 billion chickens and 300 million cattle are slaughtered worldwide every year, one can imagine the scale of the resources needed by the meat industry.
In fact, it takes up to six kilos of grain to produce just 500 grammes of animal flesh. In the light of the increasing human population and the resources crunch, it will help the planet if more people go vegan. Moreover, we will have artificial meat that tastes and smells like the real thing in a few more years  scientists have already grown such meat in laboratories. The only barrier so far has been cost  500 grammes of lab grown meat currently sells for around US$ 400, but the companies involved say they can bring it down to around US$ 5 in a few years, to be almost on par with actual meat. In the near future, it will even be possible to 3D print ones own artificial meat in a commercially available food printer.
In spite of all these industrial advances, empowering the small-scale farmers and retaining the next generation of farmers for sustainable and productive farming is still the key to ending rural poverty and warding off hunger. A world free of hunger is not an impossible dream if we have the will.

English players overworked after World Cup, says Southgate
Seville, Sunday: Gareth Southgate believes English players have been hampered by the Premier League starting so soon after the World Cup.
Englands top flight began on Friday August 10, less than a month after England had been knocked out by Croatia in the semi-finals in Russia.
The first divisions in France and Italy began on the same weekend, but La Liga in Spain kicked off on August 17 and the Bundesliga in Germany on August 24.
When you see the league, a lot of teams havent started yet at their maximum. There have been lot of injuries across our league, Southgate said on Sunday.
I dont really understand why our league started so early, but they did, and it was a really difficult situation for the clubs. Some of the clubs couldnt field a team without...look at Tottenham, who had so many players in the semi-finals of the World Cup.
It was an impossible situation for their coaches really.
England face Spain in the UEFA Nations League on Monday, hoping to improve on their 2-1 defeat at Wembley last month, when the scoreline did not do Spains dominance justice.
Spain then thrashed Croatia 6-0 and can seal top spot in Group 4 with a victory in Seville, while England are scrapping to avoid relegation.
We know their technical ability, Southgate said. But we have to cause them problems with the ball. We cant just defend for 90 minutes.
We were more comfortable in the last 30 minutes at Wembley, but we have to do that earlier in the game, be brave enough to use the ball well, and cause them problems.
England have switched from a three to a four-man defence since the World Cup, in an attempt to exert more pressure higher up the pitch.
Spain have also changed tack under Luis Enrique, who has instilled a more direct, attacking approach since taking charge following the disappointing performances at the World Cup.
Their style is a little bit different now, theyve got a new coach, a top coach, Southgate said.
Although the style and the philosophy is very similar, tactically its a bit different. There is a bit more of a direct threat in the final third.
Its as big a test as you can get in European, if not world football, at the moment.

## Date: Tuesday, October 16, 2018 - 01:00
C.W.W. Kannangaras 134th birth anniversary fell on October 13
Father of Free Education: a case of victor and vanquished
On October 1, 1945, ironically in the very month he was born 134 years ago, when Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara as the Education Minister in the then State Council of Ceylon, implemented the Free Education Act to envelop the country in its entirety to provide absolute free education to every single child, it was hailed as a step providing lasting value to the nation. The State Council Committee headed by him made epoch-making recommendations, such as the following, which stunned some of the members in the august assembly of State Council, when they were presented in 1943.
 Education should be free from the Kindergarten to the University
 The mother tongue should be used as the medium of instruction in the Primary Schools
 English should be taught in all schools from the Standard Three
 A curriculum for the child which would develop the childs head, heart and hands should be introduced. (meaning the education of emotions, education of intellect and the education for practical ability for the well-being of the child.)
Economically privileged groups
Dr. Kannangara was determined to create a new education system for the country that would ensure equal opportunity for every child in the far off village or in the central city, irrespective of the class, religion, ethnicity or the economic status of the family. He realized that the education then was not standardized even though education in vernacular schools was free with grants provided by the government and buildings, equipment and even books provided by philanthropists in some instances. As Chairman, Dr. Kannangara guided the members in the direction he envisaged with success, and received approval of the members to make those recommendations to the State Council.
But, he faced stiff opposition from socially and economically privileged groups, in his efforts to establish free education in the country. Surprisingly, several stubborn opponents were among his own colleagues in the Council, who enjoyed perks, privileges and positions offered by the British.
When the bill was debated in the Council, according to records, Dr. Kannangara had spoken for six and half hours to win the support of other members to get the bill passed. It is on record that Dudley Senanayake vehemently supported the bill, while his father D. S. Senanayake was not in much favour.
When the voting time came Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, H. W. Amarasuriya, J. R. Jayewardene, and several others were joined by Dr. N. M. Perera and Dr. S. A. Wickremasinghe, the well-known Marxist leaders. Unlike nowadays, when it came to a national issue, it was a joy to note how the visionary politicians like Drs. N. M. and S. A. voted with their arch political rivals for the sake of the country and its people. While such events were taking place inside the Chambers of the State Council, public campaigns in support of the bill were launched by personalities in the calibre of Dr. E. W. Adikaram, Professor G. P. Malalasekera and Educationist L. H. Mettananda.
Free Education to all children
Despite Dr. Kannangaras gift of Free Education to all children, establishment of the University of Ceylon as the first ever University of the country, upgrading the Pirivena Education for the higher education of the young Buddhist monks, starting up 54 Central Colleges in all districts and pioneering the independence movement with other national leaders, besides many other achievements, he lost election in his electorate immediately afterwards, though won subsequent elections and remained in active politics until 1956.
In a vastly gigantic contrast with some of todays politicians, Dr. Kannangara when retired had no wealth, no house and property, no funds in the bank, and the survival was such an issue, that reportedly, he was compelled to appeal to the then Speaker of Parliament for a financial subsidy. Response was quick, in the form of once and for all grant of Rupees ten thousand and a monthly allowance of Rupees five hundred till his death, and he died on September 23, 1969 at the General Hospital, Colombo. Such were the last stages of life of this unique humanitarian, who gave millions and millions of children born in this country, the opportunity to become performers of the highest class, like the large majority who are now and would be in the future as well.

Forty arrests in special Northern Police operation
Forty arrests were made after a special search operation was carried out in the Northern Province with the participation of around 500 Police officers.
Speaking to the Daily News, Jaffna Senior DIG Roshan Fernando said 40 roadblocks had been set up with 10 roadblocks each in the Kopai, Chunnakam, Jaffna and Manipai areas, specially targetting the Inuvil and Kokkuvil areas where most of this gang violence has been reported.
There were around 12 Police officers stationed at each roadblock, the Senior DIG said.
He said these operations were carried out under the supervision of the SSPs.
During the search operations at these roadblocks, we paid special attention to motorcycles.
The search operation commenced at 4.00 pm and concluded at around 10 pm.
These special operations were carried out with the aim of putting a stop to gang related violence in the North. These incidents are not serious, but we want to nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand, Senior DIG Fernando said, adding that this operation was a huge success.
During the operation, the Police had made 40 arrests including seven with warrants against them, 16 drunk drivers, seven wanted suspects and 10 arrested on suspicion. A further 152 traffic related cases were filed and these suspects would be produced before courts for legal action, he said.
Senior DIG Fernando noted that these mass scale Police operations would be continued to curb gang violence in the North.
However, he said these operations were carried out in a manner that would not infringe on the normal activities of the people living in these areas. The Police had commenced these special search operations with the aim of bringing under control the Aava gangs and other splinter gangs that operate in these areas, creating fear in the minds of the Northern people.
However, Senior DIG Fernando pointed out that in comparison to the violence reported in the Southern parts of the country, the Northern Province has a relatively lower crime rate, but said that these special operations would help further reduce the crime rate.

Forty-six agreements signed with drug companies: Minister
Forty-six agreements have been signed with drug manufacturing companies and 19 factories will commence production by next March, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a gathering after the inauguration of the new drug manufacturing factory at the SPMC premises.
Dr. Senaratne said that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had provided 1,240 million Japanese Yen for the new drug manufacturing factory opened at the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) premises at Kandawala, Ratmalana.
A total of 910 million Yen had been spent on purchasing machinery from countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and China, he added.
The minister said that currently, the SPMC produced 1,922 million units (tablets and capsules) of drugs annually and that the numbers would be increased to 3,337 million with the opening of the new factory.
The World Bank will provide USD 200 million to upgrade the health services in Sri Lanka, but the issue is whether it could be used successfully with the existing public service.
The prices of 48 expensive drugs will be reduced and the charges of private hospitals will be regulated soon, Dr. Senaratne added.

Forty-three dengue deaths in 2018
A total of 39,793 dengue cases and 43 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country this year up to October 12, the Epidemiology Unit said.
The highest number of dengue cases (7,654) was reported in the Colombo district, while the second highest number (4,308) was reported in the Gampaha district. The third highest number of dengue cases (4,300) was reported in the Batticaloa district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,945 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,709 dengue cases. The number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 14,421, the Epidemiology Unit said. Medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without resorting to home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school, they said.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites during the rainy season to prevent spread of dengue. Even water retained in a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they said.

Four-year research for herbal mosquito repellent
K. Wickramarachchi of Dehiattakandiya has produced a mosquito repellent using medicinal herbs and other items after a strenuous four-year research.
He had first tested its efficacy by distributing it in the form of a capsule among friends.
Since the experiment was successful, he improvised the production process by using an oil extractor provided under the initiative of Deputy Petroleum Resources Development Minister Anoma Gamage, who was informed about the new invention by the Dehiattakandiya Divisional Secretary.
Wickramarachchi has now produced the mosquito repellent in the form of a joss stick. The product was presented to Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage at his Ministry recently.
Minister Gamage who appreciated Wikramarachchis innovative skills promised to give him a machine to help him launch his business, a press release by the Social Welfare and Primary Industries Ministry said.

Going hyper over the presence of a spider
Phobias arent cute, funny or silly. Theyre real. They inspire authentic paranoia, true fear, and real disruptions in life. There was my former colleague Philip who suffered from Arachnophobia - the fear of spiders and arachnids such as cockroaches, scorpions and other creepy-crawlies.
To some, spiders are, at most, horrible inconveniences but for others even the harmless house spider can set off alarms. Few people would say they like spiders. These little creatures are usually characterised by terms such as disgusting, detestable or revolting, but in fact, the bad reputation is entirely undeserved.
For some mysterious reason Philip was terrified of spiders. The problem was that he actually became paralysed with fear whenever he was confronted by one. He would hyperventilate and often brought the house down with yells calling for his little daughters to rescue him with a slipper or a rolled up newspaper or magazine whenever he saw one.
Now, most of us would consider his behaviour an overreaction. Granted, there are many dangerous species of spider. Most spiders are not dangerous to humans at all. Indeed, many are beneficial because they eat other pests in our homes and gardens. But even the biggest spider is no match for a human wielding a flip-flop slipper or a rolled up newspaper or magazine. Yet, the irrational fear of spiders is commonplace.
Now many people in Philips shoes would have flung something at the spider and fled the scene but the poor man could only bawl for help while remaining immobilized in panic. Philip revealed that when certain mischievous elements found out that he was afraid of spiders, they liked to joke about putting a spider in his bed.
They also offered to buy him a spider as a pet. They thought it was funny. But it wasnt. Those silly jokes cause real anxiety regardless of whether or not the victim thinks that person might follow through on the threat. He once alarmed the entire household with a series of thunderous bawls until a visiting child walked smartly into his bedroom and quashed it with Philips own slipper.
Several household objects have been smashed while being pitched at these creatures in sheer terror. Time was when people afflicted by this fear would grab the nearest object at hand and hurl it at the offending creature. You would be surprised to learn that in the digital era how many tablets, phones and laptops have been ruined as a result of being chucked at these creatures across a room in a fit of flustered desperation.
Then there was my childhood friend Malka who I mentioned in some of my earlier columns. Now Malka was no ordinary person. She was always hanging around with the boys and was an outstanding marble player even when she was in her rompers. With outstanding ingenuity and faultless aim she plundered our precious collection of multi-hued glass balls. So both figuratively and literally we lost all our marbles to Malka who we aptly dubbed as the Attagirl at Attabola.
Ones formative years, dear reader, are a most ephemeral period which everyone inhabits only once in a lifetime. That is why one always senses a curious, almost unforgettable closeness among childhood friends and playmates. Malka was sizzling with mischief and even at that tender, impressionable age was practical and wise beyond her years. She was brimming with wit and could ad-lib one-liners with the panache of a professional comedienne.
But you must have realized by now that Malka was no normal personage, not by a long shot. I was never one of her smitten suitors when we wore rompers and neither was I infatuated with her later. But I admired her immensely because she was and always has been ebullient, charming, brilliantly accomplished and as mercurial as the most spectacular supernova.
For several years she organized reunion parties in the salubrious climes of her holiday home in the high sierra, for her old friends. She was also fearless, except for a single phobia. You may have guessed by now that she was afflicted with arachnophobia. Every encounter Malka had had with the eight-legged freaks seemed seared into her mind. But most people dont realise that poking fun at phobias can actually have disastrous consequences.
Unfortunately, her hubby Sonny imagined that she was distressed with an unfounded fear. He was wrong and nearly paid the price with a serious head injury. Arachnophobia, as mentioned earlier is one of the more well-known terrors and can be very potent. Sonny not understanding the depth of his wifes fear, once called her into the verandah while she was working. He said he needed to show her something fascinating.
He mischievously pointed out a large spider on the outer wall to her. Malka says she nearly threw up. Sonny laughed. But she grabbed the nearest object which was a heavy metal ashtray and flung it at him. Fortunately it only grazed his head. Malka said quite complacently after the incident: Now he knows never to pull stunts like that.
When in distress and waging full-scale war against spiders the usually composed Malka would scream like a banshee! There was a most embarrassing incident at one of Malkas hill country holiday bungalow parties. Malka as hostess was busy putting the final touches to the dinner for her friends and had to rush to bathe last while her guests were all dressed and enjoying a drink.
Malka was in the bathtub when a Daddy-Long-Legs spider ran along the bathroom shelf. She screamed so much that the insect lost its bearings and fell in, too. Malkas scream could fill any sports stadium with sound to spare. Her electrifying screeches had galvanized some of the guests to rush to her side to check out the emergency.
Some four of us of us burst into the room before the terrified Malka could wrap a towel around herself. Malka had run out of the bathroom nude, in hysterics and was all soapy. Most of the males in the would-be rescue squad appeared more ill-at-ease than curious over the sight of their completely nude and almost incoherent hostess. One of the guests finally just mumbled something, strode into the bathroom killed the spider threw him out of the window and walked out. But the petrified Malka wasnt even blushing, she just wanted someone to kill the spider and get it out of her sight.
And her rescuers after gallantly dashing to her aid didnt know whether to act heroic or look the other way.

Hair and now!
The Sri Lanka Association of Hairdressers and Beauticians (SLAHAB) held a press conference to shed light on a few important areas SLAHAB had identified and to announce the victory of the Sri Lankan team at the recently concluded Hair World Championships in Paris recently.
Led by SLAHAB Founder President Nayana Karunaratne and SLAHAB President Sumudu Wasantha the discussion was divided into three main focus areas. The standardization and registration program that SLAHAB wishes to implement for all hair and beauty salons in Sri Lanka was the first matter they dealt with. It is an initiative that has received the patronage and guidance of Charitha Ratwatte, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister and Head of the Central Programme Management Unit, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. It presented how the registration of hair and beauty salons in Sri Lanka largely happens in an ad hoc manner and how many hair and beauty salons arent even registered with a central body or authority.
The standard and quality of, both, services and products offered suffer as a result and there are numerous health and safety concerns that are a byproduct of this informal culture of hair and beauty salons. It was informed to all that the Sri Lanka Standards Institute has approved and completed the document governing the standardization of hair and beauty salons. The Prime Ministers Office will support the implementation of the standardization program, while selecting the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) and the Sri Lanka Association of Hairdressers and Beauticians to spearhead the effort. The registration and business aspect of the standardization programme will be handled by FCCISL. They will issue a privilege card to the hair and beauty salon or individual concerned upon satisfactorily completing the assessment. The assessment of the salons standards plus the level of skills and qualifications of employees will be carried out by SLAHAB.
The health and hygiene factors involved will be inspected by the relevant local authorities. Matters of workplace safety and first aid will be dealt with by the Red Cross. The entire process will be coordinated by the Prime Ministers Office and it will allow a proper grading system to be implemented across hair and beauty salons islandwide.
The Sri Lankan Team who took part in the Hair World Championships organized by the Organisation Mondiale Coiffure (OMC) in Paris won top accolades at the event. The OMC Hair World Championships is a hairdressing competition that features professionals from all parts of the world. OMC Hairworld Paris 2018 included dozens of categories to promote a wider range of talent and it, truly, was a competition that celebrated diversity of culture. With over 1,000 participants from across the globe, the attendees this year bore witness to several days of daring competition on the opulent Parisian stage.
The styles displayed, as always, were unique and extravagant, and they also featured a large number of artists who specialized in contemporary beauty trends. Two Sri Lankan makeup artists took both Silver and the fourth place in the Ladies Aesthetics Commercial Bridal Make-up category.
The Silver Medal was won by Kayalvily Jayapragash and Theekshanee Kariyawasam won fourth place at the event. Both are members of SLAHAB and have been guided by OMC Asia Zone President Nayana Karunaratne.
The team also spoke about several issues which have raised in the hair and beauty industry in Sri Lanka. The fraudulent activities of Kariawasam were discussed at length, including his issuance of bogus doctorates and certificates to individuals from the local hair and beauty industry and the manner in which he extorted money from them while, entirely, misleading them. He was arrested and placed in remand custody by the CID.

Hasini from Vishaka College Colombo said this was a great chance to win a gold medal in this mixed international relay event.
I had to play with other players in my group. Our team consisted of four boys and four girls and we had to play ten matches. Finally the team which obtained 110 points won this game. This is a very good experience and winning gold at the Youth Olympic is very special for me, said young Hasini.
Tony Wahyudi, the Indonesian coach who is the present national coach to the Sri Lanka team also said this mixed international relay is a good experience for Hasini. She works hard at practices with me. Finally she was lucky to be a member of the winning team to take gold at this youth Olympics.
Meanwhile Sri Lankan Badminton Management Committee president Nishantha Jayasinghe said Hasinis performance was very high.
The last time at this same youth Olympics Sachin Dias took a bronze medal. At this stage her medal is so vital for Sri Lanka. Actually so far Hasini is the only medal winner for Sri Lanka in this Youth Olympics. She has a good future and she has already got good exposure from this event, the badminton chief said.
We have good youngsters like Hasini but we should give more international experience to them, said Jayasinghe. He also appreciated the National Olympic Committees support in giving all facilities to Hasini for her success.

Holder looks to McGrath and Anderson for inspiration
HYDERABAD, Sunday - West Indies captain Jason Holder said Sunday that he is looking to hone his fast bowling skills by taking inspiration from pace legends Glenn McGrath and James Anderson.
Holder claimed his fifth five-wicket haul in the second Test against India but his effort was not enough as the tourists suffered a 2-0 series whitewash.
Holder, who missed the first Test in Rajkot, returned figures of 5-56 in India's first innings after hitting a gritty 52 in his team's first essay in Hyderabad.
But Holder, standing six feet and 7 inches tall, believes he has room to improve as a bowler, and that following Australia's McGrath and Anderson of England is the way forward.
"Funnily enough, I have been watching lots of clips.. People like Glenn McGrath and even James Anderson. And these guys have got lot of skill in terms of moving the ball both ways," said Holder, who has captained West Indies in 27 of his 35 Tests.
"The one thing that's common with both of them is the amount of pressure that they build," Holder said of the two cricket icons.
The 36-year-old Anderson recently became the leading fast bowler in Test history by picking up his 564th scalp during the India series.
He moved past Australia's pace ace McGrath who retired in 2007 with 563 wickets from 124 Tests.
At 26, Holder has only just begun in comparison with the game veterans. He has 86 wickets to his name since making his five-day debut in 2014.
"You just got to understand the conditions. Field placing comes in a lot, something that I have to work personally as a player and trying to know my strengths and weaknesses," he said after his team's 10-wicket loss to India.  AFP

Inquest into Roebuck death set to be reopened - report
SYDNEY Monday: An inquest into the supposed suicide of renowned cricket writer Peter Roebuck in South Africa in 2011 is set to be reopened, his former employer reported Monday.
English-born Roebuck, 55, was covering the Test series between South Africa and Australia when he plunged to his death from the Southern Sun Hotel in Cape Town.
South African police said he leapt out of a sixth floor window after two officers arrived to arrest him over a claim of sexual assault by a Zimbabwean man.
But his family have never accepted the account and his employer, Australia's Fairfax Media, said investigations into the death would begin again.
There are many questions regarding the circumstances of his death which have to be probed, the family's lawyer George van Niekerk told Fairfax.
The reopened inquest will hopefully allow all the unresolved issues to be fully ventilated. David Hood, an English lawyer who previously acted for Roebuck, added in a statement to Britain's Mail on Sunday that it is important to all internationally recognised systems of justice that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done.
That could never have been with the death of Peter Roebuck, unless and until the circumstances of his death were examined at a legally convened hearing held in public with witnesses called and questioned under oath, he added.
Roebuck's family were not invited to a closed hearing in Cape Town in 2013, which upheld the police account of events. They have been seeking to have the ruling quashed ever since.
Fairfax, which had employed Roebuck since 1984, has previously claimed the family had been denied access to any forensic evidence taken from the hotel, along with a police toxicology report and fingerprints from the window.
They believe that fingerprints must be produced to prove he opened the window amid doubts that he would have been able to do so and jump in the officers' presence.
Roebuck, a former Somerset captain, played 335 first-class matches before making a career writing about the sport. He was regarded by many as the finest cricket writer of his generation with his forthright, intelligent prose establishing an avid following.
He also regularly commentated for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. AFP

Knee fracture set to end injury-plagued Del Potros season
Paris, Sunday: Injury-plagued Juan Martin del Potro is set to miss the rest of the season after it was revealed Sunday the giant Argentine had fractured his knee at the Shanghai Masters.
Its a very difficult moment. I feel very sad, said the 30-year-old world number four who is walking with his leg in a splint after doctors confirmed he had fractured the patella bone in his right knee.
Its a hard blow which leaves me without any strength. Its very difficult for me to think about recovery again. I did not expect this to happen.
Del Potro, the US Open runner-up to Novak Djokovic this year, hobbled out of the Shanghai Masters last 16 against Borna Coric on Thursday after hurting his right knee in an awkward fall after losing his footing.
He had been set to complete his year at the elite eight-man ATP World Tour Finals in London from November 11 after qualifying for the season-ending showpiece for the first time since 2013.
Del Potro has been plagued by injuries since winning his only Grand Slam title at the 2009 US Open at the age of 20.
A series of wrist injuries required four surgeries. By the end of 2015, his ranking was at 581, he was deeply depressed and on the verge of quitting after having to sit out 10 Grand Slam events. However, he had been rejuvenated in 2018, reaching a career-high world number three in August.
He defeated Roger Federer in this years Indian Wells Masters final and was a key figure when Argentina won a first Davis Cup in 2016.
Del Potro also owns 10 wins over world number one players -- the most by anyone who has never reached the top ranking themselves. AFP

Lankas growth to remain around 4% next two years - WB
WASHINGTON- Sri Lankas economic growth is projected to recover from the effects of last years weather disruptions, which negatively affected agriculture, and to remain around 4 percent in the next two years, according to a World Bank report published twice-a-year covering regional economic update.
The latest edition of the South Asia Economic Focus, Budget Crunch said, South Asia is firming up its position as the worlds fastest-growing region, further extending its lead over East Asia and the Pacific with growth topping 6.9 percent in 2018 and set to accelerate to 7.1 percent next year.
Budget Crunch, finds however that the regions growth performance is uneven across countrieswith Afghanistan notably bucking the upward trendand mainly driven by domestic demand.
The report warns that a more turbulent external environment, manifested by trade wars and capital outflows from emerging markets, calls for prudent economic policy and fiscal discipline. Instead, most South Asian countries generate low tax revenue and run large budget deficits, often made worse by economic shocks and election cycles. At 4.4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), South Asias fiscal deficit is projected to be the second largest in the world this year after the Middle East and North Africa region. The average fiscal deficit over the last three years has been around 5.5 percent in Pakistan and above 6 percent in Maldives, India, and Sri Lanka.
Budget deficits in South Asia are among the highest in the world, and this could be storing up trouble for the future, said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region. South Asias fiscal weaknesses reduce its ability to address external shocks or economic slowdowns. It would be wise to use these good economic times for countries to get their budgets in better shape.
While fiscal challenges vary across the region, the report notes that tax revenue is consistently low across most South Asian countries and at rates below that of other developing countries with a similar income per capita, sometimes by a vast margin. Although some countries have expanded their tax bases and curbed tax exemptions and fraud, revenue remains lower than government expenditures, creating large fiscal deficits that need to be financed through public borrowing.
South Asian countries have also favoured procyclical approaches to spendingwith expenditures going up fast as their economies expandthat amplifies boom-and-bust cycles.
Together with public debt, hidden liabilities, arising from non-viable borrowing by state-owned enterprises, the failure of infrastructure projects involving the private sector, and non-performing loans in commercial banks, should be closely monitored.
While fiscal outcomes vary across the region, the fiscal situation in each country reveals more profound development challenges, which range from large security expenditures in conflict-affected countries, weak discipline by sub-national governments in federal states, to the high cost of service delivery in island nations.
Substantial government spending is understandable, even beneficial if well-invested, given South Asias enormous development needs, said Martin Rama, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region. But South Asian economies need to address their fiscal challenges to give themselves room to maneuver and sustain their journey toward greater prosperity.

Lanka name virtual U19 World Cup squad for Bangladesh series
Sri Lanka under 19 head coach Hashan Tillakaratne said on Monday that the squad picked for the upcoming series against Bangladesh comprised of players who are eligible for the next 2020 ICC Youth World Cup in South Africa. The squad he said was selected after the recently concluded Under 19 Asia Cup.
In-form Sri Lanka will look to maintain their Asia Cup momentum ahead of next years World Cup when they take on a Bangladesh side in the first of a two-match under 19 test series at the NCC grounds today.
Nipun Dananjaya captaining the Sri Lanka team said he expected much tougher opposition from Bangladesh.
Dananjaya is the most senior player from this age category as he played under Kamindu Mendis during the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup, early this year held in New Zealand. Afterwards, he was also named skipper for the home series against India U19s in July/August.
Bangladesh head coach Mohammed Naveed Nawaz said as much as it is about giving opportunities to fringe young players they were mainly focusing to form one of the foremost teams ahead of the World Cup.
The Bangladesh boards priority agenda is enhancing their capabilities and taking the first step to improve the opportunities for some of the players and hoping when the World Cup comes these players would form the backbone of the side, said Naveed Nawaz.
Sri Lanka have seven batsmen that includes five all-rounders and three fast bowlers.
The teams will play five Twenty20 internationals after the Test series.

Last-gasp Biraghi saves Italy, gives Mancini first competitive win
Chorzw, Sunday: Cristiano Biraghi snatched a late victory to give new Italy coach Roberto Mancini his first competitive victory and keep the Azzurris Nations League hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Poland in their League A Group 3 clash in Chorzow on Sunday.
Defender Biraghi, 26, slid in the winner two minutes into injury time for his first goal for Italy in a game his team had dominated. The defeat ensured Poland were relegated to League B.
It gives Mancini his first competitive victory since taking over as Italy coach last May, after the four-time world champions failure to qualify for the World Cup.
A new cycle has already begun, said Mancini
We dominated the game, we had to score the first goal, it would have been unfair to finish 0-0.
All the lads are trying to do their best. Its a good win in a very good game.
Fiorentina defender Biraghi made the sign 13 with his hands when he scored, as he dedicated his first goal to former Italy and Fiorentina captain Davide Astori who died of a heart attack last March.
I owe everything to him. Im here thanks to Davide who was a mentor for me, said Biraghi, who was called up to Italy for the first time last month at the age of 26.
European champions Portugal lead the three-team group with six points from two games with Italy on four points after three games with Poland relegated to League B with one point.
Mancini stuck with the same eleven he started with in last Wednesdays 1-1 draw against the Ukraine with Federico Bernardeschi, Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Chiesa leading the attack.
Nicolo Barella, 21, was chosen to start over Lorenzo Pellegrini in midfield after making his international debut in Genoa.
Poland opted for the strike partnership of Robert Lewandowski and Arkadiusz Milik over Genoa forward Krzysztof Piatek, who has scored 14 goals in ten competitive games for club and country. AFP
Italy had the best of the first half but once again demonstrated their difficulty finishing off.
Jorginho rattled the bar within the first minute, with Federico Chiesa also hitting the woodwork after half an hour in the Silesian Stadium.
Poland could thank Wojciech Szczesny for keeping them in the game with the under-pressure goalkeeper denying Alessandro Florenzi, Jorginho, Federico Bernardeschi and Juventus teammate Giorgio Chiellini in the first half.
Italy had a goal disallowed after 65 minutes following a well-worked pass between Bernardeschi and Marco Verratti with Insigne offside in the box.
Poland also had a couple of chances in the second half with Kamil Grosicki denied by Gianluigi Donnarumma, with Arkadiusz Milik curling over.
NEVER SAY DIE ATTITUDE (SUB HEADING)
Just when it looked as if both sides would settle for a draw, off the last corner, substitute Kevin Lasagna, who made his international debut, steered in for the Biraghi to finish off.
It had looked as if the match was jinxed, said Biraghi.
The minutes were going by and the ball wouldnt go in.
When you create a lot and the ball doesnt go in you start to get nervous, even risk losing.
Instead we stayed calm and believed until the end. This victory is thanks to the groups never say die attitude.
The result ensures Italy stayed in the tier ahead of Decembers Euro 2020 qualifying draw.
Italy next host Portugal on November 17 with Poland playing in Portugal three days later. AFP

Little Mix have penned song about #MeToo movement
Little Mix have co-written a new song honouring the #MeToo anti-sexual harassment campaign.
The group teased a snippet of the track, Womans World, over the summer (18), but have now revealed that they co-wrote the female empowerment anthem with producer Jez Ashurst as a response to #MeToo - the hashtag thousands of women have used to detail their experiences of sexual harassment and assault.
So we wrote this song when the whole #MeToo movement was coming about, bandmember Jade Thirlwall tells Vice magazines Noisey website. You know... I was so angry about what was going on. It was important to write it with Jez, whos a man. It holds an important message.
Unlike some female popstars like Beyonce who have highlighted political themes in their music, the group have shied away from divisive issues in the past - but now say they are ready to become more outspoken about their feminism in their music.
We havent written anything thats too controversial before, and now were starting to write things that are slightly more honest, Jade explains. We want to be a bit more ballsy and say yeah, it is hard to be a woman.
The 25-year-old confesses that in the past she and her bandmates have been scared about commenting on politics because they didnt feel knowledgeable enough to comment.
We were scared to say the wrong thing, basically, she says. We didnt want to talk about something if we felt we werent truly educated in it. But theres a change that comes with age, and also learning more about whats going on in the world. I think were all doing that more in general, about the things were passionate about - whether its womens rights, LGBTQ issues or Black Lives Matter.
Little Mix released their latest single, a collaboration with Nicki Minaj called Woman Like Me this week, and plan to debut their fifth album later this year - a release date is yet to be announced.

Saving money is a healthy habit which leads way to immense benefits. Since most parents are readily meeting their childs every fancy today, little do children realise the need for saving or the worth of the penny.
At a time when we see many adults waging a losing battle against bankruptcy, the trick lies in catching children young.

Hundreds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple and cheered as their car was driven into the property a short distance from the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.
The 76 engagements also include visits to schools, greeting members of the public at the Sydney Opera House, and meeting young leaders and community members at Government House.
After Australia, the couple will fly to Fiji, where they will be greeted with an arrival ceremony similar to one attended by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in 1953.
In Fiji, Harry will pay tribute to Fijian war veterans and the couple will attend a state dinner, before flying to Tonga.
The tour will conclude with a four-day trip to New Zealand, where they will be greeted by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
The Duke and Duchess will learn about environmental challenges while in Wellington, visit a charity which supports children with parents in prison, and meet members of the public in Auckland and Rotura.
Harry and Meghan will return to London from Auckland on November 1.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a low-key arrival to a wet and wintery Australia after a weekend spent celebrating the marriage of their relative Princess Eugenie and following an overnight commercial flight with Qantas.
They were seen leaving the airport with staff, looking relaxed, as Meghan clutched a pair of purple binders and Harry carried a brown and green manbag.
Queen Elizabeth II is still the head of state in Australia although there is significant support for the country becoming a republic.
Recent polls show Australians fairly evenly split on the issue, with only the slimmest of majorities in favour of ditching the British Queen and nominating an Australian head of state.
After sailing Sydney Harbour and visiting the famous Bondi Beach, meeting flying doctors, attending functions at the Invictus Games and meeting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, they jet off to Fiji on October 23.
Meghan will get a chance to speak at a UN womens empowerment in marketplaces event and meet some female vendors in the project in the Fiji capital Suva. - MIRROR, AFP

Mitra to expand in East Africa and ASEAN in 2019
UK headquartered global technology provider, Mitra Innovation plans to rapidly expand its footprint globally with a huge focus on ASEAN and East Africa, companys founders told the media during their annual leadership and strategy programme in Colombo yesterday.
Ashok Suppiah, CEO and co-founder said they will also increase their employee strength from 200 to over 350 by end of next year and 90% of the new employees would be from their date center in Moratuwa.

Monthly salary for disabled War Heroes mooted
The Defence Ministry will soon seek Cabinet approval to grant monthly salary to disabled War Heroes during their lifetime, instead of their pension payment.
Currently, all the disabled War Heroes are paid their monthly salary with all other allowances until they reach their retirement age.
They are provided with pension benefits and the retirement compensation after they retire.
That decision was taken considering the requests of War Heroes who held a protest in this regard recently.
The protesters claimed that their monthly pension is inadequate to cover their expenditure and needs and they request for the payment of a monthly salary for their lifetime.
The Ministry is currently seeking for legal requirements to fulfill this demand.

Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill site
NO ADVERSE IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday assured that the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill (SLF) site will not have any adverse impact on the environment or the people in the Puttalam district.
The ministry will take full responsibility for the project and we assure there will be no adverse impact of any kind, Ministry Secretary Eng. Nihal Rupasinghe and other top officials said at a press briefing in Colombo.
Rupasinghe urged the people not to be fooled by false propaganda for political gain and support the project.
As professionals who are involved in realising this endevour, we are taking the full responsibility of this project, Rupasinghe added.
Eng. Rupasinghe also said that a special technical team consisting experts from the Urban Development Authority, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and Sri Lanka Army has already been selected for the maintenance activities of the facility.
The logistic facilities for this technical team have already been provided, he added.
This project is not a dumping ground for waste like what happened in Meetotamulla. This is a humongous project involving most advanced technology used in this particular field backed by an extensive scientific study. This is not a project that would be abandoned half way. This is a long term sustainable project that may span from 25 years to 80 years. We are also purchasing a High-Tech Land Fill Compactor especially for this project, Secretary Rupasinghe pointed out.
According to Secretary Rupasinghe, the total estimation of the project worth 125 million Dollars, including the purchase of four train engines that will be used in transporting compressed garbage from Kelaniya to the Aruwakkalu site. The project is to be completed within a year and three months, he also said. The railway road from Puttalam to Aruwakkalu will also be developed as a part of this project, Rupasinghe pointed out.
Rupasinghe also assured that contaminated water generated from liquids present in the waste will not be released to the Puttalam lagoon as alleged by certain groups. He also pointed out that the Deodorization Facility will make sure that the people living in surrounding areas would not have to undergo bad odour emitting from the garbage. Rupasinghe also denied the allegation that salt production would be affected by the SLF.
We have taken steps to recruit people in the area as workers in the site, as a way to build up community awareness on this project. We have also made sure that no family be removed because of this project, Secretary Rupasinghe furthered. In answer to some allegations levelled against the project, Project Director Jayavilal Fernando said that the second meeting of a series of discussions will be held this month, where anyone concerned about the project would be given a chance to raise their questions. We have already had some discussions with activists, religious leaders and people of the area with regards to this project. It is already clear to us that the people who raise concerns over this project have separated into two groups. One group is open for explanations and they understand the real importance of this project, whereas the other group stands with an extreme opinion, without accepting any kind of explanation that we offer. However, we will be conducting awareness programmes and discussions further with all these groups, and especially, we have allowed people to visit the site to inspect it themselves, Fernando explained.
According to the experts, recycling activities at the Aruwakkalu landfill will begin before the end of this year. With the commencement of the activities, people who suffer from the waste disposal for many years will find a sustainable solution, they added.
Additional Secretary to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry M. Waidyaratne, Professor in Environmental Eng. Mahesh Jayaweera of the Moratuwa University, Eng. Chandana Gunawardena of the China Harbour Engineering Company and Eng. Wipula Jayasinghe of the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau were also present at the press brief.

Nurmagomedov challenges Mayweather
Los Angeles, Monday: Mixed martial arts fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov has taken a page out of Conor McGregor's playbook and issued a challenge to undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather.
Nurmagomedov's challenge came in a video posted on Instagram by Mayweather's promoter Leonard Ellerbe who indicated he ran into the UFC fighter at a fight card in Russia.
"Lets go Floyd. We have to fight now: 50-0 versus 27-0," Nurmagomedov said with Ellerbe standing next to him smiling. "We are two guys who never lose. In the jungle there is only one king. Of course, I am the king because he cannot drop McGregor but I drop him easily. Lets go."
Nurmagomedov did not say whether he wished to fight Mayweather in a boxing or UFC match. Like McGregor, the Russian has no previous experience as a professional boxer.
McGregor made millions last year by taking on Mayweather in lopsided boxing match. Mayweather appeared to toy with McGregor in the early rounds before stopping the Irishman in the 10th to improve to 50-0.
Last weekend, Nurmagomedov retained his UFC lightweight crown, beating McGregor by fourth-round submission.
He then climbed out of the Octagon to fight with a member of McGregor's entourage who had been taunting him.
McGregor also took some punches from members of Nurmagomedov's team.

Para athletes did immense service to country without facilities - Mustapha
Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha said that Sri Lankas para athletes who won 14 medals at recent Asian Para Games in Jakarta were a good example to able athletes.
Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha greeting Sampath Hettiarachchi who won silver medal in javelin throw.
The Minister made these remarks at the felicitation ceremony held at Duncan White auditorium for the para athletes yesterday.
He further pointed out that our para athletes won 14 medals including four golds with lack of facilities but able athletes who went with a contingent of 175 did not win a single medal at the Asian Games.
I am not scared to talk about reality, with a lack of facilities para athletes did immense service to their country whereas the able athletes having all the facilities failed to do so. As a Sri Lankan we should appreciate their performance, Minister Mustapha said.
Sri Lanka finished with four gold, six silver and four bronze medals and secured 14th place in the medals table out of 43 nations. China dominated the table with 161 golds, 83 silver and 55 bronze while Iran and Korea secured second and third places.
Sri Lanka also dominated two track events by clean sweeping them for gold, silver and bronze. This is first time in Sri Lankas sports history that so many medals were won at a games conducted by the International Olympic Committee.

Pep to  parallel cinema
If you thought multiplexes were just about blockbusters and mainstream releases, think again. A visit to Scope Cinemas located in the Colombo City Centre (CCC) will change your mind about the stereotyped outlook towards a cinema hall.
Sri Lankas first and largest six screen multiplex provides a world class cinematic experience for local cinemagoers. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology and facilities, the multiplex opened doors to movie buffs recently.
A couple of weeks into the new concept had proven it to be a success says Scope Cinema (Pvt) Ltd CEO/ Director Thushan Meemanage.
This cinema has become the most famous movie location in the country during this period. It is actually double the footfall of Savoy and Liberty together. Though we have not done much marketing and publicity people come purely based on word of mouth to enjoy this new experience. They wish to have better value for their money. We aim to provide them with the luxury at an affordable price, he said.
The latest in cutting-edge technology like Dolby Atmos Surround Sound and 4K projection has been introduced by the team.
You have speakers everywhere except on the floor. Therefore when you watch a movie, you feel like you are in it with the characters. We also offer stadium type seating. Therefore even a short person who is seated behind a tall person will be able to view the film without any disturbances, he explained.
Another specialty about Scope Cinemas in CCC is that they do not run their show times in an orthodox manner.
Every 50 minutes we have a show time because we do not stick to the typical 1.30 am, 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm and 7 pm show times. Therefore if a film buff comes to our cinema, they will not have to wait to watch a movie for a long span. They can select from seven different contents. The films vary in genres too so anyone who is into films will be able to find something which goes with their tastes, he said.
The multiplex is not limited to foreign content alone. If a quality Sinhala production comes to theaters the team is willing to let it have a run in their theaters.
We actually unveiled the cinema with Kolamba Sanniya. If a producer comes with a good product, our doors are always open for them irrespective of the fact whether they are amateurs or seasoned filmmakers, he said adding that Udumbara, Thala, Tsunami, 1970 Love story and Gindari 3 are scheduled to be screened on the Scope Cinema screens in the future.
The only parameter we look into is whether the movie will be accepted by the public, he quipped.
Cinemas for films will be selected according to the show times and preference. The cinema halls offer around 750 seats in the entire multiplex with 220 seats in the Dolby Atmos theater. The VIP cinema is equipped with 24 seats. Around 30 shows will be screened everyday. The cinema also houses facilities for the differently abled. They screen their movies without intervals. They have peak hour and off peak hours for shows.
There are many youngsters who love to watch a good film at a quality cinema but do not have much money. We give about 40 percent discount for the shows screened during the off peak hours, Meemanage added.
He says that they are hoping to expand the concept to other areas in the country gradually. He adds that the National Film Corporations decision to take over film distribution will have an adverse effect on the industry.
The Government acts as a monitory body for film distribution in countries across the globe. Film distribution has been liberalized. The moment politics interferes in the industry it will be ruined. We have experienced it in the past. People took the political influences for granted and started shifting away from cinema. Unlike in the past they have other forms of entertainment like cable TV and Internet today. Only those who are politically connected will be well off. People should be given the opportunity to select quality films and reject low quality productions. We have a shortage of good local productions due to this. A good production should provoke your emotions. You need to study other film markets across the world and then make recommendations according to that research, he concluded.

The museums IMAX theater was the fitting venue for the premiere of Damien Chazelles Neil Armstrong biopic First Man, drawing a crowd of Hollywood heavyweights to DC  including stars Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy  and legendary members of the history-making braintrust that helped put two men on the moon in 1969.
At the museums entrance, the red carpet was rolled out in front of the iconic gold-foiled Lunar Module  a prototype of the one Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon in 1969  for both the stars and the movies real life subjects, including Armstrongs children and colleagues. Notably quiet were the films biggest stars: Gosling and Foy zoomed through crowd and discreetly exited shortly after the film, but not before posing for a quick photo op in the museums Apollo 11 exhibit.
Thank you to the National Air and Space museum for fulfilling a childhood dream of mine of getting to show something on this screen, said Chazelle in his short opening remarks, thanking both the actors and film crew as well as the legion of NASA engineers and consultants who helped bring this story to the screen with a painstaking amount of accuracy.
The film is based on the book of the same name by James R. Hansen, but the films production team spent a good deal of time researching additional details of story with primary sources, including Armstrongs first wife Janet (who died in June, 2018) and his colleagues in the Gemini and Apollo space programs.

The refurbished State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) building at Ratmalana was reopened under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Japanese Embassy Charge dAffaires ad interim Toshihiro Kitamura on Friday.
The Japanese government provided 3,935 million Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.5,232 million) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the project Improvement of Basic Social Services Targeting Emerging Regions.
Increasing the production capacity of the SPMC is one of the three objectives of this project. The SPMC was first established in 1986 by the Japanese Government with a grant of 2.6 billion Japanese Yen.
Japan has upgraded the SPMC by providing the latest equipment, constructing a material storage building, and refurbishing a part of the SPMC building with the use of 1,240 million Japanese Yen.
With these improvements, the SPMC is now expected to double its annual production of tablets and capsules and to meet 70 percent of the national drug demand (an increase of 25 percent compared to 43.6 percent in 2011).
Under this project, the following has also been implemented:
l Refurbishment of four secondary hospitals in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, North Western and Eastern Provinces (facilities and essential equipment necessary for early detection, treatment and prevention of non-communicable diseases have been provided).
l Procurement of 86 ambulances (the Health Ministry has distributed the ambulances among base hospitals, divisional hospitals and district hospitals in the North Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Northern, Uva and Eastern Provinces).

Reginald Cooray bares myths of the North
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray has focussed on developing the North on par with the rest of the country and resolving the social issues that plague the region. Recently, he visited London to meet the Sri Lankan community and convince them to invest in the region. He believes that there are a lot of opportunities for investment in the fields of solar power, wind power, fishing, salt manufacturing, milk processing, agriculture and tourism. He believes that the diaspora should be encouraged to invest in the province.
Dispelling the notion that the North is plagued with violence and sword gangs, he said on the contrary, the situation in the North is far less serious than that of the South. He blamed the Tamil politicians for creating communal and social issues for their own survival and for political gain.
Joining the Daily News in an interview, he expressed his views on many of the topics that concern the North.
Following are excerpts of the interview:
Q: How would you describe the overall situation in the North, nine years after the war ended
A. The Northern Provinces political, economic and social contexts are to be taken into consideration. Whatever the electronic and printed media say, I am optimistic about the situation in the North. After 30 years of protracted war, the innocent people have understood the implications through their bitter experiences. Hence their common and natural desire is to live in a peaceful society. They want to look after their families and improve their economic situations. Therefore, they are for peace.
However, some political leaders try their level best to arouse communal, religious, traditional and caste sentiments, which is very bad for the country and for the North as well.
The people in the North suffer because of the climatic conditions throughout the year. Of the 12 months in a year, they get rain only during nine months, and it is very difficult to find drinking water and a lot of diseases plague the people.
At the same time, they also suffer because of the politics in the Northern Province. They normally dont talk about caste. Though we talk about human rights a lot, this caste system is totally in violation of their basic human rights. The low caste people are sometimes not permitted to enter certain kovils and sometimes the low caste people cannot be buried in certain graveyards as they are reserved only for the high castes. These issues are hidden by the politicians and nobody talks about it. However, I am optimistic about the situation in the North and feel that the politicians cannot get the mass support for another rebellion because the people want to live in peace.
The politicians in the North still hold onto their political slogans of wanting self-determination, federalism, police and land powers and so on. They direct and concentrate all their activities and efforts to fulfil that aim and neglect the development of the area. That is a very sad situation. They want to keep the people below the poverty line as it would be a very strong foundation for their future struggles. If the people are satisfied, they wont want to disrupt their lives for a rebellion. That is why these politicians want to keep the people beneath the poverty line. Until they gain their political targets, the people must suffer. That is the theory of these politicians. This is a very sad situation.
During the colonial period, 500 years ago, these places were neglected. In the South, even under colonial rule, they started tea, rubber, and coconut factories and even the roads, cities, bridges and harbours were built. But even under colonial leadership, the North was neglected. After independence too, it was the same situation. The development activities in the North are insufficient. We must expedite development.
At present, the government is taking interest and they feel that development is the only way for reconciliation. When the people are satisfied and they wont need to rebel and that is their intention. But sadly, the Northern politicians are not interested in peace as they would not be able to fulfil their motives.
For development of the Northern Province, there should be cooperation between the centre and peripheries, meaning the central government and the provincial councils. When the government is going to do something in the North, so many barriers arise because of the mentality of the Northern politicians. Sri Lanka is an island and Jaffna is a peninsula. Hence the Northern peninsula is more secluded, more conservative and more closed to society. So they are afraid of tourism and claim that they could lose their cultural identity and fear that the demography would change. They fear that it would be another invasion under the guise of development. That is the situation.
Q: Although you say that the Tamils are a closed society and fear Southern invasion, the majority of the Northern Tamils live in the South among the Sinhalese and other communities. How do you see this situation
A. Public opinion is created by the people who have vested interests such as the electronic and printed media. They can create fake opinions among the people. Even the war between Elaara and Dutu Gemunu, or Ravana and Rama are wars between kings during feudalistic times and not a war between two communities. However, the Tamil media defines it in todays context as Sinhalese being anti-Tamil and Tamil being anti-Sinhalese. These unfortunate situations also prevail and hamper reconciliation.
In the South there is no problem at all and the Tamil people enjoy everything that the rest of the residents do. They can buy land, start businesses and move freely and engage in their religious activities without any hindrance. But in Jaffna, they think that they should reserve that area as a separate area for the Tamil community.
In most Buddhist temples you would find statues of Hindu deities as well. But when someone goes to the North and sets up a temple or erects a statue, they are against it and fear it would be another act of Sinhala invasion. Even in the South, this fear existed in the past where they were reluctant to allow tourism and foreign investment. But they eventually understood that all countries are interdependent and not just independent.
Q: Currently, there is a huge investment in the South even by the Tamil diaspora, but why is this investment not happening in the North
A. One reason is the political barrier. The diaspora is interested and wants to invest here. But they are not motivated and encouraged. This is the challenge we have and we must break this barrier. They are interested and want to come and invest, given the opportunity.
Q: With regard to the war widows in the North, what has the government done in terms of strengthening their means of income and uplifting their lives
A. The Samurdhi and Enterprise Sri Lanka schemes are mainly aimed at encouraging and assisting such families. These facilities are available for them, but the problem is that the absence of a husband is not merely an economic impediment. There are so many social issues too that arise due to their vulnerability as well. Hence, we have to take these factors into consideration as well. Some widows still hold onto the belief that their husbands are alive and will return some day. Not only in the North but in the Asian region, widowed women are cornered and isolated. The hegemonism of a man is still existent. As a result, these women face a lot of problems.
There is another serious issue where men who are abroad come to Sri Lanka and marry local girls who know nothing of their background. The men could be married elsewhere, but they come here and flash their money and pretend to be very successful and most often, these innocent women in the North get caught to these tricksters. The men obtain huge dowries from the women, promise to go back and send for them, but instead, take off with the dowries and are never heard of again.
During the period of war too, some young men in the North married in order to escape from being forced into fighting. The parents encouraged early marriages just to prevent their children from being dragged away to fight in the war. But, after the war, there are many divorces as a result. Previously, you very rarely heard of divorce in the Tamil community, but today it has changed and the number of divorces is rising rapidly. Therefore, it will take some time for these social problems to settle even if the economic problems are settled much sooner.
Q: There is great interest in the sword gangs in the North currently. How do you see this situation
A. All these incidents are to be taken relatively and comparatively. When you compare the crimes in the South, the North is nil. I am in the government and I get the reports of the whole island and compare them. In comparison to other districts, Jaffna is far better. But always, even a simple incident in the North is highlighted.
In the South, there are various serious crimes taking place and numerous gangs are involved in serious crime. Comparatively, in the North, these are youth gangs and they use small knives and homemade swords. Not that I am saying this is acceptable, but compared to the South, these gangs in the North are relatively less destructive. In the South on the other hand, these gangs are using AK-47s, bombs and other modern weapons and committing serious crimes. So why dont we ask the same question from the South Why are we only pointing fingers at the North
Even in developed countries you see such groups. We are always used to seeing Jaffna in a peculiar manner. Even a simple incident is highlighted and exaggerated. But the actual situation is not as bad.
Q: The Northern Chief Minister and other Tamil politicians constantly call for the removal of the military camps in the North. Will this happen any time soon
A. First let me ask, who invited the military to the North Earlier, there were no military camps in the North, only police stations. However, because of this protracted guerrilla war, the Army was compelled to go there to protect the integrity of the land. Before that, these lands were taken over by the LTTE, but nobody talks about that. They set up camps and forcibly acquired peoples lands. They are the ones who started these activities. Not just the lands, but even small children were kidnapped for their purposes. That was a result of that protracted war.
Hence, my view is that if we remove all these camps from the North, that policy should be applied to the South as well. But, can we do that to a country No!
Because of the bitter experiences in the past, we must maintain these military camps for some time until the security in that region is ensured. Its not the number of camps and soldiers that matter, we must see if they are suppressing and oppressing the people in that area.
The truth is far from that. In fact, these soldiers are helping the poor a lot in the North. When there is an epidemic or a natural disaster, it is the Army that is first at hand to help these people. Lack of skilled people is one of the greatest challenges in the North, as almost all the educated people have left the area. Only the poor and marginalised are left behind.
Hence, when we want to develop the area, there is a lack of a skilled labour and we are unable to find engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers and contractors. In such situations, it is the Army that steps in. Many schools, hospitals and even houses have been built by the Army without any labour charges. Hence, I dont think that the Army being there is a problem for the people, but on the contrary, it is the politicians who try to make it look so. But, they must vacate the private lands they occupy. Almost 90 percent of the lands have been released and the rest too would be released in the near future.
Q: The Northern Chief Minister is adamant that Buddhist temples should not be established in the North and that Tamils should be allowed to rule the North which should be solely an area for the Tamils. What is your take on this
A. The Chief Minister was earlier a reputed judge and he is a very good gentleman. However, politically, I feel he is incapable and does not understand reality. These politicians think of winning the next election, but statesmen think of the next generation. Hence, he is doing all this just to be elected again. The easiest way to be a leader is by rousing racial, territorial and religious sentiments. Now sadly, this reputed judge is also playing this game of politics.
Q: The Tamils feel that the war is over, but justice has not been done. Do you agree
A. Realistically, we must understand it in relative terms. What is the injustice that is done to them They must be specific. They have all their rights and no one has deprived them of it. They have the same political rights and human rights that the rest of the country enjoys. Economic development issues exist, but that is not only in the North, this situation is prevalent in the other provinces too. We must address these issues, but the people in the North do enjoy all political and legal rights. Justice is being done.
Q: Tamil politicians are of the view that the drug menace has been introduced to the North by the South to destroy the Tamils. How would you respond
A. Some areas in the North are notorious for smuggling and even in the past it was so. In the past, these areas did not smuggle Kerala cannabis or drugs, they smuggled cheaper goods from South India. The distance between India and Sri Lanka is a mere 20km and India can be reached easily. There are thousands of fishing boats in that area and these boats are being used for drug trafficking and they are paid highly. Everyone is focussing on the drug menace in the North, but what about the drug menace in the South It is far worse. I feel that contrary to what they say, the Northerners are bringing these drugs and we in the South are consuming it. The drug menace is not just confined to Sri Lanka, it is a global issue. Its very difficult to control. The issue is that we are not looking at this situation objectively, as it is the Tamils who are bringing these drugs from India. Hence we must tackle this problem collectively and no one can address this situation singlehandedly.

## Title: Riot of cinematic symbiosis
## Supertitle: Venom

Venom
Riot of cinematic symbiosis
Fusing elements of action and suspense with comedy, Venom creatively displays the birth of an anti-hero while foregrounding their internal struggles to deliver an entertaining movie. However, although the movie is humorous and exciting with certain scenes standing out from the rest, it does not establish a proper equilibrium between those varying features and fails to lay the foundation for significant plot twists as well as to create a compelling villain.
A spacecraft of the Life Foundation carrying four specimens of an alien species known as symbiotes crashes upon re-entry to the earths atmosphere, allowing one of them to escape. With the three other symbiotes in his possession, Life Foundation CEO Carlton Drake secretly begins experiments on human-symbiote fusion in order to surpass the flawed structure of the human body. However, his plans are foiled when investigative reporter Eddie Brock uncovers the truth before merging with the symbiote known as Venom. Struggling to find common ground with the entity within him, Brock must now escape Drakes men and the police that hunt him as the rogue symbiote known as Riot makes its move.
The movie focuses on two main plotlines: one being Carlton Drakes plans to alter the anatomy of humans so they could adapt to alien environments when the earth becomes uninhabitable, and the other being Eddie Brocks and Venoms journey to understanding each other.
Drakes humanitarian facade masks his true identity: an apathetic manipulator who disregards the wellbeing of others in order to achieve his own selfish desiresevident in his enthusiasm for using the homeless as test subjects for illegal and dangerous experiments, as well as knowing how to twist words in such a manner that it makes the other person yield to his wishes.
Riz Ahmeds performance was fairly good given the limitations on his character. Although there were certain lines that accentuated Drakes malice and hypocrisy, the script and direction of the movie failed to help him reach his full potential: Carlton Drake lacked solidity and consistency as a villain. Furthermore, there was neither an introduction to Drakes background nor was there an attempt powerful enough to connect him with the audience. Hence, he seemed to be a villain present for the sole purpose of giving the heroor rather the anti-herosomeone to stop. Riot was quite underused until the end of the movie, however, the final battle between him and Venom was outstanding.
In contrast with Drake, better attention had been given to Eddie Brock and his relationship with Venom. The movie portrays him as a tenacious individual while revealing the numerous reports he has made on pressing matters; a symbol of Brocks dedication to his fellow man.
Tom Hardys portrayal of Eddie Brock was brilliant, especially in the scenes depicting the internal battles between him and Venom. His expressions of fear and confusion were noteworthy when Venom was rampant during the initial stages of symbiosis, as well as during the chase sequences that followed. The conversations between Brock and Venom were entertaining to watch as Brock struggled to prevent the symbiote with an insatiable hunger from preying on every person they encountered.
However, as the movie progresses, we see Venoms destructive nature take a turn for the better as he is influenced by Eddie Brocks integrity. This symbolised a deeper understanding between the pair and revealed that Venom had begun to adopt attributes of Brocks personality.
The movie mainly focused on the character development of Brock and Venom both individually and as a team, while aiming to combine comedy with suspense; and although those aspects did meld well, for the most part, they also hindered the tone of the movie in some instances. However, the combat scene with the SWAT team and the motorcycle chase sequence stood out, as Venoms fluidity, adaptability, and ferocity were utilised creatively.
The choice of music as well as its timing was well-placed and added to the suspense, while the special effects and CGI combined with the cinematography were brilliant in bringing the giant and monstrous symbiotes as well as their swift movements to life. The settings and costumes also suited the characters and their situations, especially for Eddie Brock during his struggles right before and after his encounter with Venom.
Although the trailer of Venom teased his liking for biting off peoples heads, the movie plays it safe and limits the visibility of the scenes where it does take place, which is rather absurd: why set the atmosphere for such a scene if it would not be followed through completely
The movie would have done better if it were R-rated since there would have been more room to make characters such as Venom and Riot more terrifying and compelling. After all, Venom is an anti-hero and therefore, does not require the restrictions that are usually present in other superhero movies.
Perhaps it could be said that similar to Eddie Brocks relationship with Venom, the symbiosis between the various elements in the movie too, was a riot. In the end, Venom does not stand out from the crowd in the best way it could have, but it is still a decent movie that one could enjoy.

The Sigiriya frescoes and graffiti are being copied for preservation purposes, using modern laser technology, the Central Cultural Fund said. The Bamberg University in Germany, the Central Cultural Fund, the Archaeology Department and the Kelaniya University are engaged in this endeavour.
Many of the world sites including the Kandy Dalada Maligawa have been recreated using laser technology.
In the digital copying of the frescos, some areas that are faded and difficult to read could also be successfully copied and read, Kelaniya University former Professor B.D. Nandadeva said, addressing a media conference in Dambulla on Sunday. The Director General Professor Prishantha Gunawardena, Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, and Bamberg University expert representative Dr. Max Rahrig were also present at the press briefing.
Professor Nandadeva said the frescoes would not be damaged during this process. On the contrary, these digitised copies will allow foretelling any harm that would come to the frescoes in the future, which will allow precautions to be taken.
He also said the digitised copies of the graffiti would allow clearer images for reading and understanding.
Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe said that other pre-historic cave art will also be preserved using similar technology in the future.

Spectacular theme night of dance and music
A hundred years ago there lived and worked a remarkable woman named Marion de Forest who had a dream. She was an American playwright and journalist from Buffalo, New York. She believed that women all over the world needed a voice, champions to protect their rights, their freedoms. And she attracted a group of Pioneer supporters, with whose help the Zonta International movement was born.

Sri Lanka Tourism, Aitken Spence Host Fellowship For International Cricket Media
Sri Lanka Tourism and Aitken Spence Hotels and Resorts hosted a fellowship for international and local journalists covering the ongoing cricket tournament between Sri Lanka and England.
The fellowship, attended by a large number of foreign journalists and international cricket commentators, took place at the Heritance Kandalama Hotel, the flagship property of Aitken Spence Hotels and Resorts, last week. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the Ministry of Sports also supported the initiative.
The fellowship included several traditional dance items showcasing Sri Lankas rich cultural heritage. It also raised awareness of Sri Lankas scenic tourism destinations and world-renowned cultural sites.
In addition to the main events, a giveaway social media competition was also held among the foreign journalists at the reception to promote Sri Lanka on their social media platforms.
They were asked to upload an image of Sri Lanka on Instagram with the caption Why people should visit Sri Lanka as they think and in one hour, three people with the maximum number of likes received gift vouchers from Heritance Kandalama.
Members of the international press are the ones who portray Sri Lankas image overseas and it is important to build up a channel of communication with them. Apart from covering the cricket tournament between Sri Lanka and England, they will also help us tell our story to the world, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said explaining the objective of the initiative.
Ratnayaka also thanked Aitken Spence Hotels & Resorts for partnering with SLLDA, and Sri Lanka Cricket for facilitating an initiative of this sort.
Our Tourism Strategic Plan (2017-2020) talks about the importance of strengthening Sri Lankas image as a welcoming host. Sometimes brief gestures of this nature go a long way in shaping the brand image of our nation, Ratnayaka said adding that plans were underway, with the involvement of the private sector, to welcome and entertain Balmy Army - the semi-organised group of English cricket fan following their team on overseas tour - who will be visiting Sri Lanka for the bilateral Test series.

In step with technical matters
Technical College, Kalutara, held Open Day, an exhibition aimed at educating students, teachers, parents and the general public about the job connected with the technical field and how machinery functions. It also gave an insight to the diverse technical training courses that the college has to offer.
Many school leavers, especially those in the rural areas, and their parents or guardians want them to get Government jobs. They do not wish to engage in professions related to the technical or construction field. This is because they possess a negative attitude towards the professions related the technical field, The Principal of Technical College, Kalutara, S Hemachandra said.
We have technical courses of NVQ Levels up to four and a student who is interested in following a technical course can go up to the NVQ Level seven which is at the degree level at Ratmalana College of Technology. Such students who excel in the field are able to earn nearly two or three lakhs in Sri Lanka or three or four folds of that salary in a foreign country, he added.
He said that a university degree holder has to demand a job because he or she is not given vocational training at the university. A technically skilled student knows how to find a job either in Sri Lanka or abroad. He noted that Open Day will unveils the value of a technical related profession to students.
Many are unaware that there are an abundance of technical related jobs in Sri Lanka. We do not get sufficient applications or students for the jobs available in the market. Therefore a student who has obtained his or her NVQ Level certificate will not have time to idle around. He or she is able to find a job easily, he said.
Over 4000 students from various schools in the Kalutara district visited the exhibition. Various machinery such as Gas and Arc Welding Work, Electronic Work, Electrical Work, plumbing etc were on exhibit. College trainees demonstrated them to all those who visited the exhibition. Over 200 students who have completed various technical and language courses received their certificates from the Chief Guest Technical Education and Training Department Director General Pushpa Malalasekara.

Stories, yet untold
First, there was nothing. She had hardly anything to write down. But she never gave up doodling and squiggling. Perched on the ground, the little girl would watch over her author-parents. In a little while, she finds herself ambling along the rivers and lakes where the willows grow, naturally looking for inspiration.
Growing up, she stumbled upon thoughts, words and stories. Then there was everything.
Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri entered the literary limelight when her manuscript, Stories, won the Gratiaen Prize in 2017. Later released as a Sarasavi publication, her work caught the attention of both Godage National Literary Awards Ceremony and State Literary Awards Ceremony to be chosen as the Best Novel in English medium. More meaning was added when her father was posthumously honoured at the State Lit Fest with the award for the Best Screenplay in Sinhala (Welikathara). If only those in attendance knew the father-daughter relationship, Charulatha would have received a well-deserving standing ovation on that special day.
As the daughter of Tissa Abeysekara, a cinema czar of his generation and Pushpa Meewella, a veteran writer, linguistic excellence seems bequeathed to her. Charulathas story is simple but not without marvel.
For Charulatha, no novel must be published without a proper editing process. Now, that is something quite unheard of in this part of the world. Yet Charulatha chose to be among the few even following the Gratiaen accomplishment. She submitted her work to two literary editors.
Chapter by chapter they sent in the comments. I agreed with most comments. A few comments I did not quite agree with and left it at that. I made the changes accordingly. The comments were mostly centred on how certain ideas could be presented in a better manner. In certain instances, they suggested different wording. They noted how some of the words did not carry the meaning in its entirety. Restructuring certain paragraphs was another suggestion. In another instance, I was asked to provide background information, Charulatha goes into details of her editing process.

She received a constructive feedback from the Gratiaen judging panel as well. Professor Sasanka Perera, the chair of the panel, for instance, elaborated how he felt the book could be improved. He recommends a more informative and descriptive narrative form to make the plot more picturesque for the readership.
All this sharpened her tools of the trade. It brought out the story.
Although editing is alien to Sri Lanka, Charulatha insists on editing without which publishing should never take place.
There is an always editing process involved. Usually, the publisher provides the editor. The editor works closely with the writer to improve on the story being told. The idea is to tell the story in every possible way that it can be told, Charulatha explains.
And she adds the problem as well. If an editor offers a comment, the writer feels obliged. Which is not necessary. Finally, the option is solely yours. It is your story. Your write it. You work on it. That gives you full authority over what you need to change or not. Easier said than done, however, as the writers usually approach someone with authoritative seniority to get the editing done. When they put forward a suggestion, their seniority or the authoritative scholarship compels you to oblige.
It is a delicate balance. You have to strike a balance of not offending your editor and working closely with them. My editors were marvellous that way. They sent the comments but gave me the option. They never forced me to accept their comments and work on them. If you feel like resubmitting the work, then you shall do it by all means. But remember every submission has an editors fee involved. The editor decides on the price. They have a look at the story first. Sometimes it is the word-count. Sometimes the page-count. If you can come to terms with the fee, then go ahead, Charulatha sheds some light on the editorial enigma.
On a different note, Charulatha quotes Madubhashini Disanayaka Ratnayake who is on record as saying that the Sinhala writers are light years ahead of the English writers. The English writers in Sri Lanka have so much to mature in terms of language command and how they present their stories.
The Sinhala writers are far ahead of the English writers, true. But they could also have been benefitted more with an editing process. If you have someone with an authoritative scholarship you can iron out the wrinkles in your book. It is definitely a benefit, Charulatha puts forward her observation.
The biggest obstacle for the local English writer emerges when they deal with a Sri Lankan story which could have been felt much better in the native tongue.
Suppose you have been speaking English all your life and suddenly start speaking in Sinhala. The words dont come out quite well. It applies to writing as well. English is not capable of fully captivating everything that goes in Sinhala, Tamil, Buddhist, Hindu and Catholic lives of Sri Lanka. It takes a great amount of language to bring out the essence in a way to suit the readership. There is a lot to learn, I guess.
The best source is your mother tongue, Charulatha concludes. But then why did she choose English as her medium The language came to her as a medium of convenience.
Writing in Sinhala means longhand for Charulatha. That exercise hurts her wrists in the long run. So she chose the writers best ally, the laptop, to assemble the wandering thoughts of a nostalgic realm into a proper narrative. Her mother calls the longhand-deviation laziness. Whatever it is, Charulatha cannot turn back now. She has built her literary fortress from stone. Stepping out of that comfort zone requires great effort or exertion  which might not be worth the effort.

Tangalle ex-PS Chairmans appeal fixed for argument
The appeal filed by the Attorney General against the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder was yesterday fixed for argument on March 1 next year by the Court of Appeal.
Through this appeal, the Attorney General maintained that the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Appeal Justices Shiran Goonaratne and S. Thurairajah.
While requesting to amend the punishments given to the convicts, the AG also suggested that these convicts should be given the death sentence or life imprisonment as they committed the murder using weapons as members of an unlawful assembly.
The petition also noted that the Judge had reiterated that the fourth accused in the unlawful assembly had used a firearm and that in cases of unlawful assembly, an offence committed by one applies to all in the group. Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva with Kalinga Indatissa and Counsel Darshana Kuruppu appeared for the accused appellants.

Inland Revenue Department report reveals
Tax defaulters dodge Rs.197 bn.
The Government had been deprived an income amounting to approximately Rs.197 billion due to taxes in default as at the end of last year, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) performance report for the year 2017 indicated.
Tax evasion remains one of the main reasons for the default of taxes. The report was tabled in Parliament last week.
The Gross Income Tax in default stood at Rs.117.6 billion as at December 31, 2017 as per the report.
However, out of the total sum of taxes in default, Rs.177 billion has been categorised as disputed taxes meaning that the tax payers have lodged appeals invoking their rights against assessments. Similarly, out of the total of default income tax, Rs.112 billion came under the category of disputed taxes. The total collectible tax (excluding disputed taxes and penalties) as at the end of last year stood at Rs.19.3 billion.
The total collectible penalty (for not paying taxes) stood at Rs.12.7 billion.
According to the report, a total of Rs.258 million due as surcharge on income tax had been defaulted. The defaulted amount of Value Added Tax (VAT) stood at Rs 50 billion.
The report however pointed out that the Government had collected Rs 229.841 billion from income tax last year. The total income tax payers as at the end of 2017 stood at 1,247,946 and out of them 49,000 were companies. Employees paying income tax under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) scheme stood at 1,051,364 and the Government collected Rs. 32,920million from PAYE. However compared to 2016, revenue from income tax had dropped by 3.59 percent. The Government had also collected Rs.443.739 billion as Value Added Tax (VAT) and Rs.101.824 billion as Nation Building Tax (NBT).
The total revenue collected by the IRD last year was Rs.836.518 billion recording an increase of Rs.194.971 billion over that of the previous year. It was a 45.67 percent contribution to the total Government revenue of the year.

TISL launches anti-corruption tracker
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday launched an online platform to track the progress that has been made in key anti-corruption commitments made by the government at the Anti-Corruption Summit 2016 held in London.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeysekere said this tracker will serve as a tool to promote accountability in the government to fulfill its anti-corruption commitments.
Sri Lanka is unique in constitutionally enshrining our commitment to implementing the UN Convention against Corruption. As corruption also continues to feature prominently in the public discourse, we hope that the information provided through the tracker will empower the public and other stakeholders to focus their efforts in the fight against corruption, he said.
In May 2016, 43 governments and six international organisations met in London for the Anti-Corruption Summit, resulting in a bold Global Declaration against Corruption.
The Sri Lankan government, represented by President Maithripala Sirisena, was also a participant at the Anti-Corruption Summit and made several broad-based pledges.
The three pledges that will be tracked through the online platform are the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), tracking large-scale corruption and money laundering and the protection of victims and witnesses.
These broad pledges are further broken down into 47 articles covering a wide range of commitments to combat corruption.
The tracker can be accessed at www.tracker.tisrilanka.org.

Torrent of talent
Janaka Palapathwalas attitude and heart is as great and powerful as his singing. Within him is a wellspring of compassion. Melodies speaks to Palapathwala who uses his god given talent of singing for the pleasure of others and to serve others.
When god knitted him in his mothers womb, he placed the gift of music within Palapathwalas soul. He says this in his own words. He expresses this in his songs.
If God Almighty has given me a talent, I believe that it is not only for my personal gain. I must utilize it for the benefit of society. My first charity was for Thalassemia patients. That was my decision when we organized the concert with Lions Club, in my 2014 concert. But in concerts afterward in Sri Lanka and overseas, the organizers arrive at the decision and I willingly oblige them. My concern always, is whether the charities go to deserving hands and it always has been. I wish to be of help to anyone in need and who is underprivileged, irrespective of my choice. Passions and talents are brought from birth I presume. So I would say, music was placed in me while I was in my mothers womb, explained Palapathawala.
Palapathwalas pure talent and affability has endeared him to his fans, which is why they travel long distances to see and hear him perform. His next tour is in New Zealand, to name the cities, Auckland and Wellington. Then he is flying to United States for shows in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, New York and Washington DC.
Usually every performance or concert is very memorable to me. But if you ask me to be prcise I would say in the recent past, Melbourne Concert, Los Angeles Concert and the Toronto Concerts have been very outstanding. They became Talk of the Town shows. Some fans continued to see my concerts in other cities and states of the same tour, traveling hundreds of miles that gave me tremendous satisfaction, said Palapathwala.
Palapathwala admires many great singers- Jim Reeves, Elvis Presley, Engelbert, Neil Diamond, Tom Jones, Perry Como, Demis Roussos, Faron Young, Nana Mouskouri, Dean Martin, would stand on top of the list. But there are many more that made an impression on his mind at such a tender age.
If I say why, the answer could be described in two ways. One, because they dont sing songs that everyone could sing easily. Two, these are the songs that penetrated my subconscious mind while I was sleeping as an infant. My father and mother always listened to the radio while sleeping as there was no television those days. In fact many people ask me why I have a big flair for the artists of my previous generation, stated Palapathwala.
Palapathwala took a brief absence from the musical scene but returned in 2014. He started professional singing during 2001  2002. There onwards he focused on his business. However music is his calling in life. It is his destiny. It is his first love and he will never abandon this love of his - this wonderful creation that is music. In the international scene he has collaborated with Gary Ellis and Rob Ferdinander. In Sri Lanka he has worked with Kalashuree Harsha Markalande, Suresh Maliyadde, Danister Perera, Dinesh Subasinghe, Chandradasa Fernando, Amila Thenuwara, Sanath Sathishchandra, Thilak Dias and many more.
I started professional singing in 2001-2002. Then in 2004 I left Sri Lanka for my business work. During this period I focused on my business. In an unknown land there would be no one to guide or support. So without taking risks, I totally focused on my business. But as I returned to Sri Lanka, I could not resist music which is my first love. So I had a mega concert in 2014, titled Its now or Never with a 31 piece orchestra. Since then I am continuing the journey, added Palapathwala.
Since 2014 he has done over a dozen tours. And things keep on getting better and better. Every tour holds a special place in his heart. This energy he has within him makes him deliver scintillating performances time and again making him look to the future with enthusiasm -Mostly Ballads, country, country and western and Rock and Roll.
Utmost gratitude goes to my creator and my parents who brought me into this world implanting these abilities within me. Then comes my wife and my family for supporting and encouraging me. Then I want to thank all my music directors, song writers of my originals which I will release soon. I want to thank all the fellow musicians working with me and my promoters around the world. The media play a very major role when it comes to public figures. A big thank you to Gary Ellis for establishing my name in Australia and last but not least my fans, points out Palapathwala.
His message to any young person who wants to do music is to discover your inner self and explore yourself. Decide what you are searching for.
I would say, just follow your heart. Dont seek short cuts. Identify self-talent first. Music alone is a very vast industry. So see first where you fit in, as a vocalist or an instrumentalist or a backup singer or song writer. Sing and play what you like and let the audience be the judge. Do not fall by trying to deliver what the audience wants, what you are not capable of, said Palapathwala.

Warriors seek more NBA glory as title-hungry rivals lurk
Washington, Monday: Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry will enjoy watching the Golden State Warriors hoist another championship banner Tuesday when they open the 2018-19 NBA campaign against Oklahoma City.
But the 3-point sharpshooter doesnt need to look to the rafters to know the Warriors remain the team to beat as they begin the quest for a third consecutive NBA title and fourth crown in five seasons.
Im still glowing, Curry said. The glow wont wear down until you get beat.
The Warriors boast three other All-Stars in two-time NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant, defensive stalwart Draymond Green and Currys backcourt partner Klay Thompson -- plus a fifth in injured center DeMarcus Cousins, signed in July but still sidelined after left Achilles tendon surgery in January.
Working Cousins into the lineup once he returns could add some zest to the regular season for Golden State, which has so far avoided letting repetitive domination lead to complacency. Thats the thing Im most proud of with our team, Curry said. Were talented and all that, but the work that goes into it, the mental approach to turn the page, has been there the last three years.
You work so hard to earn the right to be proud of yourself at the end of the summer. Golden State will try to become the first team since the 2000-2002 Los Angeles Lakers to win three consecutive NBA titles and join the 1950s Minneapolis Lakers and 1960s Boston Celtics as the only clubs to win four titles in five years.The Celtics dynasty, with eight titles in a row and nine in all from 1957-1966, is the only NBA squad to reach five consecutive NBA Finals -- a feat the Warriors can achieve this season.
The Houston Rockets, who pushed the Warriors to seven games in last seasons Western Conference finals, and the Boston Celtics, bringing back injured stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward to a team that was one win from last seasons Eastern Conference crown, figure to lead a pack of rivals who ache for a chance to play for the championship.
To be honest, its fun, Curry said of wearing the target for every NBA rival. No matter if its a Tuesday night at home or a back-to-back in some random East Coast city, youre going to be tested and you cant just sleepwalk through stuff.
Weve been exposed at times in terms of when were not extremely locked in that we can be beat. But when we are focused and in tune with each other, understanding what were trying to do to be successful, obviously were tough.
No one knows that better than the Rockets, who won a league-best 65 games last season behind NBA Most Valuable Player and scoring champion James Harden. Houston led Golden State 3-2 in the West finals before Chris Paul suffered an injured hamstring and missed the last two games, both won by the Warriors to reach the NBA Finals, where they swept Cleveland for the crown.

World's largest underwater restaurant to open in 2019
The worlds largest underwater restaurant is now taking reservations as it nears completion.
According to CNN, Under is an underwater restaurant that is an architectural phenomenon located near the southernmost tip of Norway. The 110-foot long structure, which is an oblique concrete slab that looks like a sunken periscope, was submerged in July 2018 after spending six months being constructed on a nearby barge. Now the interior is all that remains to be finished.
Real Clear Life reported that when finished, Under will be able to accommodate about 100 guests set over three levels. Visitors will have unique underwater views of the surrounding marine environment thanks to a 36-foot-wide panoramic window. Guests will enter the structure via a glass bridge that connects to the coast.
The location of the restaurant was purposely picked to be in rougher waters, CNN reported.
"I think the most exciting experience will be visiting the restaurant during rough weather," Rune Grasdal, a senior architect working at the restaurant, told CNN.
"It will be fantastic to see the sea surface broken up by the big waves and the rain, making for a very dramatic view - although you will still feel safe and relaxed inside the restaurant," Grasdal said.
According to Travel and Leisure, the concrete building is designed to be a positive addition to the marine ecosystem. It will double as a marine research center in the off-hours, and its concrete walls will eventually become an artificial mussel reef.
Unders menu will feature local seafood, although mushrooms, berries, various seabirds and wild sheep from the surrounding area will also be offered. Total completion is set for the spring of 2019. Reservations can be made on the restaurants website, though availability is booked well into the summer of 2019.

Zazai blitzes 12-ball 50 to equal idol and rival Gayle
Sharjah, Sunday: Hazratullah Zazai smashed a blistering half-century off just 12 balls in the Afghan Premier League on Sunday to equal the all-time T20 record held by his idol Chris Gayle and Yuvraj Singh.
The 20-year-old batsman blasted left-arm spinner Abdullah Mazari for six sixes in one over on his way to tying the mark for the fastest half-century in T20 cricket.
Gayle got a close-up look at Zazais big-hitting as the West Indian star was in the opposing Balkh Legends team.
It was a surreal moment for me to perform in front of my idol, said Zazai.
I was trying to play my natural game and wasnt thinking of outshining anybody. Left-hander Zazai, who has played for Afghanistan in both one-day and T20 internationals, was eventually out for a 17-ball 62 as his team Kabul Zwanan fell 21 runs short of a target of 245 against Balkh.Its a very proud moment for me, said Zazai. Its a very enjoyable moment for me that my name is now linked to so many big names of the game, the real legends. His record-equalling innings came just five days after he scored 124 against Nangarhar Leopards in the same competition. AFP
