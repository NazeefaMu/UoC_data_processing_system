Give clear picture on Asbestos ban

Asbestos sheet manufactures are asking for a clear message from the government on whether the ban on the manufacturers and use of asbestos sheet was still in force.
However due to reasons best known to the government and political developments between Russia and Sri Lanka the government said that the ban was temporary lifted, said Coordinator of the Fibre Cement Products Manufacturers Association, Anton Edema.
He claimed that without a proper study being done legislation was passed to ban the manufacture of Asbestos from January 1, 2018. However an alternative solution was not provided for the roofing needs of the people by the government until now. He told Daily News Business that sheet manufactures and over 200,000 people who are direct and indirect benefited from the Asbestos industry is now in a quandary with regard to this ban.
Edema said the industry needs huge investments and the maintenance of machinery too is very expensive. Hence the manufactures too want a clear policy form the government with regard to this ban. We are asking the government to do a proper study once again and come up with clear solution.
He said that today Russia is the main market for asbestos fiber, the main raw material and over 2% of Russias annual fiber exporters are to Sri Lanka. In the manufacturing process of a sheet 92% is from cement and 6% to 7% are used as a binding agent.
Edema said that Asbestos is being used in Sri Lanka for over 70 years and first they were imported from England. Later Sri Ramco started manufacturing them locally and today there are four leading players. Over 3,000 employees are involved in the manufacturing process and none of them have developed cancer or any other health related disease so far. End users too have not had any health hazards.
Today over 60% of local roofing needs are met by Asbestos and use of it saves wood and also construction cost and is also a preferred housing option for poor and middle class. It is also fire resistant. Edima said that there are six types of Asbestos sheets used in the world and some types are banned.

Advocacy group  flags violence against female candidates
A non-profit election monitor has written to the Elections Commission and the Inspector General of Police accusing a cleric of encouraging violence against female candidates in Puttalam and the countrys North and East.
In the two letters, the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said a cleric known as Niyaz Maulavi has posted videos online where he degrades female candidates reputations using profanity and insults.
His objective is their withdrawal from the elections, they wrote.
Maulavi says he is a member of the Jamiuththowheed, also known as Thowheed Jamath, according to the Centre.
In addition to the videos, the group also pointed out specific instances of violence against women contesting elections. According to them, the Elections Commission said a female candidates office was set on fire on January 19.
They also said the home of C. A. Rinuza Ilma, a female candidate of the Muslim Congress, was raided by four male police officers from the Norochcholai police station on a false tip that she was running a large-scale money laundering operation.
The police would not accept a complaint the candidate tried to lodge later at the station, the Centre said, until the Elections Commissioner intervened.
We strongly urge you to take appropriate measures in this regard to strengthen and protect the integrity of the electoral process, wrote Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, the Co-Convener of the Centre.
The reports of violence come at a time when more women are running for office after Parliament passed a law last year mandating that local governments must have a 25 percent quota for female election candidates.

Afghanistan knock out New Zealand in quarters
A 23-ball blitzkrieg of 66 from Azmatullah Omarzai was backed up by some precise bowling by spinners Mujeeb Zadran and Qais Ahmad as Afghanistan registered a thumping 202 runs victory over New Zealand to move into the Super League semi-finals of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup in Christchurch on Thursday.
Azmatullah unleashed three fours and seven sixes as the Asian champions posted a mammoth 309 for six after electing to bat first in front of broadcast cameras at the Hagley Oval. New Zealand were bowled out for 107 with off-spinner Mujeeb (four for 14) and leg-spinner Qais (four for 33) mesmerising the host sides batting.
Azmatullah, who was one of three players rested in Afghanistans last league match against Ireland which they lost by four runs, showed what the Afghanistan first-choice players are capable of as they get ready to take on three-time champions Australia in the first semi-final on Monday, 29 January, at the same venue.
The result also means that three Asian sides will be in the semi-finals since Pakistan have already qualified and await the winners of the match between two other South Asian teams - India and Bangladesh  who play the last quarter-final on Friday in Queenstown. Coincidently, three Asian sides (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan) had also reached the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England and Wales.
In other matches, Ireland beat PNG by three wickets while Namibia pulled off an eight-wicket win over Kenya. Jonathan Garths four-wicket haul was the highlight of the win for Ireland while captain Lohan Louwrenss knock of 114 helped Namibia carve out an impressive win.

Casey Affleck pulls out of presenting Best Actress Oscar

Oscar-winning actor Casey Affleck has pulled out of this year's Academy Awards, his publicist has confirmed.
By tradition, Affleck - who won Best Actor for Manchester By The Sea in 2017 - would have been expected to present the Best Actress award this year.
The actor, brother of Hollywood star Ben Affleck, was sued by two female crew members for alleged sexual harassment in 2010.
An Oscars spokeswoman confirmed that Affleck would not attend, saying: "We appreciate the decision to keep the focus on the show and on the great work of this year."
What are the claims against Affleck
Affleck's accusers, producer Amanda White and director of photography Magdalena Gorka, say they were harassed during the making of the mockumentary film I'm Still Here, which Affleck directed.
White claimed that Affleck had refused to pay her salary because she would not spend the night in a hotel room with him, and said she endured, "a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crew members, within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck".
Gorka alleged that Affleck, who was married at the time, had crawled into bed with her as she slept.
The actor's lawyers argued that the allegations were part of a scheme to extort money from Affleck.
Why is this back in the news
The claims against Affleck have drawn renewed attention in the months since sexual abuse allegations were levelled against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.
The Weinstein allegations sparked the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment.
More than 300 actresses, writers and directors responded by launching Time's Up- a project to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces.
The initiative was announced via a full-page ad printed in the New York Times.
At the 75th Golden Globe Awards earlier this month, a galaxy of A-list actresses took to the red carpet in black to honour victims of sexual harassment. Many actors signalled their support by wearing a Time's Up pin on their lapels.
The event sawpowerful speeches about the sexual abuse scandal, including one from Oprah Winfreywhich received worldwide attention.

Challenges, opportunities in LG electoral system: WMC
The new mixed Local Government electoral system with a 25 percent quota for women, has brought in new challenges while also opening up space for more women, said the Women and Media Collective (WMC) yesterday.
While 60 percent of the seats under the first-past-the-post system are contested via a ward, only 10 percent of these seats are open to women. The women have to depend on men to put them on the ward list. And we find that most parties have put their female candidates onto the second or proportional representation list, explained WMC, Technical Advisor- Programmes and Research, Kumudini Samuel addressing a media briefing at Renuka Hotel, Colpetty.
Winning a ward is an assurance of a seat and the smaller constituency of the ward allows for easier and cheaper campaigning. The majority of the women appointed through the second list will not have a constituency and will not get in if their relevant party does not win enough wards.
The women on the second list thus have to campaign throughout the Local Government body and they have been told by the parties that if they fill the ballot boxes, it would motivate the party to nominate their names when the time comes, said Coordinator Womens Resource Centre, Sumika Perera.
The WMC has asked for a more regulated method to appoint women into Local Government.
Perera also noted that that there was a trend in not letting women contest a ward even when they have worked for years on behalf of the party.
Out of the 21 Local Bodies in the Kurunegala District, only 3 to 4 women have been nominated by parties to contest a ward, said Perera.
Rural Womens Front, Sriyani Pathirage suggested that parties appoint female organizers in addition to male, to ensure that the best female candidates are chosen.
It is a lie that political parties spread when they say that there are no women to contest. There have been so many women at the grassroots who have worked hard and have not been chosen, said Perera.
When it comes to election related violence, female candidates have fared worse than their male counterparts. While reports of violence against women were not reported widely in the districts of Kurunegala, Galle and other provinces, Viluthu, Centre for Human Resource Development, Executive Director, Maithreyi Rajasingham observed that such cases were being increasingly reported in the North and East.
These female candidates, she said, have also come together across party lines to issue a common manifesto with the main objective of creating a democratic culture within LGs.

Court extends interim order regarding Gotas writ petition
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended until February 15 its interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrates Court inquiry.
A two-Judge-bench comprising the then Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrates Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, 2017, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-Judge-bench comprising the then Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the petitioner commenced his oral submissions and it is to be resumed the next date as well.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne, appearing for the Attorney General, informed court that he is expecting to make his oral submissions on the next date. The Court had upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violates his legitimate expectations.

CPSTL installs aviation  fuel filtration unit
The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals (CPSTL) has installed the aviation fuel filtration unit which has neglected for 17 years, within short period of time.
CPC and CPSTL Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga stated that according to the Joint Inspection Group (JIG) reports, Sri Lanka has achieved Good position in aviation fuel supply and they will be able to rise to Excellent with this project.
The joint Inspection Group is an internationally accepted institution, which inspects standard methods and quality tests of pumping aviation fuel. The JIG had recommended the requirement of aviation fuel filtration unit in Sri Lanka.
Following the recommendation, documentation was initiated in June, 2017. Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said they will be able to save between USD 2 to 300,000 from one vessel of aviation fuel.
There was no aviation fuel filtration unit to pump fuel into train tanks in Kolonnawa. The CPSTL had to state in the documents about the unavailability of an aviation fuel filtration unit when they prepared specifications. Following this, we had to import aviation fuel at a higher price because suppliers had offered higher bids to supply aviation fuel. We do not further require to import aviation fuel for higher prices now.
We will be able to call competitive prices to import aviation fuel, now. It saves US Dollars 300,000 on one vessel of aviation fuel. We would be able to confirm the quality of the aviation fuel and obtain huge monetary profits from this venture, Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said.
The unit was constructed by CPSTL engineers and they did complete it a few days before the scheduled period.
Parallel to this unit, two pumps with the capacity of 136 Cubic Meter per hour were installed.
CPSTL said they will be able to speed up the filling than they did earlier because of the new pumps.

Distress Sale..!
Was enjoying a holiday at a resort the other day when the lights went out. I rang the reception, No lights! I shouted with as much irritation as I could put into my voice.
Power cut sir! said a voice from the reception in a nonplussed tone.
Power cut I shouted, Who cut the power
Government sir!
I put down the phone worriedly and through the windows saw a city with no lights, staring dismally back at me. I let my imagination run and imagined I walked into a showroom and found TVs, ACs, microwaves, washing machines, toasters, you name it, going dirt cheap.
How are you able to sell all these so cheap I asked the salesman at the counter.
Its a distress sale, said the salesman with a haunted look in his yes, We have to get rid of everything before the power cuts in the city become more regular. Once people know that soon there wont be power to run their TVs and ACs and washing machines, they wont touch our stuff!
How much for that AC I asked.
How much you willing to pay for it
Im not sure, I said slowly, my wife wants a microwave, I want an AC.
Take both, smiled the salesman.
How much I asked.
Whatever you want, said the salesman.
I watched as the owner of the shop strolled over to where I was.
Are you being served he asked.
This gentleman would actually like to buy an AC and a microwave, said the salesman and the owner gave him an affectionate pat.Take a washing machine along with the two, said the owner.
I already have one, I said.
Then take a fridge and a mixer!
No, No, I said, thats too much!
Okay take a fridge, a mixer and a toaster.
I cant do that, I gasped.
Well throw in a TV with a flat screen.
Thats going to be expensive, I said.
How much asked the owner.
How much what I asked, I should be asking you how much!
How much you going to charge us for taking all this stuff away Well even give you free home delivery. Just take it all away.
I drove home in the free tempo with all the free things.
Whats this screamed the wife.
Free stuff, I grinned.
Do they burn she screamed.
Burn I asked.
The only thing useful with no power is anything that will burn, she shouted, we need firewood to cook dinner, firewood to light the room for our children to study. Take those things back and gather some firewood from the garden!I went back to the shop dragging all the free goodies. The shop had a new dcor.What are you selling I asked.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 12/B
Downturns and disruption will pave the way  to innovation

We continue with our Blue Ocean Strategy Basics and today we will highlight Tipping Point Leadership and the Four Organizational Hurdles to Strategy Execution. The Tipping Point means -the time at which a change or an effect cannot be stopped.
Let us begin. How can you catapult your organization to high performance when time and money are scarce The Blue Ocean Strategy offers you the answers.
A good Blue Ocean Strategy will have three defining characteristics:
* The blue ocean strategy will be tightly focused  and everyone will understand on what factors the company is competing. This helps avoid the temptation to invest in things which are unrelated to those key competitive factors.
* The Blue Ocean Strategy will diverge from that used by other industry players  because you are looking across alternatives rather than solely attempting to be better than the established players.
* The Blue Ocean Strategy will be clear-cut and easy to communicate  meaning it will be able to be described in a tagline that is compelling and inviting. For example, Southwests tagline could be - The speed of a plane at the price of a car  whenever you need it. A great blue ocean strategy will be so obvious your competitors will wonder why they did not think of that themselves.
Once a company has developed a Blue Ocean Strategy with a profitable business model, it must execute it. The challenge of execution exists, of course, for any strategy. Companies, like individuals, often have a tough time translating thought into action whether in red or blue oceans. But compared with red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the execution bar.
Hurdles
Managers have understood that the challenge is steep. They face four hurdles.
* Knowledge: waking employees up to the need for a strategic shift. Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth, but they feel comfortable to people and may have even served an organization well until now, so why rock the boat
* Limited resources. The greater the shift in strategy, the greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it. But resources were being cut, and not raised, in many of the organizations we studied.
* Motivation. How do you motivate key players to move fast and tenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo That will take years, and managers dont have that kind of time.
* Politics. As one manager put it, In our organization you get shot down before you stand up.
Although all companies face different degrees of these hurdles, and many may face only some subset of the four, knowing how to triumph over them is key to attenuating organizational risk.
This brings us to the fifth principle of blue ocean strategy: Overcome key organizational hurdles to make blue ocean strategy happen in action. To achieve this effectively, however, companies must abandon perceived wisdom on effecting change. Conventional wisdom asserts that the greater the change, the greater the resources and time you will need to bring about results.
Tipping point leadership
Instead, you need to flip conventional wisdom on its head using what we call tipping point leadership. Tipping point leadership allows you to overcome these four hurdles fast and at low cost while winning employees backing in executing a break from the status quo.
Blue Ocean Strategy introduces Tipping Point Leadership which allows you how to triumph over those hurdles. This leadership skill can attenuate the organizational risk, moving fast at low cost, providing a break for the winning employees from the status quo.
Quite a lot of managers would like to introduce a new idea to change the existing selling method, product or service in the organization. However, the top level of managers wont have enough knowledge and experience to accept those ideas. Meanwhile, the managers should implement the Tipping Point Leadership to overcome those hurdles. First of all, they should research the data from the disgruntled customers. Sum up all the complaints from them and study the existing problems.
Then write up a report to the organization and bring out a need for a strategic shift and a break from the status quo. The report should include the strategy canvas of transit. This strategy canvas graph can indicate the disproportionate influence with the new strategic plan.
Lacking in resources can be a very big hurdle in the new idea. The resource can be manpower, capital and facilities. Professor W. Chan Kim suggests the managers should find out the hot spots and cold spots in the organization. Hot spots are activities that have low resource input but high potential performance gains. Cold spots are the activities that have high resource input but low potential performance.
The management level should relocate the resource and focus on hot spots rather and eliminate the cold spots. For instance, iPod is the device which is cold spot in developing this product. Therefore, Steve Jobs relocates the resources in developing the iPad and iPhone. Another way to cut the cost in executing the new idea, horse trading is very common in use within the Tipping Point Leadership. For example, free store warehouse in an organization can be traded with other vendors for electronic components.
Motivation
Several ways to motivate the employees in the organization. Blue Ocean Strategy introduces the kingpins and fishbowl management in human resources. Kingpins are the people inside the organization who are natural leaders, who are well respected and persuasive, or who have an ability to unlock or block access to key resources.
Successful leaders should carry out transparency, inclusion and fair process in production. They can set clear expectation in performance from everyone. Each department should respond in particular service or production. All the members should be having their clear duty role. Atomization can be used to make sure everyone in the company are working under the specific department to deliver their capabilities in each section respectively.
Executing the Blue Oceans Strategy is challenging conventional wisdom. Tipping Point Leadership brings out the disproportionate influence on performance to achieve a strategic shift fast at low cost. It can brings out the political hurdle. The managers should find out the angels, devils and consigliore (advisors to a Mafia boss). They can spot all the landmines in the office. Then cooperate with the one who align to your idea and fight against the detractors with irrefutable facts and reason.
Blue Ocean Strategies are more about risk minimization and less about risk taking. When the four guiding principles for the successful formulation is utilized, these principles will reduce search risks, planning risks, scale risks and business model risks.
For every company, there are literally hundreds of potential Blue Ocean Strategy possibilities. The challenge lies in determining which are commercially viable and which are not. In practice, the key is to look at familiar data from a new perspective.
Example
Let us now study an example from New York Police Department. In early 1990s New York City was famous as a crime infested state. And, then came William Bratton as the Chief of Police. Within two years, he gave following results: Felony crime fell by 39%, Murders fell by 50%, Theft fell by 35%. The public confidence jumped from 37% to 73%. Job satisfaction in police department reached an all-time high.
How does he achieve it He maneuvered the hurdles efficiently.
1. Cognitive hurdle
The hardest battle was simply getting people to agree on the causes of current problems and the need for change. He broke through it by putting managers face to face in operational problems. He said reality cannot be evaded and poor performance should be seen but not only heard. He changed policy in NYTP and allowed officers to use subways for free travelling. He purchased new cars and gave officers intensive training in detective work.
2. Resource hurdle
He side-stepped the resource hurdle. He stressed efficient resource utilization and not demanding extra using at right places. In New York narcotics unit, he changed schedules (focus on nights and weekends.) He increased numbers (5% staffing to 35%). He created New York Transit police to monitor crime rates at all subways. He enhanced strengths at required tolls. He employed non-uniform cops for monitoring.
3. Motivational hurdle
He alerted employees to the need for change and identified how it can be achieved with limited resource. He told employees, You must not only recognize what needs to be done, you must also want to do it. He reformed incentives throughout organization. He introduced semi-weekly strategy meetings. Participants were commanders who control 200 to 400 officers.
4. Political hurdle
Even if an organization has reached the tipping point, powerful vested interests will resist the impending reforms. The more likely change becomes, the more fiercely and vocally these negative influencers - both internal and external - will fight to protect their positions, and their resistance can seriously damage, even derail, the reform process. He emphasized that the Department has to fight to protect their position. He told his staff to be alert.
Not every executive has Brattons personality, but most have his potentialif they follow his success formula. In any organization, once the beliefs and energies of a critical mass of people are engaged, conversion to a new idea will spread like an epidemic, bringing about fundamental change very quickly.
In the next issue, we will study about the paths companies typically follow to reconstruct their market possibilities and open up blue ocean possibilities.

Drought in Anuradhapura expected to continue
Farmer organizations and agriculture and agrarian services officials believe that no rain could be expected according to the weather reports and the current drought in Anuradhapura would continue.
The farmers who started paddy cultivation under major tanks immediately after the monsoon rains, urged the Anuradhapura government agent and the district agriculture committee to take steps to release the maximum number of water turns from the major tanks in order to save their crops.
Referring to this controversial situation, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that under the circumstances, in consultation with the irrigational authorities, it would be possible to at least issue three water turns from reservoirs, while preserving the adequate quota for drinking purposes. He added that the Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board has introduced a new crop damages insurance scheme with effect from the Maha Kanna  2017/18, to pay compensation on the basis of Rs. 40,000 per hectare, bearing a government subsidy.
Although it had been planned to cultivate 130,204 hectares with paddy during the current Maha Season  2017/18, only around 75,200 hectares are currently being cultivated. Eighty-five thousand seven-hundred and ten farmers are involved in this cultivation programme and steps have been taken to provide the proper fertilizer subsidy to them, which is worth Rs. 940 million, Wanninayake further said. He said additional food crops have been grown by 25,980 farmers using limited water facilities. They too have been offered a fertilizer subsidy on the basis of Rs. 10,000 per hectare, amounting to Rs. 190.5 million. The government agent appealed to the farmers to be careful in water-management systems due to the scarcity of irrigation water.

E-learning, way forward for next Generation
According to recent press reports the Minister of Education has taken steps to train teachers of government schools in e-learning training techniques. A timely move, indeed!
It is an accepted fact that Sri Lankas present educational infrastructure cannot meet the current and future needs of the country. Despite having 40 percent of the population under 25 years of age, Sri Lanka is expected to face a severe shortage of skilled workers by 2022.
Even today, there is shortage of skilled labour. Our education system had not been able to cater to the demand for workers in mid-professional, skilled and semi-skilled job categories. According to published reports, currently there are over quarter million job vacancies for skilled workers in corporate and state sector but no takers. Additionally, our traditional education has failed to transformitself in order to be relevant for todays rapidly changing requirements. The rate of advancement of technologies and resulting opportunities is much too rapid for traditional programmes and curriculum to keep up. Besides, there is a whole world of skills that are not even in the purview of our traditional education system.
In these circumstances, e-Learning will play a big role in helping to bring a step closer to solve our education problem.
What is e-learning
E-Learning is defined as study courses that are specifically delivered via the internet to an individual or a group of people somewhere other than the classroom. It is not a course delivered via a DVD or CD-ROM, video tape or over a television channel. It is interactive in that you can also communicate with your teachers, professors or other students in your group. Sometimes it is delivered live, where you can electronically raise your hand and interact in real time and sometimes it is a lecture that has been pre-recorded. There is always a teacher or professor interacting/communicating with you and grading your participation, your assignments and your tests. E-learning may reach learners through one of 4 channels: Campus or school, Corporates, Government or Direct-to-student. That covers the demand side.
On the supply side, the industry has content providers (authors, institutions, etc.), service providers (content creation, publishing, marketing, etc.) and technology providers (authoring tools, platforms, learning Management Systems, etc.)
.
Role of e-learning
The e-learning industry is still in its infancy in this Sri Lanka. We are just at the beginning of making fundamental changes in the education sector. We have a long way to go. With a robust infrastructure for digital access, e-learning will eventually play a vital role in shaping the skills and education needs of our country. But how should we get around with it Exploring and learning about the current global technologies, content and services will be useful but not sufficient. Like in other industries, e-learning would need to adapt and innovate to be relevant for Sri Lanka.
In order for this to happen, both the model of teachingmethods as well as types of content preparation and features built-in for the delivery of the content should align with our specific needs. What is good for India or UK may not be relevant to us. E-learning solutions which fail to be relevant to the users needs will quickly die a natural death.
One of the key challenges that e-learning normally face is maintaining learner engagement with the content and the platform on a long-term basis. In traditional classrooms this is achieved by the physical constraints, the teacher and social behaviour. Reaching a large learner base and sustaining interest levels will require integrating social engagement aspects along with learning. Successful e-learning providers increasingly adopt features, like study groups and discussions, to simulate a classroom study environment.
Gamification or introducing game-design elements and game principles will also play a key role in making learning platforms more engaging and bringing it to a larger audience.
Benefits
In every country it was implemented, e-learning initiatives have created high positive impact in their education and training spaces. E-learning raises the level of educationand resulting economic development in countries where technical education is scarce or expensive, opportunities are limited and economic disparities exist.
Benefits associated with e-learning are immense, with foremost being the possibility of giving personalized attention to every student. Another significant advantage is that e-learning enables students to access the best possible learning resources. E-learning is a great help for teachers as well because the modules enable teacher to manage the learning pace as per their students needs. Likewise, these modules empower students also to set their learning pace as per their individual requirements.
Features
Some say that e-learning is overhyped. It isnt correct. There are many things that it provides to learners that a basic school going student does not get. It promotes self-learning among the students, and they do not depend upon teachers. There is student-to-student contact via video conferencing so as to let the students discuss their queries among themselves.
With advanced features like video recorded lectures and self-paced learning, e-learning  when implemented  will make its mark in the education sector in Sri Lanka. Its beyond doubt.
Key points
We must be mindful on certain issues which might crop up when preparing content for e-learning. Most importantly, the content may appear not quite up to the mark. To prevent this to happen few precautions need to be taken:
(a) The content for e-learning should be designed from the perspective of the student. Good e-learning content is all about communicating clearly and with all relevant information.
(b) Ensure that the content helps the learner meet the objectives of his course. Only the contents that meet the goals of his course should be set.
(c) The content shall impart knowledge that can be made use of in the real world. It makes the content much more interesting and also easier to learn and keep in memory.

Corporate sector
In the modern world, e-learning is transforming education sector in a very innovative manner. The widening of courses and the changing trends in education sector has formed a broader choice for students to decide their career as per their competence and skill. Benefits of having such varied courses are not restricted to students, but are also beneficial for colleges, educational bodies, corporate and the nation at large.
For the corporate sector, where training and learning are an integral part, e-learning has been immensely successful in creating a strong foothold.
For example, it is a logistical nightmare for any employer to organise training sessions for the employees who are spread in different offices and different locations. The exercise consumes unnecessary time, money and effort. With technology-aided e-learning, employees can learn as per their schedules and availability, helping them utilize their time better. Moreover, innovative methodologies like simulations and serious gaming can kindle employee interest, providing opportunity to do and learn. The opportunity to practice and hone skills not only ensures greater productivity and quality of work, but infuses a sense of confidence in the learner, which helps them achieve overall excellence.
Keeping pace with the growth of technology, e-learning has transformed within the last few years to cater to the needs of modern employees. Newer methodologies have been very successful in imparting application-based knowledge.
Today, more and more industries are adopting e-learning as their chosen mode of training and learning delivery.
Sri Lankan internet users have touched 6.2 million by end 2017 and it is about 30 per cent penetration. We have good network infrastructure and backbone for content delivery. Aided by these and the critical need, Sri Lanka has very fertile environment for e-learning to grow.

Education Ministry to promote financial education in schools
Sri Lankas Ministry of Education (MOE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka on January 24, 2018 to formalize the provision of trilingual financial education among school teachers and students in Sri Lanka.

Secretary to Ministry of Education, Sunil Hettiarachchi and Director General of SEC Vajira Wijegunawardane entered into the MoU on behalf of the Ministry and SEC.
Financial literacy encompasses many concepts such as financial awareness, knowledge, skills and capabilities. For many years, the SEC has been imparting capital market knowledge across the country for all sections of society.

The SECs mission to provide financial education starts from the school level by providing sound financial knowledge among school teachers and students.

Moreover, since the subject of capital market is at present included in the Business and Accounting Studies for the G.C.E (Ordinary level) and Business Studies for G.C.E. (Advanced level) curricula, the SEC will ensure that their capital market awareness initiatives will cover the contents in the school syllabuses.

The agreement will continue to enable the SEC to impart capital market knowledge to students and teachers in all 98 zones in Sri Lanka throughout a period of three years in association with the National Institute of Education.

For the year 2018, the SEC is committed to conducting awareness programs for teachers in 32 zones and for students in at least 32 zones.

In addition, under the agreement, basic financial education will be incorporated into more grades in the school curricula and the existing curricula will be updated.

The SEC also anticipates publishing a handbook for Advanced level Business Studies students and telecasting a television quiz program on the capital market on state television.

Yesterdays MoU signing is yet another affirmation of the SECs continued partnership with the Education Ministry to equip school teachers and students with financial literacy competencies to promote financial inclusion.

Family left destitute after  losing house to fire
A mother and her two children have fallen destitute without a proper abode following the destruction of their house at the Rambewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, near the 70th kilometre post on the Trincomalee Road in a fire, last December. The woman, N. A. B. J. Ranasinghe, said their house was destroyed in a fire on December 16, last year, while they were away.
All their possessions including a sewing machine and furniture items, were destroyed in the fire. Kahatagasdigiliya Police, who were informed about the incident, were conducting investigations to find the cause of the fire. The woman and her children are currently living in a make-shift hut built in the compound as they are unable to build a proper abode for themselves with their meagre earnings. Ranasinghes 19-year-old daughter was supporting them with the salary she earned as a garment factory worker and her 12-year-old son is still attending school. She supplemented the family income by working as a labourer when time permits.
Ranasinghe said her family would request philanthropists or good samaritans to aid them in building a small house for themselves. Members of the public wishing to help them financially are kindly requested to remit their contributions to account number 051200360042762 at the Peoples Bank branch in Kahatagasdigiliya or the following address: N.

February 10 poll, more  than a  regional contest - Mangala
An election which will determine if Sri Lankans will live free or in fear, with impunity and grotesque abuse of power by a single family and its henchmen
The National Unity Government which was ushered in through a historic and revolutionary election in January 2015 recently marked three years in office and although the government has made many strides, the road ahead remains long and challenging as the country stands at the cusp of a crucial election, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
This election, he says echoing the sentiments of many will decide if democratic institutions and traditions, painstakingly built since 2015 will be torn down or strengthened for the years to come.
It is after all, an election which will determine if Sri Lankans will live free or in fear, with impunity and grotesque abuse of power by a single family and its henchmen.
It is viewed by many that this forthcoming Local Government elections, which is three weeks away is more than a regional contest to capture political ground within urban and municipal precincts. It is an old regimes first real attempt to recapture power and restore the old, corrupt and dictatorial order.
Incumbency fatigue and the monumental challenges ahead of Sri Lanka, as the country strives to march towards sustainable peace and prosperity, weighs heavily on the January 8 constituency and the representatives elected to serve them. Disillusioned by the road ahead, which seems fraught with difficulty and the potential for lost opportunity, this constituency may waver, Minister Samaraweera said.
But, I believe it is important to try and build on what has already been achieved and keep the window open for peace and change. I believe it is important to have a long memory. I believe it is important to be long-sighted and clear-headed about the monumental choice facing all Sri Lankans in this crucial election, he said.
The Minister reminisced of a time when protesting for clean water was a crime, when marching for press freedom meant putting your life on the line and voicing dissent was met with dire consequences, many of these notions are so easily forgotten.
We need to ask ourselves, where all the white vans have gone. Where have the grease yakas gone
We must question why the Governments political critics and dissidents are not being thrown in jail. Why media organizations are not attacked and burned any longer. Why journalists are not being abducted or killed. Remember the night races  the gift of an indulgent father who wielded all the power of his presidential office to ensure his sons could have a good time Remember the time when young men paid with their lives for the crime of being a rugby rival Remember when an incompetent brother in law to the President ran the national airline to the ground
Remember how it was impossible to speak openly about the excesses of the ruling family except in hushed whispers not so long ago he asked.
While these are basic freedoms that citizens in any functioning democracy should take for granted, he added that it must not be forgotten that there is a profound co-relation between the end of this tyranny imposed upon the citizenry and the fall of the Rajapaksa regime in 2015. And it is this culture of extravagance, abuse of state property and state terror that is trying to make a comeback in the February 10th local government election, the Minister said.
He added that electoral in-roads made in this poll could be used to attempt to recapture national control in future elections.
The elections can and will have national consequences that could reverberate for years to come, casting long shadows over the lives of Sri Lankans who have begun to live unfettered and free again today. Yes, perhaps we are not where we hoped to be by this time. But we will get there. Change is incremental, political systems are entrenched and sometimes immovable; but the will to change remains as strong as ever. He said in a statement. On February 10th the people will have to choose once more  will we continue the march to freedom or herald a return to fear

Female LG candidates attacked countrywide
The Women Action Network (WAN) has condemned the attacks faced by female candidates during the run up to the Local Government Elections.
Highlighting specific incidents, they stated, A woman candidate involved in election campaigning activities in Wellawaya in the Monaragala District was admitted to the hospital after being brutally attacked. In Arayampathy Selvanagar in the Eastern Province, a woman candidates house and the contents inside were damaged. A woman candidate in Puthukkudiyiruppu in the Mullaitivu District was physically assaulted, kept locked in a house, and asked to withdraw the complaint she made to the Police.
Women candidates in Puttalam and other districts have been verbally humiliated by religious leaders and their families and have been subjected to revolting comments. Vulgar comments on women candidates and disgusting opinions on their race and religion are increasingly being shared in social networks and circulated leaflets.
Further, they observed that video clips of Moulavis Niyas Siddiqi Siraj and Murshid Abbasi verbally attacking Muslim woman candidates and their family members in a disgusting manner for their recent campaign speeches in Puttalam have gone viral in social media. The Moulavis preached their own opinions, for example, Men can never be administered by women, and Women are only for performing household duties and to look after their husbands and children. They cast these as teachings from Quran in their degradative speeches and used words that violate human dignity such as, Husbands and family members of these woman candidates should be ashamed of them.
Thus far, no political party or independent group has condemned such speeches and nor has any action been taken against such religious leaders.
They also observed that many incidents of physical and psychological assaults on woman candidates not been reported to the Police or the Election Commission are being reported through womens organisations and activists.
In 2016, a 25 percent mandatory quota for women in Sri Lankan local government was passed into law. This creates the possibility of a minimum number of 1,991 women from 341 local councils becoming locally elected members.
Thus far, female representation is 5.3 percent in Parliament, 4 percent in provincial councils and 1.9 percent in local councils.
Violence against women is a key factor in preventing their political participation. Ethnic, religious, and cultural barriers, along with structural violence, persecution, sexual bribery, physical assault, threats to family members, financial pressures, warnings and threats from religious heads, vandalized media reports, humiliation in social networks, and open public challenges from people with patriarchal attitudes are what prevent women from participating in politics, said WAN further.
The Women Action Network reiterated that the 25 percent mandatory quota for women in local government should not only be nominal. It must be an obligation for the present government, the President, and the electoral structures.

Lest he forgets
Former minister, and, chairman of the pohottuwa party, Prof. G. L. Peiris has in recent times demonstrated a visceral hatred towards the UNP, of whose government he was at one time a Cabinet minister. In a wide ranging interview with our weekend publication, the Sunday Observer, the former law professor, in effect, says his party would not touch the SLFP, of which government, too, he was once a minister, with a barge pole, so long as it is in alliance with the UNP. According to him it is the pohottuwa which is the standard bearer of the SLFP policies of the Bandaranaikes. By joining hands with the UNP, the SLFP had contaminated itself. It (the SLFP) can redeem itself by only severing its links with the UNP, in which event, they, of the pohottuwa, would favourably consider a realignment with the former.
Going further, he queries as to how could the SLFP remain in a UNP led government which is bent on selling national assets. He said it was the SLFP, or, SLFP led governments which embarked on nationalization, and, goes onto recall the nationalization of transport, and, the Land Reforms of Sirima Bandaranaike. Going one step further, Peiris says, it was Mahinda Rajapaksa who got back the national carrier from Emirates.
Here, the learned professor is being economical with the truth. The acquisition was made out of sheer pique, after Emirates refused to accommodate Rajapaksa and his jumbo delegation, who were in transit, in London, after offloading passengers in the Business Class.
Peiris, who abhors everything that is UNP, was very much a key player in the sale of national assets under both, UNP and SLFP governments. He was a minister in the Chandrika government in 1994, which rolled back the inward looking policies of the SLFP and embraced the market economy of the UNP, where privatization, an euphemism for the sale of state ventures, in the red, was an integral part. One of the first things CBK did was bring down the Shell Company which, Mrs Bandaranaike, who is today spoken with reverence by Peiris for her nationalization spree, showed the door, in her first stint as Prime Minister, in the early sixties.CBK also famously said that while she was a good socialist in the past she would now endeavour to be good capitalist and pledged to give a human face to the open economy, whatever that meant, a system which embraces privatization as a cornerstone of the economic policy.
Peiris, who, today accuses the UNP of selling national assets, and, brings this up as the main reason the pohottuwa will have no truck with the SLFP (for being the other half of government led by the UNP), did not so much make even a token protest when CBK embarked on her privation venture, even outdoing the Greens. Nay, Peiris acquiesced with the whole process and as Deputy Finance Minister introduced the necessary laws and financial regulations to facilitate the privatization programme which entailed, part, or, wholesale disposal of national assets which were a burden on the economy.
This doublespeak by Peiris is akin to his selloff talk pertaining to the proposed new constitution. G. L. Peiris who is waxing eloquent about the government acting at the behest of the Tamil diaspora and western powers, had no qualms when he led a government delegation to world capitals to hold peace talks with the LTTE, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Anton Balasingham, Thamilselvan, Pulitheevan, Karuna Amman et al. Peiris it was, as the leader of the government delegation, who agreed to a federal structure and to effect the necessary constitutional amendments towards this end.
This was not too difficult a task for Peiris, who, only in the preceding year, as Constitutional Affairs Minister in the CBK government, in alliance with the likes of Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam, crafted, what came to be known as the packajaya, where the country was to be divided into a Union of Regions, which was all but federalism in name. The draft of that constitution was made a bonfire in parliament by the UNP, but not before frantic efforts being made by the government to buy over Opposition MPs, all of which was fair game for the respected academic.
In the interview, Peiris, predicting a landslide victory for the pohottuwa, at the LG polls, says that a split in the SLFP vote would not matter at all, so overwhelming is the support for Mahinda Rajapaksa. If he only he went back to recent history of electoral politics in this country Peiris would be more circumspect. The balance of power always had swung between the two main actors and there is no reason to believe it would be any different this time around. Vijaya Kumaratunga was at the zenith of his popularity when he broke away from the SLFP, with wife Chandrika, to form the Mahajana Pakshaya which came a cropper at the electoral test. The same fate befell the Lalith Gamini duo, whose efforts to create a third force ended in failure. Ditto for Rukman Senanayake. Crowds at election rallies do not tell a tale. If that were so, MR would still be President.

Library  from abandoned books
A library in Ankara gives new meaning to the notion that books are timeless.
Garbage collectors in the Turkish capital have opened a public library comprised entirely of books once destined for the landfills.
For months, the garbage men gathered forsaken books. As word of the collection spread, residents also began donating books directly.
Initially, the books were only for employees and their families to borrow. But as the collection grew and interest spread throughout the community, the library was eventually opened to the public in September of last year.
We started to discuss the idea of creating a library from these books. And when everyone supported it, this project happened, said ankaya Mayor Alper Tasdelen, whose local government oversaw the opening of the library. Today, the library has over 6,000 books ranging from literature to nonfiction. There is also a popular kids section with comic books and an entire section for scientific research. Books in English and French are also available for bilingual visitors.
The library is housed in a previously vacant brick factory at the sanitation department headquarters. With an aged brick faade and long corridors, the space was ideal for a library.
Books are loaned out on a two-week basis, which can be extended if needed, according to state media.
On one hand, there were those who were leaving these books on the streets. On the other hand others were looking for these books, Tasdelen said.
The collection grew so large the library now loans the salvaged books to schools, educational programs, and even prisons.
Village schoolteachers from all over Turkey are requesting books, Tasdelen said. The city government also hired a full-time employee to manage the library.
The library is often filled with children of municipal employees and students from nearby schools. There is also a lounge area for readers and chess boards for visitors. The library is especially popular with cyclists who bike in the nearby valley and break for a quick read and cup of tea.
Before, I wished that I had a library in my house. Now we have a library here, Serhat Baytemur, a 32-year-old garbage collector, told state media.

## Title: Liquidating  corruption
## Supertitle:

Liquidating  corruption
Liquidating bribery, corruption and misuse of public property has become a hot topic in the political discourse taking place in the country, particularly in the local government election campaign.
But where are the culprits The Government says they are in the Joint Opposition. According to the latter, however, the Government is a den of thieves. Similarly, within the Government the two principal partners  the SLFP and the UNP blame each other for harbouring corrupt members and condoning corruption. Though there are no corruption allegations against the JVP and the TNA, the Joint Opposition accuses them of collaborating with the Government and hence indirectly being responsible for it. Thus, every political party seems to be corrupt.
On the other hand, no political party acknowledges that there are corrupt individuals in their parties or at least in their leaderships. They present an appearance of moral excellence. Those who are facing allegations of corruption are bold enough to challenge the accusers: Prove, if you can, they counter-charge. Incidentally none of them have filed any legal action against the accusers claiming compensation for defamation.
However, the whole issue exploded in the face of the Government with the exposure of the Central Bank Bond issue revealing the silhouettes of culprits. The Government has been forced to act. In consequence, the COPE inquiries and the Presidential Commission of Inquiry were initiated, both of which confirmed a fraud. The report has been sent to the Attorney General as well as to the Bribery authorities.
Presidential Commission of Inquiry Report
The Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry is now in the public domain with startling revelations. In a parallel development, the Commission investigating Allegations of Bribery and Corruption has completed 34 investigations and handed over its report to the Attorney-General for legal action. It is said that there are several politicians named as defendants.
We have arrived at a critical juncture today. People are eagerly waiting for the Government to expeditiously bring the culprits to book. In fact, they demand so in unison. On numerous occasions since the report was handed over to him President Sirisena has declared war against corruption.
He has vowed to liquidate corruption before he retires from office. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has also expressed similar sentiments. Good! But people await actions. However, the experience of the past three years does not give us confidence that words would be translated into actions. Forgive us Sirs, for our ignorance and skepticism. We cannot help it.
The Presidential Commission has noted that similar frauds have taken place in the Central Bank during the period 2008  14 too. This shows that corruption and fraud has been a widespread and long standing problem in our society. It has been the experience of the man in the street even before these revelations. Corruption has spread both laterally and vertically. It is so widespread that it has almost become a way of life, an accepted norm in many spheres of activity. Life is tainted with corruption from birth to death, beginning with false residential address registrations of the new born to seek a better schooling for the child.
Not only politicians but also high officials in the public service and state corporations also are guilty of corruption and fraud. Often both these categories work in tandem. There are certain government departments and ministries notorious for corruption and fraud. e.g., Customs, Police, Education and Justice. The private sector cannot be excluded. Often it is the origin or instigator of corruption. The cooperative sector is also not innocent.
Foreign investors
There are certain persons who say that a little corruption is tolerable so long as there is development. Such was the thinking of former President J R Jayewardene who said let the robber barons come inviting foreign investors. There is no limit to corruption once it affecting society for it is a part of the insatiable lust for profits which drives capitalist entrepreneurs. This reminds us of the oft quoted remark of English writer of the 19th Century T J Dunning which said: With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent will ensure its employment anywhere, 20 per cent certainly would produce eagerness, 50 per cent positive audacity, 100 per cent will make it ready to trample on all human laws, 300 per cent and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged.
Is it possible to liquidate corruption and fraud by punishing the culprits in the Bond issue It would be nave to believe so. However, it would have a deterrent effect on would be offenders.
Corruption and fraud arise not necessarily and inevitably from the misconduct of individuals. They arise from objective and subjective conditions in society. As mentioned earlier, the capitalist system based on the drive for profit engenders corruption. Added to it is the moral degeneration that has taken place with it. The prevalence of considerable corruption in almost all capitalist countries including the United States proves it practically.
Zero tolerance for corruption
In developing countries such as Sri Lanka corruption is endemic since limited resources are to be shared among a relatively large population. As a result the poor and the marginalized communities and individuals get discriminated with wealth and poverty being concentrated at opposite poles of the social ladder.
The inadequacy of the legal framework is another reason for the culprits to be at large. Added to it is the breakdown of the Rule of Law. Review and revision of existing laws, including election law as well as updating administrative procedures to be in line with modern standards also will contribute to preventing or reducing instances of corruption.
The ultimate goal of a society with zero tolerance for corruption could emerge only with a social system based on socialist principles where common good will prevail over personal greed.

ICC Under 19 World Cup
Madushanka century guides  Sri Lanka to Plate final
CHRISTCHURCH, Thursday - Up until today, Zimbabwes tournament had followed a set pattern  good against the Associates, awful against the Full Members, with 10- and seven-wicket wins against Papua New Guinea and Namibia bookending losses by the same margins against India and Australia, with the African side making a combined 288/20 across both games.
And when they lost their first wicket without scoring against Sri Lanka after just four balls, it appeared the pattern would continue. But although they lost today, it was a much-improved performance, with Sri Lanka made to work hard for their eventual five-wicket victory in the ICC Under 19 World Cup Plate semi-final played at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval here.
After that early setback, Zimbabwe rallied to put on 259/4 thanks to a trio of contrasting half-centuries from their top five.
The first came from opener Donald Mlambo, who, after facing his first ball with his side already one down, decided to drop anchor and provide some ballast for his side. It wasnt quick, and it was rarely pretty, but it was exactly what his was needed to show that the Sri Lankan attack, though capable, wasnt to be feared.
The second and best of the performances was made by Jayden Schadendorf, whose 74 was equal parts fluent, enterprising, and belligerent and often all at once. It was checkpointed by four sixes, the second of which brought up his fifty, and though he fell caught at fine leg trying to hit a fifth, by then hed done his job. The third came from Milton Shumba, who immediately looked to attack, taking just 45 balls to reach his half-century and providing the late surge which took his side past 250.
The ease with which Zimbabwe built partnerships each time should worry Sri Lanka, with their attack looking largely toothless apart from with the new ball, but they restricted Zimbabwe well enough up at the beginning of the innings to leave them still in with a chance. Even that however seemed to be disappearing when Zimbabwe struck twice within the first seven balls of the innings to reduce Sri Lanka to 4/2, and their prospects shrunk even further when two promising partnerships were cut short.
Sri Lanka were 61/4 and in trouble. But from watching the way Nishan Madushka and Nawanidu Fernando batted, you wouldn't have known. The pair cruised through their 143-run partnership, rotating the strike, taking the boundaries that were on offer, and looking almost entirely untroubled throughout.
There was one moment of danger as Madushka was dropped by Milton Shumba at point when Sri Lanka had less than 150 on the board. A dismissal then would have left the game in the balance, and the drop deflated Zimbabwe. Even the eventual end of the partnership - Fernando holed out to long-on for 68 - brought no respite, Ashen Bandara striking his first ball for four, hardly seeming someone new to the crease. Zimbabwe were better today than they have been. But still Sri Lanka were too good.

Q Can you explain what awards and achievements you had in 2017
A: Kelani Cables won several prestigious awards during 2017. We won the National Quality Gold award conducted by the SLSI for the second time. This was a rare achievement winning the National Quality Gold in 2006 and 2017.Not many companies have won that twice in Sri Lanka and that shows that our quality management system is in place. Then we managed to win the APQO Global Performance Excellence Award 2017 which is a world class award, the highest one can achieve in quality, performance etc; This competition is run on the lines of Malcolm Baldridge criteria and is a very tough competition to win. Kelani Cables PLC was the only Sri Lankan Company to win this prestigious award in 2017.The award ceremony was held in Manila, Philippines in October 2017. Furthermore we also managed to win the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Gold award for the large scale manufacturing category 2017. We also won the B2B Category Gold Award at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2017.
Q How has your brand being accepted by your customers
A: We won the B2B Category Gold award at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2017. This speaks volume of our brand.

Our service levels too have improved over the years winning the confidence of our valued clients.

The investment has given us very good results by way of employee performance, discipline, respect, team work, adherence to company rules and regulations.
Q Your views about the cable manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka- challenges and opportunities
A: The cable industry has grown over the years. A few pioneering companies started 50 plus years ago in a very small beginning has grown to a staggering Rs 18 billion business annually. Today there are approximately 8 cable manufacturers in Sri Lanka. A few companies export Cables and bring in much needed foreign exchange. There are direct and indirect exporters too. The cable industry plays a very vital role in the development of our country in terms of all island power distribution, supplying cables to the construction industry, telecommunication, data transmission, lighting, hospitals and educational institutes.
Q How do you compete especially with sub standards cheap products imported to the country
A: There are also a few substandard products that are imported by some traders and it is certainly a threat to the industry. We continuously lobby with the authorities to clamp heavy import duties to minimize these substandard products coming in to the market.
Q What are the main challenges you face
A: The challenges are to keep abreast with new technology, high speed machinery, and innovative products. Opportunities are plenty for those venturing into the export market as the world cable market is growing annually around 8 to 9 percent. That is a massive market provided one can be very competitive in price, quality, service and delivery.
Q Your stance over impending FTAs
A: Free trade agreements (FTA s) have positive and negative trends. On the positive side there a lot we can learn from countries like China and Singapore. If you look at Chinas population it is 1.4 billion, which is 64 times our population. Thats a huge market. (Our population is approximately 22 million.)
Look at the plus points for instance Singapore with a population of 5.6 million people has one of the best global commerce, financial and transport hubs technologically advanced nation. It is also a city with best investment potential and the third most competitive country and third largest Forex market. Singapore is also the third largest financial center, third largest oil refining and trading center, with the second busiest container handling port. By these trade agreements other than trading we can learn a lot from the highly advanced countries. Other areas we can benefit will be from the advanced manufacturing, rail and road transport, shipping aviation, agriculture and health services. Negative impact will be if products that can be manufactured in Sri Lanka are given approvals to import it certainly will be a threat to the cable industry.
Q How do you view the business climate and export sector in Sri Lanka
A: Opportunities are plenty for those venturing into the export market as the world cable market is growing around 8-9% annually. That is a massive market provided one could be very competitive in price, service, quality and delivery.
Q What trends and innovations are in store at Kelani Cables
A: Where power is concerned we have installed solar panels in one of our factories which is a long term investment and Eco friendly initiative. Innovative products we will be introduced from time to time.
Q what are your capacity and distribution expansion plans
A: Last year we added a highly advanced line. Another two will be installed this year. With regard to distributor expansion we will increase our distribution and dealer network on a continuous basis depending on business needs.
Q Do you engage in CSR projects
A: We have two of the finest CSR programs conducted as public private partnerships which we started 10 years ago with the University of Peradeniya Engineering Faculty. Here we train on an average about 35 electrical technicians fully sponsored by Kelani Cables. Traditionally electrical technicians learn from the father, brother, uncle or a friend which is not technically correct. Cables deal with power, people and buildings. If improperly handled it can cause damage to people and property. So we identified that these people must be trained properly and we do not interfere with the administration as the sponsor. The university handpicks from those who pass the entrance examination and at the end of it they have to pass out and it is then that they are given the certificate. About 350 electrical technicians have passed out from both universities Peradeniya and Jaffna. Now there are some who got into the habit of learning because of this opportunity to study in the university environment they took a liking to study and enhance their knowledge. After passing out their earning capacity has gone up and some students have got into the habit of learning again. I know one person in the first batch after finishing his course did the CEI exam and last year he got a top job in Dubai with a six figure salary. That is fulfilling our hearts that we have done a CSR project which is worthwhile, has helped the community and on the other side which avoids calamities like people getting burnt and buildings catching fire. The plus side is there are people after passing out put up their own workshops armed with this certificate and some are doing extremely well. This year another 100 technicians will pass out.
Also the passed out students by forming an Alumni Association have helped during flood situations joining hands with CEB technicians, Kelani Cables and the respective PS people to check the wiring of houses that went under water, by doing the needful and giving the green light to the CEB to restore electricity. The wiring systems of over 400 houses were checked and repaired in Baddegama recently after the floods by the members of the Alumni Association, CEB, Kelani Cables PLC and the respective Pradeshiya Sabhas in a unique CSR program.

Moir students offered  places at Oxford  and Cambridge
Students from Elizabeth Moir School have been offered places at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities this year. These are among the first of what the school expects to be a bumper crop of places at top universities for a class that achieved the best IGCSE results of any international school in the world two years ago. Many students have already been places at other top UK universities such as Imperial College, UCL, LSE and Durham. Students will normally only receive offers from US universities in April, but Akash Gnanam has already been given a place to read Computer Science at Stanford, which is currently 2nd in the world rankings, where he applied for an early decision.
Aanya Gunawansa has been offered a place to study Veterinary Science at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.
It is possible that she may become the first ever Sri Lankan to study to be a vet at Cambridge. Aanya loves animals and has always wanted to be a vet.
She has worked very hard to pursue her dream. She achieved 11 A* grades in her IGCSE examinations and won the World Prize for English Language, the 7th time in 12 years a Moir student had won this award.
Yet, especially for Medicine and Veterinary Science, Oxford and Cambridge look for students with other interests outside the classroom that will help students cope with the very demanding course, and this is where Aanya stood out.
She is currently Girls Basketball Captain and has also won the prestigious awards for Best Artist and Best Actress at the schools annual Art Exhibition and Drama competition. Aanya is especially grateful to her teachers and says: The teachers at Moir are truly remarkable.
They helped me prepare for the test and interview with a dedication that was really inspiringand willingly sacrificed their time during lunches and after school to ensure that I understood all these new topics.
Anjali Attygalle has been accepted to read Chemistry at Magdalen College, Oxford, one of the universitys largest, most beautiful and most prestigious colleges, whose alumni include Cardinal Wolsey, Oscar Wilde and the physicist Erwin Schrdinger.
Anjali joined Elizabeth Moir School in the 6th Form from Musaeus College. As well as earning A* grades in Maths and Chemistry and As in Physics and Biology in her A Level examinations, Anjali was able to benefit from the other opportunities open to her at the school. She was a member of the schools award-winning Choir and chosen as Art Club President in her final year. Anjali pays particular credit to the school as, even though she applied after graduating and was based in the USA, the school still provided support and advice on my application.
One reason Moir students university applications stand out and they receive offers from top universities is the school internship programme, which enables all students to do work experience related to their intended career. "Internships broaden students horizons by providing practical experience of what they learn in the classroom and offer clear evidence of candidates interest in their chosen course," says school Principal Elizabeth Moir in a press release.
Anjalis application was enhanced by the experience she gained assisting with research on Bombardier beetles in the Department of Entomology at the University of California, Berkeley.
Aanya volunteered at veterinary hospitals in Colombo for two years running as well as working on a project to estimate animal numbers in Sri Lanka, finding astonishing evidence of leopards living in populated areas of the country."

A special non-communicable disease (NCD) awareness meeting and free medical camp for the members of the public was held at the Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital, recently. Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital Medical Officer-in-Charge Dr. K. M. Aslam organized the programme.
Members of the public including children and youths, made use of the medical facilities offered by the camp. Ayurvedic doctors Farwin Mohideen, Fasmina Aroos, I. L. Abdul Hai, and S. M. Rizhad participated.
Society should take measures to protect itself from non-communicable diseases, especially considering eating habits. It was recorded that around 20 percent of the worlds population is affected by NCDs. By 2020, it would be double the number, Dr. Aslam said. We do not pay sufficient attention to food, and due to the lack of physical exercise, people are suffering from diabetes, paralysis, hypertension and other heart diseases. In Sri Lanka, the NCD death rate has risen by 65 percent, he further said.

Paint box view of  Sri Lanka
Whenever Robert Sedgley is asked at which age he decided to become an artist, he usually replies that all children paint, but most stop when they become adults; he just carried on. All creativity, Sedgley avers, is dependent on play to realise an object of worth. To make is to be human, and play is at the very essence of what it is to be a maker.
He and Jean first came to Sri Lanka in 1996 and it was love at first sight. From there they made visits to Galle, Nuwara Eliya, Sigiriya, Dambulla cave temples and the ancient city of Polonnaruwa; making his first studies of this exotic country, charmed by the temples and the astonishing green hillsides of the highland tea estates. On a two day trip to Colombo a chance meeting with the artist S. H. Sarath led to his first exhibition, two years later, in the Artists Studio. A small exhibition of around twenty studies of buildings and temples, which was well reviewed in the papers, and opened by the then British High Commissioner, Linda Duffield, culminated in an interview on a television chat show and inspired many exhibitions since then and now an incredibly exciting book with the most amazing collection for paintings from his travels.
Robert Sedgley journey with art started at Junior Art School in Birmingham in the UK from the age of twelve to fifteen; and it was his time there, with its intense ethos of creativity and its sense of the camaraderie and the feeling of being part of a brotherhood, that he himself first realised that there was nothing else that he could do but be an artist. Amongst the subjects he studied there was lettering, and it is from this intense study of the forms, proportions and spacing of Roman letters that, he asserts, he derives his sense of design and space in his paintings and sculpture. On leaving school he trained as a silkscreen printer, and later worked as a poster writer, meanwhile attending evening classes in life drawing, portraiture and sculpture. Then, after some six years working at these trades, on the advice of a friend, he decided to retrain as a teacher. Following a degree level course at Birmingham and Exeter colleges of art, and a postgraduate study at Leicester Polytechnic, he worked in and headed the Art Departments of several Hertfordshire schools. A permanent move to a small village in Spain led to a lightening of his pallet and more colour in his landscape work.
Robert Sedgley next exhibition, From Holy Sites to Humble Dwellings, at the Sri Lankan Institute of Architects in 2001; where he showed a range of pictures, contrasting building styles in Spain, France, Italy, Uganda and Sri Lanka. Inspired by another journey, this time by a train ride from Kandy to the high, mountain town of Haputale, and utilising methods of mark making first developed in his Road and Bridge watercolours, this series of abstracted landscapes extend the techniques of brush and layered colour.
A visit to this exhibition by Barbara Sansoni led to exhibitions in the next two years at the renowned Barefoot Gallery in Bambalapitiya, Streetlevel and Trading Places. An extract from his Artists Statement for these exhibitions sums up the philosophy of his art in regard to his images of Sri Lankan buildings and sites:
My paintings of street life are quite objective. A process of selection and elimination goes on but basically I paint what is there.
My subject is buildings, old or modern, but normally with some aspect of age or decay. However, I do not paint romantic ruins; to me there is no romanticism in decay, dirt and degeneration. The noise, ugliness and squalor of urban life repels me, but I am also drawn to it as a subject (the conventional beautiful view has no interest for me as a painter.)
Architecture has been described as frozen music and that is another of its attractions for me. So I conceive my paintings as musical analogies. The whole takes on a symphonic appearance.
A painting needs time to tell its story, like a novel or piece of music. A painting doesnt move or make a noise, and these are its attractions. There is a temptation to take it in at a glance and move on to the next. Paintings in a gallery should be islands of tranquillity; they need a quiet mind to allow them to reveal their secrets. I spend many hours with these pictures, allowing them to grow and develop into their maturity - so my hope is that the spectator will spend at least a few minutes with each one.
It was a conversation with Barbaras son, the photographer Dominic Sansoni, that led to the idea of producing a book, which would be designed as a visual record of a journey around the island, with pencil notes of the artists impressions and experiences, and backed up with a scholarly text on the history and short articles on the most important buildings and sites. The work of many subsequent visits, Travels With a Paintbox, produced by Serendipity Publishing, is the result. In a book which is not only a personal reminiscence of his travels but also a useful travel guide, the artist presents around two hundred new drawings and paintings, with the text by Doctor KP Paranavitana, and a forward by the late professor Ashley Halp.
Robert Sedgley has thus built a strong career and following in Sri Lanka, with some nine exhibitions.
Inspired by his interest in Eastern religions, he is currently engaged on a large complex and detailed painting with a modern take, entitled The Age of Kali. According to Hindu tradition we are under the sway of this destructive goddess, which carries within the seeds of ultimate regeneration, which will usher in a new Golden Age.
So we see that this is an artist whose interests are wide and sometimes complex, whos work at every level, repays contemplation and thoughtful engagement to release all that it has to offer. Many of his works may be viewed on his website:www.robertsedgley.com

Pathfinder Foundation launches  Samudura Kelambuma
The first copies of the Samudura Kelambuma, the Sinhala translation of Dr. Raja C. Mohans Samudra Manthan: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Indo-Pacific, published by the Pathfinder Foundation ware handed over to a group of former senior diplomats, some of whom had represented Sri Lanka in New Delhi at a ceremony held at Cinnamon Grand.
The chief guest at this event was the High Commissioner of India in Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu.
Speaking at the event Bernard Goonetilleke said that Sri Lankans should be aware of dangers associated with conflicts involving big powers in their neighbourhood and it is for that reason, the Pathfinder Foundation decided to translate Samudra Manthan, so that the local people would have a better understanding of what is going on in their neighbourhood.
Citing a tale from Hindu mythology - Samudra Manthan or Churning the Ocean - Dr. Raja C. Mohan relates the story of Sino-Indian rivalry spilling over from the Great Himalayas into the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
He examines the prospects for mitigating tensions and constructing a stable Indo-Pacific order. The United States of America, the dominant military power in the Indian Ocean region, is being drawn into the unfolding Sino-Indian competition. Despite the huge differences in the current naval capabilities of China, India, and the United States, Dr. Mohan argues that the three countries are locked in a triangular struggle that would eventually mold the future the Indo-Pacific.
The India-Sri Lanka Foundation supported translation of the book and its publication. Dr. Mohan presented the book to former ambassadors G. Wijayasiri, John Gooneratne, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, K Godage, and Ananda Goonesekera as well as to Dr. Pinnawala, who helped edit the book and Sunethra Siriwardena, who translated Samudra Manthan to Sinhala, at the conclusion of the launch.
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Indo-Lanka Initiatives and Centre for Law of the Sea; Luxman Siriwardena, Executive Director, Pathfinder Foundation and Director China-Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre were associated with the book launching event.

Petition against reimposing liquor ban on women filed
Thirteen social activists yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order to suspend the reimpose of liquor ban on women by the gazette notification dated January 18, 2018.
The petitioners cited Finance Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and four others as respondents.
The petitioners stated that a century old laws and gazette notifications were in place and these provisions were a blatant violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the 1978 constitution, which includes the rights to equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex even though it has not challenged at the inception of this regulation.
The petitioners sated that under the new gazette notification, even women cannot consume alcohol at a wedding or any function in a reception hall or a Hotel which is a public place while men are allowed to enjoy as they like which is a clear discrimination under Article 12(2) of the constitution.
The petitioners stated that imposing a new law or regulations under Exercise Ordinance schedule 111 under the Excise Notification 2054-42 of 04/2018 dated on 18/01/2018 is a new discrimination that violates the equality concerns of the constitution and therefore contradict the core values of the constitution where human beings are treated equal manner.

President throws challenge to debate reports before LG polls
President Maitiripala Sirisena yesterday said that those who were demanding to bring the Presidential Commission reports in Parliament ran away from the debate on these reports.
He challenged them to have the debate on the revelations of these reports before the upcoming Local Government election.
Opposition politicians were clamouring for parliamentary debates on these Presidential Commission reports including the report of Central Bank Bond issue until they were tabled in parliament. These while collar thieves have grouped themselves to prevent these reports from being debated in parliament, he said.
These rogues in unison have got the debate on these reports postponed till the end of February.
The President said these rogues will be exposed, once these reports are debated in parliament.
The President was addressing an election rally in Panadura yesterday to ensure the victory of the UPFA candidates vying for the local government bodies in the Kalutara district.
We have begun a national campaign to ensure a clean and corruption free politics for the country. While collar thieves who are against these moves are grouping themselves, he said.

Prevailing arid weather impedes tea harvests
The harvests of the Hinidumpaththuwa and Morawaka Koralaya tea plantations have dropped by 25 percent due to the prevailing arid weather, hence reducing the quantity of tea leaves that is transported to factories, tea planters said.
Tea factory labour work has been restricted and some labourers get work only four days per week. Land owners face difficulties in maintaining their lands as well, they added. If the arid weather continues even further, the produce would fall to 40 percent, tea planters said.

Prima Kottu Mee  Calendar, stepping stone for many models
The 2018 Prima Kottu Mee calendar carries a host of vibrant young personalities who portray the brands ever-young Hot N Spicy image. 12 talented stars were the finalists who stood the tests of talent and social media voting to secure their spots in the Prima Kottu Mee Calendar, which has continued to capture the attention of Sri Lankas youth over the past 5 years with its creative and attractive concepts.
In the past years the calendar has been a platform for young models from across the country to gain limelight through the Prima Kottu Mee Model Hunt. This year, the concept was extended to go beyond modeling and expand to singing and dancing, calling for the youth to Bring out the Star in YOU. The competition was also entirely online driven, in keeping with the trends of the youth, from calling for applications, selection to voting.
The 12 stars identified were; Chathuri Kaushalya, Dilusha Jayasuriya, Dinitha Rathnayake, Hisham Rahuff, Imalka Samarawickrama, Ishara Madhubashini, J. Kisho Kumar, Kaushi Fernando, Lakshitha Peiris, Sachintha Artigala, Udantha Nawarathne and Vinodya Ramachandra. The panel of judges themselves conducted the call for applications via their social media fan pages. Undertaking the hard task of judging were Shehani Wijethunga  model and TV presenter, Teena Shanell  model and actress, along with popular musician Billy Fernando. Shehani herself was one of the winners at the Prima Model Hunt in 2012 and was featured in the Prima Kottu Mee Calendar of the same year, whereas Teena Shanell appeared in the very first Prima Kottu Mee TV Commercial. Billy Fernandos support comes in the form of his partnership with the Prima Kottu Mee brand.Within 1 week of the announcement the organizers received an overwhelming number of applications from across the island from which 100 were shortlisted for an audition. The judges then selected 24 young stars to undergo 1 week of online voting on Facebook out of which the 12-highest voted top liners were chosen to be on the 2018 calendar.
The Prima Kottu Mee Calendar has been the stepping stone for many models who dominate the local modeling industry at present. As a brand speaking out to the youth, it has been instrumental in creating opportunities for these talented young people. The extension to the fields of song and dance this year has broadened the scope for more talent to emerge.
In addition to being featured in the Prima Kottu Mee 2018 calendar, the young idols will appear in Live TV programmes in 3 National Television Channels, and stand a chance to star in Prima Kottu Mee commercials in the future.

## Title: Psychosocial  rehabilitation for war-affected

## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, January 26, 2018 - 01:00
Psychosocial  rehabilitation for war-affected
One of the major consequences of the Lankan civil war has been the internal and external displacement of people. The Tamil Diaspora abroad was estimated to be around one million in 2010, or one quarter of the entire Sri Lankan Tamil population (International Crisis Group, 2010a). Less has been documented of the psychosocial impact on family dynamics by the displacements; separations; death, disappearance or injury to bread winner, leaving high percentage of female headed households.
Whole communities have been uprooted from familiar and traditional ecological contexts such as ways of life, villages, relationships, connectedness, social capital, structures and institutions. These results are termed collective trauma which has resulted in tearing of the social fabric, lack of social cohesion, disconnection, mistrust, hopelessness, dependency, lack of motivation, powerlessness and despondency. Other adverse post war consequences are shown by social parameters such as increased Suicide and Attempted Suicide rates; Gender Based Violence; Child Abuse; indebtedness; multiple partners and youth antisocial behaviour.
The Consultation Task Force (CTF) report of testimonies from a wide variety of ordinary people brings out the widespread psychosocial consequences (CTF, 2017). Result of town hall meetings for the public, focus groups on special subjects, sectorial consultations and individual submission which has a whole section on psychosocial issues (Volume I, section VII part I- pages 359 to 404) and Recommendations which mention need for psychosocial services:
A clear policy on reparations that recognises the right to reparations and a clear set of normative and operational guidelines to give effect to this, should be set out and made public. The right to reparations should be seen as distinct from and in addition to the right to development. The policy should be imaginative and responsive to the various forms of large- scale conflict related and systemic violations that individuals and communities have suffered. It should devise multiple forms of reparations including financial compensation to individuals, families and communities, other material forms of assistance, psychosocial rehabilitation, collective reparations, cultural reparations and symbolic measures.
Conflict affected region
In a similar context in Latin American country, Peru, recommendations were made for psychosocial rehabilitation and health care as part of the reparation in the conflict affected region:
It is difficult to imagine how the specific needs of massive numbers of victims can be addressed if the ability of the state to comply with its obligations is limited and there is a systemic lack of services for all citizens. A reparations policy on psychosocial support to victims needs to be accompanied by an improvement of the health care system in those areas where it is insufficient. This is one of the main challenges of reparations programming in contexts such as Peru, where guarantees of social and economic rights for citizens lag, making it is even more difficult to provide specialized services to individual victims that are distinctly reparative.
Though there has been massive economic investment and infrastructure development post-war (PTF, 2013) in Sri Lanka, these peace dividends have not reached war affected communities, not aiding their economic or psychosocial recovery (Sarvananthan, 2012). Although nationally Sri Lanka achieved middle income status, there is a widening inequality as conflict affected areas in North and East areas remain below the poverty line (World Bank, 2016).
Eight years after the ending of the war, legitimate reparation, community recovery and national reconciliation are yet to take place. Post-war issues causing on-going stress and difficulties for healing and reconciliation are tardy resettlement and return of land; poor regular income, lack of support to return to traditional occupations, few vocational opportunities, continuing militarization, paranoid inter-community relationships, and distrust in state, and non-state institutions and structures (CTF, 2017).
Due to the war, Muslims who were forcefully expelled from the Northern Province showed Common Mental Disorder (CMD) such as Somatoform disorder -14.0%, Anxiety disorder -1.3%, Major depression- 5.1% ,Other Depressive syndromes -7.3%, PTSD- 2.4% and Total CMD -18.8% (Siriwardhana et al, 2013)
The war in Sri Lanka caused changes at the family level in significant ways. The family is the basic structural unit of the Tamil society. The war has demolished this structure due to deaths (vacuum), separations, disturbances in family dynamics, change in the roles (death of father or mother). These effects must be considered in psycho-social rehabilitation for war affected communities.
Community rebuilding
The effects of the war have been identified in the community level too. Whole communities have been uprooted from familiar and traditional ecological contexts such as ways of life, villages, relationships, connectedness, social capital, structures and institutions which has resulted in tearing of the social fabric, lack of social cohesion, disconnection, mistrust, hopelessness, lack of motivation, powerlessness and despondency (Somasundaram, 2010). This has resulted in widespread poverty, lack of initiative and motive to repair, work or earn, to return to pre-war functioning and income generating efforts.
Adverse post-war consequences are shown by social parameters such as increased Suicide and Attempted Suicide rates; Gender Based Violence; Child Abuse; indebtedness; poverty, multiple partners, abysmal educational performances and youth antisocial behaviour (Somasundaram, 2013). Socio-economic rehabilitation, development and growth are essential as a part of community recovery.
Unfortunately, the postwar, martial style of governance did not permit healing rituals such as mourning for dead, community rebuilding or psychosocial programmes (Samarasinghe, 2014). The community and its members need to be able to benefit from the developmental programmes being undertaken.
Economic recovery will not be sufficient; people need to reconstruct communities, re-establishing social norms and values. International law recognizes the Principle of Restitutio ad integrum for the redress of victims of armed conflict to help them reconstitute their destroyed life plan. This justifies the need for rehabilitation as a form of reparation clarified by the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims as taking five forms: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition (UN General Assembly 2005). Rehabilitation should include psychosocial rehabilitation at the individual, family and community levels. In a study after the Tsunami to find out the reason for failure of livelihood support, out of 160 beneficiaries affected by psychosocial problems, 50% were provided psychosocial intervention and livelihood support, rest of 50% were only provided livelihood support without psychosocial intervention.
Psychosocial intervention
After nine months, their improvements were evaluated, 60% with the livelihood support and psychosocial interventions showed very good recovery while 28% were successful at an ordinary level. On the other hand, in participants who received livelihood support without psychosocial intervention, less than 42% had recovered. The important lesson was that implementing livelihood support, the psychosocial problems of the beneficiaries must be dealt properly; then only the success rate of livelihood and development support will be useful to the community. Without psychosocial wellbeing and recovery, implementing livelihood support and development will not bring expected better outcomes.
International development efforts elsewhere in post conflict contexts have increasingly adopted holistic approaches that have included psychosocial recovery and rehabilitation through Training of Trainers (TOT) to widely disseminate basic knowledge and skills to affected populations. In Sri Lanka, the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) has sponsored the first of these efforts. We have embarked on a strategy for post conflict recovery and development based on a public Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) approach. Mixed methods were used to study the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation. Initial findings from the implementation stage are reported.
Literature survey to find best practice for psychosocial recovery and rehabilitation in post war contexts. Qualitative methods including Participant Observation, Key informant interviews of the stakeholders to monitor and reflect; and Participatory Action Research to modify the implementation of psychosocial rehabilitation efforts.
The Government of Sri Lanka established the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) in 2015 to plan and work to achieve national unity and reconciliation. Subsequently, A Task Force on Psycho-social Well-being was set up to address the mental health and psychosocial consequences of the conflict and to develop psychosocial strategies for national reconciliation.
A major proposal put forward by the Task Force was to implement a Training of Trainers in Psychosocial work. For this purpose, the protocol developed by Joop de Jong of the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization, a WHO collaborating centre, working around the world to relieve the psychosocial problems of people affected by internal conflict and war (de Jong, 2002, De Jong, 2011) that one of the authors had the opportunity to implement in Cambodia (Van de Put et al., 1997) and Jaffna (Somasundaram and Jamunanantha, 2002), in which one of the authors was a trainee, was adapted. Government, Non-Governmental workers were to be trained to train government, Non-government and village resources (Core Group volunteers) to address the MHPSS needs of people using individual, family and community level interventions.
Reconciliation processes
The training uses evidence based best practice including psychological first aid, psychoeducation, counselling, family and women empowerment group work, child and youth support and activities; testimonial and narrative methods, ventilation through creative arts and drama; Problem Management, Psychosocial support for Transitional Justice and reconciliation processes.
It also includes traditional methods such as calming techniques, memorialization and healing rituals as well as promoting inherent strengths and resilience factors to rebuild communities through intersectoral collaborations and networking for education, nutrition, livelihoods, income generation, vocational training, legal aid, housing and other facilities.
For long term sustainability and effectiveness, it was felt that the capacity for psychosocial work had to be developed within the state structures and institutions functioning at the ground level, particularly in the war affected areas.
In view of the widespread traumatisation and consequences of the war, affecting large number of the population, the Task Force identified state officers working at the Divisional level as those dealing directly with the public and thus most suitable to target for the psychosocial training. Each divisional level has over 35 categories where graduates are appointed to carry out various grassroot services.

Saegis  Campus   launches  scheme   for less priviledged students
Saegis Campus has stepped forward to lend a helping hand to students from low-income backgrounds to gain the opportunity to enroll for higher educational degrees by launching a special scheme in collaboration with some of the leading Banks in the country .
This scheme constitutes a special fund launched by Saegis Campus that can be utilized by these students to study for a degree that matches their talents and interests. The students will not have to pay for their studies immediately but would instead, utilize the funds offered by Saegis Campus to pay for their degree.
This also means the student will not require to provide any guarantees to the Bank, as the Campus would act as the guarantor for the student. The students would only commence paying for their studies upon completing their degree and gaining employment. Once employed, the student would contribute a particular portion of their salary towards the payment of the degree, over an agreed period of time
Outlining the mission of launching such a scheme, Bandara Dissanayake, Founder and Chairman of Saegis Campus stated It has always been my mission to pay particular attention to gifted and talented students, to identify them and to ensure that their learning needs were are met. It must be remembered that such students deserve to be given every opportunity and support to make the best use of their potential and help them to use their abilities to the betterment of themselves and the organizations they serve. If we aim for high achieving, well-rounded, thoughtful learners to be produced in our country, who are ready and confident to take on new challenges and new opportunities that will lead to new industries and new markets being formed through their entrepreneurial vision or outlook, it will in turn contribute positively towards the betterment of our economy and the business landscape of the country.
Bandara continued With the economy and global marketplace constantly changing, and the cost of higher education continuing to rise, we hope that launching special schemes of this nature, will pave the pathway towards helping our younger generation not to be hampered due to lack of funds to enhance their talents and pursuing the career of their dreams . Therefore, identifying gifted and talented students and giving them the right opportunities in life to have progressive careers will be a continuing voyage that SAEGIS will undertake as a key constituent of our mission.

He said that to mark his birthday every year, he declares a fortnight of welfare and development programmes in Hambantota district, but he was unable to do it this year due to various obstacles.
The Minister said that there were requests from eight schools to provide them with school buses. The request came from teachers, students and parents. He said there were eight buses opposite his Weerawila residence for distribution after the local government elections. Election rules and regulations prevented him from distributing these buses before February 10.The present regime will be in power for three more years; as such people must vote for the ruling parties because it was the ruling parties that could serve the people most during this period.
The minister added that he will try his best to solve the housing problem and provide jobs for the unemployed youth in the district.

SBC wins the CBB Inter School Drama ompetition
St. Bridgets Convent secured the championship of the CBB Drama Competition for the second year running with their colorful and energetic rendition of The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde. The adaptation skilfully edited by the director Malinthi Perera conveyed the essence of the play in a nutshell.
Competing against local and international schools was no easy task especially for an all girls cast competing with mixed casts. Ultimately, it was all down to hard work, prayer and the grace of God.
Having done tragedies and emotionally charged dramas for quite some time now, in the inter school drama scene as well as in their annual productions, they wanted a contrast. Having been finalists at every drama competition they have participated in since 2010, they had many expectations to fulfil and the pressure to choose a suitable play which would enable them to use their talents to the maximum was high. It was a bold leap of faith to pass into the comedic genre but even more of a risk to choose period play. Nevertheless, with many prayers and long discussions they went ahead with an extract from Oscar Wildes hilarious comedy of manners.
The 5th Annual Inter Schools Drama competition organized by the Council for Business with Britain was held last year at the Bishops College Auditorium. 18 schools (including schools from Galle, Kurunegala, Negombo and Wattala) competed.
St Bridgets Convent won the competition for the second time consecutively with their elegant and witty extract from The Importance of Being Ernest by Oscar Wilde. The producer Malinthi Perera has produced two winning plays  in 2016 and 2017. St Bridgets were also Runners Up two times.

Singapore says FTA with Sri Lanka will help both countries
Singapores new free trade agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka is a significant one that marks a new milestone in relations between the two countries, Minister of Trade and Industry (Industry) S Iswaran said on Wednesday (24), the Straits Times reported.

The deal also helps both countries access regional markets, he noted.

For Sri Lanka the opportunity to access the Asean market is important. Their businesses are keen on that, working with Singapore partners. And likewise for our companies, accessing Sri Lanka  but through Sri Lanka, accessing the South Asia market, he said.

Mr Iswaran was speaking to the Singapore media in Colombo a day after the signing of the trade pact.

The FTA guarantees zero tariffs for 80 per cent of product categories for Singapore exports to Sri Lanka. Tariff savings are estimated at S$10 million yearly.

The deal also ensures greater access to Sri Lankas services market and government procurement projects, as well as better protection for Singapore investments.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who witnessed the FTA signing with President Maithripala Sirisena, concludes his three-day visit to Sri Lanka on Wednesday and will fly to Delhi to begin a visit to India, where he will attend the Asean-India Commemorative Summit.

The FTA has raised some concern among Sri Lankan businesses, who felt the trade-offs made by their government in opening up markets were considerable.

Asked what trade-offs Singapore had to make to reach the deal, Mr Iswaran said: I cant really go into specifics, because theres no direct one-for-one tradeoff. You have to look at the trade agreement as a package.

He added: On the whole, I think trade-offs  yes  but I think in terms of our commitment, they have not exceeded what we have, in general, committed to in other agreements.

Turning to the regional trade deal reached by the 11 remaining countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on Tuesday, Mr Iswaran called it a welcome development.

The TPP-11 deal was reached a year after the United States decided to pull out, amid a protectionist tide that has hit the US and other countries.

Mr Iswaran said the deal shows that, despite the growing anti-trade rhetoric around the world, there are still countries that wish to advance economic integration as they see the benefits.

He said the deal is still some way from conclusion as it has to be ratified by each of the 11 countries, but there is reason for optimism.

SLR donates  equipment
Sri Lankan-born Nazoomi Azhar who was born and educated in Sri Lanka (Trinity College Kandy) and currently based in the UK has come forward to work with Sri Lanka Rugby to help less privileged children.
This is the second instance that Nazoomi has been able to supply Sri Lanka Rugby with rugby equipment, clothing, boots etc. Everything was sent to Sri Lanka free of charge with the help of Vdoc, SriLankan Airlines and SOS Kit Aid.
Priyantha Ekanayake, CEO of Sri Lanka Rugby stated that he was delighted with the offer and added that they have promised to keep supplying equipment and clothing to less privileged children and to promote the game in the rural areas.
Currently Sri Lanka Rugby is on a very aggressive plan to take the sport to rural areas and they had a Rugby Awareness Program in the Kuliyapitiya district with over 900 girls and boys attending the event. Some of the clothing was given to these children.
They also donated equipment and rugby boots to Science College Mount Lavinia and also to C.W.W. Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya Colombo and to some of the schools that have been struggling to get sponsors but doing a yeoman service.
Sri Lanka Schools rugby is probably the most popular event in the sports calendar behind international cricket where you attract 3000 to 5000 spectators for a match.
The success of Sri Lanka Cricket was that they are able to take the game to the rural areas and Sri Lanka Rugby are also trying to do something similar on those lines.
Ekanayake also stated that he would like to thank the Sports Ministry, the Minister of Sports and the Director General of Sports for their support and also wanted to personally thank Nazoomi Azhar, SOS Kit Aid, Vdoc and SriLankan Airlines for their magnanimous gesture.

South Korea hospital fire kills at least 37 in Miryang

At least 37 people have been killed and more than 70 injured in a fire at a hospital in South Korea.
The blaze is thought to have started in the emergency room at Sejong Hospital in the south-eastern city of Miryang.
About 200 patients were inside the building and an adjoining nursing home at the time.
It is South Korea's deadliest fire in almost a decade and the death toll is expected to rise with several of the injured in critical condition.
Firefighters said the victims appeared to have died from smoke inhalation. Three hospital medical staff - a doctor, nurse and nursing assistant - are among the victims.
Authorities have given varying death tolls, with police earlier saying 41 had died, but fire officials and hospital sources now say at least 37 are dead.
Miryang is about 270km (168 miles) south-east of the capital, Seoul.
'Falling over and screaming'
The hospital specialised in caring for elderly people with long-term needs, as well as other patients, reported the daily JoongAng Ilbo - and reports suggest many patients would have been too ill or old to escape alone.
The paper quoted a surviving patient, Jang Yeong-jae, as saying that he was on the second floor when nurses screamed "Fire!" in the hallway and urged people to evacuate.
"But when I opened the exit door, the whole stairway was filled with dark smoke and I couldn't see a thing," he said.
"Everybody was running around in panic, falling over and screaming as smoke filled the rooms."
Jang said he ripped open window screens and escaped down a ladder put up by firefighters.
"There were so many elderly patients on other floors... I wonder if they escaped safely," Jang's wife was quoted as saying.
Fire chief Choi Man-woo told reporters the cause of the fire was not yet known.
The hospital building did not have any fire sprinklers installed, local media said.
Under current laws, the building was not required to have sprinklers, but they were in the process of being fitted in the adjoining nursing home.
A new law that is due to come into force on 30 June will make sprinklers compulsory for nursing homes.
Choi said the fire started around 07:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Thursday) and was put out in about three hours.
Ninety-four patients from the adjacent nursing home were safely evacuated.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in arranged an emergency meeting to discuss ways of dealing with the fire.
Senior officials from both governing and opposition parties travelled to Miryang to offer their condolences and call for a thorough investigation.
The hospital has been operating since 2008 and about 35 medical staff work there, according to provincial officials.
The fire comes just a month after29 people in the South Korean city of Jecheon were killedin a blaze at a public gym.
The owner and manager of the building were later arrested over multiple safety lapses, including malfunctioning sprinkler systems.

Sri Lanka key market to Worlds  best low cost airline, AirAsia
Kuala Lumpur based AirAsia Berhad redefined the low cost carrier model in 2001 and has since gone on to be the benchmark for air travel in the world. With its Now everyone can fly tagline, AirAsia has made inroads into Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and India with localized operations and flies to over 130 destinations across 26 countries.
A consistent push to improve operational efficiencies and adopting automation through innovation, like the online booking, self-check-in, self-bag-drop and more, has enabled the airline to offer some of the lowest rates for air travel anywhere in the world with a world-class experience.
In Sri Lanka, the attractive fares and seasonal AirAsia online sale with flight fares from as low as Lankan rupees 9999 all in one ways, has ensured the low cost carrier is top of mind when travelling east. Increasing demand from the local market and the expansion of its network has now prompted the airline to double its frequency into Colombo which now operates a twice daily schedule. We caught up with Spencer Lee, Head of Commercial for AirAsia Berhad for some insights into the airlines operations and plans here.
There is a significant demand for the three to four day holiday package in Sri Lanka and short haul direct flight destinations such as Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong and even the Maldives are popular choices because they require minimum travel time and offer great value for money.
With AirAsia, the Sri Lankan traveller currently has access to a wide network and connectivity across 14 countries in Asia, Australia and even the US, with a total of 41 routes via Kuala Lumpur thanks to our Fly-Thru service. What this offering does is to connect travellers to other flights from Kuala Lumpur with their baggage checked-through to the final destination without the hassle of immigration clearance at the transit hub.
Sri Lanka has a good potential in terms of feeder traffic for travellers that has seen a large portfolio of nationalities flown to and from Sri Lanka, boosted further thanks to the Fly-Thru offering.
Surprisingly, the beauty of Sri Lanka has been well-received from travellers from China as they mark the top nationality flown on AirAsia. This can be attributed to the connection between Sri Lanka and North Asia where the airline links the former to a total of 16 destinations such as Beijing, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan, and more.
Among the travellers flown aside from China, include guests from Asean, Japan, Europe, UK and the US. Not only does the Fly-Thru service contribute to a diverse tourist inflow, more importantly, it also presents opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka to experience the various destinations that we fly to.
We do see the potential of growing Sri Lankas tourism market which is why we are exploring to set up a commercial team to further develop the market here for the year ahead.
For Sri Lanka, now, we are focusing on our existing route, Colombo; however we are always open to expanding our services when the opportunity arises.

Sri Lanka thrash  Bangladesh to reach  tri-nation final
DHAKA, Thursday: Suranga Lakmal led Sri Lankan bowlers on a confidence-boosting rampage to skittle out Bangladesh for 82 on Thursday and guide his side into the final of the Dhaka tri-nation tournament.
Openers Upul Tharanga (39) and Danushka Gunathilaka (35) sped to the target 83 in just 11.5 overs to seal the win for the islanders.
"This is what we're capable of," said Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal as he celebrated the emphatic 10-wicket win that left Zimbabwe in third place in the series and ensured Sri Lanka another match against Bangladesh in Saturday's final.
Sri Lanka had to win to remain in the competition and, coming out of their worst year in international cricket, completed the task in style. Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and opted to bat but soon regretted his move. Mushfiqur Rahim made 26 but Sabbir Rahman was the only other batsman to reach double figures, with just 10 runs.
Lakmal picked up his three wickets -- openers Tamim Iqbal and Anamul Haque, and number five Mahmudullah -- for just 21 runs and knocked out the upper order. Thisara Perera, Dushmantha Chameera and Lakshan Sandakan each claimed two wickets. Bangladesh, who had secured emphatic wins in their past three games, were all out for 82 in 24 overs and clearly stunned.
Gunathilaka, with three sixes and two fours, and Tharanga romped to victory without the loss of a wicket against Bangladesh's lacklustre bowlers.
Chandimal highlighted Sri Lanka's planning for this game.
"We wanted to attack them," said the captain. "We can control when we're fielding. Especially Suranga bowled really well at the start. Upul and Danushka finished it really well."
Bangladesh skipper Mortaza admitted his side had suffered a wake-up call.
"Good thing that our middle order has been exposed," he said. "Hopefully they'll find out their mistakes."
Mortaza said he could not blame the wicket and that Bangladesh should have scored at least 180-200.
"The boys will deliver in the final," he said.

Newcomers to the division one arena St Thomas College Matara with two wickets in hand were 14 runs short of surpassing Trinity's first innings score of 122 when play was called off due to bad light on day one at the Uyanwatta Stadium Matara yesterday.
The Thomians decision to field first paid off when they had Trinity one down for no score. Hasintha Jayasooriya was unfortunate to be run out for 44 and Lahiru Dilshan was rewarded with a five wicket haul.
Trinity bowlers then had the Thomians 69/7 but a 35-run eighth wicket partnership between Kavindu Ridmal (19) and Gishsnthika Jayaweera saw them to 104/8.
Trinity skipper Trewon Percivel captured five wickets conceding only 11 runs off a dozen overs

Steps taken to provide pure  drinking water  Minister Hakeem
"The underground water in the Kalpitiya peninsula contains high concentrations of chemicals and drinking that water has an acute danger of giving birth to disabled or deformed children. There is no alternative for getting pure drinking water in this area. Steps are being taken to desalinate sea water in this area with foreign assistance and provide pure drinking water to the people", said City Planning and Water Supply Minister and the leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Rauff Hakeem.
Minster Hakeem made these observations addressing a meeting held to extend support for the candidates contesting for the Kalpitiya Pradeshiy Sabha under the Tree symbol of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.
Minister Hakeem said that underground water in the Kalpitiya area has become contaminated with various kinds of chemicals. It has reached dangerous levels for human consumption. Since there is a high concentration of Nitrogen in this water, the children given birth to in the area has a bluish complexion.
As there is not sufficient water in the Kala Oya to supply to this area through pipelines, we are in the process of desalinating sea water and supply pure water thereby to the people of Kalpitiya.
The Minister said that the Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka will be brought on a visit to this area for him to make an observation study.
Minister Hakeem said that a large amount of electricity is required for desalination of sea water and therefore steps have been taken to hold discussions with a German Firm to generate more electricity through Wind Power.
He said that funds required to provide pure drinking water through desalination of sea water to people in Jaffna and Kalpitiya have been earmarked and it has been planned to establish a Water Purification Centre close to the Kalpitiya Navy Camp.
The Minister said that in addition to this, a programme has also been launched simultaneously to get necessary assistance to this project.
Steps have also been taken to commence the work of the Puttalam South Water Supply Project.
This project will help to provide safe drinking water to other areas of Puttalam as well.
Minister Hakeem stated that steps will also be taken to provide necessary funds from his Ministry to renovate roads in the Puttalam area.
Since the people of the area have requested from the regional political authority to renovate and develop the Alankuda Hospital, he said that steps will be taken to fulfil this request through the Health Deputy Minister who is a representative of his Party.

## Title: Sustainable  Consumption  Practices (SCP)

Sustainable  Consumption  Practices (SCP)
A business which manages its resources sustainably will last. A consumer who buys a product which is sustainable will ensure that our environment as well as our health is guaranteed. And a country which promotes sustainable production and industry will thrive for generations to come. But the question is how many of our businesses and products are truly sustainable and how do we make the switch
For the average consumer walking into a supermarket, the shelves are filled with products labelled organic or sustainable. But how do we know this for certain How many of them are real How many of them make a difference and how can you tell
To solve this dilemma, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and SWITCH-Asia; a project funded by the European Union to, support the Sri Lankan Government in selecting, adapting and implementing suitable economic and regulatory policy instruments to promote sustainable consumption policies, have come together to create an eco-labelling platform in Sri Lanka.
Sustainable Consumption Practices (SCP) is defined as a holistic approach to minimize the negative environmental impacts from consumption and production systems while promoting quality of life for all (UNEP,2011). Sitting in a packed conference room, the Ministry as well as SWITCH Asia recently brought together various stakeholders in government and private sector, to outline how this can be done.
Fake labels
Over the years we have become more environmentally conscious and as a result, companies have come up with various false environmental claims for their products, said National Expert SWITCH-Asia Sustainable Consumption & Production, National Policy Support Consumption, Dr. Lalith Senaweera.
This ploy employed by companies to sell their products is called Green Washing, he added.
But when done properly, eco labels are given to products that pass ecofriendly criteria laid down by government, associations, standards bodies or certification bodies. The criteria utilize extensive research based on the product's life cycle impact on the environment. Hence such products are significantly less harmful to the environment than similar products.
Products with eco labels allow consumers to use their purchasing power as a tool to protect the environment whilst also providing the manufacturer with the opportunity to develop his/her product and make it more sustainable.
Dr Senaweera pointed out that eco labelling with ISO Standards will ensure that the consumer is only being given valid purchasing information, without any greenwashing. This applies whether the claim is made through a seal of approval type of system, or in a claim made by manufacturer.
Sri Lanka has 18 active eco labels at present and they can be categorized unto two groups; system based (which has 10 labels) and product based (with eight labels).
Some examples of system based labels include: The Cleaner & Greener program which promotes the reporting and offsetting of emissions by companies, organizations, buildings, events and transportation fleets; Earth check and Green Globe Standard for travel and tourism, The Forest Stewardship Council, The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Naturland Association for Organic Agriculture, the Sustainable furnishing Council for home furnishing, Fairtrade, The GREENSL labelling system of Green Building Council Sri Lanka (GBCSL) to ensure that construction related greener products and Energy Star for electrical appliances with better energy use. According to Dr Senaweera, the Export and Development Board (EDB) has also recently established a National Organic Control Unit which would function as the monitoring and controlling body in Sri Lanka for exports, imports, traders, processing and certification of organic products.
The Project 
At present however, apart from the EDBs unit, there is no central body to regulate and issue eco labels in the country. Hence the SWITCH Asia project which will end in 2019 worked to ensure that: National Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Policy and Organizational Set-up are strengthened; Sustainable Production (SP) Framework is strengthened and SCP Principles are applied in selected sectors; Sustainable Consumption (SC) Framework is strengthened and Sustainable Procurement Policy and Eco-labelling; Knowledge on SCP is enhanced and awareness is raised among public/private sectors and civil society; Information Management Data Base on selecting, adopting and implementing suitable economic and regulatory policy instruments to promote SCP is developed; Long-term Sustainability of consumption and production patterns are ensured.
At present they have completed the formulation of the draft national policy on SCP; standardization of the policy formulation process in Sri Lanka; decided to focus on introducing SCP to the three sub sectors of tea, rice and dairy and have conducted baseline surveys on it and a consumer survey on SCP.
Secretary to the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayake added that they were also looking to introducing SCP concepts at the primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors in order to further normalize the concept among the general public. Further the government and SWITCH Asia are working on introducing sustainable public procurement into the government system, setting up an eco-labelling platform, creating an SCP knowledge database and e-learning platform, preparing a funding proposal for the 10,000 Green Villages programme and increasing awareness and capacity building on SCP.
The biggest project will be the setting up of the eco labelling platform by the end of 2018, said, Key Expert SWITCH-Asia Sustainable Consumption & Production, National Policy Support Consumption, Eng. Gamini Senanayake.
International Experience 
The project has also looked at best practices from abroad and International Expert on SCP, Sonal Parasnis making a presentation on the subject noted that most countries used Type I voluntary schemes to get manufacturers to switch to eco labelling. They also use third party verification practices for their labels to ensure credibility.
Having a government body monitor the whole process she said also helped give the program the necessary push and backing during the implementation phase. No country however has introduced SCP to the food industry, added Parasnis because it is difficult to conduct a life cycle analysis on food, It is hard to complete the cycle with food as it is hard to track at the consumer end, she said.
The Sri Lankan government however, has indicated that they are ready to take up the challenge in introducing SCP into the food sector.
Implementation
The SWITCH Asia team has recommended that Sri Lanka go with a fully accredited platform for Type I multi-attribute label in line with the guiding principles of ISO 14024, said Dr Senaweera.
Once the overall SCP Policy for Sri Lanka is adopted, the SWITCH Asia team has recommended the following framework be set up to implement, regulate and issue eco labels to manufactures in Sri Lanka.
This framework will be guided by the overall SCP policy that will be implemented by the Apex Body which is the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment (owner of the scheme). This will then direct the Execution Body; Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) to issue labels. The SLSIs labels would be accredited by Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) whilst the eco labels prior to issuing would be approved by Multi stakeholder Committee with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Industry Associations, Consumer Bodies, Sri Lanka Standards Institution, etc.
Further SLAB will work with other testing bodies in their accreditation process and the team recommended that the testing capability of testing laboratories namely ITI, SLSI, NERD and SLSEA be further improved to conduct life cycle analysis of products. A multifaceted technical committee has also been proposed so that they can choose the kind of products that need eco labelling and report them to SLSI.
This scheme shall be an internationally recognized scheme and hence should become a GEN member, said Dr Senaweera. The Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is an international non-profit association of third-party, environmental performance recognition, certification and labelling organisations. This, Dr Senaweera said would help get Sri Lankas eco label greater recognition. Those countries will accept Sri Lankas eco label and Sri Lanka in turn will also accept those countries eco labels, he said. Senanayake further added that the National Cleaner Production was going to introduce a pilot eco label to test the system out so that they can further learn and improve the system.
As the present SWITCH program ends, another SWITCH 2 program will come into effect, he said and added that this would allow the platform to be further strengthened and allow industries to be supported during the transition period.
Possible Issues
Aitken Spence PLC, Consultant for Social and Environmental Management, Ravi de Silva pointed out that these systems would help businesses cut down their own waste and introduce better management systems in their companies but awareness of such practices was not being highlighted through the current framework.
He further highlighted that labels were costly and certifiers expensive, thus it was important to have local certifiers who would dole out the same system.
De Silva asked that the government step in to provide concessions or tax breaks for companies trying to adopt eco labelling, This should be state policy as it benefits all, he said.
Greater consumer awareness he said would also help in making the labels more successful.
A representative from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research also pointed out that most laboratories were not accredited as it was voluntary and thus, this would affect the credibility of labelling scheme. She asked that legal provisions be brought in to ensure that laboratories testing the labels, have to be accredited. She also proposed that the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research also be included as an Apex body along with the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry so that they can ensure better implementation.
Dr Senaweera further noted that as most schemes around the world were voluntary and this too would be such, it was important to first convince industrialists of its importance when implementing it, otherwise you have them lobbying against it and reversing policy, he said.
Government Policy 
Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Director Environmental Planning and Economics, Deepal C. Siribaddana speaking on the initiative said, over the years several isolated and ad hoc green initiatives have been taken. But the Ministry of Environment at present was looking to create a network of all these green initiatives, from eco labelling green procurement and green awards so that there was a streamlined process for all, and each would benefit from the other.
The Multi stakeholder Committee in this eco labelling framework is the most important initiative for us here, he added. He further observed that eco labelling was not only important for exporters but also for imports coming into the country,
Whether we give them concessions or not, exporters will go for it because it is their market. But we must think of imports too, this is for our own people, we must get the best goods into the country, he said.
The Director asked that the labelling initiative also build from what we already have and submit a proper plan to cabinet, This is an ongoing process and we have to go step by step. If we can get a proper system and way forward, we can calculate our funds accordingly it is not a big deal. We are looking at the big picture. Siribaddana addressing the private sector said the government was prepared to meet the deficits in terms of any costs, during the initial phases of switching to more sustainable production methods.
The government in the long term will save in terms of health costs, he said.
The President is our subject minister so we have the support from the highest level. This is not going to be compartmentalized, we are happy to work across sectors, added Siribaddana touching on working with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research.
To start with the food sector however would be a challenge and Sri Lanka would be the first country to try, But we are ready to take it up, we will try, said Siribaddana.

Ten food habits,  the yoga way
At an age where one is expected to work dedicatedly, we often end up compromising with our health. While many people would agree that a good fitness regime helps keep such risks at bay, it may just not be good enough. Choosing and following a good and healthy diet can help you there. Even with a stressful lifestyle, one can minimize the risks by choosing the right food to eat.
Even though there is no set guideline to follow, a general idea of do's and donts can do wonders.
1. See what you are eating
Observe your present diet. What is it that you eat more Are you consuming too many calories in your diet and don't have enough time to burn them Then you should probably consider eating something that is less fattening and easy for your body to digest. A couple of minutes spent doing basic yoga postures will help you burn those extra calories.
2. Choose green leafy vegetables
Make sure to add green leafy vegetables to your diet. They are a rich source of proteins, iron, calcium and fiber. Green leafy vegetables are easy to prepare and quite appetizing too. Also, a short course in Ayurvedic cooking will help expand your menu.
3. Know when to drink water
We all remember studying during school phase that our body is 70% water. It is essential that the body receives its much needed daily dose of minerals through water. Drinking plenty of water helps detoxify the body as well as gives you a glowing skin. Although, we should avoid drinking water during meals as it slows down the digestion process. It is advisable to have water 30 minutes before or after having your food.
4. Include enough proteins in your diet
Proteins are vital for the body and should definitely be included in the diet. Broccoli, soybeans, lentils, asparagus and spinach are some commonly found protein rich foods. Low-fat dairy products are also a rich source of proteins. Insure that your body receives the required amount of proteins daily.
5. Chew your food
Have you seen cow chew their food A cow chews its food at least 40-60 times.
One of the easiest and obvious ways to digest food is to chew it. Most people often eat their food in a hurry and tend to skip chewing their food properly. While what you eat eventually does get digested, but a barely chewed morsel takes more time and tires your digestive system. Besides, the more you chew your food, the easier it becomes for your stomach to digest it and the more calories you burn moving those jaws.
6. Keep away from fast-food and soft-drinks
Although it may appease your taste buds, fast-food usually does a lot of harm to the body. It can be unhygienic and also high on unhealthy fats like trans-fats. Also, carbonated soft drinks have a high sugar content which may lead to obesity, diabetes and dental caries. Instead of these harmful drinks, choose to refresh yourself with a glass of buttermilk or lemonade.
7. Cook at home
Instead of ordering pizza from the joint around the corner, use your kitchen and make that dish you've been planning on having. You may also prepare your dinner in olive oil rather than sunflower or groundnut oil and make it healthier. Cooking at home is a very good investment as it lets you spend more quality time with your family.
8. Focus on your food
Most of us have our food while texting on the mobile phones or watching television and dont really keep a count on how much we eat. Though your stomach might be full, your brain tells you that you need to eat more and you eventually end up over-eating. If you focus only on your food then youll eat only as much as your body requires. So, the next time you sit down for having your meal keep the remote control and mobile phone away for some time.
9. Never skip your breakfast
Breakfast is perhaps the most important meal of the day as the body prepares itself for the whole day ahead. Make sure you eat a wholesome and rich breakfast before you step out of the house.
10. Digest your food better
While knowing what to eat and how much to eat is important, it always helps if you can boost the process of digestion. Sitting in Vajrasna (Adamintine Pose) for a few minutes after having food helps you there. This particular yogic posture enhances blood circulation in the lower abdomen and improves the digestive process.
A good food habit helps shape your personality. And this is why ancient sages always preferred consuming sattvic food. Learn here what wonders sattvic food can do for you.
A balanced diet helps keep the body fit and active. Yoga combined with good food habits can make you become more energetic, dedicated and focused person in all spheres of life. To learn more how yoga can enhance your life, find out more about the Sri Sri Yoga course here.
Remember, what you eat is what you become. So choose wisely and eat better.

Tiniest inhabited island
Earths tiniest inhabited island is known as Just Enough Room Island for a reason - its barely the size of a tennis court.
Despite measuring in at a minuscule 3,300 square feet, the mini-rock has enough room for a cramped cottage, a tree and a pair of deck chairs.
Once known as Hub Island, the land - marooned off Alexandria Bay in New York state - was purchased in 1950 by the wealthy Sizelands family. But their plans for a cozy holiday home backfired when tourists flocked to ogle the cottage.
The speck of land squeezes a house and a couple of wrought-iron benches pushed hard up against the shingles onto its banks, wrote the Washington Posts Andrea Sachs in 2010. One misstep and youre swimming.
The outpost just about counts as part of the Thousand Islands archipelago as its not only above the level of the river year-round, but can sustain two trees or shrubs.
The island is one of 1,864 tiny patches of land poking out of the St. Lawrence River, which separates New York from Ontario, Canada.
The tiny island is about half the size of Bishop Rock, which the Guinness Book of World Records claimed was the worlds smallest inhabited island.
But it lost its crown in 1982 after the islands lighthouse became automated, so there was no need for humans to man it.

Trump plan to offer citizenship to 1.8m undocumented immigrants

The White House has outlined an immigration plan for nearly two 1million people to become US citizens in exchange for funding for a controversial border wall with Mexico.
The framework was suggested by a senior Trump aide, ahead of legislative negotiations with Democrats.
The proposed bill, to be unveiled on Monday, requests $25bn (17.6bn) in funds for a wall on the Mexican border.
The Democrats, who oppose funding for the wall, have criticised the plan.
What is the plan 
The details emerged in a conference call on Thursday between White House policy chief Stephen Miller and Republican congressional aides, according to US media.
Miller reportedly described the White House plan as a "dramatic concession".
The blueprint sets out a 10-12-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million people.
This includes some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who illegally entered the US as children and were protected from deportation under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca).
The other 1.1 million would be immigrants who did not apply for Daca but are eligible for the scheme.
The White House framework also seeks to end two other initiatives often criticised by President Donald Trump.
It proposes to curtail so-called chain migration, permitting US residents only to get visas for their spouse and children, not for extended family members.
The White House also wants to scrap the diversity visa lottery, under which 50,000 people from around the world every year win Green Cards at random.
What's the reaction 
Republican US Senator Tom Cotton, one of the most conservative voices on immigration policy, welcomed Trump's plan.
"The president's framework is generous and humane, while also being responsible," the Arkansas senator said in a statement.
Democrats were less impressed. "Dreamers should not be held hostage to President Trump's crusade to tear families apart and waste billions of American tax dollars on an ineffective wall," Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin said in a statement.
New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was also among those tweeting his frustration. United We Dream, a young immigrants' organisation, called the White House plan "a white supremacist ransom note".
Why is Daca important 
Trump cancelled the programme in September and gave Congress a March deadline to come up with a new plan.
The president has so far rejected bipartisan proposals that have been presented to him. Congress' failure to secure a deal on immigration triggered a brief shutdown of the federal government over the weekend.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was optimistic that a deal on immigration would be reached that included keeping the so-called Dreamers in the country.
He added that it was an "incentive" for so-called Dreamers to work hard and "do a great job".
The Republican president has made it clear that in exchange for making a concession to help accomplish a Democratic priority, he wants the party's backing for his signature campaign promise to deliver a border wall. However, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer this week withdrew an offer of funding for Trump's proposed border barrier.

US ready for an attractive UK trade deal
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reinvigorated talk of a free trade deal with the UK following Brexit.
It follows worries that Britains special relationship with the US had cooled.
Mnuchin said Britain would still be at the front of the queue for a bilateral free trade deal following the exit from the European Union.
As soon as the UK is ready we will be prepared to negotiate an attractive trade deal, he told the BBC in Davos.
I asked Mnuchin if the relationship between the US and Britain had become strained after President Donald Trump cancelled a meeting to come to the UK to open the new US embassy in London.
President Trump also criticised Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter after clashing over his retweet of Britain First videos.
Mnuchin said that a positive economic future for Britain was very important to the US, and that America was maintaining full support for the UK over the Brexit issue.
He said the US administration was monitoring the discussions, adding: We want to see a successful transition.
Mnuchin met Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, on Wednesday to discuss Brexit, and he will meet Philip Hammond, the chancellor, later on Thursday.
The US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, said that he had met the British international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, to discuss stronger trade relationships.
He said the UK would be following the US model of having commercial officers based in every embassy to boost economic and business ties. BBC News

Warm welcome to new Chinese Ambassador
As the Sri Lanka  China Friendship Association (SLCFA) President, on behalf of all friends of China in Sri Lanka, I warmly welcome 21st Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan, who presented his credentials to President Maithripala Sirisena a few days back. Since the first Chinese Ambassador arrived here in June, 1957, the SLCFA took the initiative to welcome the Chinese envoys as the pioneer China-friendly organization in Sri Lanka.Ambassador Cheng is here at an important and crucial juncture of the Sri Lanka  China bilateral relations, as today, two countries have now become closer than ever before. During the past six decades of diplomatic relations, Sri Lanka and China have achieved diplomatic wonders. In all international forums, Sri Lanka fought for the One China Policy until Chinas inherited position in the UNO was hounrabley granted in 1971.
When China was economically and diplomatically-isolated, Sri Lanka has always been there to promote the Chinese course. China too has helped Sri Lanka more than any other country in the world to safeguard Sri Lankas territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, and also in the field of economic development.
As China today, is one of the most powerful and richest country in the world, Chinas conscious partnership is needed for Sri Lanka in many internal, regional, and international issues. As Sri Lanka is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic developing country, Chinese example and cooperation would be beneficial for us to develop Sri Lankas social stability. As a small island nation, we would always look forward for our friendship with China to maintain peaceful regional balance. I am confident that Ambassador Cheng, as a senior and an experienced diplomatic officer of the Chinese government, would contribute to further develop bilateral relations to a higher stage.

When LIYANAGE  the boxing  black panther  floored an Euro champ
He was one of Sri Lanka's top class pugilists entering the ring and showing breath taking power, superb footwork, style and throwing punches that could floor opponents. It was as if they were pole axed. That was SUMITH LIYANAGEi in action.
Boxing in the 1960s 70s and 80s was at its pinnacle and it was the era when the sport brought into the spotlight some devastating boxers from the schools, clubs and the services - Police, Air Force, Navy and Army and many clubs. Many were the tournaments held and the interest in boxing was at fever pitch. In the club scene the tournaments that attracted great interest were the Clifford Cup and the Layton Cup and in the schools roped square was the eagerly looked forward to Stubbs Shield.
Star class boxers
That era also produced boxers who were star class and boxed for the country in many international meets and stood up to their more experienced opponents and slugged it toe to toe giving or asking no quarter.Names of those legends that come to mind are the Obeysekeras, Alberts, Handunges, the Bulners, VanCuylenbergs, De Kauwes, Pereiras, Jaroofs, Marzooks, Karunaratnes and Lewkes and the Ekanayakes. Also boxers who sprung up were SUMITH LIYANAGE and Dharmasiri Weerakoon from the Police. This column in going down memory lane of boxing will want start with SUMITH LIYANAGE. Tall, quick coiled like a viper he was a treat to watch when gloved up and fighting any opponent. He schooled at Nalanda and was a versatile sportsman  cricketer, Olympic boxer and pistol shooter.
Sub Inspector
After his schooling he joined the Police as a Sub Inspector and had all the opportunities to further his boxing career which sport was his first love. He kept himself fit as a fiddle and fighting in many local meets and winning earned his slot in the Sri Lanka team to the Rome Olympics in 1960. After excelling in local boxing meets he was an automatic choice to glove for the country and his most cherished and memorable moment was when he was picked to box for the country at the Rome Olympics in 1960.
That Sri Lankan Olympic team comprised  Linus Dias (Captain, athletics  long distance), Maurice Coomaravel, (cycling), Tony Williams (swimming) SUMITH LIYANAGE (Boxing), W.A.Dharmasiri (boxing) and the team manager was Darley Ingleton.
Roped square
It is the dream of every sportsman or woman to sport the Sri Lanka colours at the Olympic Games.
This dream became a reality for LIYANAGE who earned his slot with some excellent success in the roped square.
LIYANAGE took wing confident and believing in himself and his highly talented boxing prowess. Aptly tagged the Black Panther and boxing in the style of that World Boxing Champion Floyd Patterson, LIYANAGE was down to meet the reigning European Featherweight Champion Jerzi Adamsky of Poland. Adamsky being an European champion did not bother LIYANAGE. On the contrary it made him more tough and determined and was confident that he could floor his much hyped opponent.
Lethal punches
After the introductory ceremony ended and when the bell rang, LIYANAGE moved panther-like and circled his opponent not caring about his opponents abilities and fame, began to throw punches that were lethal and stunned his opponent.
LIYANAGE was an expert of landing one-two punches with lightning speed and he did so and with a stunning upper cut that had Adamsky on the canvass. That was a moment of glory for the Lankan.
Buoyed by having the champion down, complacency apparently set in and that moment of ecstasy brought about his downfall because he was not connecting with his usual devastating punches in the rounds that followed and Adamsky who recovered from that early knock down began connecting with his punches that brought him the vital points to finally earn the verdict in his favour.
Boxed beautifully
LIYANAGE who boxed beautifully burst into tears when the verdict was announced because he was so near and yet so far from bringing honour to his country. Every time I run into the Black Panther he recalls that moment when he allowed complacency get the better of him that led to his defeat. He has no regrets but cherishes the moment when he floored the European champion.
LIYANAGE represented Nalanda College boxing in the Stubbs Shield from 1955 to 1957 and won many of his bouts. His coach in school was the clever D.C.A. Wickremasinghe who taught him all the tricks of the boxing trade. The win he achieved against Percy Khatau of India in the tri-nation contest between India, Pakistan and Ceylon as one of his most memorable moments. He also boxed for the country in the South East Asian Boxing championships.
Surprising defeat
One fight in the local arena that LIANAGE remembers well was when he surprisingly lost to police constable Mahagedera. However in a rematch that followed LIYANAGE gained sweet revenge avenging that defeat.
However the most memorable moment LIYANAGE remembers was when he was fortunate to fight in the same ring of the 1960 Olympics which saw the late great Muhammed Ali then known as Cassius Clay fight on which helped him win the gold medal and launch him rocket like to stardom and finally end up as the greatest boxer the world had seen.
LIYANAGE watched Ali boxing and seeing the Kentucky kid in action predicted that one day the handsome Ali would rule and take the boxing world by storm the manner, the style, the dexterity and the superb and stylish and devastating punches he landed on all his opponents to win gold.
Autobiography
Ali reveals in his autobiography that when he was refused entry into a white only restaurant in anger and frustration he threw the gold medal into the Ohio River.
In the police in addition to his prowess LIYANAGE with the gloves he shone in cricket and pistol shooting and went on to win a silver medal in pistol shooting at the World Police Games Adelaide, Australia.
LIYANAGE joined the Police as a Sub Inspector and retired as Deputy Inspector General in 1996. He was easy going, popular and a honest and respected police officer.
After hanging up his gloves he took to administering boxing and served as vice president of the Amateur Boxing Association. He also served as manager of many boxing teams.President Mithripala Sirisena who gives honour where honour is due recently invited all Olympians and presented them with gold coins. The 'BLACK PANTHER' was also a recipient. LIYANAGE was one of best boxers produced by the country and will no doubt remain a SPORTS LEGEND.

Romer joined the development finance organization in October 2016. He will be returning to his post as a professor at New York University, Kim said.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Romer had apologized for a World Bank report titled Doing Business, which he believed included a series of methodological changes aimed to lower Chiles ranking among the worlds economies for business competitiveness. Chiles standing would have been little changed if the changes had not been made.
Romers analysis set off a storm, the paper said. The former director of the World Bank report, Chilean economist August Lopez-Claros, denied that the methodological changes somehow targeted Chile.
