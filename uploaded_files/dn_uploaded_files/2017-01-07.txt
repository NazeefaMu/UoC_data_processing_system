Keep fighting: Schu legacy lives on
It is three years since Michael Schumachers life-changing skiing accident, but his legacy remains undimmed.
The Formula One legend has been credited with helping to lay the foundations for Mercedes three years of dominance which culminated in two world titles for Lewis Hamilton in 2014 and 2015 and a first for Schumachers compatriot Nico Rosberg in 2016.
Former Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn says Schumacher had an important influence on the team, which has also won three consecutive constructor crowns.
The German made a shock decision to come out of retirement to drive for the team in 2010, staying for three seasons before retiring again and being replaced by Hamilton.
Michael, for sure, contributed to the organization and structure that has gone on to achieve success at Mercedes, Brawn, who engineered Schumachers seven world titles with Benetton and Ferrari as the teams technical director, told CNN.
He helped create the success we had at Ferrari and he continued that approach at Mercedes.
According to Brawn, one of Schumachers strengths was that he put in time at the factory working with the backroom team preparing to race.
With his knowledge and maturity, sitting with a group of aerodynamicists or vehicle dynamists or tire people and explaining what was needed was invaluable. He was instrumental in creating the systems that contribute to the success that Mercedes has today, Brawn said.
Schumachers medical status still remains unclear, having suffered serious head injuries in a freak skiing accident on December 29, 2013.
The 47-year-old continues to receive specialist treatment at his home in Switzerland.
His manager Sabine Kehm said in a statement this month: Michaels health is not a public issue, and so we will continue to make no comment in that regard.
The Schumacher family wife Corinna, daughter Gina-Maria (a competitive equestrian rider) and son Mick launched the Keep Fighting initiative before Christmas with the aim of bringing together those inspired by the legendary driver.
It aims to unite the people who are inspired by the career and character of Michael Schumacher, and to encourage them to keep fighting and never give up, the mission statement on the official website announced.
Keep Fighting also aims to spread the positive energy that supporters of Michael have expressed to him and the Schumacher family over so many years, and it seeks to channel this positive energy as a force for good.
There is also another beacon of hope in the Schumacher household as 17-year-old Mick continues to impress in his burgeoning motorsport career.
The teenager finished runner-up in the Italian and German Formula 4 championships with the influential Prema Powerteam. The plan is to step up to Formula 3 in 2017, although that has not yet been confirmed.
Mick posted a photo on Instagram posing with new world champion Rosberg which had the cheeky caption: Big congratulations Nico, also wanted to let you know that I will soon take over that trophy ...
There has been speculation that Mick may eventually join the Mercedes junior driver program which has fast-tracked 2016 F1 rookies Pascal Wehrlein and Esteban Ocon.
Brawn said it would be very special if Mick could eventually graduate to the top tier of motorsport and follow his father into Formula One.
Mick is a lovely guy, Brawn added with a smile. I see Corinna and Mick periodically and weve chatted.
Ive taken an interest in his career and Im a sounding board if they want any advice. When Mick was doing Formula 4 there was some discussion about what teams he should go with.
But I wouldnt make any claim to have made any sizable contribution, apart from supporting when they need it.
Brawn, however, like many of Schumachers global fan base, does continue to keep a close eye on Micks progress.
With Michaels accident, its not only Michael thats suffered, its the family too, he added.
For the family to be achieving what theyve achieved, not only with Mick but with Gina-Maria and her horses, is a testament to the strength of the family and to Corinna.

105-year-old cyclist sets new distance record
He might be 105 years old but there's just no stopping Frenchman Robert Marchand in his pursuit of new cycling records.
The centenarian cyclist, who became vegetarian a month ago, pedaled 22.547 kilometers (14 miles) in 60 minutes at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome outside Paris Wednesday. His distance fell short of the 26.927 kilometers (16.73 miles) he managed in 2014, but is still a new record in the 105-and-above category.
I didn't see the sign for the last 10 minutes, otherwise I could have gone faster, Marchand told BFMTV.
Britain's Sir Bradley Wiggins holds the outright mile record with a distance of 54.526km (33.88 miles).
Marchand, who was persuaded by doctors to take up meat again for the challenge, is 1.50 meters tall and weighs just 50 kilograms but makes up for his slight frame with exceptional physiology.
He is very small but his heart is very big, Professor Veronique Billat, who is a physiologist, told CNN Sport.
His V02 max oxygen consumption is the same as a man of half his age who doesn't do any sports, added Billat, referring to the measure of oxygen uptake.
So he has a great oxygen consumption thanks to an exceptional heart.
Marchand lives alone in his Parisian studio flat but is sustained by optimism as well as laughter and many friends, according to Billat, whose team has been studying the cyclist's efforts since he turned 100.
He was born in 1911 and was a keen cyclist until the age of 22 when his coach told him he would not become a champion because of his size.

Another scalp for Siniakova in Shenzhen
SHENZHEN AFP Jan6, Unseeded Czech tennis player Katerina Siniakova defeated Britain's world number 10 Johanna Konta on Friday to secure a place in the WTA Shenzhen Open final.
Siniakova eliminated second seed Simona Halep earlier in the $750,000 tournament but another upset looked unlikely when Konta raced into a 5-0 first set lead and took it minutes later.
But the world number 52 recovered to level the match. Third seed Konta again took the lead in the decider, but Siniakova won the last four games to triumph 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.
I think she definitely started slower in the match, and me, quite well, Konta said. But all credit to her, she really raised her level in the next two sets.

Aussies push for series clean sweep over Pakistan
SYDNEY: Australia were nine wickets away from a series clean sweep and Pakistan an improbable 410 runs from victory with one day left in the third Test in Sydney on Friday.
Spinner Nathan Lyon grabbed the wicket of debutant opener Sharjeel Khan for 40, caught at mid-wicket, nearing stumps to have Pakistan at 55 for one.
At the close, Pakistan's leading series scorer Azhar Ali was not out 11 with nightwatchman Yasir Shah on three.
Skipper Steve Smith called a halt to Australia's second innings at 241 for two with 16 overs left on the fourth day and the tourists facing the herculean task of scoring 465 for victory.
Usman Khawaja was left unbeaten on 79 off 98 balls and Peter Handscomb was on 40 off 25 balls.
Handscomb finished with a series average of 114.66.
Smith was out in a review after 'Hot Spot' detected a faint edge off his glove and was caught behind off Yasir for 59 off 43 balls to finish the series with 441 runs at 110.25.
David Warner smashed the second fastest 50 in Test history to give Australia a flying start in their chase for runs and a declaration.
The explosive Warner smashed leg-spinner Yasir for six, six, four, four in the fourth over of the innings, and then clouted Imran Khan for four consecutive boundaries in the seventh over.
His breathless half-century came off 23 balls with seven fours and three sixes and was the second fastest in Test history after Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq's 21 balls against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014.
But Warner perished when he missed in a lusty swing and was bowled by Wahab Riaz for 55 off 27 balls.
Younis Khan was left unconquered on 175 as Pakistan lost their last two wickets in an hour's play post-lunch after rain washed out the first session.
Younis was dropped on 141 by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, who got his right glove to the chance but could not cling on, much to bowler Mitchell Starc's annoyance.

BRISBANE AFP Jan6, 2017 : Unseeded Frenchwoman Alize Cornet reached the final of the Brisbane International when Spain's Garbine Muguruza withdrew while trailing 1-4 in the opening set of their last four clash on Friday.
Muguruza, the tournament's fourth seed, had three long matches heading into the semi-final and was on court for more than seven hours.
She called for a trainer after the fifth game but decided she could not continue.
Cornet will play either third seed Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic or sixth seeded Ukrainian Elina Svitolina in Saturday's final.

Cornet to play Pliskova in Brisbane final
BRISBANE AFP Jan: Alize Cornet reached her biggest final in over two years after an exhausted Garbine Muguruza withdrew from their semi-final of the Brisbane International on Friday.
The unseeded Frenchwoman was leading her Spanish opponent 4-1 in the first set when Muguruza decided she couldn't continue.
Although the official reason was a right thigh injury, the fourth seeded Spaniard, who had spent over seven hours on court in her first three rounds, conceded later that she was physically spent.
I just felt, like, a little bit exhausted on the court, and I have been dealing, you know, with tiredness and issues with all these hard matches I have been playing, and today I was far from 100 percent, she said.
Cornet will now play third seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova in the final, the first time the 26-year-old from Nice has reached the decider of a Premier Level tournament since she lost to Venus Williams in Dubai in 2014, after having beaten Serena in the semi-finals. A delighted Cornet said Muguruza's withdrawal had been the perfect result.
When she decided to stop I was a little bit surprised, but you know a little bit of luck never killed anybody, she laughed.
I'm just going to take it. I really enjoy the fact that I'm in the final. It's a big day for me.
I just learned that I'm going to be seeded at the Australian Open because of this match. So it's two bits of good news at the same time. Cornet went into the tournament ranked 41st in the world, but will now climb to 31.
She could go as high as 26 if she wins Saturday's final.
The 26-year-old said earlier in the week she wanted to be more consistent this year and enjoy her tennis.
After winning her semi-final she signed Vive la Vie on the television as a dedication to former French Fed Cup physio Patrick Bordier, who died of a heart attack while working at the Rio Olympics. There is no translation in English. It's like 'enjoy life', she said.

CR-Kandy match should be a thriller
The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between defending champions Kandy Sports Club and the formidable CR and FC in the Dialog A Division League rugby match at Longden Place today should turn out to be a thriller.
A mammoth crowd is expected at kick-off time 4:00 pm to witness this grand game in the 2016/17 League Rugby tournament.
The match should turn out to be a battle between CR's power-packed forwards and Kandy's speedy three quarters. CR's forwards especially seasoned campaigner Supun Warnakulasooriya, skipper Shane Sammandapperuma, Shawqat Lahir, Shemal Weerasekara, Ishan Noor and Omalka Gunaratne have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy.
In the set scrums CR's hooker Warnakulasooriya will have the edge against Kandy's Damith Dissanayake while the line outs should be shared between Kandy's Gayan Ratnayake and Shehan Pathirana and the CR duo of Shemal Weerasekara and Noor.
Kandy's forte has been their speedy three quarters. The halves combination of skipper Roshan Weeraratna and Nigel Ratwatte have to hit it off smoothly as they are playing together their second match for the season. Centres Danushka Ranjan and strongly built Gayan Weeraratne are hard runners who should punch holes in the CR defence with full back Thilina Wijesinghe joining the line to form the overlap.
But the biggest threat to CR will be posed by winger Richard Dharmapala with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Red shirts have to make the maximum use of the good ball that comes their way through their halves combination of brothers Kavindhu and Ashan and they must not delay their passes for their two hard running centres in strongly built Tarinda Ratwatte and Bhanuka Nanayakkara to hit the gaps without being nailed by their opposite numbers.
Also they should come up with a much better display as they have two strong runners in winger Sashan Mohamad while on the open side wing they will have the services of diminutive Kavindhu Perera who has impressed with his sizzling runs in addition to an attacking full back Prince Chamara.
Kandy SC beat CR by 50 points to 29 in the first round game at Nittawela after the scores were deadlock at half time 20-all. Another thriller is on the cards today.
Teams: 

CR&FC (Probable XV): Shane Sammandapperuma (Captain), Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Charana Chamikara, Gayan Jayamanna, Ishan Noor, Shemal Weerasekara, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu de Costa and Ashan de Costa, Sashan Mohamad, Bhanuka Nanayakkara, Tarinda Ratwatte, Kavindu Perera, Prince Chamara, Head Coach: Ben McDougall (Scotland).

Navy go out favourites against Airmen 

The high-riding Navy Sports Club will go out favourites against Air Force Sports Club in their Dialog A Division League return game at Welisara today commencing at 4.00 pm.
The Navy SC played a superb game against Police SC in their last game at Welisara and will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the Airmen with a bonus point victory.
The forte of the Navy side has been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another blockbuster display with skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Sathya Ranatunga, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Sajith Saranga along with ever green flanker Danushka Gertha Perera likely to give off their best.
Meanwhile the unpredictable Air Force lads who nearly turned tables on CR & FC last week at Ratmalana and beat the defending champions Kandy SC in the first round game will try their level best to create a shocking victory against the formidable Sailors.

Electoral College votes Real Voter Population
The ancient Athenians had political equality, not merely through right to vote, but also had a clear opportunity to participate in public policy debates and influence political decisions. Unfortunately, the US voters currently cannot enjoy the basic democratic essences of elections. The US elections do not carry equal representation for their citizens. Recent US Presidential election is not a positive example of democracy but also a major challenge to it.
Former Sectary of State, Hillary Clinton won the 2016 Presidential election by three million votes but lost the White House by 74 Electoral votes. This was the fifth time in the US history, candidate who won the election by so called popular votes and lost the White House. The US is the only country in the world, uses Electoral votes to elect their President over common voters regular ballots, which are called as popular votes. This had happened in 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 US Presidential elections. During the 2000 Presidential election, George W. Bush received 50.46 million votes (47.9 percent) compared to 51 million votes (48.4 percent) for Al Gore. The Democratic Party candidate Al Gore carried 540,000 more votes than his rival candidate but lost the White House by five Electoral votes. This weird, undemocratic scenario had happened again after sixteen years in the 21st century.
The United States Electoral College is a mechanism established by Article Two of the United States Constitution. Representation in the Electoral College is based on population, which is assessed every ten years by the census. Each state receives a minimum of three electoral votes. Additional votes are assigned for each seat a state holds in Congress above that minimum.
This is a cross between how congressional seats are assigned in the House of Representatives, where they are divided according to the population with a minimum of one per state, and the Senate, where each state is represented equally by two Senators. Each US state carries two Senate seats despite their populations. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming are the seven least populated States, which represent 4.8 million voters. They enjoy fourteen US Senate seats while Minnesota, which represents 4.9 million voters, just has only two US Senate seats!
Electoral vote system
The founding fathers didn't unanimously agree on the Electoral vote system. There were sharp divisions on this weird vote system. According to Records of the Federal Convention, James Madison and significant numbers of delegates were in favour of popular vote to elect the US President over Electoral College mechanism. However, Electoral College mechanism was used as a bribe for nationalist Southerners. James Madison stated as the right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States, and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed, on the whole, to be liable to the fewest objections. During last two hundred years, more than 700 constitution amendments were presented to the US Congress to amend or abolished the Electoral College mechanism because this voting system has been violating basic equal representation in the democracy is defined as one person, one vote,. However not a single amendment was successful.
Because of the Electoral College system, Presidential elections campaigns are mostly focused on swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin and Ohio. Most states in the US are neglected during the presidential election cycles and swing states voters get significant attention over the rest of the other voters. In addition small states are having a prominence under current Electoral College system and there votes are more powerful than other states. This is a clear unequal representation.
Professor Benjamin Bolinger, who authored a research article Abolishing the Electoral College on International Social Science Review, stated that states with small populations control a disproportionate number of electoral votes compared to those with large populations. According to the 2000 census, California's population was 33, 871,648 giving it fifty five electoral votes and Wyoming, the least populous state, had only 493,782 residents, earning three electoral votes. California gets one electoral vote per 615, 848 residents; Wyoming receives one electoral vote per 165,594 residents. That is approximately 4 to 1 ration advantage of Wyoming. Not only Wyoming but also Vermont, North Dakota also have voter advantage over Texas and Florid respectively. Professor Bolinger further stated When the votes of some citizens count more than others, America has failed to honour its commitment to equal representation.
Equality in voter power
Famous mathematicians and game theoreticians like William H. Riker, I. Mann, L.S. Shapley, and John F. Banzhaf III vigorously studied about correlations on Electoral and popular votes. In 1968, John F. Banzhaf III generated a formula called voter power, which was a function of (1) the probability that a citizen's vote could change a state's votes for a given candidate, and (2) the probability the state's electoral votes could decide the outcome of the national election.
John F. Banzhaf III, who authored a research article One Man, 3.312 Votes: A mathematical analysis of the Election College on Villanova Law Review, proved that voter in New York state had 3.312 times more ability to affect Presidential election than the least powerful state. He concluded his research paper the current Electoral College system falls short of even and approximation of equality in voter power. Another mathematician S. Merrill further developed Banzhaf's voter power model and presented a research paper Citizen Voter power under the Electoral College: A Stochastic model based on state voting patterns on SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, in 1978. He also proved that different states had different voter power on Electoral College system. This was a gross violation of equal representation in democracy is defined as one person, one vote, which means every citizen's vote has an equal value.
More equal representation is necessary to strength the democratic elections in the US. To achieve this target, Electoral College votes system should be abolished and popular vote should be introduced.
The Electoral College vote's allocation does not represent the real voter population. If real voter population represent on the last Presidential election, Hillary Clinton will take office as the 45th President of the United States.

Some A division clubs have written to the controlling body SLRFU stating that rugby needs good knowledgeable referees. Discussions are underway to get down international referees for key second round matches of the ongoing Dialog A division league tournament.
Most of the cubs it is learnt are not happy with the refereeing during the current season.
Today, most of the problems at matches are due to the poor standard of refereeing.
The game is fast developing with most of the schools and clubs playing at the highest level and encouraging their players. The schools in the urban and rural areas too have taken up the game. The drawback of this fine game is in the refereeing.

Frustration as fixing scandal hits ahead of Aussie Open
SYDNEY AFP Jan6,A match-fixing charge in Australia has underlined concerns about corruption in tennis ahead of the year's opening Grand Slam, with top players frustrated at another scandal hitting the sport.
Police said an 18-year-old had been charged with match-fixing at a tournament in Victoria last October and would appear in court in March.
Australian media Friday named him as Oliver Anderson, an emerging star who is the reigning Australian Open boys champion.
The claim, just days before the world's leading players assemble in Melbourne for the first Grand Slam of the season, related to a first-round match at the second-tier Traralgon Challenger event.
World number one Andy Murray, playing in the Qatar Open in Doha, said he had read about the case and that although he did not want to comment on the specifics, corruption must be tackled.
It's disappointing for the game any time something like that comes out, said Murray.
However, if people are caught and charged, I see that as being a positive thing.
If it's going on and nothing is happening about it that's much worse for the future of the sport.
So, if it's happening, there should be the most severe punishments for whoever is involved in it. He was backed by rival Novak Djokovic, also in Doha, who said he was saddened by the news.
Very disappointing to hear, especially considering the fact that he's young and won the junior Grand Slam, said Djokovic.
You know, obviously the quality is there and the potential is there.
I don't understand why he has done it, he said, before adding: Everyone makes mistakes. Fourteen-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal said the latest police case showed the fight against match-fixing was working.
You get tired about this kind of stuff, but the most important thing is (to) fight against these kind of things, he told reporters at the Brisbane International tournament.
And he is young. That's even the worst part. - 'Zero tolerance' - On the eve of the Australian Open last year, there were bombshell media allegations that match-fixing was rife in tennis and the authorities had done little to counter corruption.
They included claims that players who had reached the top 50 had been repeatedly suspected of fixing matches but had never faced action.
It sparked an independent review headed by Adam Lewis QC, a London-based expert on sports law, aimed at shaking up tennis's under-fire anti-corruption body, the Tennis Integrity Unit.
In the wake of the revelations, Australian tennis authorities boosted measures to fight corruption.
They included having anti-corruption officers at all sanctioned events, a block on accessing gambling websites via public wifi at tournaments, and bolstering its National Integrity Unit.
Ann West, head of the integrity unit, said much had been done to address the problem since the scandal broke last year.
My first reaction was disappointment, to be honest. Whilst we understand that we'll always fight the battle I would have anticipated the message was getting out there, she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
We're realists, we have to continue and will increase our education opportunities with our players, she added. We have zero tolerance to match-fixing. That's our mantra. Neil Paterson, assistant commissioner of Victoria Police, said targeting match-fixers and illegal betting was a key focus of authorities heading into the Australian Open which gets under way on January 16.
Match-fixing is one of the fastest growing organised crime types across the world at the present time, he warned.

Govt reduces tax on imported rice
The government decided to reduce tax on imported rice with effect from midnight yesterday.
This decision was taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living which met at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
The Committee comprises Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Special Task Force Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Badiudin. The soaring price of rice in the current market was discussed at the meeting.
Customs duty of Rs.50, 15 percent VAT, 7.5 percent Port and Airport Levy and two percent Nation Building Tax per kilogram of rice have been removed. However, a special commodity levy of Rs. 15 per kilogram of imported rice will be imposed.
This will be effective from midnight. Taxes have been reduced for rice varieties such as Samba, Nadu and Brown raw rice. However, tax reduction is not applicable to imported Basmati.
The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living took this decision as a measure to bring relief to the people.
Rice prices have increased due to the prevailing dry weather in the country. This will prevent s traders who hoarded rice stocks and created an artificial shortage in the market to exploit the consumers.

Kandy Sports Club who got off to a flying start in the second round of the Dialog A division rugby league with a grand 50 points victory over Army Sports Club will be on show in Colombo, when they play CR & FC at Longden Place today at 4 pm. Both teams are unbeaten in the second round and a blockbuster of a game is in store for Colombo's rugby fans. When these two teams played in the first leg match at Nittawela, the hill country club defeated the Red shirts. The side which plays the better rugby should come out winners. Fitness has been Kandy SC's forte this season. Another advantage is that the white shirts have suitable replacements for all players save for skipper Roshan Weeraratne who has been the mainstay in the side. The Red shirts are sparing no pain or efforts to win this one. They have been through a kind of training that would not be ideal for this game and the excitement is just electric. Kandy SC's pre-match mood is a happy one with all the players in peak form. The CR & FC side too should be able to address in the same manner in their home territory. The Red shirts are likely to find most of their problems coming from up-front where Kandy has shown tremendous fire. The CR & FC work up-front will not be only confining the virile young pack of the opponents, but in showing the area where Kandy SC's attack is sharpest. CR & FC has a good back division, for them it is going to be a hard evening's work.

Luck of the draw
The dispute between the Government authorities including the two lotteries boards and the lottery sellers (agents) has been resolved temporarily with the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena. The dispute arose as a result of the Governments decision to increase the price of a lottery ticket to Rs.30 from Rs.20 in line with a Budget 2017 proposal without essentially making any changes in the commission structure for lottery agents. It is still not clear whether the price hike will be effected, but the familiar jackpot today cry of lottery agents, amplified by megaphone, will be heard again countrywide from today. A note to sellers, though: can you turn down the cacophony, please
Lotteries are run in virtually all countries today, either by Governments themselves or by approved private operators. Lotteries are used a means of generating additional revenue for Governments. Lotteries are first believed to have been held in China around 200 BC, but lotteries in their present form originated around 1400 in Belgium and Netherlands. The Dutch state-owned Staatsloterij is the oldest running lottery in the world. In fact, the English word lottery is derived from the Dutch noun Lot meaning fate.
The history of lotteries in Sri Lanka runs almost to the year of independence. The lottery was initially set up by the Sri Lankan Government to finance the health services. In 1949, the Minister of Local Government proposed to the Government to set up a lottery in order to improve and expand the health services. The proposal to establish the Hospital Lotteries Board was initiated under Act. No. 04 of 1955.
In the 1960s, the Government felt the need to widen its scope to cover other development activities. The National Lotteries Board (NLB) was established under the Finance Act No.11of 1963 to generate funds for development. The Development Lotteries Board (DLB) was established in the 1980s with much the same purpose in mind.
According to the National Lotteries Board website, in July - August 2016, the Lotteries Board earned an income of Rs. 10,045,460, but by September, it had decreased to Rs 8,019,216. This is perhaps a reflection of the times, with people placing other day-to-day priorities ahead of a dream jackpot. A price increase will not help under these circumstances, but the two boards can continue the usual practice of pricing special lotteries with very large price structures (Rs.50 million and above) at Rs.50 and Rs.100. But even with diminished sales, lotteries do make a huge contribution to the coffers. Most of the revenue from lottery sales goes to the Presidents Fund, 50 percent of which is allocated for Mahapola scholarships. A certain amount is retained for the prize pool.
One factor that confuses buyers is that there is a bewildering array of lotteries under various names, from Mega Power to Jathika Sampatha. Around five or six draws are held daily, with some lotteries such as Saturday Fortune having several draws weekly. It would be better to consolidate the lotteries to a few well recognized names and widen the price structures. Given that buyers have to beat astronomical odds, even a Rs.100 million jackpot is fine, but there should be a better and bigger spread of the consolation prizes.
There have also been several previous attempts to have a lotto style lottery where the buyer can select the numbers on an electronic terminal, but none has been viable so far. One of the two lotteries boards should step in to fill this void but more awareness should be created on the advantages of this system. For example, you can play the same set of numbers for a few years until you score a win, which is impossible with pre-printed tickets. This is in fact how most lotteries are conducted in other countries, including many developing ones.
Greater transparency is also needed from lottery operations and we do not just mean the telecasts of lottery draws. The public does have the right to know how their lottery money is spent. This is especially so with the Right to Information laws coming in from next month. For example, the Govisetha lottery is intended to help agriculture, but no one knows how much of the income has actually gone to agriculture per year or what kind of projects have been completed with the funds. Such information should be published in the newspapers. Then even the losers (they are in the majority anyway) can take heart in the fact that their money has gone towards a good cause.
The public should also be allowed to submit their ideas for such good causes that can be completed with lottery funds. The UKs National Lottery run by the Camelot Group has pioneered this concept whereby various health, development, educational, cultural and community projects are supported through lottery-generated funds. The possibility of starting such a concept in Sri Lanka should be explored. Most Sri Lankans love to try their luck at the lottery kiosk, but they will be luckier if their money goes for more good causes.

The major challenges of 2017
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe found good cause in keeping with their New Year resolutions of service to the country with the launch of the Sustainable Era for Sri Lanka 2030 earlier this week. The President made this the occasion to a call for all to come together to work towards developing the country, stressing that among the immediate priorities, in addition to social and economic development was reconciliation.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghes related message was to recall that the January 8, 2015 election of the President was on a mandate not only to develop the country economically, but in all aspects. He said the mandate of January 8 was to bring about national unity, reconciliation, ensure political freedom, a new constitution, have transparency, remove corruption and improve the economy of the countrywith all the people reaping the benefits of these.
The Year 2017 comes a century after the Russian Revolution of 1917, which saw significant changes in the socioeconomic trends that prevailed in the world. The dawn of 2017 saw the conclusion of a century that saw major changes in the world, that included the rise of both Capitalism and Communism, the end of one World War that paved the way for the Second World War, a century where colonialism thrived and also saw its steady decline, and the rise of Fascism and its defeat in the West, with an important period of the rise of the Welfare State.
It also saw the fall of Communism after its distortion by Stalinism, the breakdown of the Soviet Union, and a fresh rise of capitalism, with Neo Liberalism moving on to Globalization, which has now led to serious questions about the future trends of Capitalism. It was certainly not the age of the End of History as some western thinkers believed, but has brought out new trends in the rise of populism in the USA and Europe that will have a major impact on global trends in the coming decades.
The challenges here
At the end of such a historically significant century, Sri Lanka just concludes two years since what was known as the Rainbow Revolution that saw the defeat of the Rajapaksa Regime, with all its plans to maintain its authoritarian and corrupt hold on power, and the promise of major social and economic changes in the country, with emphasis on the strengthening of peace, understanding among communities and reconciliation among people, all of which requires a good democracy and respect for the Rule of Law.
What we see today are trends that seek to take the country and people away from those important goals of January 8 and August 2015, and instead move the country backwards to an era of populism based on race and religion, and certainly away from the constitutional changes that are at the core of the search for a better and stronger democracy, improvement in the Rule of Law and a definite fight against corruption. The biggest threat in this situation is the manipulation of popular feeling and thinking against a new constitution, with fanning of the flames of communalism and religious extremism, and increasingly demonstrating the bogey of a divided country through the rise of separatism, which is the incorrect but a convenient description given to Federalism or power sharing.
Coming into focus in the current situation is the growing rivalry within the Coalition of Consensus leading to a government of National Unity that was established after the elections of August 2015. The efforts by the Mahinda Rajapaksa led Joint Opposition (JO) and divisions within the SLFP, the second major partner in the ruling coalition, are certainly issues that calls for action by the leadership of government, if the goal of a Sustainable Era of Growth for Sri Lanka that President Sirisena launched, is to come anywhere near achievement.
Super Moves
The debate over the Super Ministry and the opposition raised to the development efforts in Hambantota, with a full cover up of the huge loans that have been taken from Chinese institutions for a mainly non-functioning, and loss making, Hambantota Port and Mattala International Airport, are among the issues that are being flaunted by those opposed to the necessary democratic and economic changes in the country.
Moving towards the extreme levels of opposition, in a dangerous rise of religious fundamentalism is the move to have the proclamation of an Order by the Buddhist clergy, against the governments activities related to economic development in Hambantota and the South, and thereby relating to the entire country. This is a Super Challenge that calls for clear alignment within government.
What is necessary in this context is to rein in the SLFP sections within the Government that are carrying on a dichotomous political strategy of being pro-SLFP and anti-UNP, in the search of popularity, that will not help achieve the goals of January 8 and August 2016.
The efforts being made to avoid major constitutional changes, which include the abolition of the Executive Presidency, must be challenged with a renewed commitment of government to constitutional changes, which will require peoples endorsement in a referendum should be carried out with renewed commitment.
The Rajapaksa Dream
It is evident that this is the real dream time for Mahinda Rajapaksa with his announcement to foreign correspondents about bringing down this government in 2017. The realities of parliamentary membership, and the huge benefits of ministerial position that SLFPers hold in Government, appear to have missed Rajapaksa, despite the anti-UNP noises made by some big (but defeated) members from the SLFP, who make the most noise today. This is certainly the time to give this dream a touch of realistic awakening, by holding the now much overdue Local Government elections, without further ado, even under prevailing delimitations and electoral laws, if that is legally possible. The more than ridiculous delays in the delimitation process only add to the strength of the Rajapaksa dream, which could impact on peoples thinking.
Giving a good shake to that dream is implementing the promise by the Prime Minister in his briefing to the media on Balagathu Sri Lankava - The Powered Sri Lanka  are certainly necessary to really awaken Rajapaksa and the JO forces, and drive more light to SLFPers toeing their line while in the Government. What the PM said was that we have our countrys strategic location, which is the fastest growing economic location; we could become a centre of communications for shipping, airlines, logistics and business.
The Prime Minister also stated there that with major development projects and a boosting of employment in the South, especially in the Hambantota area, Rajapaksa and his followers will not be able to secure a single seat in the Hambantota election in an election. This is certainly a political exaggeration, but it is timely, and the need is for such development projects to be launched with a determined regularity; to take a new message of development to the people, away from the dangers of racist and religious extremism.
COPE fights corruption
The fight against corruption gets new strength with the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) extending its investigations into the recent controversy on tenders for the supply of coal, which took place even after concerns expressed by the Supreme Court. COPE will also probe an alleged massive scam related to rice imports in 2014/2015. It is understood that he related coal tender had resulted in a loss of Rs. 2,145 million to the Government. The alleged corruption in the import of coal is of important national concern, with the continuing rise in demand for coal imports for power supply.
With regard to rice imports, current Chairman of COPE Sunil Handunnetti had informed Parliament that a staggering amount of Rs 18,597 million had been spent on importing these rice stocks, when there was no shortage of the staple in the country.
The loss incurred was Rs. 2,359 million, while some of these stocks stored for a long time had been declared as animal fodder, when found unsuitable for human consumption. In the context of the current controversy over the issue of rice to millers, and the present cost of rice that is certainly contributing to the cost of living, this probe by COPE is most timely and welcome, as it could be the beginning of further serious inquiries into the supply of the staple food of the people and the support of government to the agricultural sector. It is clear that the best intentions expressed in the New Year resolutions of national leaders will certainly need a major commitment of government for full implementation, with a similar determination to take the country away from the dream world of Rajapaksa politics.

Minister not ready to assess CTFRM recommendation on foreign judges
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said that he was not ready to assess the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTFRM) recommendation to include foreign judges, lawyers, and investigators in the transitional justice mechanism.
I cannot make a statement on the inclusion of foreigners in the reconciliation process right now. I can say that we have communicated our position on the issue to the UN Commission on Human Rights. We are an independent nation that can make the final decisions, Rajapakshe said.
The minister did say, however, that it would be very difficult to include judges in the proceedings under Sri Lankan law.
Under the Constitution, no foreigner can sit as a judge. The recommendations will be difficult to institute because of this, he added.
Rajapakshe also hit back at the idea that those who had suffered abuse during the war had little trust in the judiciary.
No one is complaining about the independence of the judiciary. I have full faith that the Sri Lankan judiciary can handle this important task fairly and professionally, he said.
He also complained that some members of the CTFRM were prejudiced and unfit to be a part of the task force.

Munro belts New Zealand to T20 series win
MOUNT MAUNGANUI AFP Jan6: Colin Munro produced a masterclass of controlled aggression to smash 101 off 54 balls as New Zealand coasted to a 47-run win in the second Twenty20 against Bangladesh on Friday.
The comprehensive victory at Mount Maunganui gave New Zealand an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, and follows their 3-0 sweep of the 50-over matches.
Colin Munro
With Munro in sublime form, hitting seven sixes and as many fours in his whirlwind innings, New Zealand posted a daunting 195-7. Bangladesh in reply were all out for 148 in the 19th over.
Sabbir Rahman and Soumya Sarkar made a bold attempt to run down the target after Bangladesh slumped to 36-3 in the fifth over.
The pair piled on 68 off 40 deliveries, including 21 off a Colin de Grandhomme over before a spectacular collapse in which seven wickets fell for 44 runs.
With Sabbir and Soumya scoring with ease, and the required run rate after 10 overs at 9.3, New Zealand were forced to bring back Trent Boult, their main strike bowler, earlier than expected for his third over.
Boult immediately removed Soumya for 39 and Sabbir fell to Ish Sodhi for 48 to start a slide that saw Bangladesh all out with 11 balls remaining.
Bangladesh, needing to win to keep the series alive, won the toss and opted to bowl first on a ground where the side batting second has traditionally won.
They made the best possible start with opener Luke Ronchi dismissed first ball, but the game was immediately taken away from them when Munro arrived at the crease. Kane Williamson (12) and Corey Anderson (four) did not hang around long but Tom Bruce joined Munro to form the backbone of the innings with a 123-run stand for the fifth wicket in just 67 balls.
Bruce, in only his second international, was unbeaten on 59 at the close of the New Zealand innings.
The third and final match in the series is again at Bay Oval on Sunday, to be followed by Tests in Wellington and Christchurch.

New Turkey attack kills two as Istanbul gunman hunted
TURKEY: A car bombing blamed on Kurdish militants rocked the Turkish city of Izmir on Thursday, killing at least two people and triggering a deadly shootout as authorities chased the fugitive killer behind the New Year attack in Istanbul.
The new attack intensified alarm in Turkey after the shooting rampage at Istanbul's Reina nightclub unleashed shortly after revellers rang in 2017, which killed 39 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group. Just four days after the nightclub carnage, a car bomb exploded outside a courthouse in the Aegean city of Izmir, with authorities blaming the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
A policeman and a court worker, reportedly a bailiff, were killed, Deputy Prime Minister Veysel Kaynak told reporters. Police battled "terrorists" in a clash which saw two militants killed. Another escaped, he added.
The state-run Anadolu news agency said two suspects had been detained but it was not clear if they included the pursued militant. It added that security forces carried out a controlled explosion on a vehicle that the attackers may have been looking to use as a getaway car. The usually peaceful port city, Turkey's third largest metropolis, is the gateway to the plush beach resorts of the Aegean and rarely sees violence on this scale. It is well west of the PKK's main theatre in southeastern Turkey. Izmir governor Erol Ayyildiz said initial evidence suggested the PKK -- which has fought a deadly insurgency for over three decades -- was behind the attack.
He said the slain policeman tried to stop the car before it exploded and the "terrorists" then sought to escape as the charge was detonated, triggering the gunfight. Up to seven people were wounded, Ayyildiz added. Officials praised policeman Fethi Sekin as a hero for preventing a far higher toll by stopping the car and then chasing down the attackers. "Our brave martyred policeman prevented an even greater disaster from happening," said Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.
Reports said that two Kalashnikovs, seven rockets and eight grenades were seized, indicating the attackers may have planned a rampage inside the court complex.
In a statement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that Turkey would not allow terror to "strike fear into the nation and polarise society".
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he was saddened that Turkey "within just a few days has again become victim of an attack".
Turkish authorities meanwhile were seeking to close in on the Istanbul club attacker, who slipped into the night after spraying 120 bullets at terrified partygoers celebrating New Year. Of the 39 dead, 27 were foreigners including citizens from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iraq and Morocco. Kaynak said the attacker was likely a Turkic Uighur and reports have indicated the authorities are looking into the possible existence of a cell, also including other jihadists from Central Asia.
Most Uighurs, an eastern Turkic group, live in the Xinjiang region of China, although there are also significant populations in ex-Soviet Central Asian states.
IS took responsibility for the massacre in a statement on Monday, the first time it has issued a clear and undisputed claim for a major attack inside Turkey.
Kaynak told A-Haber television that airports had taken measures to ensure the killer did not flee Turkey and Dogan news agency reported that authorities had tightened land borders.
"The security forces are aware of who the terrorist is. We are also aware of the probable place where he might be," Kaynak added, without giving further details.

No barrier for JO to rejoin SLFP  SP Chief Minister
Joint Opposition members have no obstacles or been prohibited from rejoining the SLFP as they are followers of the party policy and vision, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
Disclosing the partys plain for the upcoming Local Government elections, de Silva said the SLFP will contest all Local Government bodies throughout the country at the upcoming polls.
The Joint Opposition is a dissident fraction of the SLFP. Hence, they can at any time return to the party under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, as they also follow the same political doctrine and policy, he said.
At present there is only a conceptual tussle within the party. It is not a splitting up of the party. President Sirisena is concerned over party unity. He is ready to do anything to uphold the unity of the party, the Chief Minster said.
He firmly believes that the partys forward move and strength depend on the unity among party circles. There is no barrier for anyone to rejoin the party under his leadership, the Chief Minister said.
He said although the SLFP is a party to the Unity government, it has the right to take its own political decisions as an independent political party.
We are one of the two biggest political movements of the country. We take our political decisions according to our party policies and vision which would in no way be detrimental to the concept of the National Unity government, he said.

Outstanding jurist and a peacemaker
Judge Weeramantry is no longer with us. He passed away in the eve of January 5. Perhaps, he felt the 90th year of his birth, after serving humanity for so long, was the right time to bid farewell. But those of us who knew him dearly and cherished every second with him, know that it was not enough. But the world order is given and this is the reality. His departure to the heavens will be guided by angels with soothing songs. Let us say goodbye to the greatest man of peace in our time, by recollecting some of his great work for humanity.
Judge Weeramantry was, undoubtedly, one of the most distinguished and outstanding jurists in the world. His judgments and opinions, international publications and lectures, and keynote addresses given at eminent foray, in Sri Lanka and overseas, stand testament to his erudite scholarship and his extraordinary ability to interpret the underlying philosophy of legal principles, congruent with the teachings of global religious and cultural wisdoms. He was the first Judge to bring religious principles and teachings into judgements of the International Court.
Further, Judge Weeramantry, in many of his publications, argued that this notion needed to widen for the peaceful co-existence of all religious and cultural groups. This was important in the Sri Lankan context where all major religions are vibrantly practiced.
At the International Court of Justice, Judge Weeramantry derived obligations and legal principles from religious and cultural wisdoms from throughout the world, and advocated that international adjudication needs to be more aligned globally.
Therefore, he extracted and interpreted these cultural notions in his judgements. In many of his opinions, Judge Weeramantry not only quoted from the rich repositories of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, but also highlighted the traditions and customs of aborigines such as Maoris and Incas.
International Justice
His outstanding contribution to International Justice was recognised by the City of the Hague in 1998, when the City of The Hague celebrated its 750th anniversary. Eighteen areas in which the City excelled over the 750 years were chosen and individuals in these areas were recognised.
Judge Weeramantry was selected as the most Outstanding Person who contributed to International Justice. A booklet was produced on the 18 selected personalities. Judge Weeramantrys works along with others were exhibited for a month at the City Hall. Judge Weeramantry always had a fear and expressed in all his conversations that should a war take place, there will be a rain of nuclear bombs. Needless to say that the world is not strong enough to undergo such devastation and God forbid should that day come!
When the UN General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice for an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, he gave the outstanding dissenting opinion, drawing on major religions and traditions from across the world to condemn nuclear weapons outright, and totally illegal in all circumstances.
His opinion is regarded as a leading exposition of the illegality of nuclear weapons, and its resultant environmental damage to current and future generations for thousands of years to come. It is his authority which is often cited when the illegality and environmental damage caused by nuclear weapons comes up for discussion.
In August 2016, a special session was held in Japan where he was invited to be the chief guest to commemorate the judgement on the use of nuclear weapons; a rare honour indeed.
Modern environmental law
With regards to the environment, Judge Weeramantry has done more than any other jurist to highlight the importance of environmental law as a rapidly developing branch of international law. In the words of Professor Philippe Sands, Global Professor of Law, New York University School of Law: Judge Christopher Weeramantry has made a singular contribution to the development of modern environmental law if international environmental law has been mainstreamed then much of the credit must go to Judge Weeramantry.
Judge Weeramantry has also done outstanding pioneering work on the teachings regarding environment and Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam in the book Tread Lightly on the Earth: Religion, The Environment and the Human Future. In May 2016, he was chosen to deliver the keynote address on the occasion of the 800th year of Magna Cartar - yet another honour. He was also Emeritus Professor of several universities in the world.
Judge Weeramantry has inspired people through religious teachings. He used the deep knowledge he acquired through his judgements and wrote extensively as well. He did two pioneering works on the legal content of Islam and Christianity, referring to the specific teachings relating to trusteeship of the environment, created by the Almighty for human use, on the basis of trusteeship for future generations.
The books: Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective and The Lords Prayer: Bridge to a Better World, are a tribute to this.
US Constitution
He was appointed Chairman of a committee of judges from across the world by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to draft a manual of International Environmental Law for the worlds judges.
This was necessitated by the fact that many judges are now called upon in their domestic jurisdictions to decide matters in the developing area of Environmental Law and often do so without knowledge of the latest developments in International Environmental Law.
The draft has been made available to judges all over the world by UNEP and has greatly advanced in the application of modern Environmental Law in many jurisdictions.
When the United States was celebrating its 200th Anniversary in 1976, a major world congress was held on Equality and Freedom - the underlying themes of the US Constitution.
Three major presentations on equality and freedom were arranged from the stand point of the Western World, The Communist World and the Third World. Out of all the jurists of the Third World, it was Judge Weeramantry who was invited to make the presentation for the Third World.
His speech was serialised in various journals such as The Asiaweek and the Christian Science Monitor, and was described by a reader of Asiaweek of April 15, 1977 as A Magna Carta for the Third World.
Judge Weeramantry has been a pioneer in seeking to prevent the enormous powers of modern science and technology from damaging the environment, now and for generations to come.
Sir Arthur C. Clarke - the outstanding futurist - often described him as the prophet of the space age. In his Foreword to Judge Weeramantrys work on Protecting Human rights in the Age of Technology, he observed: this monumental work deserves a wide readership, because it is concerned with nothing less than the survival of humanity and the necessity of making the right use of the awesome new powers that science and technology has given us...
So I am happy to see that Judge Weeramantry outlines many of the steps that must be taken if we are not to follow the dinosaurs into oblivion.
No more needs to be said to highlight the calibre of this man, (although he had many more achievements), or to establish Judge Weeramantrys pre-eminence as a scholar and jurist.
He is a man who has done his utmost for the sustainable development and protection of the environment for many future generations. Sadly, the world has lost a guiding light.

Police Commission lacks controlling power: Outgoing Chairman
Sri Lankas Independent Police Commission lacks power to control the police force, and the Commission has to seek appropriate powers, says Prof. Siri T. Hettige, who resigned from the chairmanship of the commission recently to take up a teaching assignment at Heidelberg University in Germany for a semester.
Hettige, a Professor of Sociology at the Colombo University, had told the New Indian Express on Friday, that during the first year of the commissions work, there were no problems with the police establishment and the commission was able to formulate and launch several schemes to tone up the quality of policing. But in the second year, cooperation from the police establishment was not forthcoming, he said.
Although personality was a factor, the fault basically lay in structural deficiencies of the commission itself, the professor explained. The commission had written to the Constitutional Council, which appoints the Independent Commissions, to make structural changes to give us independence and control which we presently lack, Hettige said.
The Constitutional Council and the various Independent Commissions were set up under the 19th constitutional amendment in 2015. One aim of the amendment was to free various wings of the government from political meddling in recruitment, disciplinary and other matters and ensure that established norms are followed.
Prof. Hettige made it clear that he has not resigned from the commission as such, and would return as a member after his teaching assignment abroad is over in four months. I resigned the chairmanship as I should not be away for so long, he said.

Presidents decision on Wilpattu will not hamper resettlement process: Badurdeen
Industries Development Minister Rizad Badurdeen said the decision taken by the President relating to the Wilpattu Sanctuary will not hamper the resettlement process of Muslim and Sinhala families, affected by the war.
The Minister refuted the allegations that he had cleaned 17,000 acres of forest to settle Muslim people. War affected Muslim and Sinhala families in the Mannar District are living in their own land. He said he has not violated any rule of the country relating to lands. According to him, the Mannar District Secretary is a Sinhala Buddhist and therefore no one can believe that he allows Muslim people to settle in the district by force.
When the Minister was quested on the issue of the Wilpattu sanctuary, he said the President has understood that the sanctuary had not been destroyed.
He further said most people tend to identify the entire land as the Wilpattu sanctuary. But is is not true and Muslim and Sinhala families are living on the land.
He questioned where were the families chased away by the LTTE during the war period and said they should be settled on their original places. According to him the allegations levelled on him that he is ruing the forest for Muslim settlements are baseless and those allegations are levelled for various political and ethnic gains among others.
He said certain media spreading false propaganda he would quit the government and resign from his ministerial post on the decision taken by the President relating to the Wilpattu sanctuary. He said he has no intention to quit the government, which formed after much effort.

President to take firm decisions on certain critical matters
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he would be taking several firm decisions in the next few years on certain critical matters affecting the country, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said the President intimated this to those present when he visited Minister Mahinda Amaraweeras residence recently.
The minister addressing a press conference at the Presidents House in Fort yesterday said the post January 8 period of this year would be important to the country due to these decisions pending direct implementation.
He said an alms giving to about 1,500 Buddhist monks covering all districts of the country has been organised at Presidents House on Sunday to mark the 118th Anniversary of SLFP Founder and former Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike and the completion of the second year in office of President Sirisena.
We consider this a new beginning. The President reminding us of how high handed his predecessors had been stressed that his approach is different.
He had been democratic enough to allow a group of his party members to work in the Opposition, while another group is working with him in the Government. However the President said the firm decisions he intends to take in the coming few years may hurt some and may lead to misinterpretation, but he was committed to do so in order to fulfill the aspirations of the people who gave him a mandate on January 8 the minister said.
The minister pointed out that the President reminded them that his victory on January 8 was not driven by money or an organised campaign but by a strong public desire for social change.
I am committed to this undertaking and I want your support for that the President had told his confidants.
The minister said nine key programmes including drug eradication, promotion of indigenous agriculture and prevention of kidney disease were spearheaded with the direct supervision of the Presidential Secretariat as of the Presidents aspirations.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister also made it clear that President Sirisena stands by his position that foreign judges are not required for the domestic mechanism to probe human rights violations.
We have faith in our own judges. They have the knowledge and experience to handle these inquiries, he said.
Commenting on the Hambantota Port Agreement, the minister said the President was clear that no agreement would be signed before it was passed through the Cabinet, Parliament and the Attorney General. These issues arose because all the ministers were not adequately briefed on what was going on. The coordination of the two parties needs to be enhanced, he said.

Procurement Authority finds foul play by tender board :Sugathadasa track re-laying tender cancelled
The tender for re-laying of the Sugathadasa synthetic running track has been cancelled by the Procurement Authority after considering the appeal made by a group of rejected tender applicants. The appeal stated that the Sports Ministry tender board has acted partially in favour of the approved candidate and the Procurement Authority has confirmed that the approved company has not fulfilled the required standards and the approval is illegal.
According to the sources violation of tender procedure by the tender board and other controversial issues have been the fundamentals of Procurement Authoritys recommendation to cancel the tender approval.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara pledged his support to the Procurement Authoritys decision, but said he has to present the recommendations to the Cabinet for its consent.
To re-do the tender procedure will take at least six more months and the Sports Minister said that he will make arrangements to minimize the inconvenience to athletes during this period.
The athletic pools for Asian Junior Athletics Championship and World Athletic Championship must be selected before April 28 and the Sports Minister said that he will try to make arrangements to complete the track before May. He also said that he will change the tender board to evade such incidents in the future.
The tender approval was criticized on many allegations among them that the favoured company was categorized as a C3 company which is only allowed to apply for projects below Rs. 300 million whereas this is a Rs. 350 million project.

Sri Lanka Medical Laboratory Technicians Association president Ravi Kumudesh said the laboratory service units of the state sector hospitals have gone up by 30 percent and at present the number of blood tests that are done at private sector due to lack of laboratory facilities in the state sector have gone down.

SLto get back GSP Plus: EDB
Sri Lanka will be given back GSP Plus by May or June. The Export Development Board (EDB) is now in the process of making necessary arrangements for the exporters to supply their production without any delay or trouble once the GSP Plus is back, Chairman and Chief Executive of the EDB Ms. Indira Malwatte said.
Addressing media briefing after opening the new `EDB Info Point' with touch screen at the EDB in Colombo yesterday, she said the Government is working hard on getting GSL Plus back and had already submitted all required documents. The GSP Plus would open up a huge market for Sri Lanka with concessionary rates. Therefore, we are confident that Sri Lanka would get GSP Plus back in another four or five months, she said.
According to Ms. Malwatte, the EDB is working with the small and medium scale garment exporters to upgrade their technology, quality, etc. They will be ready to export their production once the GSP Plus is back. It is possible to export quality Sri Lankan garments to India and China, after signing the Free Trade Agreements (FTA). It is a significant increase of Sri Lankan exports. FTA is to be signed with Singapore too.
The self service interactive information KIOSK would facilitate walk in visitors to obtain information of the EDB services promptly, before meeting an official. The service is available from 8.00 am o 6.00 pm during working days at the NDB - EDB Tower, Ground Floor. The new system provides real time error free data, she said.

State buildings to harness renewable energy
The inaugural ceremony of a national programme to transform State sector buildings into renewable energy centres will be held under the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry on January 9 at 10 am.
The programme will be promoted islandwide under President Maithripala Sirisenas Sustainable Development Initiative and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes Economic Policy Statement.
Sri Lanka has taken the initiative to find solutions to the global energy problem by making proposals through Budget 2017 to the issue.
The dearth of energy sources is a global issue as supply of energy does not meet the increasing demand. Alternative energy sources are introduced amid the increasing demand for energy. The supply has failed to meet the demand. The success of the development agenda of Sri Lanka will depend on the success of harvesting renewable energy.
The country's power generation is 4,000MW. However, the demand for energy will increase up to 5,300MW by 2020 due to development projects. It will rise up to 7,500MW by 2025. Preparing to face the challenge is the responsibility of any farsighted government.
The government has planned to provide financial assistance to households where their monthly electricity bill exceeds Rs.2,000. They will be able to transform their current source of energy into a renewable energy basis under the project. The government will provide a bank loan of Rs.150, 000 per household for the purpose. The government will bear 50 percent of interest for such loans. Rs.1, 500 million has been allocated by Budget 2017 for the project.

Why MS Dhonis place in cricket history is assured
Mahendra Singh Dhoni stepped down as India's limited-overs captain ahead of the upcoming one-day international series against England.
Dhoni was not only a calm captain himself, he was the cause for calmness in others.
He smiled, he showed displeasure, he chatted to bowlers, but while his immediate message was clear, no one could bet on what his thinking was.
To catch the cricket fraternity by surprise twice in two years - first while quitting Test cricket and now when relinquishing captaincy in one-day internationals - is no mean feat.
Dhoni read the one-day game better than he did Test cricket, and was India's finest captain in the shorter formats.
He led India to victory in three tournaments - World Twenty20 (2007), World Cup (2011) and Champions Trophy (2013) - so the record matched his reputation.
He tended to let the longer game drift occasionally, and seemed to feel the pressure of not losing his early Tests, something that might have rendered him more defensive once the streak was broken.
The shorter formats were different.
He could experiment, even gamble, trusting his finely honed sense of time and place to bring him success.
When he handed the ball to rookie Joginder Sharma in the final of the inaugural World T20 a decade ago, there might have been a collective gasp around the country. Yet Sharma claimed the last Pakistan wicket, and as an unintended consequence, the face of cricket was changed forever. The IPL was born as India, Twenty20 deniers became Twenty20 obsessed.
Dhoni, one of the greatest finishers in the modern game, got his timing right once again, pre-empting the inevitable media speculation about his future following the sustained successes of Test skipper Virat Kohli.
Fitness not a problem
The only question to be answered, of course, was whether Dhoni saw himself in the 2019 World Cup team. He would be 39 then, but fitness was unlikely to be the problem. The concern was over the fact that given that India's fixture list is heavy on Test cricket, he might feel rusty with bat in hand.
Already in recent matches, his legendary finishing abilities had let him down occasionally, and there were few chances to get match fit.
This meant that he could not afford failure, and had to make an impact every time he went out to bat. Youngsters like wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant were beginning to look match-ready. It was thus a pragmatic call, to give up the captaincy, focus on batting and try to rediscover the freedom and form that made him one of the greats.
For Dhoni is nothing if not practical
Not for him the romance and layered philosophy of the game; he was simple without being simplistic, straightforward without being naive, and knows his mind best.
These qualities served him well as captain, they serve him well as a person.
The long chat he had with the chairman of selectors, MSK Prasad, during the semi-final of the ongoing domestic Ranji Trophy tournament might have convinced him. Perhaps the decision to step down as the one-day captain was made before the chat.
Dhoni's place in history is assured, and not just as a player and captain. He was leader of a talented group of players which emerged from non-traditional areas.
There was a historical inevitability about this. India's early captains were the local royals. Then came those who worked for the royals like Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare. Then came the middle-class salary-earning city-bred captains (Gulabrai Ramchand, Nari Contractor, Ajith Wadekar) with Tiger Pataudi the exception in the 1960s. Dhoni's arrival was a testimony to the reach of televised cricket.
Youngsters had been fired by the 1983 World Cup win by Kapil Dev's India. Suddenly towns like Bharuch, Aligarh, Jalandhar, Palarivattom, Quilon, Rae Bareilly, Khorda and Kodagu began producing international cricketers.
Dhoni was eight when Sachin Tendulkar made his debut, yet within months of playing under Dhoni, the senior man was saying, I am delighted at the way Dhoni conducts himself. He is a balanced guy with a sharp brain. His approach is clear and uncomplicated.
So clear and uncomplicated that when his immediate predecessor Anil Kumble retired, Dhoni carried him off the field on his shoulders.
In Indian cricket, no captain is a hero to his vice-captain, and this must rate as one of the great sights on a cricket field. The simple was best demonstrated when he asked spinner Amit Mishra to bowl the last over on the second day of the Mohali Test against Australia in 2008, and the bowler dismissed Michael Clarke.
At the press conference later, Dhoni, praised for his acumen, confessed, It was a fluke. He was to say later, I want a team that can stand before an advancing truck.
It was a captaincy mantra that he followed, and which saw India rise to the top in both Test and ODI rankings.
Whether Dhoni was bowing to the inevitable by giving up the captaincy, or merely anticipating the future by a fortnight, the fact remains that once again he goes out on his own terms.
He led in 199 matches, winning 110, a figure second only to Allan Border's 165. His 41 wins in Twenty20 are the best by any captain.
The transition, as in Test cricket, will be smooth.
Virat Kohli is ready, willing and able. He has said he learnt much under Dhoni, and as he prepares to put together the team for 2019, the younger man has enough time to figure out whether the older fits into his scheme of things. But currently, Dhoni the batsman is a certainty. - BBC
Dhoni was Indias finest captain in the shorter format.

## Title: Will Roger Federer and Serena Williams add to major haul in 2017

Will Roger Federer and Serena Williams add to major haul in 2017
The new year is made for resolutions and predictions.
So heres what will happen in the world of tennis in 2017 in a season that will feature a comeback for veteran stars Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal.
Federer to make a slam final.
At Wimbledon, where he has won a record-equaling seven titles.
Federer has some work to do to return to the top five, given his inactivity since deciding to end his season in July.
Motivation remains sky high for Federer the 35-year-old plans on playing a couple more seasons and even when injured he came close to reaching the final at Wimbledon. He returned to action Monday at the Hopman Cup in Perth and quickly dismissed Britains Dan Evans.
If Federer, the mens leader with 17 majors, makes the final and plays defending champion Andy Murray, his chances would appear to be good.
Federer has won five straight matches against Scotlands two-time Olympic gold medalist and new world No. 1.
No new mens winnersGrigor Dimitrov. Kei Nishikori. Milos Raonic. By now, some would have expected at least one of the trio to have won a grand slam.
The Big Four of Federer, Nadal, Murray and Novak Djokovic, however, continue to reign supreme, with Stan Wawrinka adding to a superlative quintet. Advances in recovery, nutrition and training mean those five players are able to sustain their high levels for longer periods.
Since the beginning of 2010 28 majors ago only six players aside from the quintet have appeared in a grand slam final, including Raonic at Wimbledon this year and Nishikori at the US Open in 2014.
Expect the dominance of those five to continue and dont expect any new mens grand slam winners.
Serena to win two majors
Several womens pros said last year that Angelique Kerbers win over Williams at the Australian Open gave them the belief that they too could topple the American. Kerber added a second major at the US Open.
If Williams aura has faded slightly, she certainly wasnt far off winning three majors in 2016 instead of the one title she secured at Wimbledon.
Williams endured injury throughout 2016, which no doubt made her more vulnerable.
At 35 such physical issues arent a surprise but Williams should return to the circuit refreshed and with less pressure than 11 months ago when the California native had to back up a sensational 2015 season that saw her come within two wins of achieving a calendar year grand slam.
She won Wimbledon, the Australian and French Open titles in that year but went out in the semifinal of the US Open.
Kerber to add to slam collection
Is Kerber, who ended Williams stay at No. 1 in September, a one-year wonder destined to fade in 2017 Her game, and the current WTA landscape, suggest not.
The German left-hander is no longer a defensive player largely retrieving at the back of the court. Rather, aggression has slowly but surely found its way into the 28-year-olds game. She is also competing better than ever. And with the pregnant Victoria Azarenka off the tour for a while longer and Sharapova not back from her drug suspension until late April with the Russian needing time to return to form Kerber will, if healthy, remain in the top two for a while yet. Based on her matches with Williams in 2016, tennis fans surely want the rivalry to intensify. Their two encounters at the Australian Open and Wimbledon were classics.
Nadal to win 15th major
Those who have wanted Nadal to add to his coaching setup got their wish last month when Carlos Moya joined the 14-time grand slam winners team.
Moya apart from being a former world No. 1 and grand slam winner himself was Nadals mentor. Like the King of Clay, he hails from the island of Mallorca in Spain.
Nadal is hoping for a spike in results, similar to those Djokovic and Murray experienced when working with grand slam winners Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl respectively.
Working against Nadal, though, is his age at 30 he is a year older than Murray and Djokovic and has suffered an array of injuries.
A wrist complaint scuppered his 2016 season after appearing to be in form. He had rediscovered his confidence early in the clay-court season.
But Nadal, for the time being, is healthy, and the arrival of Moya who was alongside Raonic as the Canadian reached a career high third in in the rankings will only be a boost.
He is reportedly practicing well in the off-season.
Nadal is too much of a champion, at this stage of his career, to simply fade away.
His last grand slam title came at the French Open in 2014 and with a record nine titles at Roland Garros to his name, Paris is the likeliest spot for another triumph at a major.  CNN

Work on BIA runway begins after 30 years
Work on the runway overlay at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Katunayake began yesterday after a lapse of 30 years.
The main runway at the BIA will be closed for renovation for three months from January 6 to April 5 for eight hours each day, from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm. During the closure, the runway will be overlaid to improve surface condition and friction levels. This would be the first time such an overlay project is being carried out since the commissioning of the runway in 1986. The closure period was decided in consultation with the airport users with special emphasis on weather trends and civil engineering needs.
The daily closure time of eight hours during the three months has been decided taking into consideration minimising congestion to minimise any adverse impact on both airlines and airport users.
Currently,there are around 175 aircraft movements per day and most of the commercial flights have rescheduled their operations during this period.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the airport authorities have taken all possible measures to minimise the impact of the closure on airport users. Security of passengers and aircraft will not be compromised in anyway during this period, but efficiency will be improved overall, he added. De Silva further said that passengers should turn up at the Bandaranaike International Airport at least five hours before their flights to minimise congestion, caused by the closure of the airport.
A special traffic plan will be implemented by Police within and around the airport. Drivers are advised to park their vehicles only in the vehicle parks. The respective airlines will update their passengers on any revision to their flight schedules. Sri Lankan passengers who are departing for foreign employment are requested to obtain registration from the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) head office or from islandwide SLBFE branches prior to arriving at the BIA, the minister added. The minister said the estimated cost of the renovation project of the runway is nearly US$ 48 million which is being undertaken by the Kathik Company in China.
I am extremely please that we could start this project during my tenure as the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister. If we continued to use the same runway without going for renovations, international recognition for the BIA would have suffered. That is why we decided to expedite this project. We will also start work on second terminal building from April. This will enable the BIA to accommodate 20 million passengers per day.We are also discussing with international airlines to bring down more airlines to the Mattala international airport, the minister said.
Therefore, this will be a massive boost for the countrys tourism industry, he added.
