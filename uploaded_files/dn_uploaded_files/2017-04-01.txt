Reaping the benefits of strengthened ties
Some local entrepreneurs said in a media statement that if implemented, the proposed agreement with China will have an adverse impact on the domestic industries, leading to the collapse of a large number of them; if that happens it will result in loss of jobs and livelihoods and inevitable economic chaos. They pointed out that most industrialists were unaware of this grave danger and urged all domestic industrialists to unite and safeguard their industries and businesses.
The proposed FTA between Lanka and China became a serious concern for the local industrialists when the government recently disclosed the requirement and conditions. As local industrialists point out, the potential free entry of Chinese goods, like a tsunami will force domestic industries to closure. It is obvious that the local industrialists have been a solid force in stabilizing the countrys economy throughout the toughest of times.
The sweat and tears they shed over the last few decades built successful local industries and created thousands of employment opportunities within Lankas economy. On this basis they strongly oppose the signing of the FTA in the present form. In addition Lanka doesnt have proper regulation, such as an anti-dumping law to safeguard the local industries. However, all that cannot change the need to connect with large markets in the East. Western giants of global capitalism are in trouble. Yet, people in those countries are agitating for better life, which means better goods with fine finish. We are forced to look elsewhere.
Fight for true freedom
Of course we have the example of Cuba. A small and relatively poor country  Cuba  demonstrated to the entire world that while the western might, sadistic and brutal, it is not omnipotent, and it is possible to defy it. There is no reason why one should not dare, or one should not dream about a much better world, why one shouldnt fight for true freedom, attempting to win. Cuba inspired the world. Its daring Revolution took place just a few miles from the shores of the United States.
After few years, its teachers and doctors went to all parts of the earth, spreading optimism, solidarity and kindness. Its heroic revolutionaries went to fight against the most dreadful forms of colonialism, which were torturing people, such places as Congo, Angola and Namibia. Later, America changed the face and morals. Obama administration attempted to water down the determination of the Cuban citizens. Of course Cuba did not compromise and sell its Revolution. However Cubans are not living in democracy and pressure on ruling elite has increased many folds. A greatly educated nation, Cubans can see the value of democracy even in the form practiced in America.
Presidents state visit to Russia
The Lankan Presidents state visit to Russia shows the pragmatic change in the liberal ideology in Lanka. In the past populist politicians expected help in the name of socialism. Now it is clear that there is no socialism anywhere in the world. The 2017 centenary of the Russian revolution, something which the current Russian regime does not want to highlight, was used by the Lankan liberal leaders to highlight the democratic change in Lanka.
The Russian revolution did not deliver socialism, but changed the course of world history. It created the Russian capitalist regime, one of the two super powers that dominate the world today. Twenty five years after the fall of the USSR, Russia is raising its head again; many outside of Russia are still struggling to understand what it wants in the 21st century, or where Vladimir Putin wants to take the bear!
The great political rivalry that is emerging between the American eagle and the Chinese dragon affect Russia. Russian foreign policy recently was dependent on three main factors. These factors included firstly, the relationship with the US; secondly, responding to global economic crises, especially, since 2007 and, thirdly, interest in conflicts in Middle East.
While Putin is projected as a villainous anti-western autocrat, his early self was not antagonistic to the West. He tried to cooperate, clearly announced in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks, the US and Russian interests of fighting terrorism aligned and he called for pragmatic partnerships and relations with the western nations. In the meantime China, one of the oldest and greatest civilizations on Earth, went through the terrible period of humiliation. Divided, occupied and plundered by the West, it has never forgotten nor forgiven.
Now the Chinese Communist state and its mixed economy are influencing countries in virtually all parts of the world, from Oceania and Latin America, to the Middle East and especially Africa, to survive and to finally stand on their own feet. Despite all the vitriolic propaganda of the West, China has been gaining respect and trust in virtually all corners of the globe. The Chinese people and their government are now standing strongly against Western globalization. They will not allow any recurrence of the disgraceful and dreary past.
The West is provoking this mighty and optimistic nation, pushing it into a confrontation. Obviously China doesnt want any military conflict. According to them it is the most peaceful, the most non-confrontational large nation on Earth. But it is becoming clear that if pushed against the wall, it will not compromise: it will fight. Such determination gives hope to many other countries on our planet.
Western plunderers
The message is clear: the West cannot do whatever it wants, anymore. If it tries, it will be stopped. By reason or by force! Russia is ready again, too. It is standing next to China, enormous and indignant. Throughout history, Russia was attacked and ransacked from the West. Millions, tens of millions of its people were murdered, literally exterminated. Like the Chinese people, Russians are unwilling to compromise, anymore. The Old Russian forecast is once again alive!
Go tell all in foreign lands that Russia lives! Those who come to us in peace will be welcome as a guest. But those who come to us sword in hand will die by the sword! On that Russia stands and forever will we stand!
In Russia, as in China, and as in so many other nations that were devastated by the Western plunderers, nothing is forgotten and no one is forgotten. It only appeared for a while that the memory had fainted. It never does. You cannot burn down an entire land, ruin the cities, burn the fields, and still pose as one with the moral mandate. Or as we say now in Lanka: Justice takes time, but it always comes! And the world is watching. It is suddenly clearly registering this determined and brave, epic stand of morally strong nations. Many of those who are watching are deeply impressed with what they are seeing.

Rs.14 m worth pure heroin seized from flight toilet
Customs Department Officials yesterday seized Rs.14 million worth pure heroin from a flight that stopped over at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake last morning. The heroin haul weighed 1.3 kg.
The detection helped to reveal an international drug trafficking scheme. The raid was carried out in Fly Dubai flight FZ 555, which was flying from Male to Dubai, when it stopped over at Katunayake.
Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said four packets of heroin had been found inside the flight toilet and the flight crew informed about it to the Customs officers.
Preliminary investigations have found that an air hostess had first detected the suspicious parcel and informed the pilot.
The Deputy Customs Director said the flight crew members extended their full support to the investigations. The plane departed to its destination at around 6.51 a.m. after a five hour delay.
After the Customs investigations, the heroin haul is to be handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau.

Russell Westbrook breaks NBA record
Russell Westbrook recorded the highest-scoring triple-double in NBA history on Wednesday night, totaling 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists to lead Oklahoma City Thunder to a come-from-behind, 114-106 overtime road victory over Orlando Magic.
For Westbrook, it was just another day at the office as he compiled his fourth consecutive triple-double and his 38th of the season, leaving him three shy of the NBA record held by NBA legend Oscar Robertson. The 57 points were one short of his career high.
You just got to want it more than other people, Westbrook said. I dont think about getting tired. I just keep going and going. I dont think about it. I just think about making the next play, making winning basketball plays. Im blessed. The Thunder (43-31) have won eight of the last 10 games. Westbrook scored 16 points in the fourth quarter on Monday when OKC erased a 13-point deficit in the final 3:31 to win in Dallas. He scored 19 points in the final six minutes of regulation to force overtime on Wednesday when the Thunder erased another 13-point fourth quarter deficit.

Shadab shines again as Pakistan deny Windies
Port of Spain: Shadab Khan gave another match-winning bowling performance and Hasan Ali held his nerve for Pakistan to sneak a three-run victory over the West Indies in the second T20 International on Thursday.
Set a relatively modest target of 133 to level the series following a six-wicket defeat in the opening match in Barbados, the hosts were restricted to 129 for eight to suffer their fifth consecutive T20 loss to the visitors.
Pakistan now hold an unbeatable 2-0 lead ahead of the final two matches at the weekend back at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad.
In the wake of an impressive senior international debut at Kensington Oval, Shadab snared four for 14 with his mesmerising mixture of leg-breaks and googlies to stymie the West Indies quest. His most important strike came on the last delivery of his four-over allotment when he had Marlon Samuels caught at the wicket for a top score of 44. Samuels imperious strokeplay, reminiscent of his two match-winning performances in World T20 finals, looked to be taking the home side to the target before he was undone by the confident 19-year-old.
Getting Samuels was important for us to have a chance of winning, said Shadab after collecting his second straight Man of the Match award.
This pitch had more bounce and encouragement than in Barbados so I am really looking forward to the final two matches.
From that point the balance was tilting in favour of Pakistan although West Indies captain Carlos Brathwaite, who had earlier taken three wickets on a sultry afternoon, battled to keep his team on course in partnership with fellow all-rounder Jason Holder.
But it came down to fast-medium bowler Ali retaining his focus and concentration in the final over after being smashed for boundaries by Sunil Narine off the first two deliveries.
West Indies needed just six more runs to complete the victory but the bowlers excellent accuracy denied both Narine and Holder, who could only manage a single off the last ball when a boundary was needed to tie the scores and force a super over. Put in to bat after Brathwaite won the toss, Pakistan struggled to gain any sort of batting momentum against the twin spin threat of Narine and Samuel Badree. Narine claimed three for 22 and Badree two for 14. Pakistan were indebted to the ninth-wicket pair of Wahab Riaz and Shadab as they put on 36 quickfire runs off the final four overs to bring a measure of respectability to the total after they were put in to bat on a dry, turgid surface.
They were in trouble from the very first over when Kamran Akmal was bowled by Badree without a run on the board.
From that point on they laboured despite a 41-run stand for the second wicket between Babar Azam and opening batsman Ahmed Shehzad. Azam got to 27 before falling to Brathwaite while Shoaib Malik followed up his match-winning unbeaten 38 at Kensington Oval with a top score of 28.

A number of other problems affecting the youth will also be addressed at the event.
We conducted an island-wide research and identified the main problems faced by the youth in Sri Lanka over last two years and we hope to find solutions to many of these issues at the concention.
The SLFP Youth Front has been at the forefront in providing guidance to the youth and resolving their problems, Bandara said. We do not need youth insurgences. Many young lives were destroyed in the 77, 88 and 89 insurgencies and also in the Northern war. Who is responsible for those deaths Has the country benefited from them and the destruction caused," he queried.
All this time politicians used the youth to meet their own needs,but,we will use this occasion to solve their problems. We have held village and provincial level youth meetings and leadership training camps before holding this national level event,the SLFP Youth Front Chairman said.

Sri Lanka to sign MoU with BIMSTEC
Cabinet this week granted approval for Sri Lanka to enter into a MoU with members of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) to build a common power grid interconnection to facilitate energy trade among the member countries.
BIMSTEC formed in 1997 in Bangkok to boost economic and technical cooperation among member states consists of; Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
At the October 2015 Ministerial meeting of BIMSTEC, member countries approved of an action plan for energy cooperation among member states. A MoU was thereafter drafted for member states towards the implementation of grid interconnections for the trade in electricity with a view to promoting national and optimal power transmission in the BIMSTEC region. The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy is the implementing authority of the agreement in Sri Lanka and this week, they submitted the MoU for Cabinet approval after having received the green light from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority.
The MoU when signed will have Sri Lanka agree to Enhance the intra-regional coordination through an action plan for developing and utilizing various energy resources, Coordinate and optimize the energy infrastructure investment including grid interconnections Encourage the new or renewable sources of energy projects, Enhance energy security of the region,
Encourage for generating additional energy, Encourage cross border energy trade and Establish the BIMSTEC Energy Centre.
In addition, a Grid Interconnection Coordination Committee (BGICC) will be established to actively coordinate and represent parties involved in the trading programme.
The MoU also asks that member states, develop a transmission tariff framework for trading of electricity among the parties and open up new avenues of cooperation to promote electricity trade but the Ministry of Power and Energy is yet to work out such a formula and has informed Cabinet that they are awaiting Concurrence from the Ministry of Finance before finalising the proposed transmission tariff framework for the trade in electricity.
The MoU is be revisited again in five years for any revisions.
Bangladesh signed the MoU in November last year and is hoping to exchange electricity with Myanmar and has held negotiations with India, along with Bhutan for hydroelectricity exchange.
Nepal, who is the current chair of BIMSTEC signed on earlier this year and they are to host the 4th BIMSTEC summit by the end of this year.

## Title: Trumps Real ASEAN Test

Trumps Real ASEAN Test
Given the unprecedented attention that former U.S. President Barack Obama paid to Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in U.S. Asia policy, it was always going to be a challenge for the Trump administration to match its predecessors level of engagement with the sub-region and for the chattering classes to accept that sobering reality. And so it has proved, with some in Washington and in Southeast Asia already crafting various litmus tests for the new administration, including Trumps attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam and the East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in November.
It would no doubt be a welcome development if Trump does end up scoring as well as Obama did on Southeast Asia and ASEAN, especially since this is the 50th anniversary of ASEANs founding and the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations. But it is also true that given Southeast Asias traditional position in U.S. foreign policy, the Obama administrations unprecedented commitment to the sub-region, and the Trump administrations vision for the region thus far, that test may seem unfair and the metrics might not be quite as applicable. A more meaningful and ultimately more rigorous ASEAN test for the Trump administration, beyond a single event or metric, is whether it can preserve the U.S. role as a capable and willing Pacific power seeking to advance greater security, prosperity, and democracy in the Asia-Pacific while working with Southeast Asian states on common challenges in a way that advances U.S. interests but still preserves their autonomy and freedom of action.
Southeast Asia and U.S. Policy
Any attempt to assess a new U.S. administrations Southeast Asia policy should begin with an understanding of the sub-region as well as its place within broader U.S. foreign policy. Southeast Asia is a diverse region that has interacted with a range of major powers through the centuries. The regions history may be summarized as a search for unity in the face of diversity, represented by the ten rice stalks on the flag of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), initially founded in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand (or the ASEAN five) after two other failed and short-lived regional groupings. Over time, Southeast Asian states have grown accustomed to adjusting their foreign alignments to cope with their own domestic development, interactions with other regional states, and the changing nature of major power competition.
Though U.S. attention to individual Southeast Asian states tended to vary, Southeast Asia has also traditionally occupied a marginal role in U.S. foreign policy in general and U.S. Asia policy in particular, unlike China or Japan, which both loomed much larger. While the U.S. presence in some Southeast Asian countries was evident in decades before, the sub-region only really rose to prominence in the context of threats to the United States and to its European and Asian allies and partners, be it from Japan during World War II or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. As smaller countries, Southeast Asian nations have also felt the changes in U.S. commitment to the Asia-Pacific most acutely in the past few decades, from the American withdrawal after the Vietnam War to the decline in U.S. presence following the end of the Cold War.
By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Southeast Asias importance as a sub-region had grown significantly but U.S. policy had in some cases not adjusted to give the sub-region the attention it deserved. Economic growth among the original ASEAN Five, Southeast Asias centrality in addressing challenges from terrorism to Chinas rise, and ASEANs transformation from an anti-communist bloc to a forum for major powers to engage made the regions importance clear. Yet U.S. attention continued to wax and wane depending on the threat of the day, be it the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 or the war on terrorism in the 2000s. Though this was to be expected, it also prevented the rise of a more strategic, region-wide, and balanced approach to Southeast Asia.
Obamas Rebalance within the rebalance
Though some of the steps had begun during George W. Bushs second term, Obama was the first president who really elevated Southeast Asias importance within U.S. Asia policy and significantly boosted U.S. commitment to the sub-region to back this up. Indeed, arguably the most significant aspect of the Obama administrations rebalance to the Asia-Pacific has been the greater share of attention devoted to Southeast Asia as well as ASEAN as a whole within U.S. Asia policy  what came to be known as the rebalance within the rebalance.
Under Obama, the United States ratified the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, became the first non-ASEAN country to appoint a resident ambassador to ASEAN, joined the East Asia Summit, institutionalized annual U.S.-ASEAN summits that the president has attended regularly, and even held the first-ever U.S.-ASEAN summit in the United States. The administration also made significant inroads in building out U.S. alliances and partnerships in Southeast Asia, from the inking of new strategic and comprehensive partnerships with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam to the signing of a new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the Philippines. As I have repeatedly emphasized, these are no small feats for a U.S. Asia bureaucracy that still continues to be largely dominated by Northeast Asian concerns.
That said, U.S. Southeast Asia policy under the Obama administration also continued to be dogged by a series of challenges stemming both from its engagement of the sub-region as well as its broader Asia policy. Most clearly, on China policy, the administrations eagerness to ease Beijings insecurities and collaborate on issues like climate change  initially dubbed strategic reassurance  made it difficult for Washington to deal with an increasingly confident and at times assertive Beijing, with the South China Sea being a case in.
In the economic realm, despite the administrations best efforts, the failure to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  which involved four Southeast Asian states: Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam  during its tenure paved the way for the pacts eventual downfall, leading to a lost opportunity to structure U.S. economic statecraft in Asia. And on the democracy and human rights front, though officials were correct when they tirelessly argued that U.S. policy had to depart from the lecturing of Southeast Asian states seen in the past, the failure to define an alternative vision  as opposed to individual initiatives like town hall meetings and the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI)  gave way to the perception that this was not a major priority relative to other U.S. interests.
Trumps Real ASEAN Test
For all the apocalyptic post-election predictions about the collapse of the regional order, after a bit of a rocky start, the Trump administrations engagement in Asia has thus far represented far more continuity than the naysayers initially suggested. That applies to Southeast Asia too. The nixing of TPP, the questioning of the One China policy, and the Trump travel ban (which led to unsubstantiated rumours about a potential expansion to cover Southeast Asian states) had all sent anxieties throughout the region about what it might expect from an America First foreign policy.
At the same time, it is still early days, and engagement appears to be slowly taking shape. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met ambassadors and charge daffaires of ASEAN countries here in Washington, D.C., where he attempted to ease some lingering concerns about U.S. policy toward the region. And though staffing has indeed proceeded much slower than previous administrations, diplomats and officials from individual ASEAN countries have also begun meeting Trump administration officials at various levels and tried to schedule visits through 2017. More is to come: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit Indonesia next month as part of a wider Asia tour, and a meeting between Tillerson and ASEAN foreign ministers is also expected soon.
As U.S. Southeast Asia policy begins to take shape under the Trump administration, what might be a fair test to judge it by We have already seen that actual policy will depart  often significantly  from Trumps campaign rhetoric and the administrations initial signals. This reflects the transition from campaigning to governing as well as the reality that an administrations Asia policy is usually judged less by its initial approaches than its eventual responses to ongoing developments. Similarly, individual metrics like visits are poor indicators of the U.S. commitment to Southeast Asia in any administration, especially since the past three U.S. presidents  Obama included  have all missed or nearly missed Asia trips because of either concerns in other parts of the world or at home.
More meaningfully, the Trump administrations real ASEAN test is whether it can preserve the U.S. role as a capable and willing Pacific power seeking to advance greater security, prosperity, and democracy in the Asia-Pacific while working with Southeast Asian states on common challenges in a way that advances U.S. interests but still preserves their autonomy and freedom of action. That means accomplishing five things. -The Diplomat

We have to be aggressive to win - Mortaza
Bangladesh are within a match away from creating history in another format of the game when they take on Sri Lanka in the third and final ODI at the SSC today.
Having won their maiden Test victory against Sri Lanka they are now eyeing a maiden ODI series win against the host. Bangladesh are one-up in the series and cannot lose the series  they can either draw or win it.
If we can win the series it will of course feel very good. But for that we have to play very good cricket, said Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. If you see the last match, they scored 300. Obviously the wicket was very good, but maybe we have to try to minimise 20-25 runs from that. Where they can score 300, we have to keep it to 280. So if we can do something like that the task will become easier for us. We have to play according to the plan, otherwise it will be difficult.
Being relaxed is very important, because the team has won two matches on the trot be it Test or ODI. So being relaxed is very important and to play according to the plans put in place. I will always want that we play the aggressive game. It is very difficult to play with too much caution, because you cannot play your best that way. Either you will have to be in a defensive mode or you have to be attacking. And if you want to win a game of cricket, you cant do it being defensive.  [ST]

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday assured the Court of Appeal that the baby elephant Nandi would remain at Pinnawala and steps will be taken not to send the animal to New Zealand until the next court hearing on May 26.
In a writ petition before the Court of Appeal, several civil society activists have sought an Interim Order to suspend the exportation of the baby elephant Nandi to New Zealand until the final determination of the writ petition. The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya.
The petition had been filed by 18 parties including Dharmavijaya Foundation, the President of Dharmavijaya Foundation Olcott Gunasekara, Bodhiraja Foundation and Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera.
The petitioners had cited 41 parties including Attorney General and Minister of Livestock and Rural Development.
Five-year-old baby elephant Nandi had been purported to be gifted to New Zealand, when New Zealand Prime Minister John Key visited Sri Lanka in February 2016.
The petitioners stated that elephant Nandi belongs to the species ELEPHAS MAXIMUS, a rare and vulnerable species with Sri Lanka being one of the few countries that is home to the Asiatic elephant.
The petitioners further sought an order quashing the agreement entered into by government of Sri Lanka and the Auckland zoo with regard to the gifting of the baby elephant Nandi to New Zealand.
The petitioners further said that it has been stated by conservationists that the exporting of Sri Lankas elephants for the purpose of gifting in order to be displayed in Zoos for the commercial purposes of foreign countries, is ill conceived in as such around the world today there is a distinct and growing trend of the concept of zoos being considered deleterious to the welfare of the animals.

Air Force (Adastrians CC) celebrate 50 years
Sri Lanka Air Force then known as Royal Ceylon Air Force will be celebrating their Golden Jubilee this year for winning the All-Island Inter-Club Division Two cricket championship and grabbing the prestigious Donovan Andree Trophy 50 years ago in 1966/1967 after representing as Adastrians Cricket Club under the astute leadership of former Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda cricketer K. M. Nelson and his deputy was Old Anandian Charlie Siri Amarasinghe.
During this era the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (now Sri Lanka Cricket) conducted three major tournaments in the country namely Saravanamuttu Trophy (Division One - presently Premier Trophy), Donovan Andree Trophy (Division Two) and Daily News Trophy (Division Three).
Sri Lanka Air Force then known as Royal Ceylon Air Force participated as Adastrians Cricket Club in 1961/1962 and they won the Daily News Trophy and were promoted to Division Two. They were captained by Harry Gunathilake and some of the other players who were in the cricket pool who come to mind are Dr. Wijetunge, Aubrey Ebert, Rex Fernando, Palliyaguru, Gerry Weeraratne, Dudley Perera, Costa, Charlie Amarasinghe, Lerrick Fernando, Wally Jayathilake, Nihal Sooriyabandara, S. Dharmarajah, Rajah Wickramasinghe, K. S. S. P. Silva, M. Fareed and W. S. Silva.
After winning this trophy Adastrians were promoted to Division Two Tournament and there were up and downs. The same year three players Keerthi Caldera, Mahinda Athulathmudali and Norbert Fernando requested permission to represent other clubs in Sara Trophy. Caldera and Athulathmudali were granted permission but Norbert's request was turned down and ultimately he was the highest rungetter for the Air Force and scored a stubborn knock of 54 runs against Nondescripts Cricket Club to bring victory in the final.
In the 1966/67 tournament KM Nelson captained the side. The Command Cricket Officer was Squadron Leader S. Luwelyn Fernando and throughout the tournament Adastrians were leading. The teams which participated in addition to Adastrians were Saracens Sports Club, Nondescripts Cricket Club, Burgher Recreation Club, Catamarans Sports Club and Kandy Sports Club. All together ten matches were played on a home and away basis. The home ground of Adastrians was Rifle Green, the present Air Force grounds at Sir Chithampalam Gardiner Mawatha, Colombo 2. During this period the Rifle Green was the home grounds of Saracens Sports Club also.
Adastrians won nine out of ten matches and lost only to Nondescripts Cricket Club on first innings in their first outing at their home grounds at Maitland Place. They were represented by in addition to the captain and vice captain by Donald Perera, Mohamed Faleel, Hemasiri Hettige, K. S. S. P. Silva, Hemasiri Fernando, Leslie Ratnappuli, Sarath Fernando. S. Dharmarajah, Nimal Cooray, Wilfred Basnayake, Norbert Fernando, P. P. Silva, W. Ratnayake, W. Somabandu, K. C. Silva and Dilwin Mendis. They got all the support and assistance from the cricket crazy Commander of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff Rohan Amarasekara and Padman 'Paddy' Mendis respectively.
Nelson claimed 66 wickets and earned the Best Bowler's Trophy and the same year he carried away the prestigious Vartharasa Challenge Trophy awarded to the Best Sportsman of the Air Force at the Annual Colours Awards Ceremony. He also represented the Board Presidents Cricket Eleven against the touring England cricket team at the P Sara Oval.
Former Sebastianite and Catamarans Cricket Club player Norbert Fernando and Dilwin Mendis passed the 400-run mark and Norbert got the highest average while Mendis scored the highest aggregate of runs. All others contributed their might with devotion and dedication to win the Championship.
The same year Adastrians were promoted to the Sara Trophy. Despite 50 years having lapsed todate still the Air Force cricket team has not been able to win the Premier Trophy though top notched cricketers who have excelled in school and club level have joined the Air Force as regulars, volunteers and on contract basis time to time.
Commander of the Air Force Rohan Amarasekara, the Command Cricket Officer Squadron Leader Luwelyn Fernando and the players of the team Charlie Amarasinghe, K. S. S. P. Silva, Sarath Fernando, Hemasiri Hettige, Nimal Cooray and Wilfred Basnayake who were responsible for winning this trophy along with the others have been called up from above for their eternal rest as opposed to the great saying, "Old Soldiers never die. But these great cricketers cum Airmen have just faded away".

Bangladesh reject invitation to tour Pakistan
Bangladesh have refused to tour Pakistan for a proposed two-match T20I series sometime before July this year.
In a bid to bring international cricket back to the country, the Pakistan Cricket Board had extended an invitation to their counterparts in the Bangladesh Cricket Board after they had successfully hosted the PSL final in Lahore three weeks ago. Among the people who were present at that game was Major AKM Anisud Dowla, a BCB representative.
On Friday, Jalal Younis, the BCBs media and communication committee chairman, told Dhaka Tribune that, the reports were not satisfactory enough due to which we had to pull back.
PSL chairman Najam Sethi was adamant about hosting the final in Lahore on March 5 and had taken extensive measures to ensure its security. There were bulletproof buses for the teams and five tiers of security extending 2 km from the Gaddafi stadium. Paramilitary forces and local policemen were on hand to monitor the situation as well. The ICC security advisor Sean Norris, who also attended the PSL final, is expected to submit his report of the night at the ICC board meeting in April.
Pakistan are scheduled to tour Bangladesh in July and the PCB is seeking a part of the revenue generated from the series. They believe they are owed compensation for the BCB rejecting invitations to play in Pakistan for the last six years.
We want to host Bangladesh but its chances are not bright, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had said recently. Some of our friends think they may tour but I feel they will not because of political concerns more than security concerns. But during ICC meeting I will speak to my Bangladesh counterpart and may re-negotiate our tour to Bangladesh this year and ask them to compensate us for not touring Pakistan.
On their last visit to Bangladesh in 2015, the PCB had reportedly taken USD 325,000 and justified it by saying the series had technically been Pakistans home series. This year the BCB has rejected all proposals to share revenue although they were open to playing at a neutral venue if necessary.
The PCB, however, are not keen on that option. It is understood that they feel hosting teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in the UAE - their adopted home - is not financially viable.

Carry on grunting: Groans and moans here to stay, say WTA Tour chiefs
The head of the WTA Tour will risk angering purists by shelving plans to curtail grunting while pressing to abolish rules restricting coaching. Steve Simon, the tours chief executive, is relaxed about the repeat yelping of players, which will become more prevalent this year with the return of Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova.
He also wants to challenge the age-old idea in tennis that coaches are not allowed to issue instructions from the stands. This currently incurs a $5,000 fine and official warnings from umpires.
While grunting is not just a female issue, last Sundays final in Indian Wells was marked by constant screams from winner Elena Vesnina.
Explorations into decibel levels set in motion by former WTA supremo Stacey Allaster have been abandoned although there is advisory education on the topic for younger players. I dont plan on pursuing anything to eliminate grunting, said Simon. I dont know how you stop grunting. We do have rules in place that if we feel its forced and it becomes a hindrance then obviously there are rules that address that.
The mics on the court are picking it up. I dont think its as strong as it was a few years ago, there are fewer players grunting.
His attitude towards coaching is highly contentious. At present players are allowed one visit per set at regular tour events from a coach, eroding the principle of tennis being a sport in which players must figure out tactics for themselves.
I think coaching is something that the sport needs to embrace, its part of the story, said Simon. There are some great personalities among the coaches that could be good for our sport, its something I would like to see expand.
The mens game does not allow in-match coaching and there are no current plans to introduce it, but there are instances of secret communication between player and box.
The fact is there is coaching, asserted Simon.They all have coaches, and theres been the question for years - are they coaching from the box or arent they How do you know Is the banana going left or is it going right Lets call a spade a spade here: I scratch my head, my hat was on backwards, now its on forwards. Cmon!
If youre going to allow coaching, fine. If not, lets go put the coaches in a suite where the player cant find them. We need to be realistic.
But allowing a free-for-all from the stands would disadvantage the self-reliant players who think for themselves on court. Agnieszka Radwanska is an example of that in the womens game, while Andy Murray is one among the men.

Certain estate companies violating collective agreement
Some Estate companies have been violating the collective agreement signed with estate sector trade unions and do not pay the increased wages for their employees, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry sources said.
According to sources, this was revealed during a recent discussion held at the ministry. According to the collective agreement signed between estate companies and trade unions, estate companies should pay a production allowance of Rs. 140, but they skip paying this allowance using various tactics.
The collective agreement stipulates that one estate worker receives a salary of Rs. 730 and the production allowance depends on the workload carried out by the worker.
The companies have increased the workload to a level that a worker was unable to complete in order to avoid paying Rs. 140, the sources said.
The companies rejected the accusation. Minister Seneviratne ordered a report to be submitted to him within a month after observing the behaviour of the accused companies, the sources added.

The clear path away from hybrid courts
President Maithripala Sirisenas announcement that the Government would not prosecute War Heroes who fought for the Motherland, takes a major issue out of the consensual resolution 30/1 of October 2015, for the implementing of which Sri Lanka obtained a two year roll over in Geneva recently.
The Presidents statement, at the presenting of Virasara beneficial cards to War Heroes at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala, also takes much of the sting away from criticism of opposition forces, mainly from Sinhala extremist groups, the Joint Opposition, and a large number of persons from intellectuals, academics to politicians, who have taken to Sinhala nationalism, as it takes away the very cause of the concept of hybrid courts, that has been the major criticism of the government over the Geneva resolution.
The statement that War Heroes would not be prosecuted came very much in line with President Sirisenas recent statements of opposition to hybrid courts, that would have foreign judges, sitting in judgement on cases involving issues of Human Rights, mainly relating to the final stages of the war to defeat LTTE terrorism.
Sri Lankas assurance to the UNHRC in Geneva of making the reconciliation process in the country a success, moving towards a progressive and united society, and taking the Sri Lankan nation to new heights in socio-economic development, will now have to be implemented without any prosecution of military personnel for alleged war crimes in the country, which was a key aspect of the Geneva Resolution.
The Presidents statement will certainly need to be studied in the context of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Husseins, reiteration of the need for foreign judges and other legal personnel to be available for probes into any alleged war crimes in the country  both by the State forces and the LTTE - in the final stages of the war with the terrorist LTTE.
Issues to resolve
There is no doubt this decision would lead to disagreements with the UNHRC, with Geneva resolution 30/1 of October 2015 having the hybrid courts as a principal clause in it. Sri Lanka will now have to show definite attention to the other aspects of the resolution, with more emphasis on the issue of Missing Persons, the proposed Task Force on Reconciliation, as well as issues such as the resettlement of persons in the North and East displaced during the war, and the return of land in the former war affected areas still being held by the Security Forces.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did pave the way for the major attitudinal change that will come following President Sirisenas latest statement, by stating that hybrid courts were not practicable due to political changes, the new policies of governance, and the need for a constitutional amendment.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera also sought to clear the path to this new situation, with his statements that the Geneva resolutions were not binding on Sri Lanka, that they required constitutional changes, and also stating that this is not the most appropriate time for such amendments to the Constitution.
President Sirisena did mention at the Kurunegala event that there was unprecedented goodwill for Sri Lanka among the international community today, and there were many questions as to how this goodwill could be directed for benefits to the country.
There will certainly be a need for very active diplomacy to maintain the good relations that Sri Lanka has built with the international community since January 2015, and not let the new decision of protection for War Heroes be considered as a move against Human Rights, or the rejection of the international principles on Human Rights.
If the call is for greater diplomacy with the new decision on War Heroes and Human Rights, in dealing with the international community, this also calls for new thinking on internal politics and governance, because it will certainly lead to major objections and protests by the Tamil community and its elected political leaders.
TNA and the political parties that form it will not be ready to accept the Presidents declared policy on dealing with War Heroes, on issues that relate to Human Rights.
The Unity Government facing its own divisions, will certainly have to face considerable opposition from the Tamil community and Tamil political forces in the new situation.
The ability to largely silence the Sinhala opposition on the issue of War Heroes will certainly open a new area of criticism and opposition to the government from the Tamil community, leading to serious changes from the political attitudes of January 2015.
This will be a major challenge to the government as it completes the mid-term in office and moves to the uncharted areas of approaching elections in Local Government and Provincial Councils, as well as move towards the next Presidential Election and General Election.
Away from War Heroism
Those who had increasing concerns about the probes now being carried out into those crimes involving the assassination and attacks on media personnel  Lasantha Wickrematunge and Prageeth Eknaligoda who were killed, and others who escaped killing, and that of sportsman Wasim Thajudeen, could have some relief with the Presidents statement, also at the Defence Ministry event at Kurunegala, that he was unable to protect those who are found guilty of acts not connected to national security, and were guilty of killing media personnel or sportsmen.
There has been much concern in recent weeks about the progress of these investigations, which are being conducted with a clear commitment by the investigative bodies, but appears to be delayed due to lack of cooperation from security forces institutions to which most of the suspects in these cases have been attached to.
There is also the new concern about these investigations, with the major political rivalries that some of these probes are leading to, especially the differences between Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and former Secretary of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on the alleged role of the Army personnel, from those at the very high level downwards, with these alleged crimes.
Although the President mentioned the killing of media personnel and sportsmen, there is also the matter of civilians who have been kidnapped and later killed by security forces personnel that have nothing to do with the war with the LTTE; and investigations showing a very clear commitment to crime, with no relation to the tasks of War Heroes.
Those standing out in these probes are from the Sri Lanka Navy, and there has been much concern that key persons in the Navy, from very high ranks in the past, could be interested in protecting these suspects.
There is the hope that the Presidents statement on no refuge to those who kill media personnel and sportsmen, will also extend to these civilians who were the victims of uniformed crime that has nothing to do with the fight with the LTTE.
Fasting Heroics
The man who was once known as the symbol of the political farce of fast has now been shifted to the National Hospital Colombo, to be treated as he continues his fast in opposition to being held in remand custody, when indicted for an offence involving nearly Rs 90 million of public funds, as well as the misuse of official transport on an unimaginable scale of corruption and fraud.
The JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa are making every effort to make this a fast of national political importance. There is a great deal of theatrics in the entire exercise, from the admission of Weerawansas daughter, who was also apparently fasting in sympathy with the father, to the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital. (Is she a child enough to be treated in the Childrens Hospital is an interesting question).
There are the leading JO members such as Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara who are championing the cause of the Fast Performer, with diverse positions that have little reality to what is actually taking place.
It was stated earlier that Weerawansa was fasting because his stay in remand custody prevents him from serving the people as a Member of Parliament.
The fact that he was permitted to attend the sittings of Parliament, which is the best way of serving his people, has been totally ignored. Vasudeva Nanayakkara now states that this "hunger strike was launched not urging the government to release him, but to protest against the burning issues in the country, namely the sale of state assets to foreigners, the rising cost of living and indirect taxes.
It seems wholly unfair that all those members in the JO decided to use this one member to demonstrate protests against the burning issues in the country.
Could not all of them launch a staggered fast, with more theatricals This farce is now straining the National Hospital. When is it likely to be taken up as Contempt of Court, which it very much seems to be

Colombo could be the Singapore of South Asia: Liang
Colombo is the most suitable city to be South Asias commercial hub, said Liang Thow Ming, Chief Marketing Officer of the US$ 1.4 billion Colombo Port City project being executed by the China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC).
Liang said Colombo is not only South Asias cleanest and most liveable city, it is also the capital of a country which has no quarrels with any of the nations in South Asia.
That makes Colombo an ideal place to create and run a regional commercial hub, he added.
People from all parts of South Asia could come to Sri Lanka and do business here without issues relating to their nationality, Liang pointed out, in a veiled reference to problems between India and Pakistan which hinder free movement of goods, services and people between the two countries.
In fact, from the general acceptability point of view, Colombo could be the Singapore of South Asia, Liang added.
A Singapore national of Chinese origin, Liang said the Colombo Port city (now renamed Colombo Financial City) will be an international commercial and financial hub with its own legal system based on the British model and labour laws attuned to the needs of modern businesses. It will have investments from all parts of the world and not necessarily from China.
Serving the Indian Market
However, the Financial City would be primarily serving the Indian market which is the single largest in the total South Asian market of 1.7 billion people, Liang said.
Indians who want to park funds abroad could do it in the Colombo Financial City, rather than in Dubai or Mauritius, as Colombo is the nearest and also culturally compatible, he noted.
Asked about Indias opposition to the project on security grounds, especially after the visit of Chinese submarines in 2014, Liang said that India has since dropped its opposition because Indian businessmen and government officials have realized that the Port City is nothing but a commercial venture in which Indians are welcome to invest.
He said he had met Indian entrepreneurs and even addressed the association of top Indian real estate developers at their conference held in Shanghai. The delegates expressed an interest in knowing more about the project. Liang also met the former Indian Deputy External Affairs Minister Shashi Tharoor, an ardent advocate of India-China cooperation.
According to Liang, it would cost a company about US$ 200 million to invest in land, buildings and business in the Colombo Port City. There are about 1,000 top Indian developers out of which 100 to 200 may be able to raise US$ 200 million, he estimated.
However, the question is whether it will be worthwhile for them to shift to Colombo from India or Dubai to Colombo, Liang said. According to the Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, four or five top Indian companies have expressed an interest in investing in the port city, but he would not name them. Following the Sri Lankan Presidential election in January 2015, in which the incumbent President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated the Port City project, was defeated, the new government stalled work on it for a few months to investigate some charges and also to negotiate the terms.
But after the modification of the terms, work is going full steam ahead, Liang said.

Date of massive islandwide strike to be announced on April 3: GMOA
The date on which the islandwide trade union action is to be launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) along with 150 other trade unions from ten political parties against SAITM, will be announced on Monday, April 3, 2017. The GMOA expects that President Maithripala Sirisena would intervene and offer a solution to the SAITM issue even at the last at moment, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that political parties and their trade unions that never unite on one platform, have united against SAITM under the leadership of the GMOA, while some of them are the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), JVP, Front Line Socialist Party., etc.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the Government had two months time to prevent the islandwide trade union action, but did not do so. Now the responsibility concerning patients and the public who undergo various difficulties, should be taken by the Government.
In Sri Lanka, only education and health have standards so far and now politicians try to destroy the only two fields that had some standard. Today shamelessly politicians support SAITM and not the public.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that health ministers received International awards because of the standard maintained in the health sector and not for their personal achievements. If strike action is the only language they could understand, the GMOA and 150 trade unions are ready to give it to them in the best possible way.
Only the current Health Minister stands by the SAITM, while all others including former health ministers have opposed it. May be the current Health Minister is having a more stronger relationship with SAITM than as Health Minister.
A fraudulent institution could not be forgiven in the name of victimized children, he added.

Govijana Development Council replaces Agrarian Service Centre
The Govijana Development Council will come into effect in another six months replacing the Agrarian Service Centre said Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
Even though the farmers are represented, the final decisions are taken by the officers. It is clearly stated in the Govijana Development Act that the farmers should be given priority but it was never implemented. In future farmers will be given the opportunity to make decisions and the power will be in their hands, he said.
The Minister was speaking at the launch of Thirasara Lanka (Sustain Lanka) programme at the BMICH yesterday.
Minister Dissanayake said out of 17 SDGs around 15 are in some way that connected to the Irrigation Ministry.
The ministry organized a meeting with nearly 27,000 officers attached to the agricultural field. We briefed them about the SDGs and the measures that need to be taken to make it a success. So we have carried out many initiatives in the agricultural sector and they have benefited the people, he said.
He further said that farmers who were affected by drought will be given compensations.
Minister Dissanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena understands the needs of the farmers in a better way.
People are today reaping the benefits of the January 8 victory. The change that took place on January 8, 2015, was not just a change of a president but it lead to a transformation in the whole system, he said.

## Title: An impetus for the economy
## Supertitle:

An impetus for the economy
Managing the economy is a challenging task especially in a volatile global environment. When the Yahapalana Government came to power in January 2015, the local economy was in dire straits with a huge foreign debt component. Debt servicing has become a huge burden, with some economists predicting that we would be paying off the debt for hundreds more years.
But that is just one of the challenges facing the economy. A coherent and swift response is needed to counter the threats that affect the economy. The Government has realised the need for such a mechanism and proposed to establish a Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) to deliver big, fast economic results for the country in the next three years. This was approved by Cabinet this week as concerns over the economy not growing fast enough looms over the government. Given the current trend in economic growth however, the Central Bank is hopeful of a 5-5.5 percent GDP growth by the end of 2017.
The Cabinet had earlier approved the proposal to launch a programme to enable Accelerated Economic Transformation in Sri Lanka and the setting up of a Central Programme Management Unit. Thereafter, the Minister of National Policies and Economic Management and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe engaged the services of the US Consultancy group McKinsey and Company to prepare a plan for the implementation of such a programme.
McKinsey consultants have met with government agencies and private sector stakeholders to review government and sector plans and conducted analyses to help define a three year Economic Delivery Programme (EDP) for Sri Lanka. The EDP will only focus on delivering economic outcomes.
The EDP will mainly focus on increasing median income, private sector jobs, investment (both foreign and domestic) exports and government revenue. These are all vital to rejuvenate the economy. The latter three are especially significant  Sri Lanka cannot become a key Asian player without enough investments and a rise in exports and Government revenue. The Prime Minister will be closely involved in the implementation of the economic revitalization programme.
The McKinsey consultants, who have experience in over 20 countries, have identified the three main areas - tourism, agriculture and manufacturing to be accelerated. Their assessment tallies broadly with the sentiments of most local economists and development planners. The Tourism plan calls for marketing and international connectivity efforts on Tier 1 countries like India, China, UK, Germany Russia and France and capturing the luxury segment in Tier 2 markets and hubs such as Middle East- Dubai, USA-New York, Singapore, Australia and Japan. This ties in with the proposed new marketing campaign of Sri Lanka Tourism and plans to increase aircraft movements at the Bandaranaike International Airport after April 6 following the successful completion of the runway overlay. SriLankan will fly to three more Indian cities this year and new airlines such as Silk Air will come in.
Manufacturing is another very important sector that must be given more attention. Plans for this sector will focus on textiles and apparel, electronics and food and beverage. Agriculture, on which much of the local population depends, will see improvements in end to end tea processing, coconut processing and rice cultivation. Both sectors are intimately linked to the export sector. The consultants have also identified the digital economy as a key driver of growth.
The consultants have proposed that the programmes be led by relevant ministers closely supported by an identified private sector Czar. This idea has been around for some time. Now that it has gained traction, the Government should explore the possibility of making an appointment.
The consultants have touched on several other aspects of the economy. One problem that both local and foreign investors face is the incessant red tape. Many have been driven to the point of abandoning their planned investments due to this factor. De-bureaucratising the economy is therefore essential. Fast tracking investments should be a priority for the government as there has been a drop of foreign and domestic investments in recent times. However, local politics has come into play in certain projects, threatening their early implementation. One such project is the Hambantota Port project, where certain opposition politicians tried to sabotage the agreement to be signed with China. That sent a negative signal to investors worldwide who were planning to come to Sri Lanka. Investors look for national policies on investment that will not change when a new Government comes to power, but such protests can make investors jittery. In fact, we need national policies on the economy, education, agriculture and health to move forward.
It is also vital to address the notion of inequality in development. The Western Province is growing at a pace similar to that of China while other provinces are lagging behind. This is not a good omen and the authorities should encourage new investors to move inland. The concerns of all stakeholders must be taken into account in going forward with development plans so that future generations will inherit a more prosperous country.

Inquiry into war crimes: Govt. would never condone use of foreign judges - Minister Samarasinghe
The present government would not allow any foreign tribunal or judge to inquire into the last phase of the war or war crimes, said Skills Development and Vocational Development Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe.
He made these observations yesterday, at a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium, in response to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's statement that the government had betrayed the country by agreeing with a resolution moved on Sri Lanka before the United Nation's Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
He said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had made those statements publicly. He added there are also the heads of the two main political parties and there is no way for such an inquiry.
He also said that they had stated that according to the provisions of the Constitution, there is no room for the involvement of foreign judges.
He also said that the then government objected to the Darushaman report, adding that the Darushaman Committee that was set up in an irregular manner, could not be compared with the resolution that had been moved by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
"When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Udulagama Commission to investigate into 19 incidents of human rights violations, on a request by the International Community to appoint international observers, the request had been agreed by the former President," said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. "The head of it was Indian Chief Justice Bhagawathi, while Darushaman was appointed to it by others. Later, without the approval of Bhagawathi, a report was formulated by others.
As the then Human Rights Minister I objected to it at the UNHRC."
He added that it was the Mahinda Rajapaksa government that agreed with foreign intruders not the incumbent good governance government. He added that Sri Lanka had defeated the most ruthless terrorist movement in the World. "However, our forces had not fought against the civilians, but the LTTE. They used more than 300,000 civilians as human shields to take our forces before a war tribunal," Minister Samarasinghe said. "But we were tactful to get rid of it."
He also said that when the Chilcot Report was released, the then Prime Minister of UK said that there was an industry to make charges. So all the allegations could not be accepted. "It is the same with Sri Lanka."

IPO Director commends Sri Lanka's efforts
Sri Lankas efforts to draft a national policy on Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions were commended by Director General of the Geneva based World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Dr. Francis Gurry
He said the WIPO supported twin national and cross-regional workshops on the theme to be held in Colombo in April will lead to legislation that will protect and give value to the intellectual property rights associated with Traditional Knowledge (TK), and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs) unique to Sri Lanka.
He said Sri Lanka enhances the national capacities in several spheres of intellectual property in the country in the recent years and continues cooperation and active engagement with the WIPO.
The Director General made these observations when he met Secretary to the Industry and Commerce Ministry Chinthaka S. Lokuhetti in Geneva on March 30 on the sidelines of the 37th Session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Industrial Designs and Geographical Indications (SCT) held from March 27-30 in Geneva.
Earlier in his address to the Standing Committee Meeting, Secretary Lokuhetti, said the Cabinet had approved amendments to the Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003, which aims to facilitate registration of Geographical Indications in Sri Lanka and safeguard the interests of the producers and exports of Ceylon Tea and Ceylon Cinnamon.
The proposed amendment as an interim measure to protect Geographical Indications (GIs) has now been gazetted, and will be tabled in Parliament shortly and National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka (NIPO) is making preparations to issue GI registration certificates accordingly, he said.
Secretary Lokuhetti also met with WIPO Assistant Director General (Global Issues Sector) Minelik Getahun, who was invited by the Government of Sri Lanka to participate in the national workshop and G-15 member States workshop on Traditional Knowledge, and Sri Lankas celebration of World IP Day to be held in the week of April 24 in Colombo.
The visit of Getahun will be the most high-level official visit from the WIPO since the visit of DG Gurrys to Sri Lanka in November 2013, when a 10 Point GoSL-WIPO Intellectual Property Action Plan was initiated, and under which significant progress has been made in all spheres of cooperation.
The Secretary also met WIPO Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific Director Andrew Michael Ong, where the support of WIPO was sought to formulate the national IP policy for Sri Lanka, accession to Madrid Protocol, develop P Hubs within Sri Lanka and strengthen the capacity of the National IP office (NIPO), in terms of structure, human resources and skills, including the development of middle level management.
It was agreed that relevant officials from Sri Lanka undertake a study visit to the Republic of Korea in June 2017 to learn from the best practices in establishing a coherent IP strategy.
Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ambassador R.D.S. Kumararatne, Director General of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka (NIPO) Geethanjali Ranawaka, Second Secretary of the Geneva Mission Dilini Gunasekera, and Gihan Indraguptha, Head of the G-15 Secretariat were participated.

Konta downs Venus to reach Miami final
MIAMI AFP March31, 2017 : Britain's Johanna Konta beat Venus Williams 6-4, 7-5 in a grueling battle Thursday to reach the WTA Miami Open final, where she will face Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.
The Australian-born 25-year-old broke Williams in the first game and played aggressively throughout the opening set. Williams fought back strongly in the second set, breaking to go up 3-1. But Konta broke back immediately and again for a 5-4 lead that allowed her to serve for the match. The American took advantage of some nervy play from the 10th-seed to break back, but Williams was unable to hold serve and that gave Konta a second chance to wrap up the contest, which she did after more than two hours.
Konta said she expects a big challenge ahead in order to capture her second title of the year after a Sydney crown. I am going to have a tough battle on my hands, Konta said. Caroline makes you work.

London Stadium set to host Cricket World Cup match
England are set to play in front of the biggest crowd to watch a cricket match in this country when the World Cup is staged here in 2019. The London Stadium is due to be one of 12 venues hosting 48 games - with two matches expected to be staged in Stratford, including one England fixture in front of a sell-out, 60,000 crowd. That will make it by far crickets top UK attendance, with the biggest dedicated cricket ground Lords having a capacity of 30,000.
Steve Elworthy, managing director of the 2019 World Cup, has travelled to New Zealand to study the best technology for drop-in cricket pitches that will be incorporated for Stratford.
ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said: It would be an amazing statement to have 60,000 people in a ground in the UK watching World Cup cricket. The London Stadium has the right dimensions.
There are not a lot of other stadiums that have the capacity to fit minimum boundaries in.
The London Stadium is not being considered for the World Cup opening ceremony - despite its unbeatable experience of staging the 2012 Olympics curtain-raiser -because of the drop-in pitch complications.
But certainly World Cup organisers will want an improvement on the opening to the 1999 World Cup at Lords - regarded as one of the worst sporting ceremonies ever -when lingering firework smoke obscured the crowds view of the shambolic proceedings.
The second game at the Olympic Stadium would probably be an India versus Pakistan match, if the draw allows, to take full advantage of the big Asian population in east London.
Cricket in Stratford - with the running track covered and the retractable seats removed - would also allow the stadium to showcase its potential as a multi-sport venue. The camera positions used for athletics would work equally well for cricket.
And the promise of cricket following on from the World Athletics Championships in August is also going to help sell an elusive naming rights deal.

The most powerful woman in sport
As FIFA's secretary general, Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura is one of the most powerful figures in world football.
Her appointment last June was historic and groundbreaking -- the 54-year-old from Senegal is the first woman, and the first non-European, to hold an executive post at soccer's governing body.
Nearly a year into her role, Samoura talks exclusively to CNN Sport about major issues plaguing the game, from inequality and racism to hooliganism and corruption.
FIFA facelift ongoing
Since May 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives, FIFA has been engulfed in claims of widespread corruption.
Two of the most powerful men in the sport -- then FIFA president Sepp Blatter and former UEFA president Michel Platini -- are serving lengthy bans from all football-related activities, while a Swiss criminal investigation is ongoing.
While Gianni Infantino promised to restore the organization's reputation upon his appointment as FIFA's new president, Samoura is intent on ensuring there is equal representation of men and women at all levels of its hierarchy.
"We are regenerating the organization in many ways," Samoura told CNN. "The facelift is still ongoing and we would like to see more women in senior positions. "When you look at FIFA at the low executive level, there are more women than men. In fact, 61% of women and less than 40% men. "But as we are getting higher to the football governing body hierarchy today we are only 42% of women and definitely the target is to have, by the end of the first mandate term of the president, 50% representation at all levels -- including at all levels in the confederation level."
Women at the center of football
While it took FIFA 100 years to appoint its first female executive, Samoura has set her sights on putting women at the center of the sport.
Making women's football self-sufficient and less dependent on the men's game by focusing on sponsorship and television rights is a must, she says. "We need to talk seriously to media broadcasters but also to our commercial partners so that they give additional consideration and definitely more revenue to women's competitions," the former United Nations director and representative said. "We are, let's say, heavily dependent on the men's World Cup in order to fund all of our other competitions.
"The overarching goal that I'd like to push whilst I'm still in FIFA is to make sure that the women's competitions generate their own resources, especially that the women's World Cup will generate enough resources to support the youth and grassroots and women's competitions in general."  CNN

No impact on Muslim settlements or villages: Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday denied reports that the gazette notification which created the Mavillu Conserved Forest in the North of Wilpattu affected Muslim settlements or villages in the vicinity.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha in the meantime added that President Maithripala Sirisena would not be revoking his gazette, contrary to certain media reporting it so.
The President in his Gazette of March 24 brought together the forest reserves of Mavillu, Weppal, Karadikkuli, Marichchikadi and Vilaththikulam under one Conserved Forest which will give it more legal protection. It has no impact on settlements, Minister Jayasekara explained.
The Minister was addressing a media briefing together with Minister Musthapaha at the Government Information Department yesterday.
The issue of Muslim IDPs being resettled within or inside Wilpattu has been an issue of contention wrought with ethnic flavour for many years and President Maithiripala Sirisena last year stated that a just solution would be arrived once forest land is properly surveyed, marked and gazetted. As a result, the four separate reserves were gazetted into one to ensure continuity in the reserve.
Muslim settlements, places of worship or any private land has been included in this gazette. There is a settlement to the West of Weppal, another to the North of Marichchikadi and one to the West of Vilaththikulam. By putting these forests together, these settlements have been clearly demarcated and left out, explained Jayasekara as he traced the gazetted areas on a map. The Sports Minister also lashed out at certain groups of making the issue an ethnic one, especially within the Muslim community, The Muslim community showed great support to the President and that became a turning point at the Presidential election. We are currently undertaking resettlement of the displaced and in Puttlam there are many IDPs. It is essential that they be resettled, this is a priority of the government. We are taking all measures for that. But,while we accept their right to their land, we must also note that our forest cover is receding and it is at a mere 25 percent right now. The President is trying to increase it up to 35 percent as the country moves towards sustainable development. This was part of that plan. There is no hidden agenda or racism here,he said.
We are not planning to take away any Muslim lands, the minister said and denied reports that over 100,000 acres of land have been included in this gazette. It is only 600 acres, said the minister.
As Jayasekara spoke of the issue as means to discredit the President in the eyes of the Muslims, he added that if anyone had grievances, they could present it to the President and he would look into it.
The gazette will not deliver injustice to Muslims, Minister Musthapha said and explained that the gazette only dealt with state land.
On March 24, a gazette signed by the President declared all the forests located near the Wilpattu North Sanctuary belonging to the Department of Forest Conservation as one Reserve under the 3A of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.
If there is any necessity to make variation of limits of conservation forest only the Minister may by Order published in the Gazette, declare that the limits of any conservation forest shall be altered or varied. An Order made by the Minister under subsection (1) will have no effect until it has been approved by the President and confirmed by Parliament and notification of such confirmation is published in the Gazette,it further stated.

Onus on Sri Lanka to win today
Battle with Bangladesh and the weather :
Sri Lanka have more than a spirited Bangladesh side to contend with when they face them in the third and final One-Day International at the SSC grounds today having to deal with the fickle weather conditions currently experienced in the city which they have no control of.
Bangladesh already one-up cannot lose the series. They can either win the series or draw it. As for Sri Lanka they have to win today to share the series, a no-result like the second ODI at Dambulla is no good for Bangladesh will easily pocket the ODI series for the first time against Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has all to play for today and cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha although its a new game said the confidence level of the team was very high.
If you talk to the players, theyre disappointed about their performance. But its up to us to get up tomorrow morning, come here, and give everything. Whether were in a winning position or winning every game, the players will be focusing on their own job first, said Gurusinha.
Any cricket board doesnt want to lose a series, especially at home. There is pressure and there will be criticism anyway. A few years ago everyone was criticizing Bangladesh and they have come up. We have to do that. Weve got to cop it if were not performing. Thats what weve got to do. Weve got to go out there and give everything we have. Then if we lose the game then Bangladesh has played very good cricket. Thats what well have to do tomorrow, he said.
I thought we played well in the second one when we batted  to get to 311. For our bad luck it rained  it would have been a good game. We have been training well. The confidence is very high. But they all know its a new game tomorrow. Its SSC and the wicket looks a really good one. Were expecting a great game tomorrow. The pressure is there. Whether we have won the series or not, the pressure is always there.
Gurusinha who believes in consistency in team selections said that there was no change in the Lankan team for todays game. We still have the same 12. The eleven we played in the second ODI and Seekkuge Prasanna will be in the 12. We have our team meeting later today, so well look at our options. But this wicket looks good, so there is no other changes, said Gurusinha.
Theres a little bit of grass on it, in the first hour and a half, the ball will move a bit. Itll be a good batting track at the end of the day. If youre prepared to play shots it will be good. I feel itll be a great game tomorrow, because SSC is a great wicket. Thats the reason were looking at going with the same 12 tomorrow, he said. Gurusinha spent a large part of his 12-year first-class career at SSC whom he represented in the Premier tournament and knows the behavior of the pitch like the back of his hand.
Gurusinha pointed out that it was the lack of consistency that has placed Sri Lanka in this current position.
Its just a team thats playing a good side and getting out to some bad shots. We do well in patches but the consistency is where the important part is and the patience as well. Bowling one good line and length and just being patient until the batsman makes mistakes  thats about getting into that habit about winning and knowing how to win from difficult situations. That has to come, and it has to come quick, said Gurusinha.
For today Danushka Gunathilaka and Upul Tharanga will continue to open till Kusal Perera and Niroshan Dickwella recover from their injuries.
Currently weve got Danushka and Tharanga, but weve got two other players coming in hopefully for the T20s we might get one more, which is Kusal Perera who was supposed to be in the squad and got injured  and then Dickwella, said Gurusinha.
Niroshan is out for about three weeks. He had a hit on his left thumb. Initially we thought he can play but then the X-rays showed us he has a fracture. Yesterday the surgeons here confirmed that as well. Theres no operation or anything, but hell be out for at least three weeks. Were hoping hell play the latter part of the provincial one-day tournament. Hes a great player. Those are the names were looking forward to. I feel our batting is strong and we can put a lot of pressure during selection. Im very much looking forward to watching these guys, especially the top order batting. We can build a really good team. At the end of the day well have to take 15 to England, and I think it will be a good challenge for us to pick that 15, he said. Following the Bangladesh series Sri Lankas next international assignment will be the ICC Champions trophy in England in June.

Petes holds the edge over Joes today
St.Peters College Bambalapitiya will be at full strength and raring to go when they take on St. Josephs college Maradana in their Singer A Divisioninter-schools league rugby first round match for the Rev. Fr. Basil Wiratunge Memorial Shields 59th encounter at St.Peters grounds in Bambalapitiya. Kick off will be at 4:15pm.
Led by nippy full back Diyath Fernando the Peterites got some good players who could be match winners for the Bambalapitiya outfit. Players such as centre Theekshana Dassanayaka, fly half Steffen Sivaraj, number eight Angelo Mendis, flanker Sajith Saram and scrum half Raveen Fernando should be marked well by the Joes if not they will be in deep trouble.
Peters, one of the strongest contenders for the Singer league this year, will be out for their fourth win when they meet their traditional rivals.
The Peterites coached by former junior Sri Lanka coaches in Colin Denish and Terence Henry, should have things their own way in this encounter.

Port City to attract $13bn in investment from 2018, says official

A Chinese-backed real estate project near Sri Lankas main port is expected to attract $13bn worth of investment from next year, the developer said yesterday to Gulf Times.
The $1.4bn Port City project by China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) started late last year as part of Beijings ambitious plans to create a modern-day Silk Road across Asia.
Liang Thow Ming, chief sales and marketing officer of CHEC Port City Colombo, the local company that handles the project for CCCC, said a third of the 269ha site had been reclaimed from the sea.
We are hoping to deliver the first site for construction by the end of 2018, Liang said in Colombo yesterday.
The reclamation was expected to be completed by the end 2019 and the company anticipated $13bn worth of investment in the form of housing, marinas, health facilities, schools and other developments over the next 30 years, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisenas administration restarted Colombos new waterfront development  the biggest foreign direct investment in the country  in 2016 after suspending the project because of concerns about overpricing and financial terms.
The new land is being built from the sea in the commercial heart of the capital adjacent to the main port and the historic Galle Face Green.
We are positioning the port city as a hub to the whole of South Asia... This is a huge market and a region growing very fast, Liang said.
The government has proposed to ease rules for investors in the project, although no bills have been presented to parliament.
Liang said 50% of the land would be allocated for housing, 30% for commercial offices and the rest for other activities.
India has objected to some aspects of the development near Colombo port, a major trade route for the South Asian giant.
Sirisenas administration rejected a proposal to give 20ha of freehold land to CCCC after India raised concerns.
Instead, the Chinese firm was given land only on a 99-year lease.

Raviraj murder case: Appeal filed by aggrieved party re-listed for support
The appeal filed by the wife of former TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj challenging the Colombo High Courts judgment to release the five accused, including three Navy Intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case, was yesterday re-fixed for support on May 19 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya were informed that second respondent accused, a Navy officer is yet to receive notices regarding the petition.
Two other Navy officers were represented by senior Counsel Anuja Premaratne.
The aggrieved party, Sasikala Raviraj, wife of the slain MP filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016 to acquit and release all accused from the case.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy Intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict which was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke as per the unanimous decision reached by the jury, following a month long trial. The jurys decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury. The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code. Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.
