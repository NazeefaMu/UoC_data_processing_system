Cash-strapped Chery to sell controlling stake

Chery Automobile Company has decided to trade its controlling stake for at least 20 billion yuan ($3.12 billion) as part of efforts to reboot itself in an increasingly competitive Chinese market.
The proposal was unanimously approved at the cash-strapped State-owned carmakers workers meeting on Tuesday because of a pay rise promise and hopes of a turn in the companys fortunes for the better, according to Chinese-language newspaper Securities Daily.
Last year, Cherys total deliveries in China fell 3.5 percent year-on-year to 680,000 vehicles, a far cry from its sales target of at least 900,000 units.
Its net profit in the year stood at 264 million yuan, some 60 million yuan less than the previous year. Its debt hovered at around 61.2 billion yuan by the end of 2017, up 7.33 percent from the previous year.
Established in 1997, Chery was once a popular carmaker in the country, becoming the first Chinese manufacturer to produce 1 million vehicles annually in 2007.
However, its sales have been falling since 2010 because of much more intense competition in the market and the poor positioning of its offerings. Chinese magazine Caixin said Cherys debt-to-asset ratio has hovered at around 75 percent over the past few years, while analysts said the percentage should stay between 40 and 60 percent for most usual automakers. The stake-for-cash deal is expected to be sealed in June, but Cherys largest shareholder so far, the government-controlled Wuhu Construction Investment, will retain veto powers to ensure the company does not move operations out of the province, according to Caixin.
Its other two shareholders are Wuhu Ruichuang Investment owned by Chery Chairman Yin Tongyue and Huatai Securities, which was shown to become a shareholder two months ago, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.
Analysts say that Cherys plan to introduce investors is in line with the National Development and Reform Commissions announcement in late May that it supports State-owned and private carmakers to attract investors and partners to become competitive. They say that it is a good thing if Chery can obtain the much-needed capital but that will not ensure its revival, which depends on a number of factors ranging from the shuffle of the management team to, more importantly, its product plans.
Several companies have shown interest in the floundering carmaker including property and insurance conglomerate Baoneng Group, investment firm Fosun International Ltd and Sichuan province-based liquor maker Wuliangye.
Baoneng, who now holds a 51 percent stake in Cherys joint venture Qoros, has been investing big in the automotive industry, with a special focus on the booming electric vehicle sector, setting up facilities to build cars and components in the country.
Earlier this year, Baoneng Chairman Yao Zhenhua vowed to invest 10 billion yuan a year in research and development for at least the next five years, a figure that is similar to the level invested annually by Chinas largest car group SAIC Motor.
But chances have become slim for Baoneng, despite an offer of over 25 billion yuan, because the Anhui government would prefer a simpler investor, Caixin quoted sources as saying.
The Anhui government believes bringing in Baoneng could complicate Cherys management structure, making the automaker hard to control in the future, sources told Caixin.
Earlier this year, Wuliangye and a government-owned automotive investment company acquired the controlling stake for Cherys low-end brand Cowin for 2.49 billion yuan.
An analyst who would like to remain anonymous said the liquor maker is unlikely to become the investor as well, as local authorities will be prudent in approving of a deal worth up to 25 billion yuan with a company that does not show signs of good return.
Besides Qoros and Cowin, Chery produces and sells cars under Chery and Jetour brands. It also has a joint venture in China with British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover.

Chinese mine explosion;  11 dead, 23 rescued
CHINA: Rescuers pulled 23 workers out of a mine in northeast China on Wednesday, hours after they were trapped underground by an explosion that killed 11 and left two others missing, state media reported.
Nine other workers were injured in Tuesdays blast at the iron ore mine owned by Huamei Group, a subsidiary of China National Coal Group Co, in Benxi, Liaoning province.
The blast took place when miners were dropping explosives down the one-kilometre (3,280-feet) -deep mine shaft, destroying the pits hoisting system, according to Xinhua.
State broadcaster CCTV had earlier reported that a truck carrying explosives had blown up near the mines entrance as workers were drilling a mining shaft.
Six miners were lifted out of the shaft at 5:20 am on Wednesday and 17 others were pulled up about two hours later, according to Xinhua. All were in good condition.
Authorities were still searching for the two missing miners.
The mines electricity, ventilation systems and hoisting system were brought back online, Xinhua said.
Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record.
A gas leak killed at least 18 people working in a coal mine in central Hunan province in May last year.
In December 2016, explosions in two separate coal mines in the Inner Mongolia region and in Heilongjiang killed at least 59 people.
Earlier that year, 33 miners were killed in a colliery explosion in October in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, and in September at least 18 were killed in a mine blast in the northwestern Ningxia region.
In another incident that captivated the countrys attention, four miners were rescued in January 2016 after they spent 36 days trapped in a collapsed gypsum mine in eastern Shandong province.

Beware the boomerang
The Australian aborigines have a wooden device shaped like an expanded v, and thrown into the air comes back to the thrower. It is called boomerang. A group of MPs who were in the government opposed the prime minister at the no-confidence motion and fell on their bottom with a thud'.
When this government was formed, they were short of a majority. These MPs jumped on the bandwagon for their own benefit. They were nothing else but a Trojan Horse sent to disrupt the working of the government and they succeeded to a certain extent.
Mahinda Rajapaksa was expected to welcome these prodigal sons with open arms and also kill the fatted calf. But things did not work to their satisfaction. So they will sit as a separate unit.
This is not the first time that some of them have crossed the parliamentary aisle.
When the hustings come round, they do not have the strength to stand alone. So they will obviously stand with the buddies'. The voters will do well to know that they only think of their own benefit and replace them at the hustings with younger men. They have not done anything to benefit the country. So they are not indispensable.

On a  common  cause...
Todays Youth are highly knowledgeable and healthily skeptical. They are armed with talents and knowledge in diverse fields. They are also ambitious and eager to make a difference everyday in all fields of work and as leaders in the community.
Young people constitute one quarter of the worlds population, and one third of the population in developing nations.They have been in the forefront of drives for equality and justice through youth social movements throughout the world. They have led movements against political action and anti-corruption in the recent past. There is also an increased recognition in the decision making process lead by the youth and continuous effort has been made to bring young people to the table in development planning.
The Commonwealth Youth Forum, which runs parallel to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), is one such platform which has been set for youth to build cross-cultural connections and networks to recognize challenges, create youth led initiatives and influence decision makers in ensuring that youth have a say in the future. Aptly themed as Powering Our Common Future the 2018 Youth Forum saw many youth with potentials coming together in London, UK. Sri Lankas youth representative Sachinda Dulanjana Witharana is a youth of many talents.
With the other Regional Finalists of the Commonwealth Youth Worker Award 2013 at the Asia Regional Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting held in New Delhi, India
His presence was not only noted but he also made an impact as his nomination was accepted for the Commonwealth Youth Council Elections 2018 which was held during 11th Commonwealth Youth Forum.
I was one of the three Sri Lankans who were running for different positions of Commonwealth Youth Council this year. I ran for the position of Asia Regional Representative for Commonwealth Youth Council. My election campaign slogan was #MissionContinues, Sachinda said.
Around 53 Commonwealth Member States vote for the candidates through their national delegates. Though he did not win the position being a candidate for the event itself was a great achievement for Sri Lanka.
It was a very stiff competition but the experience was worth it. I will continue my mission to serve young people across the Commonwealth and beyond with my experience, he said.
Delivering a motivational session to a group of students in Polonnaruwa
Recalling his roots Sachinda says, The beginning of my Commonwealth journey dates back to the 9th Commonwealth Youth Forum 2013 which was held parallel to CHOGM 2013 in Hambanthota. I was awarded as a regional finalist (Asia Region) with the Commonwealth Youth Worker Award 2013 at the event.
Soon he was invited to take part as a guest panelist on Youth Work for the Asia Region Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting 2014 which was held in New Delhi, India. He says that his experience in the role as the speaker in the Sri Lankan youth parliament came in handy while taking part in such events.
Meeting the Lord Speaker of House of Lords at a special reception
Next he took part in the 10th Commonwealth Youth Forum 2015 which was held in Malta in connection CHOGM 2015, Malta. He had held the position of Asia Regional Representative (2016/2017) for the Commonwealth Student Association which is the official voice of students across 53 Commonwealth Member States.
The former student of Ananda College, Colombo, had been a former Official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations who took part in United Nations General Assembly 2016. He was also a former UN Youth Adviser on Social Work in the United Nations Youth Advisory Panel 2014/2017 for UN Country Team.
I am a person who loves to live in the moment. I see each and every achievement in my life as something to celebrate with the same importance as it motivates me to do better in everything I do. However among all these achievements I believe that my greatest achievement was being able to become an Anandian by passing the Grade five scholarship examination. That is where the journey began! Sachinda explained.
Sachindas passion lies in community service work. He is the founder of the H3 Foundation  Hearts and Hands of Humanity; a youth led voluntary organization which promotes volunteerism. Incepted in 2012 with the vision of setting a convenient platform for young people to get engaged as volunteers according to their own capacity and time availability, the H3 Foundation mostly focuses on people with special needs.
Youth need to play a crucial role for any social cause. Young people should lead the path as pioneers with the energy and passion they have to make this world a better place. Involving young people in social service activities will also give them a different view of life where they could cope and tolerate even the hardest situations in their lives, Sachinda opined.
Throughout the past seven years I have empowered many young people across the country by delivering sessions on areas such as gender equality, motivation, leadership, sustainable development, volunteerism etc. I will do the same in the future while expanding the number of beneficiaries. I have been working on increasing youth participation in the democratic process as I have a special interest on that area. Now I can accelerate my mission with all these international exposure, he said.
Elaborating his future plans Sachinda says, I also hope to continue my mission of empowering Sri Lankan youth by showing my path to success by setting my own self as an example for a person who has emerged from the grassroots while going through many hardships in life.

Companies pledge to cut plastics use on World Environment Day
Major companies across sectors, including ITC, RB, PepsiCo, Nestle and Hyundai, have pledged to reduce usage of plastics in their businesses and enhance recycling on the World Environment Day.
Homegrown consumer goods major ITC said over the next decade it would deploy solutions so that 100 per cent of its product packaging will be reusable and recyclable besides scaling up its solid waste management programmes.
Similarly, another FMCG firm RB also committed to make 100 per cent of its plastic packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025.
Food and beverages major PepsiCo India also pledged that it would explore ways to scale up recovery and recycling, equivalent to 100 per cent of its post-consumer plastic waste in the next few years. The company will also pilot first-ever plant-based, 100 per cent compostable packaging for Lays and Kurkure snacks products in India.
The problem of solid waste management is one of epic proportions and requires each organ of the society and more so, enterprises that are large economic organs of the society, to make a meaningful contribution, ITC Ltd Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said.
The company said already over 99 per cent of waste generated in its operations is recycled and its solid waste management initiatives extend to 10 states across the country, covering cities, towns, villages and temples at present.
Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA), the apex body of cement producers in India, also pledged to minimise single-use plastic by the sector. CMA President Shailendra Chouksey said the cement industry is confident of using all plastic waste that can be made available by local bodies within a radius of 200-250 kms from any integrated cement plant. We will have the potential to consume 12 million tonnes of plastic waste in our kilns annually by 2025, resulting in conservation of conventional fuels such as coal to the extent of 10 per cent, he said.
RB said it is committed to removing or reducing plastic packaging...and investing in research into alternative materials and it has been propagating responsible use of plastic for packaging through the 4R approach -- reduce, reuse, replace, and recycle. PepsiCo India President and CEO Ahmed ElSheikh said the company has been working to reduce the impact of its packaging on the environment. We are committed to working with partners to leverage new technologies and developing sustainable, environmentally friendly packaging solutions, he said.
ElSheikh further said, ...India will be among the first countries to pilot this new, sustainable packaging solution developed by PepsiCo. We plan to launch this pilot in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Nestle India also said it will continue with its efforts to reduce, recycle and recover towards protecting the environment. In 2017, the company said it reduced packaging material weight by approximately 1,532 tonnes by ensuring eco designing of packaging in a sustainable way. We have initiated projects on waste management by engaging with relevant stakeholders, Nestle said, adding it also supported initiatives to recycle or recover energy from used plastic.
Auto major Hyundai Motor India also announced plans to reduce the usage of plastics across all its offices, dealers and service networks. Commenting on the initiatives, HMIL Director - Sales and Marketing Rakesh Srivastava said: This years theme is Beating Plastic Pollution, for which we are exploring green alternatives to reduce the usage of plastics across all our offices, dealers and service networks.
Hyundai said its initiatives will focus on reducing the usage of plastics at its manufacturing plant in Sriperumbudur near Chennai and across all its 493 Hyundai dealerships and 1,309 service workshops.
The company, along with its vendor partners, will also opt for alternate packaging material for spare parts and usage of water-borne paints. Similarly, as part of the World Environment Day initiative, Volkswagen asked its customers to book appointments for water-less car wash, a special service initiative from the brand to assist in water conservation and get saplings for plantation.

Deepika Padukone made her big Hollywood debut opposite Vin Diesel in last years xXx 3: The Return Of Xander Cage. But ever since, there have been murmurs that the production team is all set to get Deepika to reprise her role as Serena in the next installment of the action franchise.
Although DJ Caruso had confirmed about Miss Padukones inclusion in xXx 4, its not happening anymore.
Deepika has refused the offer. She was keen on doing it but she is unhappy with the way her Hollywood career is shaping up. Priyanka, despite a smaller role in Baywatch, has made a bigger impact on outside shores. She has turned down the role.
But the real reason happens to be something else.
Our source reveals, Deepikas dates for xXx 4 were needed around October end - December. She couldnt do the film because shes kept her dates free around that time as shes tying the knot with Ranveer Singh. Unless there are last minute changes in dates of the marriage, she wont be seen in xXx 4 for sure.

The match at the Queens Park Oval in Trinidad is the first of a three-match series.
Opening the batting alongside Kraigg Brathwaite after captain Jason Holder chose to bat first on winning the toss, the 36-year-old left-hander watched his partner depart in just the third over.
Brathwaite stabbed indeterminately at a probing delivery from experienced seamer Suranga Lakmal to give wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella a straightforward catch and departed for three.
Smith, who last represented the regional side against England in his native Grenada in 2015, would have been especially keen to make an impact amid speculation by critics that his recall, despite a prolific regional season with the Windward Islands, was more of a backward step for a West Indies team needing to build a more competitive squad for the future.
But his ambitions were undone by sharp work from Dinesh Chandimal as the Sri Lankan captains throw to the wicketkeeper from midwicket found the opener just short of his ground after he was called through for a single by new batsman Kieran Powell.
Powell, the regular opening partner alongside Brathwaite throughout the 2017 season, sought to impose himself on a Sri Lankan bowling attack comprising three seamers and two spinners.
It was surprising however that no place was found in their final 11 was found for slow bowler Akila Dananjaya, who had taken eight wickets on his debut in his countrys last Test, a victory over Bangladesh in early February which clinched a 2-0 series win.
Powell and Shai Hope put on 40 for the third wicket and looked to be getting on top of the tourists bowlers when Lahiru Kumara struck.
Keen to expose the West Indians vulnerability to short-pitched bowling which was quite noticeable in their last series in New Zealand six months earlier, Kumara unsettled both batsmen with his hostility on a placid pitch.
Yet it was a full-pitched delivery which accounted for Powell, the upright left-hander being bowled off the inside-edge for 38 by a ball which swung sharply back into the batsman.
Hope (29 not out) and Roston Chase (11 not out), two of the seven Barbadians in the West Indies team, navigated the remaining minutes to the lunch interval and will carry the battle into an afternoon session when Sri Lankas senior bowler Rangana Herath, the most successful left-arm spinner in Test history, will be expected to play a greater role.

Brief scores at lunch:
West Indies 99-3 (K. Powell 38, S. Hope 29 n.o.; S. Lakmal 1-20, L. Kumara 1-30)

First winner as chief guest  at 40th anniversary show
Sri Lankas first-ever school cricket awards show will be celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. When its four decades of success is celebrated on a grand scale, there is no better person to invite as the chief guest than the first-ever recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title, the then Royal College captain Ranjan Madugalle.
It will be a fitting tribute to the Chief ICC Match Referee Madugalle when he attends the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year grand finale, to be held shortly, as the chief guest.
The 59-year-old former Sri Lanka captain has confirmed his participation at the Mega Event as the chief guest, exactly 40 years after he had became the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1979.
Madugalle, during his last interview with the writer, recalled his early days as a schoolboy cricketer and identified those as the best moments in his cricketing life.
He stated that he had thoroughly enjoyed his school cricket career at Royal College, Colombo. He said that he had made some good and dear friends both on and off the field, not only with his team mates but also from the opposing teams and his numerous supporters.
That alone shows the friendly atmosphere in which the game had been played, compared to unwarranted rivalry often witnessed at present. The former Royal, NCC and Sri Lanka captain said he was honoured and privileged to become the first-ever recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award some four decades ago, although he had never thought of individual glory.
Madugalle paid a rich tribute to the Sunday Observer and its publisher Lake House (ANCL) for understanding the need to recognize the outstanding performances of schoolboy cricketers during an era which did not have any inter-school tournament structure or an awards show to inspire schoolboy cricketers. Born on April 22, 1959 in Kandy, Ranjan Senerath Madugalle was one of the most technically skilled Test batsmen that Sri Lanka has ever produced. He came to the limelight from his early days with a rich harvest of runs with the willow in successive seasons and had the honour of captaining the Reid Avenue boys at the centenary Royal-Thomian encounter in March, 1979.
He won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award and went on to represent Sri Lanka at the second ICC World Cup to make his ODI debut in the same year.
Madugalle made his Test debut a memorable one, scoring a half century (65) at Sri Lankas inaugural Test against England at the Sara Stadium in 1982.
In fact, Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga, the second to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award, were first ever half centurions in Sri Lankas Test history.
In his recent interview, Madugalle was of the view that there are too many matches for a school team to honour during a season.
A school team plays more matches now. We played about 11 matches for a season then, but now we see most school teams playing more than 20 matches a season.
This practice does no good for the physical being of young players, said Madugalle, adding that there should be a right balance between quality and quantity.
Going down memory lane, the former Royal skipper said that there were no competitions or tournaments during their time. We had only friendly games. But almost every inter-school game is competitive now, he said. Talking about school cricket in the modern era, Madugalle said that there were fewer opportunities for schoolboy cricketers in the past.
Now they have more opportunities. Television gives the best of sport, so the fans could witness the live action in the comfort of their homes. The poor standard of cricket that is dished out at present in school matches could also be another reason, he was quoted as saying.
Madugalle said he had thoroughly enjoyed his school cricket career while adding that it was possibly the best moments in his cricketing life. Some of my early life learning lessons were picked up on the cricket field. That was a memorable period, he added.
The former Sri Lanka captain turned Chief ICC Match Referee said he was honoured and privileged to become the first Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year.
In fact, we even didnt know that there was such an award on offer. We played traditional friendly matches to enjoy the game and not for competition or personal glory. But it was great to feel that your hard work as a schoolboy cricketer is appreciated at the end of the season, he continued. When questioned about his progress from schoolboy cricketer to Sri Lanka captain and then as ICC Match Referee to the Chief ICC Match Referee, the position he holds at present, Madugalle said he was |absolutely lucky to have been a part of each of these phases and progress to the level what he is today.
I have learnt many a lessons during each of those phases, not only in cricket but also lifes experience. It has been a privilege, something I will treasure, he said.
Madugalles advice to present day schoolboy cricketers is simple but exemplary. Enjoy the game! It is the foremost. Play by the laws. Always remember that the game is bigger than the individual. Respect your opponent as much as you respect your own team mates.
Since its humble beginnings at Nawarangahala way back in 1979 with Madugalles crowning glory, Sri Lankas premier school cricket awards show has come a long way to become the most sought after event in the school cricket calendar.
Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires Association with the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests continues under three divisions. Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.

Forbes names Kohli as crickets top earner
Indias Virat Kohli is once again the only cricketer on the annual list of the world's 100 highest paid athletes, published today (Wednesday) by Forbes magazine.
Kohli is No.83 on this year's list with estimated earnings of US$24m (approx AU$31.4m), of which $20m is estimated to come from endorsements and the remaining $4m from his salary.
Kohli was 89th on last year's list with estimated earnings of US$22m.
The list is headed by American Boxer Floyd Mayweather, whose estimated earnings of US$285m are more than double those of Argentine football superstar Lionel Messi, who is second on the list with US$111m.
The list is dominated by athletes from America's NFL, NBA and MLB competitions, although the top five athletes  Mayweather, Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Conor McGregor and Neymar  are from either football or combat sports.
There are no female athletes on the list.
There are no Australians from any sport on the list and given the final entrant in the top 100, NBA player Nicolas Batum, earned just shy of US$23m, it's unlikely any Aussie cricketers will appear on the list anytime soon.
In the Australian Financial Review's Top 50 Sports Earners list from late last year, David Warner was the leading cricketer with an estimated AU$4.73m, putting him 12th overall.
Shane Watson, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Marsh, James Faulkner, Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Starc were the other cricketers on the AFR's list last year.
Warner and Smith have been hit hard financially this year following their suspensions for the Cape Town ball-tampering saga, with both players losing their IPL contracts as well as their deals with CA.
Forbes reports that Kohli, 29, earns most of his money from sponsors like New Era, Tissot, Oakley, Uber, Puma, Audi, Colgate-Palmolive, Herbalife and Pepsi.
Pepsi is included on the Forbes list of Kohli's sponsors even though he publicly distanced himself from the soft drink company last year.
"If I myself wont consume such things, I wont urge others to consume it, just because I am getting money out of it," Kohli reportedly said.
"When I started my fitness turnaround, it was more of a lifestyle thing initially.
"If something goes away from that, I would not want to be a part of that or be promoting that."
Kohli's earnings are impressive, however he has yet to reach the heights of the man he replaced as India's skipper, MS Dhoni, who Forbes listed at 22 on their top 100 in 2014 with an annual pay packet of $US30 million. - cricket.com.au

Fraudster in USA gets passport back
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered to release the passport belonging to a suspect who had been charged for preparing fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The magistrate had ordered to impose the travel ban on Hiripitiyage Wilson Samarasinghe regarding the alleged preparing of fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The suspect had fraudulently prepared letters as a former participant at an athletic event and another letter purportedly issued by the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Athletics Association, saying that he had participated in athletics and submitted it to the US Embassy to obtain a visit visa.
The US Embassy officer Ann Florence Nicholas had found that they were fake documents.
Earlier, the suspect had given a statement to the police that his first name was Hiripitiyage Premarathne and later had legally changed his name as Hiripityage Sugath Priyantha in 1999. After changing his name, he had been in the US in 1999 and worked at a fuel station and in 2004 had returned to Sri Lanka.

Fresh impetus for Unity Government
It must be cause for comfort, indeed, for all those who worked towards the January 8 revolution, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledging to continue with the Unity Government for the rest of its term. Addressing an Ifthar breakfast ceremony at Temple Trees on Tuesday, the Premier, while admitting that there were issues to be resolved with President Maithripala Sirisena, nevertheless, pledged to continue with the present arrangement until the life of the current parliament runs out in August 2020, to realise the pledges given to the people at the last Presidential and Parliamentary elections. We will perform our duties with the support of all constituent members of the National Government and the people of all races and religions, an English daily quoted the PM as having said.
True, relations between the two constituent parties of the Unity Government is not what it was at the beginning of honeymoon period. At the time, both parties were getting on like a house on fire, with President Sirisena even attending UNP functions held at Sirikotha, the first time a SLFP leader had done so since S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike left the Greens in 1951. There was also much camaraderie between members of both sides, with SLFP ministers even defending the UNP actions, in parliament against the criticisms of the Joint Opposition.
However, with the passage of time, relations soured, chiefly due to the policy differences between the parties, with the SLFP not seeing eye to eye with the UNP's way of doing things and went public with their opposition. Things came to a head with the bond issue, with both sides pointing fingers at each other. The February 10 Local Government election results exacerbated matters that eventually led to 16 SLFP ministers and state/deputy ministers leaving the government, following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Premier Wickremesinghe.
Without doubt, all those who put their shoulders to the wheel to bring to fruition the late Ven. Maduluwave Sobitha thera's efforts to rid the country of the authoritarian regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa will welcome the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister. For all the recriminations, even the President, from all appearances, has not shown any signs of parting ways, which augurs well for the country. With another two years for the completion of its term, the Unity Government cannot at this point of time afford to jettison all it has worked for, to put the country back on track.
There are many achievements for which the Unity Government can be proud of. It has settled much of the mountainous foreign debts accumulated under the Rajapaksas, to make the country a debt free one for the future generations. Development work is going on apace though not manifested clearly to the public. However, its major achievement, without doubt, is the restoration of the lost rights of the people under an autocratic regime. There is an air of freedom and a sense of independence collectively enjoyed by the people today. The judiciary is no longer under the thumb of the executive, as in the past, and the Prime Minister no less appeared before a Presidential Commission at a time relations between the President and the PM were very much on the level. On all fronts, there is a sense of freedom, justice and fair play which, alas, the people are yet to fully appreciate.
Besides, there is much to be achieved in the remainder of the period of the Unity Government. Hence, the importance of maintaining the status quo. Like the Premier indicated, much of the pledges have to be fulfilled during a short period. On the reconciliation front, some advances have been made, though, things are moving at snail's pace at present. With a joint UNP-SLFP government in place, it will present an ideal opportunity for the national question to be resolved collectively, by both parties, who did not see eye to eye on the ethnic question in the past.
The exit of the 16 SLFP members from the government also augurs well for a smooth run for the President and the Prime Minister in attaining their objectives. It was no secret that it is the renegades who were the main stumbling block towards success of the present arrangement with their loyalties clearly with the Rajapaksa camp. Their departure, certainly, would clear the decks for the President and the PM to continue with the task at hand unhindered.
Time, though, is running out and the duo should get about the business of working towards honouring the pledges made to the public without delay. There is much frustration among the public at the failure to punish the crooks of the last government. With the special courts now all set to function, it is hoped that things would get moving at a faster pace and all those responsible made to pay.
All efforts, in the meantime, should be diverted to ease the living costs of the people, taking into consideration the disenchantment that was given expression to, on Feb 10. Ideally, a road map should be set for the next two years through which the Unity Government could aspire to reach its targets.

Funds transferred to Aluthgamage's account - Witness
A trade union treasurer said he took measures to transfer trade union funds amounting to Rs.3.9 million among three individuals including former Minister Mahindananda Aluthagamage.
Testifying before the Colombo High Court, witness Douglas Kahawage, the Treasurer of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress affirmed in court that he took measures to transfer the funds.
Kahawage gave evidence in a case filed against former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs. 3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
However, he admitted in court that MP Aluthgamage had repaid the money owed to Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress through three cheques. Further trial into the matter was fixed for August 2 by High Court Judge Sampath Wijeyaratne.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,000,000, misappropriated Rs. 1,900,000, and misappropriated another Rs. 1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October, 2012 and April, 2013.
The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code, listed 13 persons as witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items.

Guatemala volcano  eruption likened to Pompei
GUATEMALA: Guatemala is reeling in the aftermath of a devastating volcanic eruption that has buried whole towns and claimed at least 69 lives in a disaster that is being compared to the volcanic eruption in Pompeii.
The death toll continues to rise in Guatemala as charred bodies are pulled out of the debris, with only a fraction of the victims identified so far.
El Rodeo, a town which felt the volcanos full fury when it erupted on Sunday, is almost entirely buried under ash and rock.
A makeshift morgue in the nearby city of Escuinta is overrun with desperate relatives searching for missing loved ones amongst the dead.
Horrifying photographs and videos have been shared on social media showing the pyroclastic flow soaring into towns, with onlookers suddenly finding themselves with just seconds to get out of the way.
Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving currents of extremely hot gas and volcanic matter that pour down volcanic slopes at incredibly high speeds.
They contain a mix of hot lava rocks ranging from pebbles to boulders, pumice, ash and volcanic gasses.
Pyroclastic flows can reach speeds of up to 430mph and temperatures of about 1,000 degrees Celsius.
The most infamous pyroclastic flow in history occurred in AD79, when a pyroclastic flow from erupting Mount Vesuvius buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Most of the residents of were buried before they could escape, and the towns were smothered in ash.
The cities were rediscovered in 1599 and have been excavated over the years, largely preserved due to the lack of air and moisture from the dense ash blanket.
Guatemalas national disaster agency CONRED is advising residents to stay away from ravines and valleys where pyroclastic flows tend to spread.
Volcn de Fuego - meaning volcano of fire in Spanish - is situated 25 miles from the capital Guatemala City.
This is the volcanos second eruption this year, with an ash cloud sent up hundreds of metres into the air on February 1.

The initiative received tremendous support and positive feedback and was declared the national program for the Puttalam District for the World Environment Day
As Sri Lanka celebrates 70 years of independence, we are celebrating 70 years of Hemas and this initiative was one of the key programs we have planned. We are privileged to be a part of the national program of Puttalam, said Shiromi Masakorala, General Manager Group Sustainability and Corporate Communication speaking at the event.
The Kotakanda Forest Reserve has been affected due to the surface soil being used for development projects that were done around Sri Lanka. This has caused the area to dry up and it was important to take immediate action to reverse the environmental damage that has been caused.
Research data shows that 70 years ago the country had a 50 percent forest reserve, and over the last few decades, Sri Lankas forest cover has depleted significantly, creating changes in the environment that have far reaching consequences, added Masakorala
The reforestation is a part of the Groups effort to protect and increase the forest cover in Sri Lanka.The Group, understanding the importance of safeguarding and increasing the forest cover in Sri Lanka have launched a series of initiatives through the Hemas Green Club, the first in which theyworked with the Rainforest Protectors to reforest a two-acre land in Kalawana, in close proximity to Sinharaja.
During the year, the Group hopes to continue their efforts and expand the area to the rest of the five-acre Kotakanda forest reserve, while creating awareness and encouraging its employees and other stakeholders to take part in such initiatives.

Huawei inches closer to Apple in smartphone shipments
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said on Wednesday that it will ship nearly 200 million units of smartphones this year, close to its arch rival Apples 200 to 210 million annual shipments.
Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huaweis consumer business group, said We will ship about 200 million units of smartphones this year, up from 153 million units last year, thanks to the growing popularity overseas.
On Wednesday, Huawei also unveiled a new technology which it claimed can boost smartphones image processing efficiency by 60 percent while lowering down chip energy consumption by 30 percent.
Yu said GPU Turbo, as the new technology is called, is part of Huaweis intensified push to beef up spending on research and development. GPU Turbo can help our low-to-middle-range smartphones to have the performance roughly as good as rivals premium devices, he added.
In the first quarter of 2018, Huawei shipped 39.3 million units of smartphones worldwide, with its global market share hitting a new high of 11.8 percent. Huawei has maintained the line between keeping a strong domestic position while slowly upscaling its brand image in international markets with dividends paying off as its growth rate reached 13.8 percent year over year, beating the global average of 2.9 percent decline, according to market research company International Data Corp.
Outside of China, Huawei is growing and gaining market share across the Western Europe region, an otherwise declining market, and is particularly strong in Spain, Germany, and Italy, IDC said in a research note. According to IDC, though Huaweis high-end smartphones are popular in China, the bulk of its shipments are of the more affordable class of smartphones, and it also introduced a few new models in the low-end and mid-range segments. That is in part why Huawei introduced the GPU Turbo technology to optimize its cost-effective handsets. (Chinadaily)

Hundreds of homes destroyed by  Hawaii volcano lava
US: Hundreds of oceanfront homes have been destroyed by lava flow from Hawaiis Kilauea volcano, officials said Tuesday.
We lost hundreds of homes in Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland overnight, but we dont have exact figures, Janet Snyder, a spokeswoman for Hawaii County, told AFP.
She said the lost homes were in addition to 117 others destroyed since the volcano began erupting on May 3, forcing the evacuation of 2,500 people.
The latest two communities affected by the lava flow had been ordered evacuated beforehand and there were no immediate reports of any casualties.
One of the homes lost was that of Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim, Snyder said.
His second home was claimed by lava, she said.
The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said that an overflight early Tuesday confirmed that lava had completely filled Kapoho Bay, inundated most of Vacationland and had covered all but the northern part of Kapoho Beach Lots.
It said that a series of earthquakes had rattled the island for most of Monday night and into Tuesday morning, including one with a magnitude 5.5 that generated an ash plume.
Lava has engulfed an area of about eight square miles (20 square kilometers) since the volcano -- one of five on Hawaiis Big Island -- began erupting.
Scientists believe that volcanic activity can be a precursor to a major eruption, similar to the Kilauea eruption in the mid-1920s. - AFP

I have had no contact with Mahendran after his removal- PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday told Parliament that he has not been in contact with former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran after the latter was removed from the post.
The Prime Minister was responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, who queried as to why he could not make a personal effort to bring back the former CB Governor.
You have had close contacts with Mahendran to an extent that you at a previous time had been aware that he was going abroad to attend a wedding. As the appointing authority, you have a responsibility to bring him back, the MP told the PM.
Mahendran kept me informed of his foreign visits when he was working under me as the Central Bank Governor. The incumbent CB Governor and other Ministry Officials also do the same.
That obligation is not there when they no longer hold the position. I have had no contacts with Mahendran even when I went before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to give evidence. It was his habit to change houses from time to time and that is a general practice in Singapore. I am unaware of his whereabouts and he had left the country without informing me, the PM replied.
MP Dissanayake in his question from the Prime Minister requested details on the actions taken by the Government to arrest former CB Governor Mahendran and fugitive ex-diplomats Udayanga Weeratunga and Jaliya Wickramasuriya.
The PM, making a detailed reply on the process of legal actions against each of the three individuals, said a formal request has been made asking to issue an Interpol Red Notice against former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Wickramasuriya and that request is now being processed. He stated a formal request has been made on May 17 to extradite former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, who is now being detained at the UAE.
The Prime Minister said an Interpol Red Notice has been issued against former CB Governor Mahendran. He, however said the Singaporean Government has informed Sri Lankan authorities that it cannot arrest a suspect upon the Interpol Red Notice as per the laws in Singapore.
Therefore, they have asked us to make a formal request to extradite Mahendran and we have acted accordingly, he added.

ICT industry poised to attain us$ 5 bn status - pm
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lankas ICT sector can attain the status of a $5 bn industry effectively with the right funding and appropriate investment and support which are now adequately available.
The Premier was addressing the ICT Forum 2018 organised by the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka on the theme of Information technology and its role in the modern organisations held in Colombo yesterday.
He said that promoting a knowledge economy is one of the main objectives of the government since it will be essential for the economic development in the next decade.
The quality of education and training are very important to create a knowledge economy. The provision of ipads to schoolchildren by the Education and Finance Ministry is commendable. The Prime Minister further said the government had identified the ICT sector as a priority focus area within the newly established National Export Strategy. The ICT industry is Sri Lankas fourth largest export earner. We should produce skilled and talented people in IT, communication, logistics and manufacturing sectors to create a knowledge based economy, he said.
Despite the debt burden, our aim to achieve US$ 20 billion target in exports by 2020 and increasing GDP in order to giving better living standards to the people.
In order to achieve this objective, we should make Sri Lanka a hub in ICT, logistics, manufacturing and transport and tourism sectors. The conducive environment, availability of skilled manpower, innovation and technological change to be competitive and improve productivity are key factors in this regard.
As a country with a low population, we have to go in for semi automation.At present, the nations IT industry is poised for progress, he added.
The Governments national budget for 2018 under its IT initiative will provide Rs.3 billion to the ICT sector over the next three years by way of grants, equity investments, credit facilities, mentoring and technical support for local startups, to attract foreign startups, create an enabling environment to support the establishment of incubators, as well as to enable SME IT companies to double their revenue in three years.
We have set aside Rs. 300 million for 2018 to implement various activities through the Export Development Board (EDB) and depending on the progress, we hope to allocate more funds to the sector, he added.

JO split, cause for SLFP to lose post - Minister
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday stated that the vote against Dr. Sudharshani Fernadopulle was not personal and that it was the split within the Joint Opposition that had led to her loss.
It was nothing to do with the individual.We saw that many in their camp, especially the Rajapaksas had left by the time the vote was taken, Minister Senaratne addressing the weekly media briefing said yesterday.
Explaining the reason as to why there were two candidates put forward for the Deputy Speaker post, Senaratne said Dr. Fernandopulles nomination was done at the very last moment. According to the agreement between the UNP and SLFP, if the position of Speaker went to the UNP, the position of Deputy Speaker was destined go to the SLFP.
The SLFP put forward the name of Angajan Ramanathan.But the TNA opposed it because of certain incidents he was involved in. We did not want to antagonize any party unnecessarily. So the name was withdrawn. The Prime Minister asked the President if there was any deputy minister who would like to resign and take it on, but there was none. Then the President said there is no one from our side, you choose from yours.The UNP working committee then approved the name of Ananda Kumarasiri
The President proposed Dr. Sudharshani Fernandopulle at the last minute on Tuesday.But the PM pointed out that they had already got party approval for Kumarasiri and it was now hard to go back. So the President said it was fine, both could contest, Senaratne said.
He said the government had decided to give one position in Parliament to the Opposition and keep two under government control. Accordingly the positions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are with the government whilst the position of Deputy Chairman of Committees is with the Opposition (TNA).

Kandy SC in driving seat after winning Sevens first leg
The 1st Leg of the inter -Club sevens was conducted last Saturday and Sunday at the Race Course Stadium. Kandy Sports Club the defending champions and the rugby kings in the country were in an excellent form clinching the title by beating Police SC 21-5 in dramatic fashion to win the inter club rugby sevens 1st leg championship. Kandys new sevens coach Fazil Marija and his assistant Saliya Kumara were the architects of the victory. The Chairman of Kandy rugby Lasantha Wijeysuriya stated that it was a mountain to climb and they believed in themselves to succeed. President elect Mahesh Weerasinghe said it was a fantastic performance by the squad who raised the levels in every game, and it was a decent showing.
Now Kandy SC go into the 2nd leg in the driving seat, but they should not take anything for granted as the other teams are also equally good and can turn tables. They achieved their goal as a team and it must be remembered that Kandy SC possess almost the national team with the best rugby players. The important message now is for the players to keep their feet on the ground and continue to work hard, to win the 2nd leg too.
The inter club sevens tournament was first introduced in 1976, the first win in sevens championship for Kandy Sports Club was in 1999 under Haris Omar and coached by Priyantha Ekanayake. They went on to win in 2002, from there they won it for many years. Last year 2017 they pulled out of the tournament and Navy won for the first time.
In this years first leg 16 teams were seen in action. Group (A) Navy A, Army A, Navy C, Air Force. Group (B) Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Sabaragamuwa RFC, Galle RFC. Group (C) Peterson SC, Police A, Navy B, ArmyA. Group (D) CH& FC, Air Force A, Police B, CH & FC B.
On the first day Kandy SC beat Sabaragmuwa RFC 50-0, Galle RFC 46-0, Havelock SC 22-0 to finish on top. On the second day in the quarterfinals they beat Navy B 24-14, in the semi-inals CH & FC A 26-21 and in the final Police A 26-5. The winners scored four tries in the final.
Kandy SC was led by Richard Dharmapala, in the first half Danush Dayan got the scoring underway early and the rest of the tries were from Danushka Ranjan currently the most versatile player in club rugby, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, and Jayson Dissanayake. One of the try's was goaled by Thilina Wijesinghe and the other two by Roshan Weeraratne. For the Policemen Kasun Suranga scored closer to the final whistle.
Today Sevens rugby is very popular in the country, likeT-20 cricket. In the early days schools and clubs, kicked off their inter club or school season with a sevens tournament. Sri Lanka has a long history in the sevens field. It was in 1931 that the first sevens rugby game was played, and that was in Ratnapura. The man who did everything possible to see to the kick off was K.F. Jenkins a Welshman, who was the ASP at Ratnapura Police Station. He organized a game between a Police team with the Planters. From here the game spread its wings to Kandy, Colombo and the planting sector.
Then in 1941 the first ever major sevens tournament was held for the Layard Cup. In 1947 to mark the 25th year of CR & FC, Sydney de Zoysa and Winne Serasinghe came out with a tournament. It was CH & FC the first club to win an international sevens tournament that was the All India Sevens tournament in 1968. The side was led by John Burrows and together with Omar Sheriff made things easy for the winners. Sri Lankas first Sevens team to go overseas was in 1976 for the Hong Kong sevens. The team comprised players such as Lanil Tennakoon, Jeffrey de Jong, M. Omerdeen, Ronald Rodrigo, G.Gunadasa, Dr. Maiya Gunasekara, Mohan Balasuriya with Indrajith Coomrasawmy as the captain.
Kandy SC under Lasantha Wijeysuriya won the 1997 All Pakistan Sevens. Sri Lankas first ever sevens trophy was in 1984 when they won the Bowl under Hisham Abdeen at the Hong Kong Sevens. Rest of the players in that team were Nalin de Slva, Saman Jayasinghe, Chula Dharmadasa, Hubert Rayan, Len de Silva, Rohantha Peries, Chandrishan Perera, and C.P.P. Abeyagunawardene. The inter club Seven-a-Side tournament is without doubt the best organized rugby competition of its kind in Sri Lanka. It has consistently produced a high standard of rugby.

Nippon Paint sponsored two young designers from Sri Lanka following their ascent to the top spots at the Asia Young Designer Award (AYDA) held in Sri Lanka to take part in the regional Asia Young Designer Summit 2017/18 held in Malaysia.
The Gold award winner in the Architecture category, Dilushan Kodikara from the University of Moratuwa and the Gold award winner of the Interior Design Category, Sachintha Fernando from the City School of Architecture joined delegates from 14 other Asian countries to take part in the four day learning programme.
Spearheaded by Nippon Paint, the programme included coaching sessions, enlightening talks by industry experts and educational study tours of local architectural and historical sites. The participants also worked on design concepts in line with the theme You for Tomorrow and presented their designs to a panel of 56 renowned judges from across Asia, for a chance to win the highly sought-after Asia Young Designer of the Year title.
Commenting on the summit Raja Hewabowala, Managing Director, Nippon Paint Lanka said, Regionally, Nippon Paint implements this initiative to foster design talent across Asia and promote networking amongst young professionals in the region. During the Asia Young Designer Award (AYDA) which we held in Sri Lanka, we witnessed the exceptional talent that young Sri Lankan designers possess and we were pleased to be able to sponsor two of the best young Sri Lankan designers to take part in the summit in Malaysia. I am confident that they will bring a wealth of knowledge back to Sri Lanka and nurture friendships that will help Sri Lankan designers to reach further heights.

The summit agenda took us on an inspiring journey which encouraged us to break conventional barriers and come up with design concepts that can steer us all towards a better tomorrow. Moreover, competing with talented designers from other countries gave us both an extra edge and confidence which will guide us through to improve our own craft, commented Sachintha Fernando.
The two winners of the Asia Young Designers of the Year 2017/18 awards, Ng Wai How (Architecture) and Shahmeenan Labeeb (Interior Design) from Malaysia each won USD5,000 for their innovative designs.
Commenting on their experience at the summit Dilushan Kodikara said, The two of us were able to acquire the deep insights in to the nature of design during the summit and form friendships with other young designers that will enrich our future work and the wealth of information that we will be able to obtain in the coming years. Both Sachintha and I are thankful to Nippon Paint Sri Lanka for giving us this wonderful opportunity.

LET A NEW LIFE DAWN....
By giving identity to our own language, we have erected an additional barrier to further separate us from our own people who are suffering from conflicts arising from man made barriers. All barriers erected by man to isolate him from other men need to be demolished to bring true peace and harmony to the world we live in. Till such time as we have a universal language or method of communication with each other, the only way we have to break through the language barrier is by translation.
Dr. Kandiah Shriganeshans attempt is an admirable effort to cut across the language barrier and bring the South Asian writers together through the English translations.
In Suthanthiram - South Asian Poetry in Translation and My Choice Dr. Kandiah Shriganeshan has made a major contribution to the world of poetry through his translations. His contribution is important not only for the poets and the readers, but also for the students of Translation Studies, as he happens to be the coordinator of the Translation Studies unit of the University of Jaffna. Shriganeshan has published the poems both in English and Tamil.
Suthanthiram is a selection of poems from the SAARC region, collected from several anthologies. Several poems are from the anthology Amaravati Poetic Prism, with 948 poems written in 85 languages, along with the English translations of every poem. A few are from the publications of the Foundation of SAARC Writers And Literature (FOSWAL) founded by Ajeet Caur. Some poems were written in English, but most of the others written in the poets mother tongue and translated into English. It is never an easy task to translate a translation, specially when it comes to poetry. It is a challenge that Shriganeshan had accepted, giving us all an opportunity to enjoy the creativity of our fellow poets, our own brothers and sisters separated by geographical, political and language barriers.
Among the poets Shriganeshan has selected are academics from leading universities and well known award winning poets, including some of the great names not only in their own countries but in all of South Asia, and beyond. To name a few, we have Sitakant Mahapatra, Muhammad Nurul Huda, and K. V. Dominic, poets spanning eight South Asian countries, their ages ranging from nine to eighty. They are from all over South Asia, separated by the political barriers, but united in their universal link language, English, though originally written in Pushito, Urdu, Punjabi, Malayalam, Butanese, Sinhala, Bengali, Sindhi and Hindi.
It would have been wonderful if poetry too could be created in a universal language like the language of the artist, the musician and the sculptor. We have to depend on translations for all literary works till someday mankind is able to develop a universal language. Till such time the translator has a major role to play and a major responsibility to select the best works and give us the best possible translation.
My Choice is Shriganeshans choice of 30 poems by 25 poets writing in Tamil. This selection would not have been easy, probably because the Sri Lanka Tamil poetry would be as good and as numerous as any poetry around the world. This is an opportunity for us in the South to read, understand and empathise with the people in the North and East of our country. The poems are thought provoking, making us close the book, close our eyes, and try to see the poem through the poets mind. Wants by Ilangeswari tells us of what all of us want, but most of us never get, whether our lives are cut off very early or we live to old age. The social revolution and the new freedom enjoyed by young women is symbolised in Wheels by Thabiluvil Jega. We can feel the sadness of all mothers, all over the world, throughout history, in My Tender Child by Jayanthy Thalayasingam. Her poem Mammoty reminds us that the same mammoty we use for planting our crops has to be used to bury the dead too. Mullai Musrifa has summed up the position with all the misunderstandings and the fanaticism about the world religions in The long story of aggression.
Translation is what we need, for unity among all poets and the readers, using English as our link language, and to share our creativity, our culture, heritage and feelings. Translation is also a weapon to battle against language chauvinism which prevents us from respecting and trying to learn the language of our fellow beings. When institutions and organizations which have the infrastructure and the facilities have failed to bring out anthologies in translation, hold conferences and discussions among the literati, it is up to the individual writers and translators to carry on their mission of unification. It is also time for Sinhala translators to make their contributions too.
Shriganeshan should continue the good work to collect more poetry not only from South Asia but also from all Asia and then the world. We wish him success in all his endeavours.
As Aruwil wrote in The son who left home without a word,
Dont lose the humane qualities
Learn how to love people
and Ampuli in Seek and you will find,
let a new life dawn in your hands
for all poetry and literary creations.

Minister orders documentaries  on historic sites in upcountry
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama summoned media personnel and other officials attached to his ministry in order to produce short television (TV) documentaries on historic places of archeological value in the upcountry.
As the preservation of such historic places that are the heart and soul of the nations culturewhich was receding from the minds of the peoplewas a contemporary challenge, it was essential to produce short TV documentaries regarding them, the minister said.
It was necessary to preserve and renovate such sites, while safeguarding their archeological value. As such, all historic places in the hill country would be covered by ministerial mandate relating to the protection of the Kandyan heritage, he added.
He directed that in the first instance, such documentaries should be produced on 10 selected sites. Included in this group of 10, would be Gadaladeniya, Lankatilaka, Hindagala, Bambaragala, Medawala, Welivita, Welagama, and Hanguranketha.
The minister further said that the documentaries should also be produced under the theme of the 1818 Rebellion, with the assistance of filmmakers of the caliber of Sumithra Peries.

Alleged list of PTL beneficiaries:
MPs urge Speaker to make clarification
Many Parliamentarians from both the sides urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday to take swift measures to make a clarification on the alleged list of MPs who had obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius.
A number of MPs who took the floor yesterday pointed out that the allegations of MPs receiving money from Aloysius have become a headache for them, and that they have been finding it difficult to move with the people due to this reason. JO MP Shehan Semasinghe requested Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikalanathan, who was in the Chair to take collaborative effort with the Speaker to make a clarification in this regard or order the MPs not to make claims on the matter to the media and general public without any proof.
First the media reported that there are 118 MPs who have received money from Aloysius. But yesterday (5), several sections of the media reported that the actual number is 166. This is becoming a joke now. Now, all the 225 MPs in this Parliament are facing criticism and humiliation in society, Semasinghe said.
We do not know who recieved money from Aloysius and who did not. Now each and every one of us has become a suspect, he noted. The Deputy Chairman of Committees said that he would bring the matter to the attention of the Speaker. UNP MP Nalin Bandara pointed out that this alleged list has become a headache to everyone. The government MPs also want these alleged names to be revealed. So the Speaker should make a clarification on the matter to protect the goodwill of this Parliament, he added.

From the MUD to the STARS
I confess I know nothing about Penelope Lively. Nor have I read any of her books. This could be because unlike some of the younger male writers of our time - Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes and Ian McEwan - she has never been in the limelight. For Eighty-Five years she has lived a sedate, headline-resistant life: no scandals, no feuds, just one marriage. As some critics see it, her life is like the plot of a badly written happily-ever-after novel.
This could be why in 2005, she published a sort of anti-memoir, Making It Up, in which she imagines all the different directions her life MIGHT have taken. What if shed become an archaeologist What if shed married an American What if shed had an illegitimate child She never did, of course, and so she never grabbed the attention of the world and always remained on the edge of the radar. Yet, Penelope Lively is the only writer to have won both the Carnegie Medal for childrens literature and the Booker Prize. Just last week she was nominated for the Man Booker International 2018. In her writing career spanning more than four decades she has written 31 books for children, 22 novels for adults and 4 non-fiction.
Born Penelope Margaret Low in Cairo in 1933, where her father, an Englishman who belonged to the southern gentry, was employed by the National Bank of Egypt, she grew up there until almost the end of World War II. She still remembers the city then with vivid exactness  even the tins of water in which her bed legs sat, to keep ants from crawling up. She was raised and educated, after a fashion, by a nanny who hadnt had much schooling herself. When Lively was 12, her parents marriage broke up in scandalous fashion and her mother went off with another man, abandoning her to the custody of her father, who promptly sent her to school in England, an experience Lively describes as fairly catastrophic. It was ghastly. Id never been to any kind of school, and I was hopeless at it.  Lively remembers the school as extraordinarily unimaginative. One punishment was to read for an hour in the library, which pretty much summed up the attitude towards literature. I was reprimanded by the headmistress for having a copy of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse in my locker.
Still, Lively excelled in the school certificate at 16, prompting her father to pay a visit to her headmistress. He said to her: I understand that quite a few girls go to university nowadays. I was wondering if Penelope should think of it. The headmistress looked at him in horror and replied Oh no, no - our girls dont do that. The implication was that you got your school certificate and married - or at worst tried a domestic science course. Luckily, her father took a more enlightened view. Lively was moved to a crammer, and applied to Oxford to read modern history. I wasnt an assiduous student, and I didnt get a good degree, but it certainly formed my mindset, she says.
It was at Oxford, too, that Lively met her husband. Newly graduated, Lively was working as a research assistant when Jack, a working-class boy from New Castle arrived. Id heard some of the other fellows talking about this very clever chap coming over from Cambridge called Jack Lively. I remember thinking the name sounded like a character in an 18th-century play, she smiles. Their friendship, fostered over coffee in smoke-filled rooms, quickly blossomed, and in less than a year the pair were married. It was a relationship that sustained them both until Jacks death from cancer in 1998, 41 years later. In many ways Jack was very different from me: much cleverer, very combative. His chief intellectual pleasure was a good argument, and he had a shorter fuse than I have. But he was, she says, always quick to apologize - and when it came to her writing, he acted as both ally and advocate. He thoroughly enjoyed the fact that I wrote, and was always my first reader. I never asked him directly what do you think, because of course what you want to hear is that the whole things superb, and he would never have said that. But he commented on the specifics. I dont have that any longer, and I miss it hugely.
It was when she was in her late 30s that Lively first began to write. Im one of those people for whom reading became writing, she recalls. Because of my odd childhood, Ive always been an obsessive, avid reader, and that went on and on and on. Not every obsessive reader feels the need to turn into a writer, but a few do, and Ive never met any writer worth his salt who wasnt an obsessive reader.
She started writing childrens books  her first, Astercote, was published in 1970. The best of them, the Carnegie-winning The Ghost of Thomas Kempe (1973), is said to be in some ways a grown-up book in disguise: The ghost is really a metaphor for the persistence of the past.
Throughout her career in adult fiction, the perception that Lively is a womens writer - with all the vaguely negative connotations of that label - has persisted. After all, she is fascinated by families, gives precedence to relationships and is comfortable writing within the domestic sphere. Even the novel that put her on the map, the 1987 Booker-winning Moon Tiger, was criticized for being a housewifes book. But Lively rejects the classification. I dont think its true, she says. My novel, Consequences was romantic, but everyones entitled to one of those, surely And Family Album is indeed a family book; but after all, men live family lives too. I find the notion that a book could be for women or men puzzling. (It would be fair to say that perhaps the idea she is a womens writer comes from people who havent read her).
According to an article in the Guardian, Moon Tiger, is anything but romantic. The story is a series of deathbed reflections by a woman named Claudia Hampton, who tells a nurse, Im writing a history of the world, and then adds, to herself: The works, this time. The whole triumphant murderous unstoppable chute, from the mud to the stars, universal and particular, your story and mine. She looks back on her life  childhood, love affairs (including an incestuous one), motherhood, her years as a war correspondent  in scenes that seem arranged in almost random order. Sometimes theyre even repeated, first from one characters slant, then from anothers. Just as the narrator intends, the book works like a kaleidoscope: Shake the tube and see what comes out.
Today, at the age of eighty-five, Lively lives alone in a house overlooking a leafy square in the London borough of Islington. Charles McGrath who interviewed her last year for the New York Times says she is unusually tall, which gives her a kind of instant authority, and dresses in matronly camouflage: scarves and twin sets. Her friend and neighbor Jane Seaton, a professor at the University of Westminster, says shes beady, someone who sees everything but doesnt give away a whole lot. She has a badly arthritic back, she underwent breast-cancer surgery a few years back, and her eyes have started to go. Her balance is so bad that taking the Underground makes her dizzy. She says she has been ambushed by old age and that she is now waiting in the departure lounge. Yet, she is cheerful about being old. This house is full of Post-it slips reminding me of this, that and the other. But my long-term memory is very good. I remember my childhood vividly. I just had a birthday, and old-age birthdays become more like childhood birthdays, when theres a huge difference, say, between being 8 and being 10. Well, theres quite a lot of difference between being 84 and 85. You notice your contemporaries and you think, My goodness, shes 86! she laughs.
And as she puts it, she still has all her marbles.
This is why unlike Philip Roth and Alice Munro she does not see why she should retire. I wouldnt know what to do if I wasnt writing, she says. Id feel very restless. I know if I start something new I may never finish it, but its what you do. A writer writes.

Quotable Quotes from Penelope Lively  1.When you are able to be with a person and there is no need to talk, something has happened. 2.Giving presents is one of the most possessive things we do, did you realize that Its the way we keep a hold on other people. Plant ourselves in their lives. 3.Children are not like us. They are beings apart: impenetrable, unapproachable. They inhabit not our world but a world we have lost and can never recover. 4. The past is our ultimate privacy; we pile it up, year by year, decade by decade, it stows itself away, with its perverse random recall system.

Mythical, magical and  mesmerizing...the warriors are back in style!
Sri islanders rugby, despite its dramatic turnovers. and ugly post match issues soon had the focus back after our brief postponed fixtures post negotiations.
Naturally our resident...experts were last seen hugging a statue at Hatton railway station and singing ...swing low sweet chariot...to their hearts content and plenty of misty eyed faithful hoping the pendulum settled in their favour.
As predicted despite much economics and a general sense of calm. The Singer school season, certainly turned upside down...but thankfully able to deliver the league for the rest to enjoy.
2018 has so far been perhaps the biggest ever impact among players, family and spectators.
The game must go on ....even if we disagree about its rules ...we must protect the kids, from the inevitable.
We cannot imagine the mindset of those who deliberately aim to disrupt.
Thankfully sanity and common sense prevailed...and we were back to our great code.
Assuming assurances ok and the last two critical weekends are ready for kickoff...
What a pleasant thought, what a grand turnaround for the schools.
Royal ran out to simply breeze past a bewildered Patana. Completely outplayed and given the treatment for 65mins last Saturday. Reid Avenue stepping up their fluidity and scoring at leisure.
I am hopeful that the green machine will pull things back by the knockouts
Top performance from the defending league champions...and little to interrupt their precision this season.
At CR, it was the mighty Joe-Pete and plenty on the line ...least of all...the Martis v Nilufer factor...
All speculation and pundit/experts, claims to be settled on the day in the middle...70 minutes of pressure, pleasure, presumption and pain.
A trophy at stake and an epic confrontation about to unfold...
Plenty of rhetoric to fuel the passion reserves, and resilient fervour on both sides
I did mention the nature of this Josephian team...and their latent ability to pressure play anyone, irrespective of skills, stats and reputations.
Peters were certainly up for it and looking for a likely opportunity to dismantle the Joes upfront etc ....
What Peters hadnt anticipated or considered was how they handled 50mins with 14 players and resolutely defended their 10-5 scoreline right through.
Many are still fuddled and question the wisdom of not taking their penalty kicks Was that part of their game strategy...presumably expecting to have the 15 v 14 players equation, to their running game advantage
But on the day ...in the middle, it was a stonewall Josephs defence that gave them the big W ...and a famous victory against the odds and despite only 14 on the park.....much relief for the red card offender, after his early shower
History will record the facts ...St Josephs beat St Peters 10/5...on 2nd June 2018.
On that same noteRoyal v Peters for the league cup and also on Saturday 9th Joes v Patana for the runner-up slot
Currently its Royal 46, Joes 42, Peters 41....focus should be on the match, and playing well to their plan ...not trying for league positions....fair
On global rugby ...what a clinical London 7s tour by Fiji ...who simply ran rings around everyone they played, and complete proof what a remarkable team and depth they carry in this HSBC World Series 2018.
The final v the Boks minus Cecil Africa meant South Africa were only a single barrel finisher...and a runner short.
Fiji too much power and form from the breakdowns ...closed the African machine off and denied them good ball with some mind altering defense all across the park.
The 21point victory a delightful testament to the team skills and try scoring appetite that make their 21/17 win such a grand whisper for the final series weekend in glamorous Paris.
Definitely worth a trip if you can clock the time and discipline the mind
Finally with the club 7s second leg in a fortnight...Kandy who won the 1st Racecourse leg are pulling out while CR will step up a side.
On that notethank you for all those genuine rugby hearts who asked about our famous 7s win in Fiji, beating Uruguay in that Bowl final.
The team including current WPRFU president Nazeem Mohammed, as approved for travel by the Minister of Sport, Bimal Perera - CH, Asoka Jayasena - Police, Nazeem Mohammed - CH, Sudath Sampath  Police, Hilmy Saheed - Havelocks, Jude Pillai  CH, Chan Perera (C) - CH. Graham Raux - Havelocks, Azad Junkeer - CH, Alex Nishanta  Havelocks, Coach - Tony Amit, Manager - Udekka Tennekoon.
What a grand result to beat Uruguay by 2 tries, coming from behind in the 2nd half ...and certainly my proudest moment in national colours ...special history for me as skipper of my last international series and perhaps our islands most significant away win so far.
The quality of skill talent and staminaquite a passport and experience to step up as required.
Blessings to all Sri Rugby islanders and courage to face the worlds best.
Bula bula the mind for more!

National Evaluation Policy in July
The government has accepted the importance in having a national evaluation policy for its development drive and will launch the National Evaluation Policy by July, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said this in response to a question posed to him by MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday as to whether the preparation of a national evaluation policy for the development of the country was made.
The government has understood the importance in having a national evaluation policy in its development drive. Many of the developed countries have obtained favourable results through the implementing of a national evaluation policy.
The national evaluation policy formulation commenced under the National Policy and Economic Affairs Ministry in July 2017 and is currently being carried out by the Project Management and Monitoring Department under the Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Ministry.
A draft of the national evaluation policy was published in the newspapers on April 17, 2018 for entertainment of public comments having conducted several rounds of discussions and workshops with the Line Ministry, main district secretaries, professionals, civil society organisation representatives, funders and Treasury Department officials.
Based on the responses received to the newspaper article, the relevant amendments and suggestions are being currently incorporated and by the second week of June, the national evaluation policy will be submitted for Cabinet approval. Based on the Cabinet approval, I hope to be able to launch the National Evaluation Policy by July, the Prime Minister said.

Natural tips for greathaier
Egg treatment
Use the entire egg to condition your hair. If you have dry or brittle hair, use egg whites to moisturize your hair. Use 1/2 cup of any egg mixture (egg white, entire egg) and apply to clean, damp hair. Leave it for 20 minutes and rinse with cool water. Try this one of the most effective beauty tips for hair and notice the change,
Cleanliness is important
The most important reason for hair fall is dandruff and itchy scalp. Therefore, maintain good cleanliness for beautiful and healthy hair.
Avoid hot water
Skip hot water showers, because hot water will make your hair dry and brittle as it strips protective oils from your hair - says Dr. Suttar. Thus, prefer a temperature which is just a bit warmer than your body temperature.
For that shiny soft hair
Prepare a mixture of 1 cup of your daily conditioner and 2-3 tablespoons of honey. Apply this mixture evenly on your wet hair. Leave it for 30 minutes and wash it off thoroughly. This mixture will close down your hair's cuticle and give your hair that amazing shine.

Baking soda therapy
One of the beauty tips for hair is Baking soda therapy. Make a mixture of 3 tbsp. of baking soda and some water.
Rinse your hair with this solution after shampooing. Let it set in for at least 5 minutes before the final rinse. This therapy will help to remove the excess shampoo and styling product from your hair.
Don't wash your hair frequently
Wash your hair every 2-3 days, for proper regulation of natural hair oils. Washing your hair less often will also help regain your hair's naturalbody and luster.
Make your conditioner
For a protein packed conditioner, mix eggs and yogurt and rub it into your scalp. Leave on for five or 10 minutes, and then wash it off completely.
For strong hair
Use almond oil to treat dry and damaged hair.
It is a very simple procedure, pour some almond oil in a bowl and heat it for 40 seconds. Then evenly distribute on your hair. Leave it for 30 minutes and then rinse normally with shampoo and conditioner using cold water.

Nearly  200 missing,  73 dead  in Guatemala volcano
GUATEMALA: Nearly 200 people are missing and at least 73 people were killed since Guatemalas Fuego volcano began erupting over the weekend, officials said Tuesday.
Seven communities in already devastated areas were evacuated as the volcanos activity increased, with rescue operations halted.
In the city of Escuintla, near the summit, panicked locals rushed to their cars to escape, causing chaotic traffic.
An AFP photographer witnessed a large plume of ash rise into the sky, prompting an evacuation of everyone authorities could find before the police, the military and rescuers were stood down. And a total of 192 people remain missing since the weekend eruptions, disaster relief agency chief Sergio Cabanas told reporters. The search for bodies in mountain villages destroyed by the eruption was progressing slowly, officials said earlier, given the nature of the terrain and the way the volcano released large amounts of boiling mud, rock and ash down the mountain.
We will continue until we find the last victim, though we do not know how many there are. We will probe the area as many times as necessary, Cabanas told AFP.
However, the prospects of finding any more survivors was poor, he said.
If you are trapped in a pyroclastic flow, its hard to come out of it alive, he said, adding that people who may have been caught in the flow may never be found.
The latest of the 73 victims was a 42-year-old woman who died in hospital having lost both legs and an arm in the eruption.
The previous toll was given as 72. Some 46 people were injured, around half of whom are in serious condition, it said.
The 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano erupted early Sunday, spewing out towering plumes of ash and a hail of fiery rock fragments with scalding mud.

New Labour Act formulated
The government received Cabinet approval this week to introduce a new Labour Act which would integrate all current labour laws into one.
The Labour Department has thus far implemented 61 Acts in relation to the labour force in the country but only 27 are being practically enforced.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera submitting a Cabinet paper on the above subject noted that many of these laws had certain discrepancies in them and that the Department faced issues when enforcing them.
Thus a new law has been proposed with all safeguards towards current employee rights ensured.
The new Act would combine the Shop and Office Employees Act, the Wages Board Ordinance, Women, Young Persons and Child Employment Act and the Maternity Benefits Ordinance into one.
The bill on the above proposal was submitted to Parliament and was taken up for debate yesterday.

Not a magic trick!
A few simple meal planning and preparation tips will help you to produce healthy, delicious food that your family will love.
1. Take a few minutes each week to plan your menus.
This will allow you the time to schedule a quick and easy meal on Wednesday when Jimmy plays hockey and a late dinner on Thursday because of a parent-teacher interview. As well, you will be able to try a new recipe or ensure that a favourite is served more often.
2. Cruise the grocery store with a list.
A grocery list will ensure that you bring home everything you need to prepare the tasty and nutritious meals you plannedand help you to not load up on unneeded items, whether its chips or an extra bottle of ketchup. This simple trick list will usually save you money by helping you to avoid impulse buys and ensure that you have everything your family needs on hand.
3. Choose seasonal produce and pick the brightest colours that you can.
Buying fruits and vegetables in season lets you enjoy peak flavour at modest cost. Buy asparagus in the spring, peaches in the late summer, and apples in the fall. When the price of fresh produce is high, frozen fruit and vegetables are usually an economical choice. Canned fruit and vegetables are another alternative, but be aware of the sugary syrups and higher salt content.
Fruits and vegetables provide lots of vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy at a very modest calorie cost. In general, the darker the colour, the higher the nutrients (think bright red peppers, or dark green broccoli).
4. Equip your kitchen for low fat food preparation.
This doesn't need to be expensive and you can gather the pieces one at a time.
A steamer for vegetables helps retain their flavour and nutrients without added fat; a pan with rack allows the fat to drip away from meat to help you achieve low fat, flavourful cooking.
Sharp knives allow you to remove the fat easily and slice meat thinly; non-stick cookware lets you to brown or saute without added fats or oils.
5. Use cooking methods that do not add extra fat to the dish.
Steamed vegetables are especially flavourful when herbs are added to the steaming liquid. Broiled or grilled meats are lower in fat and develop a rich golden colour that adds visual and taste appeal. Baking, especially in a pan with a rack is another low fat cooking method. The microwave allows you to prepare food quickly without added fat. Barbecuing is another lower calorie cooking method.
6. Reduce or eliminate high fat ingredients from your favourite recipes.
Using a non-stick pan means that you can saut without added fat. Adding tofu, bulgur, or brown rice to casseroles means that you can cut down on the amount of meat that you are using. Using smaller amounts of stronger cheeses decreases the amount of milder cheese needed without sacrificing the flavour. Chilling a soup or stew will allow the fat to rise to the top and congeal for easy removal.
7. Learn to use spices and herbs to kick up the flavour.
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme are classic herbs that you will savour. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg will add a new taste to traditional dishes. Many cookbooks offer advice on using spices and herbs and many recipes on the internet will introduce new tastes.
8. Double check your serving size.
Most of us are victims of the supersize phenomenon. Research shows that people who are presented with larger containers of food eat more than those consuming snacks from smaller containers. Make this work for you.
Eat your dinner on the smaller luncheon plateyour serving will look larger. As well, if you want to splurge on some treat, as we all do at some time, think in terms of a single size container: not a whole chocolate bar, but the mini size, not a 200 gram bag of potato chips, but a 43 gram size.
This will give you the indulgence of a treat that you want, but allow you to stop while the calorie count is still low.

JO attempting to sabotage Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement: PM
The Joint Opposition is attempting to sabotage the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement with unfounded criticisms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday, replying to a question by JO MP Bandula Gunawardena. The MP alleged that the Government entered into the agreement without informing Parliament and without facilitating an open dialogue with professionals associations and the general public. He called on the Government to suspend the implementation of the agreement and start an open dialogue.
The PM said the Agreement was inked after it received Cabinet approval and that a panel of officials conducted extensive discussions on its content. He said the Agreement was in line with the countrys laws and policies and that due procedures followed in its making.
I cannot understand why you are running after FTA with Singapore. It was during former President Mahinda Rajapaksas time that Chinese engineers and labourers came here in large numbers. There were well-experienced engineers among them and we benefitted from their knowledge. Even Bangladesh workers were brought in here to work in road development projects. We did not hire foreign workers when the Mahaweli Project was carried out or when we built huge industrial zones, he said.
The PM said the talk of JO does not match with what it practices. All your monies are deposited in foreign banks in Dubai, Seychelles, Hong Kong, etc. You do not deposit your money in banks in Sri Lanka.
You say one thing to the country, but do completely the opposite. Did you inform Parliament when the Port City and Shangri La lands were given outright Did you inquire for our opinion before starting the Hambantota project he told the JO.
Audit Bill would be taken up for debate soon: Speaker
The National Audit Bill would be moved for debate in Parliament shortly after finalizing the Amendments to it, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He said he brought to the attention of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the need to pass the Audit Bill soon. The Prime Minister promised me that the Bill would be taken up for debate soon. The Public Service Commission has also provided their recommendations on the Bill, while those were also studied. We are also keen on getting this Bill through Parliament as soon as possible, he said.
The Speaker made these observations in reply to a query by JO MP Ranjith de Soyza, who brought the attention of the House to the issues the Audit Commission has faced due to the delay in passing legislation.
Rift in JO over 20th Amendment
The Joint Opposition group meeting held at the Parliamentary complex on Tuesday, was divided on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Parliament sources said yesterday.
During the meeting, JO MP Kumara Welgama had proposed to invite JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake to brief them on the contents of the Bill to abolish the Executive Presidency.
He had said that the SLFP group could then question the JVP and get a thorough understanding of the amendment.
While some JO members welcomed the proposal, some including MP Wimal Weerawansa had opposed it.
Weerawansa, who defected from the JVP and his supporters in the JO had spoken against inviting the JVP leader to brief them on the 20th Amendment.
An irate Welgama had then demanded Weerawansa to brief the JO group on the contents of the amendment and be prepared to provide answers to all the questions he had about it, sources said.
NWSDB trade union action unfair: Minister Hakeem
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) workers Trade Union action is very unfair at a time when they had been given a 20 percent salary hike, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
The minister told Parliament yesterday, that the NWSDB workers demanded a 23 percent salary hike and they were given a 20 percent salary hike after discussens held with the Treasury after obtaining Cabinet approval.
This entire agitation is because they wanted another 3 percent increase. This is nothing but bargaining by taking the innocent consumers for granted. In addition to this salary hike, each salary cadre had received about a 10 percent increase because we removed the salary anomalies, he said.
The TU action was launched without prior notice. We are discussing with the Treasury as to whether we could facilitate an incentive payment to the tune of 3 percent. We are ready to solve this issue, he added.
The NWSDB workers are demanding a salary hike in par with the CEB and CPC, but we are facing financial difficulties because there had been no revision of water tariff for the last 6 months. We did not increase the water tariff as it would inconvenience the public. In 2015, the salaries of the NWSDB workers were raised by 30 percent, he said.
The minister made this observations when MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena asked for the immediate intervention of the Minister to resolve the problem in the the NWSDB without letting it create a water scarcity in the country.
Female workers entitled to 84 days wages for live births: Minister Samarawickrama
Having realized the discriminatory provision in the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, the government under the amendment, has done away with the differentiated payments and made all live births of children of a woman worker entitled to full benefits of all 84 days of wages, without discrimination for all child births, said the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
As for the existing provisions, only for the first and the second child maternity benefits were given in terms of wages for 12 weeks. Accordingly, a woman is entitled to the payment of maternity benefits two weeks before confinement and another ten weeks after confinement in the case of an issue of a live birth. However, in terms of a still birth, payment was restricted to only six weeks, which is 47 days, he said, adding that in giving birth to a third child or more, the woman worker was entitled to maternity benefits and wages exactly for only half of the period, which is only 42 days prior to and after confinement.
He said there are no generalised insurance fund to cover maternity expenses of female employees, hence, the Ministry of Labour would initially take steps to correct the anomalies in the Maternity Ordinance and later steps would also be taken to establish a fund for the purpose of insurance cover during pregnancies at a future date.
The minister made this statement presenting two important amendments to the Shop and Office Employees (Amendment) Bill and the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday, for the benefit of the workers of the country who are really in need of relief.
The subject of maternity benefits is covered under two laws, the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and the Shop and Office Employees Act. The Maternity Benefits Ordinance provides for the granting of maternity benefits to women covered under the Wages Board Ordinance and the Factories Ordinance. The Shop and Office Employees Act grants maternity benefits to women workers in shops and offices. On account of basic differences in the basic nature of work under these laws, for several decades, maternity benefits had been provided at different levels, but not on an equal basis. The way the maternity benefits have been provided under the Ordinance, the woman workers who are generally engaged in manual labour underwent hardships on account of several discriminatory provisions. He also said that having corrected the anomalies, the number of days granted for maternity leave would be counted only taking into account the number of working days.
Among the basic differences in the two laws in comparison were gaps in the standards set out in the Maternity Protection Convention of the ILO, which Sri Lanka ratified in April 1993. On account of these anomalies, the two laws and gaps in comparison with ILO standards, the successive governments were subjected to criticism for not initiating action to rectify these anomalies of the two laws in operation for several decades.
Thus, all these amendments are long overdue. In the amendment to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, steps were taken to remove several discriminatory provisions in the ordinance in the process of equalizing the standard of the Shops and Office Employees Act. To activate this exercise which has been suggested not only by the ILO, but also from several trade unions and Womens organisations, suggesting the removal of the prevailing anomalies in the Maternity Benefits Ordinance merely granting benefits on the number of children, Samarawickrama noted.
Charge sheeted Police officers not entitled for promotions
An officer who has a charge sheet against him would not be granted promotions, as this was the policy maintained by not only the Police Department, but in all state institutions, said Law and Order and State Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said this in response to a question raise by Joint Opposition MP Shehan Semasinghe as to why despite the recommendations of the Police Commission to reinstate SP Priyadharshana Herath who had been suspended for one year, the IGP had still taken steps to suspend his services further. Having been re-instated, the said police officer had been in service for just 20 days, when the IG had again suspended his services, disregarding the recommendations of the Police Commission.
Semasinghe questioned as to whether the IGP had the power to disregard a recommendation of the Police Commission and if it was not in violation of the Constitution.
In response, the Law and Order Minister said, The relevant police officer had been given a charge sheet and as such, such a person is not entitled to a promotion, not only in the Police service, but it is the policy of all state institutions.
However, Semasinghe asked the Law and Order Minister to pay attention to the many problems that are affecting the members of the Police Department.
He also asked the minister to focus his attention to the increasing crime and drug related incidents affecting the country.
However, Minister Madduma Bandara said in fact the rate of crimes had reduced in the country and measures were being taken to further reduce crimes in the country.

Meanwhile in container handling, Port of Colombo recorded a 16.2% growth for the first quarter of 2018, according to Alphaliner Monthly 2018. Among container Ports worldwide, Colombo growth rate is the second only to Port of Singapore which has recorded 16.5% growth over 2017.

President not involved in 100 day programme - Rajitha
Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday admitted that President Maithripala Sirisena was not involved in the formulation of the governments 100 day programme.
So I suppose he could say that it was this programme that we put forward that became problematic for us later on, said Minister Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, yesterday.
He explained that there had been very little time for the campaign and that a separate group met to formulate the 100 day programme and manifesto during the month-long campaign,
The President was stuck in the campaign. Even I was stuck in it, but we set up meetings at 5 am, and from 5 am to 7 am, a group of us would convene to discuss the 100 day programme. Ven. Rathana Thera, Asoka Abeygunawardena, and later Champika Ranawaka joined us together with civil society members. This was the first time a party manifesto or programme was made by persons other than the members of the party. Outsiders wrote it - university professors, doctors, lawyers, civil society members and people who had no connection to politics.
Thereafter, he agreed with the President that logically they could not have achieved much with just 42 UNPers in Parliament. So the decision was made to join the SLFP and take the national programme forward.
As the President said, if we had dissolved Parliament on January 9, we would have won a resounding victory at the election and formed a stable government. At the time, Mahinda [Rajapaksa] left to Carlton and Basil had left to America, he said further.
But we thought that just running a government was not important. The youth were getting fed up of politics. So we felt we should use this time to resolve the burning issues of the country and have a national programme.
He stressed that their manifesto and 100 day programme was designed to accommodate all parties. You always have problems when you have such programmes.
The Minister further explained that the President had let the Prime Minister and his group formulate the plan. So the Prime Minister had made most of the decisions with a lot of freedom at his hands.
Given their journey together so far, Minister Senaratne stressed that there was no way forward but together for both parties, and hence the government would last in its current state until 2020.
Quoting Mao Zedongs famous statement, Power grows out of the barrel of a gun, he said, First we need to be in power before we can implement our programme.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 27:
Provide the best customer experience, your company continues moving upwards
If you are in selling or servicing business, very likely, your organization would have already implemented one or more customer-focused strategies and some form of customer service system. At some point, have probably been asked the question, Are you meeting your customers expectations
You would have said, Yes, we have. You should not be happy with your answer because todays organizations must go beyond just meeting customer expectations but work to exceed those expectations. Organizations that take an approach to exceeding customer expectations focus on defining and executing very specific, proactive customer service strategies. Successful organizations are also likely to use technology to assist them in executing these strategies.
This process is not as easy as it sounds  customer expectations are a dynamic feature that ebbs and flows regularly in accordance with a wide range of factors. You may have the greatest selling and servicing teams, but if your customers perceive their needs are not being fully met, your service reputation suffers.
Meeting customers expectations
To provide good customer service, you need to understand who your customers are and what they want.
Know your customers
Gather information about as many of your customers as possible. Try to find out what your customers are buying, why they are buying and the frequency of their purchases. When trying to understand their needs, it may be useful to know details such as their lifestyle, occupation and interests. Include any potential customers who have made enquiries about your goods or service. Find out more about researching customers.
Understand your customers needs
Each customer will have a different perception of what customer service means to them. If you want to provide good customer service, you should know the needs of the customer and how to fulfil those needs.
Find out how your customers expect you to meet their needs. The expected level of service varies from marketplace to marketplace, industry to industry and, to some extent, from consumer group to consumer group. Research your marketplace and your target markets to find out what your customers expect of your business in your location.
Meet your customers needs
Tailor your level of service to suit your customers needs. Some businesses work well providing a no frills basic level of service while others go beyond customer expectations to achieve a level of service to make their customers say wow.
Some ways to go beyond customer expectations are: introducing initiatives - for example, customer focus groups, customer survey cards or a suggestion box. These initiatives send a clear message to customers that you are interested in their input suggesting add-ons - for example, Would you like batteries as well
Customer expectations analyzed
Understanding the following 6 customer expectations is critical before you set out to measure customer satisfaction.
1. Explicit Expectations - These are formed on the basis of the promises made by the brand at the time of purchase. The brand has complete control over explicit expectations. The customer may have mental targets for product performance, such as well-identified performance standards.
2. Implicit Expectations - These are formed on the basis of the customers perception of brand image, stature, reputation and the price premium they pay for a brand. These are far more difficult to gauge and manage. An implicit reference might include wording such as Compared with other companies or Compared to the leading brand
(Most often organizations measure only the explicit commitments. Failure to identify and measure implicit expectations is a big reason for the gap between its understanding of the quality of service rendered and customers perception of the service received. Customers perception of service will improve only when both these expectations met.)
3. Static Performance Expectations - These concern how performance and quality for a specific product or service are defined. Although each performance measures are unique, general expectations relate to quality of outcome and include: accessibility, customization, dependability, timeliness, accuracy, options, cutting edge technology, flexibility, and user friendly interfaces. Static performance expectations are the visible part of the iceberg; they are the ones we see and -- often erroneously -- assume are all that exist.
4. Dynamic Performance Expectations - These are about how the product or service is expected to evolve over time. Dynamic expectations may be about the changes in support, product, or service needed to meet future business or use environments. Dynamic performance expectations may help to produce static performance expectations as new uses, integrations, or system requirements develop and become more stable.
5. Technological Expectations - These focus on the evolving state of the product category. For example, mobile phones are continually evolving, leading to higher expectations of new features. Mobile service providers, in an effort to limit a consumers ability to switch to new technology phones, have marketed rate plans with high cancellation penalties for switching providers, but with liberal upgrade plans for the phones they offer.
6. Interpersonal Expectations - These reflect the relationship between the customer and the product or service provider. Person to person relationships are increasingly important, especially where products require support for proper use and functioning. Interpersonal expectations include interpersonal sharing of technical knowledge, ability to solve a problem, ability to communicate, reduced time to problem resolution, courtesy, patience, enthusiasm, helpfulness, assurance that they understood customers problem and customer perceptions regarding professionalism of conduct, often including image and appearance.
Failing to meet expectations
When a business fails to meet customer expectations, customers do business elsewhere. Poor customer service and the perceived indifference of staff and management account for about two thirds of customers who dont return to a business.
Customer complaints can alert you if your business is failing to meet customer expectations. Learn more about managing customer complaints.
Some actions you can take to improve customer service are: (1) investigate the areas of issue train staff in customer service and sales skills, (2) rotate staff so they can increase their knowledge of other areas, (3) encourage and support teamwork, (4) review recruitment and selection procedures.
Training
Training your staff is an investment in your business. Your staff are your most valuable asset and making sure they are trained with the skills and knowledge they need is essential for meeting your business goals. Training helps you get the most out of your staff and increases their job satisfaction, which can help you retain staff and avoid the expense of recruitment.
Regardless of what you are selling, you and your sales team can achieve great product sales by been trained and master a set of proven selling skills that focus on confidence, relationship-building, listening, persuasion and product knowledge.
Its important to include training in your business planning and budgeting. You should also consider whether changes in your business may require you to offer training.
Best practices
Good organizations share a few best practices that they incorporate into their efforts to exceed the expectations of their customers.
Best Practice #1: Listen to your customers
While the importance of listening to your customers is obvious, many organizations fail to fully listen and understand what customers are trying to tell them.
The key to understanding your customer is in providing feedback mechanisms and processes that will enable you to understand more about your customer than they do themselves. Customer satisfaction surveys and focus groups are two popular methods for listening to customers.
Customer satisfaction surveys
Independent customer satisfaction surveys are the first step to measuring your organizations ability to meet and exceed customer expectations for service. It is the most common best practice tool that is used by organizations to capture customer feedback.
Focus groups
Focus groups provide an opportunity to strengthen customer ties by forming stronger one-on-one customer relationships. They provide an opportunity to drill down more deeply into specific issues with customers and to capture levels of understanding not available in a survey format.
Best Practice #2: Set aggressive goals and metrics
Research shows that organizations must push themselves to set aggressive goals and metrics. You may be surprised to learn that your organization can exceed expectations and should therefore set aggressive goals in order to push the organization to peak performance and results for customer satisfaction. Organizations are finding that customers are demanding more customized service and they expect to have a satisfactory experience with your organization when they need service.
Best Practice #3: Innovate with CRM technology solutions
CRM software provides organizations with the technology tools to innovate and improve customer service. Traditional CRM software for customer service was aimed toward the efficient management of customer cases. But as customer service needs have evolved, so too has CRM software.
Best Practice #4: Transform business processes
Transforming business processes is not only about streamlining the number of processes you rely on, but it is also about how you execute them. Often times, customer service employees find themselves relying on word of mouth, informal notes, or luck when applying service strategies. By leveraging innovative technology capabilities can automatically drive consistent interactions across all of their communications channels. For example, Make certain that customers have a process that allows them to call one place, one number, one person and expect not to be transferred or to have to call multiple numbers.
Best Practice #5: Apply lessons learned
As your organization contemplates new customer-focused strategies, changes business processes, gathers customer data, and implements new technologies, consider applying some of the lessons learned.
Ending note
At times, you cannot win them all. You may have to give up on customers that do not perceive you favourably. No matter what you do to please them, their mental baggage will not allow them to appreciate the superior value you bring. Move along and search for other customers, clusters, niches, segments that can and will love what you have to offer.
Trying to be perfect for an imperfect mass market is not pragmatic; looking for customers that can tolerate your imperfections and love what you have to offer is the pivotal strategy for winning.

Launch of emergency mobile app
Ragging should stop - Minister
Ragging at higher education institutions should be done away with promptly in order to ensure an ideal education environment, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister was speaking at the launch of an Emergency Safety Mobile App to curtail ragging in universities, at the Higher Education Ministry yesterday.
The University Grants Commission (UGC), which stands for zero tolerance of all forms of violence in universities, has developed this app in collaboration with the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). The app has been developed for university students and academic and non-academic staff to be used in emergency situations of violence, including ragging and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).
The mobile app can be downloaded free of charge by undergraduates or by staff and can be utilised at any instance of ragging. If a particular student or any student close by is subjected to ragging, that particular student can inform authorities by pressing a button on his or her phone. Then relevant authorities take prompt action in this regard.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said that the Anti-Ragging Act should be implemented immediately to curtail ragging. It is the duty of university management to make use of this Act.
In line with the launching the mobile app, the university administration should take measures to utilise the Anti-Ragging Act, State Minister Grero said.

Sharp to buy Toshibas PC business for 4 billion
Sharp Corp. announced it will acquire Toshiba Corporations once-signature personal computer business in a bid to make a comeback in the PC market.
Sharp, controlled by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., will pay 4 billion for an 80.1 percent stake in Toshiba Client Solutions Co., a PC-related subsidiary of Toshiba that once held the biggest share of the global laptop market but has since lost out to overseas rivals. The stock transfer is planned for October 1.
Sharp also announced it will issue new shares worth up to 200 billion to buy back preferred shares from banks, seeking to quickly improve its financial status.
Sharp aims to turn Toshibas money-losing business into a new profit-driver by exploiting its liquid crystal display production and the manufacturing know-how of parent Hon Hai. Sharp said it plans to keep using Toshibas Dynabook PC brand name.
Toshiba is letting go of its suffering computer business as part of a portfolio-restructuring effort after facing a fiasco involving its U.S. nuclear unit, Westinghouse Electric Co., last year.
Sharp will take advantage of Hon Hais manufacturing capability to strengthen its hardware products as a cash-cow business, said Takao Matsuzaka, a credit analyst at Daiwa Securities Co.
He added that Sharps TV and smartphone segments have improved by teaming up with Hon Hai, a Taiwan-based manufacturing giant famous for iPhone assembly.
On top of Hon Hais manufacturing expertise, Sharp produces LCD panels, which can be used for computers. Thus, there is a good chance that Sharp can provide cost-competitive computers and turn the business into profit source, Matsuzaka said.
According to a document released by Toshiba, its computer business logged a 8.2 billion net loss in the business year that ended in March after seeing a 1.7 billion net loss the previous year.
According to Euromonitor International, a London-based research firm, Toshiba was ranked eighth in terms of global laptop share in 2017 with 1.92 percent.
As it struggled to recover from a money-losing spiral, Sharp was purchased by Hon Hai in 2016. Since then, the Osaka-based firm has improved its financial health.
In the business year that ended in March, Sharp posted a net profit every quarter for the first time in 10 years.
While Toshiba Client Solutions main business is computers, it also develops wearable devices and technologies related to the internet of things.
Sharp is aiming to strengthen its electronics business by incorporating artificial intelligence and the internet of things into more of its products, such as home appliances. Thus, Sharp may be interested in Toshiba Client Solutions-related technologies, said Matsuzaka.
Sharp has been led by Chief Executive Officer Tai Jeng-wu, who came from Hon Hai. Tai has expressed a willingness to re-enter some electronics businesses from which Sharp had withdrawn.
The company exited the computer business in 2010. (BBC)

## Title: SLFP, UNP and the Common Candidate
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, June 7, 2018 - 01:00
SLFP, UNP and the Common Candidate
Almost unexpectedly, last week saw the emergence of a new political strategy from President Maithripala Sirisena who is attempting to consolidate his leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which is beset with internal divisions.
The first hint of this came at the commemoration of the 76th birthday of Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera who provided inspirational leadership to the campaign against the Executive Presidency in late 2014, leading to the resignation of then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena and his emergence as the common candidate against Mahinda Rajapaksa.
To say that President Sirisena was forceful in his remarks is an understatement. Perhaps he was annoyed by the comments made at the ceremony by a Buddhist monk, Ven. Mugunuwatawana Siddatta Thera who stated that the yahapalanaya government lost track of its objectives only after President Sirisena took the leadership of a certain institution, a thinly veiled reference to the SLFP.
Visibly annoyed, President Sirisena lashed out. Observers noted that his speech was similar in tone and content to the speech he made prior to the general election in 2015, when he declared that he would not appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister even if the SLFP won the poll- only this time, at the receiving end was not only Rajapaksa but also the United National Party (UNP).
President Sirisena again alluded to the Central Bank bond sale, even though UNP stalwart Ravi Karunanayake who lost his Cabinet portfolio over the issue was seated in the front row of the audience. The late Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera didnt advocate a common candidate to rob the Central Bank, the President declared.
100-day programme
The President stated that he and other SLFP ministers were instrumental in blocking legislation at Cabinet level, which he said would have seen the transfer of funds from state banks to private sector banks. If this was allowed, the major state banks would have collapsed, he declared.
Other issue raised by the President was the yahapalanaya governments 100-day programme which, the President said, was a stupid plan and he did not know who its author was. Because of this programme, the dissolution of Parliament was postponed and with that the government lost the chance of obtaining a stable majority at the general election, he argued.
President Sirisena also referred to the provision of helicopters for his predecessor, Rajapaksa, to travel to his native Medamulana, after his election defeat. This was done without his approval, the President said, also noting that he had to use old vehicles for two years as President.
The Presidents speech did raise eyebrows, more within the government than in the opposition ranks. The question that was being asked was whether it was a spur of the moment emotional outburst in response to the veiled accusation made against him by the Buddhist monk- or whether it was a calculated strategy. The President was not reading off a script but it did appear that he had given considerable thought to what he had to say.
In the wake of the presidential outburst, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe moved into damage control mode. Addressing a UNP meeting at Sirikotha, the party headquarters, he told his parliamentarians to hold their horses. Clearly, the Prime Minister wanted to avoid an escalating slanging match between UNP and SLFP parliamentarians.
It is understood that a group of UNP ministers also held discussions with senior SLFP ministers in a bid to defuse the situation. The ministers were due to report to their respective leaders and the dialogue was set to continue, indicating that the coalition between the two parties will continue at least for the foreseeable future.
The questions raised by the Presidents speech are many. If it is assumed that it was part of a deliberate strategy- because President Sirisena is too mature a politician to give into the temptation of making a temperamental outburst- it raises the obvious issue of what the rationale behind the speech was.
JO faction
While it was abundantly clear that the President was not pleased with the UNP, its leadership and its policies, he also made it clear that there still was very little love lost between himself and the Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP. Hence the repeated references to concessions granted to the Rajapaksas, after the 2015 presidential election.
A hint of what that rationale could be emerged later in the week when President Sirisena chaired a meeting of the SLFPs Central Committee, the partys highest decision-making body at the Apey Gama complex at Battaramulla on Sunday.
The meeting was billed as a move towards restructuring the SLFP and was previously touted to be a first step towards rapprochement with the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the SLFP. However, whether the changes made would meet that objective remains to be seen. It appears that the President has directed the party only partially in this direction.
The most significant change was replacing General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake with an acting General Secretary, Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa. It was an open secret in the SLFP that there was little goodwill between Dissanayake and the JO faction.
Dissanayake was one of the few SLFP stalwarts to leave the party when the President, then serving as Health Minister, resigned to contest the election and as such, has every right to feel hard done by because of this decision. However, he has been appointed the national organiser of the party.
Piyadasa, a Professor in Mass Communication at the Kelaniya University is a veteran SLFPer but not an active politician. In this respect, the SLFP appears to be moving in the opposite direction to the UNP which previously had professionals in the post of general secretary but now has full time politicians in that role.
The other noteworthy appointments were the designation of Rajapaksa, along with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne as advisors to the party. Rajapaksas appointment is ironical in that he is the de facto leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which is in effect the dissident faction of the SLFP. Rajapaksa was not present at the meeting on Sunday and has not commented publicly as yet on his appointment.
Presidential and general elections
The SLFP will now also have four Senior Vice Presidents in Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and former Ministers W.D.J. Seneviratne, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha. Except de Silva, the others recently quit the government and decided to sit in the opposition. Their allegiance is likely to be towards the Rajapaksa faction at the next elections. Therefore, their appointment appears to be a compromise with the dissidents.
Significantly, those directly professing their loyalty to the JO have not been appointed to the highest positions in the party. This appears to be a deliberate decision by President Sirisena to retain his hold on the mainstream SLFP while still making some concessions to the dissidents. The President, while meeting the JO aspirations halfway, has clearly indicated that he intends to be at the helm of the partys affairs.
These moves by President Sirisena, both within the SLFP and also against some actions of the UNP, his coalition partner, suggest that he will be very much in the running from the SLFP at the next presidential and general elections. It is also a signal to the JO and the SLPP that any reconciliation appears distant right now, although the national elections are eighteen months away- but that is a very long time in the volatile climate of Sri Lankan politics.

Spreading culture of peace
Global conflicts from terror and disputes pervade media coverage, and the international society is throwing back the question of peace. Citizens around the world, watching the disputes arising from religious intolerance or power struggle, are voluntarily seeking practical solutions to achieve peace and taking actions, states a Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) release.
The release adds: In May at over 100 cities in 50 countries, worldwide peace campaigns named 5th Annual Commemoration of the Declaration of World Peace, have been carried out to advocate peace-building led by grassroots such as youth, citizens, civic groups, and media. The Declaration of World Peace was announced in 2013 by an international peace NGO affiliated with UN ECOSOC, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) to call for all members of society to work together as peace messengers.
Joining this global peace campaign, an event titled 5th Annual Commemoration of the Declaration of World Peace and the Peace Walk in Peace Lanka was held in Sri Lanka.
Indika Niyadandupola, Principal of Wayamba Technical College said, Actually, peace education has to be provided children and youth to enlighten them with the values and spirit of peace according to the declaration that HWPL proclaimed. To do this, it needs creating good educators and inserting the curriculum of peace education to school syllabus for spreading a culture of peace.
South Korea held the recent inter-Korean summit breaking a decade of the turbulent period of tension, the event with the theme of Realizing Peace on the Korean Peninsula was held simultaneously in 12 cities on May 25, when the declaration was announced. It aimed to seek ways to interact freely with North and South, based on the citizen-centered peace activities, and to encourage citizens to take an active role in the progress in peace-building on the Korean peninsula.
Many leaders in many parts of the world showed their support for peaceful unification of Korea.As all humanity desires peace, the Korean Peninsula and globe will indeed see peace, HWPL Chairman Man Hee Lee said.
Volunteers and citizens from various countries including the U.S, Sri Lanka, India, China, France as well as Afghanistan and Palestine, the disputed areas, gathered for activities such as peace walk, peace letter writing, and signing campaign for international law for peace in order to enact an international peace law and spread a culture of peace.

Sunday morning tuition classes hampering Dhamma school attendence
Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Deputy Minister of Home Affairs J. A. Alawathuwala said that many school children do not attend Sunday Dhamma schools on Sundays since private tuition classes are held at a stretch from early morning to late evenings on Sundays.
He was speaking at a meeting of a Dhamma school teachers held at We Uda Raja Maha Viharaya, Mawathagama, Kurunegala yesterday.
Although the former NWP-PC Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had declared a law instructing and banning all private tuition masters within the NWP not to conduct private tuition classes on Sunday mornings, as students miss their dhamma school lessons that help them to be morally disciplined future citizens, the law is not in effect now and not followed here in the Kurunegala District, Hence, those who violate that rule purposely underestimating the laws should be legally punished, as most of the students are now living and behaving impolitely far away from their religions and noble human morals.
If this situation is not seriously addressed appropriately, the evils among the youth would grow and it will become a social tragedy in the near future.
All citizens are legally bound to respect the law and hence, the NWP-PC must implement immediately, the law of prohibiting private tuition classes in the morning hours on Sundays, Deputy Minister J. C. Alawathuwala said.

Supreme Court rejects NI abortion law case

Human rights campaigners have lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law.

The court dismissed an appeal brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC).

But a majority of judges said the existing law was incompatible with human rights law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crime.

Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.

Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.

'Inhuman' treatment

The commission lost on the issue of whether they had the required standing to bring the case, and analysts suggest the defeat came because of a technical legal point.

The Supreme Court judges said it would have required the case to have been brought by a woman who was pregnant as a result of sexual crime or who was carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality.

A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth, although anti-abortion campaigners have argued that terminally-ill babies "can and do defy the odds".

As a result, the judges did not make a formal declaration of incompatibility, which would normally lead to a change in the law.

The ruling comes just weeks after the Republic of Ireland voted decisively in a referendum to reform the country's strict abortion laws, which had effectively banned all terminations.

The referendum reignited a debate about Northern Ireland's law, with some calling for reform while others - including the biggest party, the Democratic Unionist Party - remain opposed to changing the law.

The NICHR had argued that the current law subjects women to "inhuman and degrading" treatment, causing "physical and mental torture," in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Transmission center shut down by TRCSL:
TNL to file facts before Polgahawela Magistrate
The TNL Media Network will file facts before the Polgahawela Magistrate on Friday (08) with regards to the shutting down of their repeater transmission center located in Polgahawela, TNL News Manager Teran Karannagoda said.
Responding to Daily News, Karannagoda said that they are to appear before Polgahawela Magistrates Courts where they will present their case.
He also said that the TNL media network denies the charges leveled against their company by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL).
Karannagoda further said that they will take other necessary legal measures after appearing before the courts on Friday.
A repeater transmission center in Polgahawela belonging to the TNL Media Network was shut down last Tuesday.
The Polgahawela Magistrates Court issued the relevent court order. The Police have presented facts to the court based on a complaint made by the TRCSL and the Polgahawela Magistrate Court has issued an order to seize the equipment and conduct an investigation in to the charges leveled against them.
According to reports, the removal has affected transmission to areas including the Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba and Western Provinces. The shutting down on the transmission center was the highlight at the Parliament sittings on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) says that action was taken to shut down TNLs illegal transmission in Polgahawela due it causing interference to other government channels and causing a loss to the government and that there is no other undue ambition behind the action.
The TRCSL said it has taken action against such violations with regard to illegal broadcasting stations operated by different companies including Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation at Balangoda.
Issuing a statement yesterday, the TRCSL Director General P.R.S.P. Jayathilake stated that the TV transmission operated by Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd is presently licensed for 9 locations throughout the country namely Colombo, Nuwara Eliya (Mt. Oliphant), Karagahatenna, Piliyandala, Awissawella, Badulla, Gongala, Hantana and Ratnapaura.
He said that a television transmitter should be used at each of above location and a valid licence should be obtained under Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No 27 of 1996.
The licence issued will be valid for a period of one year and renewable for another year, on payment of relevant licence fee.
Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has obtained a valid licence for the year 2018, after payment of relevant licence fee for the above 9 locations. But no licence has been issued in favour of above Company by TRCSL to use VHF CH 11 or VHF CH 3 at Polgahawela.
Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has operated VHF CH L1 and CH 3 from time to time for a considerable period of time in contravention to the Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunication Act No 25 of 1991 as amended causing interference to other licence government broadcasters.
The TRCSL said it has informed Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd to shut down this illegal transmission on April 27, 2016.
Ignoring the above letter, Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has continued the aforementioned transmission causing interference to other government channels and without making due payment causing loss to the government.
Therefore the TRCSL has been compelled to take action against this violation based on above grounds and the TRCSL emphasizes that there is no any other undue ambition behind this action, the statement said.
The TRCSL said it has taken action against such violations with regard to illegal broadcasting stations operated by different companies including Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation at Balangoda.

Therefore, there is no point of closing down the State Medical Faculty.
Alwis said it is possible to have hidden agendas behind the closing down of this State Medical Faculty because there are many reasons for the Government and certain persons to close down this State Medical Faculty of the Eastern University. There is a private medical faculty,Baticaloa Campus of Sri Lanka to be opened soon. It is located very close to the Eastern University.

Water management systems for cultivation to be improved
The farmer organizations in Anuradhapura district complained to the Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake that the irrigation officers didnt issue adequate irrigational water for their farm lands despite there was sufficient water in the tanks to be distributed.
They charged as a result of this lethargic and irresponsible attitude of irrigation authorities, they were prevented from cultivating irrigable land. These submissions were presented by the farmers at a meeting held at the Rambewa Divisional Secretariat auditorium recently with the irrigation Minister in the chair.
The farmers representing the Padaviya, Mahakanadarawa and Huruluwewa, integrated farmer organization were present at the session along with irrigation officials in the region.
The water issue systems to be followed during the forthcoming cultivation seasons, repairing dilapidated irrigational structures, payment of cultivation losses compensation, the progress being achieved at Yanoya and lower Malwathuoya reservoir projects etc were discussed at the meeting and views exchanged between Minister Duminda Dissanayake addressing the farmers and the officials emphasized that since Irrigation, Water Resources Management and Disaster Management affairs go together, the water management systems could be implemented in a better way if correctly coordinated.
He said that although 100 percent water is issued at upper irrigational level, only 70 percent or less than that is reached at the farmlands. He appreciated that water management technology adopted by Padaviya farmers during 2018 Maha season, where they managed to cultivate the whole landscape of 13,500 acres when the water level at the Padaviya reservoir was 4,000 a.f. out of the normal capacity of 85,000 a.f.
They managed to use every drop of limited rain fall and harvested 150 to 200 bushes of paddy per acre.
In the meantime illegal water tapping along the 65 km long feeder canal carrying Mahaweli water to Huruluwewa reservoir also was pointed out by the farmer organizations representatives to the Minister.
They said that the full water volume being sent through the canal to Huruluwewa for their cultivation purposes was illegally tapped by some tourist hotel owners and large scale business minded cultivators en-route and also water sources being blocked in several tanks such as Habarana, Thalkote etc by the Agrarian Development department.
The habit of waiting till the tank starts spilling to start seasonal paddy cultivation shall be done away with. The farmers and officials shall work hand in hand to achieve a record productivity by minimizing crop failures and compensation following practical water management strategies, the Minister emphasized further.
Everything is not politics. Politicians try to enhance the number of votes in their favour by hook or by crook, misguiding and hoodwinking the innocent farmers by misinterpreting even the governments people friendly policies. The JVPs Namal Karunarathne type is in the caliber of having taken to hypocritical politics. The famer community shall not allow such elements to deceive them, the Minister appealed.

There is no quick solution to cleaning out impurities but if you make sure that your skin is healthy and clean every day then you will definitely see the results that you need. Consider doing a cleanse completely - inside and outside your body.
Its never too late to try out these simple tips to improve how your skin looks and feels.
 Using creamy and oil free face wash
 Using anti-aging creams
 Protecting your skin from the sun
 Saying no to smoking
 Using only trusted products
 Cleaning out skin impurities immediately
Reducing crows feet
The eye area has the thinnest skin on our body-eyelids are three to five times thinner than the skin on the rest of our face. We blink about 10,000 times a day, and all our emotions are dealt with in the eyes. Mix this with the aging process, squinting, smoking, and other factors, and you have crow's feet.
Invest in an Eye Cream and Mask. If the idea of microneedling is too invasive for you, eye creams can diminish the effect just as well, and prevent them from forming in the first place if you're one of the elite who has yet to get them. Use eye treatments or massage the area starting in your twenties, or as early as possible.
Exercise the eye and face area by rolling your eyes around, then scrunching and releasing your entire face.
You can also use ice or refrigerated creams on the area as this is anti-inflammatory and stimulates your skin.
All about aging spots and how to remove them
Age spots - also called liver spots and solar lentigines - are small dark areas on your skin. They vary in size and usually appear on the face, hands, shoulders and arms - areas most exposed to the sun. Age spots are very co mmon in adults older than 50. But true age spots are harmless and don't need treatment.
Botox
Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin are all used to counter wrinkles. They're a purified form of botulinum toxin A, meaning there's no botulism risk when used properly. They work by blocking the nerves that contract muscles, softening the appearance of wrinkles.
Facelift
A facelift reshapes the lower half of the face by removing excess facial skin. Rhytidectomy can tighten loose, hanging skin around the jaw line, also known as jowls.
It can also remove deep creases around the mouth and nose, and excess, hanging skin and fat under the chin and in the neck.
The procedure can also tighten the underlying tissues, and it may be combined with surgery to enhance the forehead, cheeks, brows, and eyelids.

Work begins on Aruwakkalu sanitary landfill site
The project to transport garbage from Colombo to a sanitary landfill site in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam will go ahead with Cabinet approving funding for the project.
In February this year, Sri Lanka sought Word Bank funds to part finance the US$ 274 million project. The project spearheaded by Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry had planned to dispose solid waste in Colombo to Aruwakkalu and further develop an existing site in Muthurajawela.
The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry had received Cabinet approval to negotiate US$ 115 million from the World Banks' International Bank for Reconstruction and Development window. By April however, the World Bank which had released US$ 200 million for the garbage disposal project and the Kelani River Flood Protection work pulled out alleging corrupt practices in the tender process.
This week, a Cabinet paper on the subject noted that the contract for the project had already been awarded and that funds would be released to initiate the procurement process to purchase 34 container wagons and 94 container boxes which would transport solid waste in selected urban areas in Colombo to Aruwakkalu.

Health Sciences to be made compulsory subject at GCE O/Ls
Cabinet has decided to make compulsory, the subject of Health Sciences at the GCE Ordinary Level exams.
The Cabinet Paper on the proposal was submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
His proposal is in addition to the recommendation made by the Committee of Experts on Educational Reforms for the 2023 national syllabus.
The Minister had pointed out that annually 75 percent of the deaths in the country were as a result of Non-Communicable Diseases.
Around 72.5 percent of the countrys population do not consume the required daily quantities of fruits and vegetables in their diet. When it came to the female population, 44 percent do not engage in any physical activity. In order to change such behaviour, it was seen as a necessity to continue Health Science education as a mandatory subject, Minister Senaratne said.
The proposal will be implemented subject to approval of the National Education Commission. At present, Health Sciences are taught from Grade 6 until Grade 9 and is a non-compulsory subject at the O/L exam.

Im doing something right - Kagiso Rabada on six-award night
Kagiso Rabada is the best bowler in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Player Rankings, and that was reflected in the Cricket South Africa (CSA) awards function on Saturday, when he went home with six trophies.
Rabada, 23, won the awards for Cricketer of the Year, Players Player of the Year, Test Cricketer of the Year, ODI Cricketer of the Year, Fans Player of the Year, and the Delivery of the Year for the ball he dismissed David Warner with in the third Test at Newlands earlier this year.
It wasnt a surprise. Since the start of 2017, Rabada has picked up 95 wickets in 18 Tests at an average of 20.03 and 32 wickets in 23 one-day internationals at 30.87.
I am grateful and honoured to have received these awards, he said. It means Im doing something right. Im glad to have done it for the team and for the country. It felt good to do what I did, but at the same time, I really do think that the whole team contributed. If you look at the Test matches we played, whenever we were in trouble, there was always someone different who bailed us out.
There were guys like Aiden (Markram) and AB (de Villiers) and Dean (Elgar), who were consistent, but if you look at the roles that other guys played like a Keshav (Maharaj), like a Temba (Bavuma), like a Quinny (Quinton de Kock) at Newlands. Those guys are not getting too much recognition, but when you are in the changing room you see it all. I just feel like everyone contributed. Fantastically as Rabada has bowled, there have been occasions when his on-field behaviour has come under scrutiny, most recently in the Test series against Australia at home, which South Africa won 3-1.
Theres certain things that happened to me, some good and some bad, which I have taken note of and made a conscious effort to improve on them, whether it be on the cricket field or just in my life, he said. Thats where I am at the moment, just trying to build on from last season and trying to be ruthless by bringing this on in the new season.
The big winner among the women was Dane van Niekerk, the South Africa captain.
Van Niekerk ranks among the best bowlers and all-rounders in the world in limited-overs cricket, and since the start of 2017, has 443 runs and 36 wickets in 25 ODIs and 222 runs and two wickets in seven T20Is. She has also led her team well, taking them to the semi-finals of the ICC Womens World Cup 2017.

It marks the return of actors Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Julie Walters, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Dominic Cooper and also feature Lily James and Cher.
Obviously no ones going to be comparing the two in the great canon of film, but that was very much the template.
Its a beautiful idea that you can jump backwards and forwards and learn more about the present from the past, he said.

According to the spokesman, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that both Western and Ayurvedic medical treatment systems should be in equilibrium, adding that otherwise, the medical profession would not reach the required standards.
The minister further said appointments had been provided to 900 Ayurvedic graduates and that Health officials were instructed to establish Regional Health Services Directors Offices for the Ayurvedic system.
He said the main reason behind the inability to develop the Ayurvedic treatment system in Sri Lanka, was due to the local officials poor attitude towards it.

While the DC universe hasnt exactly been a complete success so far, the one movie that was both critically praised and a commercial smash was Wonder Woman. It was the biggest grossing movie of last summer, and expectations are high for next years sequel. With production on Wonder Woman 2 about to start, producer Geoff Johns has teased a logo for the movie.
Johns took to Facebook to showcase the logo. It reads WW84, with the letters designed with a VHS-style static effect. Weve known for some time that Wonder Woman 2 will be set in the 1980s, and this suggests that itll specifically take place in 1984. Hollywood Reporter

The 21st Century learner
It is common knowledge that incredible technological changes are defining our current reality, impacting on our approach to society, to planning and to breaking new ground in terms of education. This phenomenon has immensely widened the gap between the teachers and their students. It is therefore imperative that educators must understand the overarching characteristics, perspectives and styles of the students belonging to the Z generation.
They are the students who with access to more information through smartphones, broadband Internet access at home, or an online connection at school than any other generation at their age. Though anything they want to know is only a click away, they also recognize threats online, such as identity theft, cyberbullying, and phishing. Thus, understanding Generation Zs characteristics and the socio-cultural and political contexts they live in seem to provide insight into how their perspectives have been influenced. All those who are involved in the field of education including policy planners, curriculum designers, textbook writers, teachers and teacher educators must be aware of their perspectives when it comes to learning and teaching and fulfilling their aspirations.
Characteristics of the Z Generation
All the school students today belong to Z Generation born between 1996 and 2012 and the majority of the teachers are from X and Y Generations. It has been found that learning for the students belonging to Z Generation is entirely different from that of all the previous generations. They are truly the first digitally native generation. Those who were born in this generation are very comfortable with the internet and social media. They are the ones who see these tools as a good way to socialize or communicate with people without feeling isolated from the rest of the world.
Generation Z students prefer to engage in hands-on learning opportunities in that they there try to apply what they learn to their real life. Plus, these students are good observers and they prefer to observe how others complete their tasks before applying the learning to them. Further, they are much interested in coming to know that the concepts they learn either in school or elsewhere have a broader applicability rather than the practice examples they experience in the classroom.
Intrapersonal learning is yet another characteristic of the Z Generation. The reason behind this feature is that the individual nature of technology has greatly influenced them to get accustomed to learning independently. They focus on setting their own pace and making meaning of their learning before they share their experiences with others. This does not necessarily mean that they prefer individual learning. They prefer collaborative work and need social learning.
Learning styles for Generation Z students
Generation Z students are not interested in using technology for unnecessary or useless purposes and instead, they are keen on incorporating it in such a way that they can view the world with different perspectives or, in other words, they can think differently. Particularly, they employ technology in their problem-solving in order that they may think deeply and have an insight into what they are engaged in doing. It has also been found that they want to attend school for social connections but not for achieving vocational skills or skills of technology which they can easily gain by themselves.
It is evident that the majority of the Z Generation students today connect with people around the world online, and they are really good at using many technological devices to play games, find materials, read, and consume information. They do not want others to shape their journey but they need others as guides to help them shape their lifestyle by themselves.
Traditional teaching-learning methodology
Generation Z students are of course not interested in the work done in the school environment. Because of the traditional teaching and learning mythology, many students seem to have got tired of the school life which has inevitably resulted in paying less attention to school work and finding information from other sources.
Today, in Sri Lankan context, and almost in all the schools, Advanced Level students keep away from school in Grade 13 classes. I was informed by some parents that even the students in Grade 11 classes show reluctance to go to school in the second half of the year. There are many students who have got fed up with the school work.
Gen Z-ers have a greater tendency to be involved in social learning environments in which they can achieve hands-on experience by directly engaging in the learning process. On the other hand, they are more inclined to embrace career-focused experiences. They are highly interested in involving themselves in the learning process rather than coming to school and listening to a lesson done by a teacher. They can actively take part in the learning process if such opportunities are provided for them to immerse themselves in educational experience and to enjoy by encountering challenges thrown by the technological world. It has been revealed that they are much comfortable to work with other students even outside of their schools by using digital tools such as online forums.
Generation Z as a digital Generation needs an environment where digital tools are integrated into their learning process. Unfortunately, there has not been a shift towards this in our school environment and traditional teaching-learning methodology they experience in many schools in the country does not either motivate or inspire them to be active learners.
What is to be done
All these changes boil down to the fact that there has arisen an essential need to meet the students where they are in their networked digital adolescent lives. In other words, we have to have a shift in pedagogy in order to meet their needs. This does not necessarily mean that we are expected to use more technology in the classroom, but this new paradigm needs to take advantage of the new media to the teaching-learning process.
Palfrey and Gasser in their book Born Digital: How Children Grow up in a Digital Age provide important information on how teaching and learning process can be changed to arrest the problem. Today, it has been found that much of the learning generally takes place outside the classroom. Teachers thus have to adapt their methodology in such a way so that students in-school activities can be connected with their out-of-school interests.
Another view presented by them is that technology can also be used as a means to a specific end. In the globalized economy acquisition of 21st-Century skills is paramount important to face the new challenges thrown by the new digital society. Perhaps, a student may need to write a computer code or even to hack in order to show the weaknesses of the information system. By doing these things they are overtly or covertly getting themselves prepared for the new job which will inevitably be there when they leave the school or graduate. One may raise the question whether technology can be used for developing students character.
Use of social media today has given rise to a big number of ethical issues. Students too are encountered with ethical questions when they use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other media. Plagiarism has also become one of the big issues among the younger generation. If technology is in the hands of inspired and motivated teachers and learners, there will definitely be a big shift in the quality of education given in schools. But the greatest problem today is that there are very few teachers who have the ability and a clear sense of how to use technology in the classroom.
On the other hand, very few schools have attempted to find out the connection between how the students belonging to the Z generation are actually learning and the teaching and learning methods used by their teachers. It is vehemently important for the schools to adapt to the ways of how children process information and they also must understand that modes of learning are drastically changing in the digital age. This is apparently a very complex situation because if the technology is to be appropriately used these changes must be fully appended. Moreover, in order to understand these changes our frame of reference has to be expanded from classroom learning to other areas where students learning takes place.

50 Greatest Players in WC History
#23 Jairzinho
Playing football for Brazil is a complicated thing. First of all, you have to prove that youre worthy of being in the limelight. Then you gotta reign supreme and prove that youre head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. Thats the kind of pedigree you inherit with the storied yellow kit.
How many players can boast about having scored in each and every match of a World Cup Dont scratch your heads, Ill tell you. Two players. Uruguays Alcides Ghiggia and Brazils Jairzinho. The former scored 4 in 4 and our man, Jairzinho, scored 6 in 6 in the 1970 World Cup held in Mexico.
After a forgettable 1966 World Cup, Brazil were ready to fire on all cylinders in Mexico and boy did they have the architects to execute the plans!
This was, what is widely touted to be the finest Brazil side of all time. A team that could rewrite history if they so desired. A team that could weave poetry on grass if they so wanted. How about I make things a little easier to discern and tell you that Rivelino, Tostao Gerson, Carlos Alberto, Pele and Jairzinho were the ones championing Brazils World Cup campaign at the time.
Its so easy to get lost in the glitz in that team. With so many stars shining brightly, youd be excused for getting eclipsed. And that, perhaps, did happen in Jairzinhos case. Its not that the rest outshone him but Jairzinhos comes across as a rather forgotten name who just had one great World Cup to show for. But the reality is far from that.
Jairzinho played in 3 World Cups and his fortunes at each of them varied like subcontinental weather on a summer evening. Sure, there was Pele, there were Rivelino, Tostao and all of them who have all left an indelible mark on the game but to win a game, World Cup or no World Cup, you need goals. And Jairzinho provided them without fail on every single night.
The 1970 World Cup is regarded as the high point in World Cup history and Jairzinho was the standout performer. He finished the tournament with a flourish, putting the game beyond doubt against the Italians who were threatening to upset the Selecaos peace by pulling one back with the game getting nervy at 2-1.
The starry vessels crew that Jairzinho was a part of has definitely diminished his glow. Youll perhaps get a better idea of things if you heard what Jairzinhos teammate and legendary centre-forward Tosta told ESPN FC about his teammate.
When people talk about the greatest forwards in history, they never remember him. It seems that he was only a forward that had his moment under the sun just during the 1970 World Cup, but he was much more than that.
Jairzinho was a bit like Neymar, playing from the side to the centre and striking with precision. He had speed, strength and a lot of skill. When we played him a long ball, he was spectacular. He bumped, gained his space with his body, and still managed to shoot with skill.
And his oeuvre included the whole shebang.
If he meticulously lobbed the ball home against Romania, he finished off one of the greatest goals in the history of the tournament by leathering one into the roof of the net against England. But nothing quite beats the goal he scored to seal the World Cup in the final against Italy.
Jairzinho charged onto a flick from Pele and drove past the Italian defenders at blistering pace and though he didnt get the kind of finish on it as he would have liked, he did just about enough to poke it past the keeper.
He is often dismissed as being a player who just found great form in one tournament but Jairzinho was much more than that. The hipster romantics will still root for the magic Garrincha weaved on the wings and would have not really been interested in Jairzinhos directness and desire to get the ball and smash in a goal.
But for buoying the greatest football team to the greatest triumph in world football, in perhaps the greatest World Cup of all time, Jairzinho gets a red carpet welcome into our 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

Arms trade treaty in post-war Lanka
Any legitimate governments utmost responsibility will be to protect its own people from enemies, protect its territorial land, maintain law and order, improve its socioeconomic status, protect and safeguard its natural environment, historical and other nationally valued interests, and which is supportive of world peace. To have all these, no doubt, those governments need to have armies and police equipped with certain weapons. Such weapons need to produced or acquired from other countries in a transparent and responsible manner. Transparent and responsible arms trade will heal many wounds of nations without doubt.
But the question is how many governments are legitimately engaged in a transparent and responsible arms trade In todays context arms trade is the biggest business on the planet which involves mainly governments, politicians, the corporate sector, arms brokers, terrorists, armed groups and influential individuals. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2015 financial value of the global arms trade was at the US $ 93.3 billion.
Governments failure to meet basic needs of people
Today, most of the developing nations are facing severe economic, social, environmental or political crises which negate their socio-economic development and safeguard the natural environment. Directly or indirectly this links to the ongoing armed conflicts or preparation for armed conflicts if they arise in the future. This led to Governments not being able to meet the basic needs of people (human security-health, education etc.) and tend to spend more and more resources on acquiring or producing arms and ammunition. This tendency will not only be able to find peaceful solutions for their issues but also profiting the arms producers and arms brokers.
Terrorists and armed groups acquire conventional weapons
Terrorist groups and armed groups around the world engage with various businesses such as fighting against the states, fighting among armed groups, anti-poaching activities which thrive on the illegal wildlife trade, human smuggling, drug dealings and business of killing humans etc. The illicit weapons trade which thrives in the present day global arms trade. Sometimes governments may engage in illicit arms trade which the arms directly or indirectly falls into the hands of terrorist or armed groups.
Importance of regulated arms industry for local development
Unregulated and irresponsible conventional arms trade intensify and prolong conflicts, lead to increase sporadic levels of human rights abuses, hinder socio-economic development, regional instability and loss of natural resources, this includes an increase in the illegal wildlife trade.
Developing nations like Sri Lanka suffered heavily due to the 30-year long war between the Government Security Forces and LTTE until 2009. The LTTE had acquired weapons from various sources around the world to fight against the Government Security Forces. The LTTE had submarines which the Sri Lankan Navy was not equipped with. They had ships to transport weapons from around the world. Still, no records are available about how much the LTTE spent on acquiring weapons. No doubt that it was a multi-billion dollar business. The Government of Sri Lanka has also acquired certain conventional weapons, which were not done in a transparent manner according to the media reports during the war.
The 30-year war brought Sri Lanka to a standstill at various points. Sri Lanka is one of the countries in the world which suffered heavily due to the unregulated arms industry. The 30-year war in Sri Lanka tells the world of the importance of having a regulated arms industry. This will no doubt help developing nations to meet peoples expectations and the governments to be supportive of them.
Illicit arms issue in Sri Lanka
Due to illicit arms (small arms and light weapons) every year many civilians get killed in Sri Lanka. Most of the small arms and light weapons used in Sri Lanka in automatic forms and bullets which are imported from other countries and none of them are produced in Sri Lanka. Still, there is no record available about how many illicit arms are in the hands of armed underworld groups and individuals in Sri Lanka. This directly hinders the socio-economic development, political stability of the country and the security of the people.
Some years prior to the ATT came into force in 2014 Sri Lanka had some impressive actions against the proliferation of illicit arms. During the height of the war in 2005, the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has set up the National Commission against Proliferation of Illicit Arms in All Its Aspect (NCAPISA). Not only in Sri Lanka was that the first commission but also in the world to set up in that nature. The NCAPISA led many activities against illicit small arms and light weapons proliferation in Sri Lanka and has shown the world Sri Lankas commitment on the matter.
In 2006 several important steps were taken in this regard. In 2006 July, Sri Lanka destroyed over 35,000 small arms to mark the International Gun Destruction Day at the Independence Square. The same year Sri Lankas Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN New York Prasad Kariyawasam presided over the UN Conference to Review Progress in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects which was held in New York. At the same conference on June 26, 2006 Sri Lankas then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa made a statement on Sri Lankas progress with regard to NCAPISA and country commitments on the subject.
In 2008 March, the NCAPISA published a survey report with a foreword by then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. On May 8, 2008, a report was submitted to the UN Conference mentioned above. In 2009, the war ended with the LTTE and during that time NCAPISA became defunct and post-war Sri Lanka started again to experience the proliferation of illicit weapons.
What is the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)
The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which was adopted in 2013 by 154 member states in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and which came into force in 2014. The ATT offers a framework for establishing international norms for responsible trade in conventional arms. The ATT is not a disarmament Treaty. Its an arms control Treaty which aims to achieve a responsible trade. The ATT is designed to regulate arms transfers and to promote responsibility, transparency and accountability in the global arms trade. A core purpose of the Treaty is to reduce human suffering.
The ATT is largely a normative treaty that seeks to promote appropriate governmental regulation of the cross-border trade of conventional weapons. The Treaty includes the activities of the international trade comprised of export, import, transit, trans-shipment, and transfer and brokering. The Treaty seeks to prevent conventional military weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists or organised crime groups.
The ATT is the only weapon related Treaty which talks about gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children due to armed conflict and armed violence. The ATT will positively impact the achievement of a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including Goal 5 on Gender Equity, Goal 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 17 on Partnerships.
Post-war Sri Lankas engagement with the ATT
The ATT came into force in 2014, five years after the war ended in Sri Lanka. But Sri Lanka is still not a State Party to the ATT. During the negotiations of the ATT Sri Lanka was an active participant and voted in favour of adopting the Treaty at the UNGA in 2013. A prominent Sri Lankan Ambassador H.M.G.S. Palihakkara chaired the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters (Appointed by the UN Secretary-General) of its annual two sessions (57th and 58th) of the year 2012 which focused on the arms trade. The Advisory Board recommended continued efforts to promote awareness of circumstances in which there can be negative consequences of the arms trade to the UN Secretary-General.
Parliamentarians for Global Action (PGA), Sri Lankas Chapter Chairman Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Secretary Thilanga Sumathipala MP, had been supportive of promoting the ATT. In 2017, President Maithripala Sirisena made some important statements with relation to the global arms industry. Among them, on May 11, he said: In my opinion, we will be able to build a conflict-free world if the manufacturers of firearms take up different lines of business to earn a living, it is the manufacturers of firearms that should be brought to the negotiating table. This May Harshana Rajakaruna MP actively participated at the South Asian Roundtable Discussion on Promoting and Universalisation of the ATT in Nepal.
The way forward
Sri Lanka should immediately re-activate the National Commission Against Proliferation of Illicit Arms in All Its Aspect (NCAPISA). As its first step recovered arms and ammunition from the LTTE and underworld activities should be destroyed publicly at a place like the Independence Square or Galle Face Green. This could be organised in parallel to the next year 10th anniversary of ending the war between the LTTE and the Government Security Forces.
Post-war Sri Lanka should engage with the international community to eradicate the illicit trade of arms which encompasses export, import, brokering and transfer. Rather it should be supportive of socio-economic, political, environmental and other sectors development locally and globally. There are various opportunities for a post-war country like Sri Lanka to accede to the ATT. Since Sri Lanka does not produce or engage with illicit global arms trade which provides an opportunity be a State Party without a question. Post-war Sri Lanka should be the first country to accede to the ATT in South Asia.
This opportunity should not be missed by Sri Lanka. This shows that the country will not take any side and will act as a neutral nation in the region and maintain the Non-Aligned Foreign Policy. No doubt that this will help to make a pathway to Sri Lanka becoming a Soft Power in the region and bring back the old glory of being a Champion of Disarmament.
Sri Lanka will host the 18th Conference of Parties (CoP) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) next year. The CITES CoP18 will be held for the first time in Sri Lanka which will be attended by 184 countries. This will be the first ever biggest international gathering in Sri Lanka. The CITES always talks about the direct link between illegal arms trade and illegal international wildlife trade. If the CITES CoP18 host country Sri Lanka becomes State Party to the ATT before next year it shows the countrys commitment and support for denouncing the international illegal wildlife trade.
The Buddha preached that lay people should not engage with five types of wrong livelihood and one of them is business in weapons. Not only in Buddhism but also in other religions the arms trade will not be tolerated. Sri Lanka as a predominantly Buddhist country with other religions (Hindu, Christian and Islam) is a multi-religious nation and should not be supportive of the illicit arms trade and should accede to the ATT without delay.

Bangladesh apparel products losing ground in US markets
Bangladesh lost its apparel export market share in US markets to close competitors last year, data released by the US government shows.
Stakeholders say the country is facing this problem due to losing price competitiveness and lack of product diversification.
According to the US Department of Commerces Office of Textiles and Apparel (Otexa) data, Bangladeshs export earnings from US saw a 4.46% fall to $5.07 billion in 2017, which was $5.30 billion a year ago. Bangladeshs market share in US apparel market came down to 6.31% from 6.58%.
Vietnam, one of the closest competitors of Bangladesh, registered over 7% growth in the US apparel market, followed by Mexico at 5.33%, India at 1.19% and Pakistan at 1% in the same period.
China, the largest exporter of apparel products, also saw a decline in export earnings as well as market share in the US. According to Otexa, Chinas export to US saw a 3.17% fall, while market share came down to 33.67% in 2017 from 34.69% in the previous year.
The total export from Bangladesh to the US was $5.27 billion in 2017, down by 3.98% from 2016. Of this, only $204 million was from non-apparel products.
Right now, price competitiveness is a big challenge for Bangladesh in the global markets. The production cost has gone up due to safety improvement spending as well as wage hike. The advantage of cheap labour is over, Exporters Association of Bangladesh (EAB) president Abdus Salam Murshedy told the Dhaka tribune.
Meanwhile our competitors have gained competitiveness due to government policy support and incentives, said Salam.
The fall in Bangladeshs earnings from apparel exports to the US is bigger than the total drop in US apparel and textile imports, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem said.
