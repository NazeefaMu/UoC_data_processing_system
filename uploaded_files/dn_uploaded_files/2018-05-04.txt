Bankrupt politicians hope for political instability
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that the politicians who dont have the peoples vote are trying to create political instability in the country.
He stressed that some politicians are planning to topple the government. He was addressing a religious ceremony held at Dematagoda, yesterday. There is no political instability. But several incidents occurred which should not have happened.
Those were started by politicians who are greedy for power. Some politicians who think they can win elections with money try to topple the government. Investments have stopped due to the acts of gamblers. This kind of politicians do not consider about the country, the Minister stated.
The last Cabinet reshuffle took place after the discussions between the President and Prime Minister.
We have 18 months more. People expect us to make corrections and march forward. In 2015, the people gave a mandate to the President and the Prime Minister to rule the country together. But not to establish either an SLFP or UNP government. Pure politics is necessary for the country.
That is our responsibility after the Cabinet reshuffle, Minister Ranatunga stated.

UNICEF Parliamentarian Platform for Children held:
Children are crucial constituents for countrys development
UNICEF hosted parliamentarians from the South Asian region during the South Asia Parliamentarian Platform for Children which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from May 2 to 3.
The programme was carried out in an effort to increase investments in children and young adults, to bring about change for millions of underprivileged individuals and to improve prospects for a healthy economic growth within the region.
The programme also aimed to strengthen opportunities for children during the first two decades of their lives.
Lawmakers from all eight countries in South Asia, met to prioritise, promote and safeguard childrens rights and discussed prospects for further investment in early childhood and adolescent years.
While South Asia is home to one-fourth of the worlds population, its share of global income is only four percent. This fact underlines one of the biggest challenges for South Asias progress on the social and economic front: namely the lack of investment in its largest asset; its human capitaland especially the young within society, UNICEF South Asia Regional Director Jean Gough said.
Three parliamentarians from Sri Lanka participated in the meeting: Parliamentary Caucus for Children Chair Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Women and Gender Sectoral Oversight Committee Chair Dr. Thusitha Wijemanna and Public Finance Sectoral Oversight Committee Member Prof. Ashu Marasinghe.
Parliament Assistant Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera was also present.
Speaking on the initiative, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle said, Children are crucial constituents; the future economic prosperity and the development of the country depend on them. In our role as parliamentarians, we need to review legislation and especially the National Budget, through a childs perspective to ensure that investments in the social sectors that impact children are adequate and equitable so that no child, regardless of who they are or where they live, can reach their full potential to become productive citizens of this country."
This years meeting focused on the regions commitment to increased investment in children.
Three hundred million children in South Asia are called multi-dimensionally poor with too little to eat, a high risk of falling sick from preventable disease and a slim chance of going to school.
Evidence shows that investment in the young pays strong dividends to society.
Even a dollar invested in quality Early Childhood Development, would give a return of between 6 and 17 dollars.
If low- and middle-income countries ensured preschool enrollment to half of the countrys children, the result could be cumulative lifetime earnings gains of US $15 to $34 billion.
The urgent, timely and adequate investments in early childhood and adolescent years, would lead to developed brains and a productive workforce.
There are good chances for bringing about radical and important change: in most countries in the region, children and young people make up a large part of society and even smaller investments now will give good results for children and South Asian societies, Jean Gough said.

Good Governance Government continues to uplift livelihoods
The Good Governance Government had implemented many development projects to improve the livelihood of the underprivileged, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Deputy Leader and Parliamentarian M. H. M. Navavi said.
He made this statement while attending as the chief guest to a programme which was held to distribute equipment for self-employed residents in the Puttalam district, which was held at the Puttalam Divisional Secretariat auditorium, recently.
During the event, industrial goods valued at Rs. 2 million, which had been allocated by ACMC Leader and Commerce and Industries Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, were distributed among the participants.
Each beneficiary received equipment worth Rs. 50,000 under the said Diviyata Udana self-employment project.
Around 86 beneficiaries from the Puttalam, Kalpitiya, Mundal, Vanathavillu, Chilaw and Madampe divisions, participated in the programme.
Further, Parliamentarian Navavi said, "With the efforts of ACMC Leader Rishad Bathiudeen, the self-employed and underprivileged families within the Puttalam district currently receive aid to carry out their work. Last year, a sum of Rs. 50 million per head, was provided by the Commerce and Industries Ministry, which enabled the uplifting of many self-employed residents."
"This year, each parliamentarian had been provided with Rs. 2 million in order to meet the necessary requirements for such programmes," he added.
The Puttalam District Industrial Development Authority Deputy Director and Assistant Planning Director, ACMC Youth Organiser Iflal Ameen, Puttalam Urban Council members, the Kalpitiya Electorate ACMC organiser and others participated in the event.

President is perfect candidate for next Presidential Election
President Maithripala Sirisena is the perfect candidate for the next Presidential Election, Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering after assuming duties of his new position in Colombo yesterday.
Minister Dissanayke said the President is the most popular and suitable person for the Presidential candidate. Minister S.B.Dissanayke and few others had made temporary decisions, but we will discuss them with the President. All will rally round the SLFP at the end. It has happened in the past, the Minister said.
What matters most is the decisions made by the Government and not its Cabinet reshuffle. I hope this will be the last Cabinet reshuffle. A country cannot be let in an unstable situation as a result of an election. The time wasted on the No Confidence Motion and Cabinet Reshuffle is a crime, he said.
Issues of the victims of the Meethotamulla Garbage dump will be resolved within the next six months. The Government offered the largest ever drought relief valued at Rs. 37,000 million. During Poson, 100,000 yellow robes will be offered seeking rains and researches are carried out to get artificial rains. Just like the President dreamed of the Moragahakanda Reservoir, I dream of the Lower Malwathuoya Reservoir, the Minister said.

Sri Lanka has round the clock electricity
The government is setting up solar panels in almost all public schools and Sri Lanka is the only country in the South Asian region that provides electricity round the clock while catering to the increasing demand, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday.
The Minister said since the country is using all possible water resources to generate hydro electricity, the country has to use solar power.
He made this observation during a ceremony held to grant solar panels to Siri Saman Vidyalaya, Kegalle. He said while India imposes a power cut of six hours and Pakistan imposes a 5.5 hours power cut, Sri Lanka has been able to provide electricity 24 hours. However, this would be expensive during the drought.
The Siri Saman Vidyalaya was granted solar panels worth of Rs. 1 million. The school would get the required power for its use while the balance electricity generated would be supplied to the national grid. The Ministry has so far provided solar panels to more than 1,000 schools and temples during the two years the government was in power. Minister Siyambalapitiya said he would take measures to turn each roof in the Kegalle district into power generators as a sign of gratitude to the people in the Kegalle district for electing him to Parliament for 18 years to represent them. He added that the panels would be a source of income. Those who dont have the capital could get bank loans to set up solar panels, he added.

Abolition of Executive Presidential system, threat to countrys unity, territorial integrity: Mahasangha
The Mahasangha firmly believed that the Executive Presidential system should be preserved in this country sans any change or dilution. Abolition of the Executive Presidential system would pose a threat to the countrys unity and territorial integrity.
This should engage the firm attention of the Government, Asgiri Parivenadhipati and Deputy Lekakhadhikari of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Narampanawe Ananda thera said.
He expressed these sentiments when the 16 SLFP members who resigned from the Government and Ministry portfolios, called on the members of the Karaka Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter headed by the Asigiriya Prelate, to educate them on their stance and receive their blessings on May 2.
Ven. Ananda thera said earlier too the Mahasangha opposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitutions because it fathomed the dangers it would pose in future before hand.
But former President J. R. Jayewardene was forced to proceed with it according to circumstances which prevailed in the country. However, former President Jayewardene had the foresight to ensure that the Executive Presidency was preserved for posterity.
It was the powers vested in the Executive Presidency which thwarted attempts made by Vardarajah Perumal to declare a separate state.

ADB calls for progressive taxation in region
Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Takehiko Nakao called on its member countries in developing Asia to go for more progressive taxation including individual income tax, inheritance tax and property tax to address the widening income inequality in the region.
The President was speaking at a press conference parallel to the 51st ADB Board of Governors Annual Meeting 2018 which kicked off at the ADB Headquarters in Mandaluyong City in Manila yesterday.
We have to come to grips with the new reality of growing income inequality and this is a very important political issue in the region. We have been promoting the idea of market oriented development, but there are so many kinds of complaints mainly because of widening inequality. We should address these issues more seriously. We cannot just let market decide everything, he said responding to a question of a journalist.
We need policies to support people affected by this technological development. Some people might lose jobs and they cannot easily find jobs. Re-training, education and social protection are important to tackle this issue. We need to provide minimum protection for life for the people affected, said the President.
The President made these comments in reference to the findings in the report Asian Development Outlook 2018: How Technology Affects Jobs which was launched last month. Economists Elisabetta Gentile and Sameer Khatiwada, the co-authors of the report, pointed out new technologies will alter skills requirements and may cause unemployment as some firms downsize or close.
Our message is that indeed technology is associated with a decrease of jobs, but the boost in productivity that technology gives to the economy allows demand for goods and services to grow up. This is because some people are making money through them. New jobs appear every time there is new technological advancement. The challenge for our workers is to re-train them and learn the new skills, said Elisabetta Gentile delivering a presentation to media.
The ADB President further observed that the trade has picked up in Asian countries since the beginning of 2017. He attributed this growth to open trade and the investment regime in addition to stable macroeconomic policies and advised to continue them.
Responding to a question on the private sector involvement and Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the ADB President noted, To fill the infrastructure gap and to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) we need to involve the private sector. It must be done in an efficient way. We need to mobilize both resources as well as private expertise to invest in the infrastructure and some of them can be helped by ADB. We already established a PPP Office. However, the PPP is not magic policy to resolve all the issues. It should be designed and implemented in a very fair, transparent and wise way.
Speaking on the Belt and Road Initiative of China, he said the ADB has been promoting the idea of regional integration and cooperation since 1990s. We need to have connectivity between countries. The ADB established this idea and we are happy to cooperate with Belt and Road Initiative, he said.
If countries borrowed too much for certain infrastructure without serious economic feasibility, they would face more struggles in repayment. Because of bigger presence of these new ideas like Belt and Road Initiative and institutions like Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), debt sustainability issues must read carefully, Takehiko Nakao added.

Advantis Projects provides logistics expertise to CEB
Continuing its leadership in logistics in Sri Lanka, Advantis Projects, the project logistics arm of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently secured and completed the transportation of 12 transformers and their respective accessories as part of the Ceylon Electricity Boards project - Construction Of Grid Substations, Greater Colombo Transmission And Distribution Loss Reduction.
Amongst the cargo were two 250MVA transformers which weighed 131 tonnes each, making it the highest capacity cargo project handled by a local company in Sri Lanka. The remaining cargo was made up of two 50 tonne transformers and eight 70 tonne transformers.
The original contract for the project was won by a Korean company which then awarded the local logistics component to Advantis Projects based on their technical knowledge, capabilities and experience.
Rising to the challenge Advantis Projects was able to provide an incident-free complete end-to-end solution for the transportation of these transformers from clearance at the Colombo Port to multiple locations within the greater Colombo area.
The project required the use of equipment such as specialised trailers, high capacity cranes, 400T synchronised jacking systems and skidding/sliding tracks, which were all available to Advantis Projects through their own range of equipment.
It also required novel methods for the successful execution of the project. One such method involved the movement of the 250MVA (131Tonne) transformers, utilizing synchronized skidding/sliding tracks.
Due to space limitations at the location where the transformers were unloaded, cranes could not be used for the precise final placement of the units. This required the Advantis engineers to devise an innovative method to push the transformers into a narrow space.
In a first for Sri Lanka, the Advantis team laid down a special skidding track that allowed them to slowly but precisely push the transformers into place. Advantis Projects is currently the only local company to own such skidding tracks, which were designed and engineered with in-house expertise.
This ingenuity in moving heavy cargo is a testament to Advantis Projects commitment to innovation by benchmarking with European standards to improve their capabilities.
The Ceylon Electricity Boards project intends to improve the quality and reliability of electricity in the greater metropolitan area by minimizing power loss.
This will require the introduction of low-loss power transmission and distribution lines, and the construction of new substations. However, the success of this project will rely just as much on the ability and ingenuity of logistics providers to transport these sophisticated machines to their respective locations, as it will on the engineers installing them.
In the past, projects of this magnitude were handled by costly foreign entities due to a lack of local skill and expertise. However, today, with Advantis Projects leading the way by investing in the development of local talent and increasing their capabilities by acquiring specialised equipment, the local industry has matured and gained the necessary expertise to cater to the needs of local and foreign players in the transportation of their heavy cargo.
Our wholly owned specialised equipment and innovative special projects team has always helped Advantis Projects to go above and beyond in meeting our clients needs with tailor-made solutions, said Shadil Rizan, General Manager, Advantis Projects.
This was exactly the case with this latest project that put our ingenuity and capabilities to the test. Our successful, incident-free completion of the project is a testament to the strides the local industry has taken in recent years and speaks volumes of our ability to cater to a myriad of client needs.
A subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, Advantis Projects is the market leader in providing project logistics solutions to local and international contractors who are involved in large-scale infrastructure development projects.
The company brings over two decades of experience and a proven delivery record that has been driven with technology innovation and adherence to industry best practices.
The company specializes in project & general cargo handling, inland transportation, freight, chartering, customs clearance & forwarding (C&F), storage facilities and numerous services related to logistics chains.

Buddhism emphasizes peace through non-violence - UNSG
United Nations Secretary General (UNSG), Antnio Guterres speaking during the annual commemoration of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on May 01, noted that although born a prince, Buddha rose above self-interest and went into the world to help overcome human suffering. His teachings are based on the principle that compassion is central to enlightenment, and as such, his message of service to others is more relevant than ever, the Secretary-General said.
The United Nations Day of Vesak was celebrated in New York on May 01, in accordance with UN General Assembly resolution 54/115 recognizing the Day of Vesak internationally as the most significant day for Buddhists all over the world. The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York, along with the Permanent Mission of Thailand took the lead in organizing this years commemoration, together with other states that co-sponsored the resolution in 2000.
The celebrations commenced on the morning of May 01, with a dana offered to over forty Buddhist monks representing Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and the Republic of Korea, at the Sri Lanka Mission premises. Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera and senior diplomats from Thailand, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos, Bhutan, Nepal and Republic of Korea attended the ceremony and offered dana to the Maha Sangha. A number of lay persons, including the staff of the Missions of these countries were also present. Chief Incumbent of the Staten Island Buddhist Vihara in New York, Ven. Heenbunne Kondanna Thera conducted the religious ceremony.
A solemn event to mark the Day of Vesak, co-chaired by Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera and Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of Thailand to the United Nations, Ambassador Vitvihas Srivihok was held in the evening of May 01, from 6.30 to 8.30 p.m. at the United Nations General Assembly hall. A large number of Buddhist monks representing many countries, President of the General Assembly Miroslav Lajck, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, Permanent Representatives of Member States, senior diplomats, senior UN officials, staff of the Permanent Missions and the UN Secretariat, and communities from various countries attended this solemn event.
Ambassador Rohan Perera delivered the opening remarks, highlighting the significance and relevance of the message of Buddha in addressing contemporary problems that affect the world today. Dr. Perera noted that, despite our best efforts, we are confronted with unprecedented challenges in the global order. In identifying the root causes of these conflicts, Ambassador Perera referred to the Buddhas teaching which states that wrong views are the reasons behind the challenges we face, and in order to tame these views, underlined the need to adopt Samma Ditti or right views within ourselves.
The President of the General Assembly (PGA) in his brief statement highlighted three principles from the teachings of the Buddha, which are sources of guidance to the activities of the United Nations; firstly, the middle way, secondly metta (friendship) and karuna (kindness), and lastly the fundamental equality of people. He further noted that these same values are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Lajck concluded by saying that while the United Nations was not born of any religion, these timeless principles remain important to its work and that they shine a light on the path to peace  peace among nations, and peace within people.
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antnio Guterres paid reverence to the birth, enlightenment and parinirvana of the Buddha and emphasized the inspiration found in his message of service in order to become global citizens. Secretary - General Guterres stated that the Buddhist world view teaches us to see ourselves as a part of this world and not its masters, and Buddhisms emphasis on non-violence stands as a powerful call for peace. He concluded by referring to the focus in Buddhism on the inherent dignity of life, which finds resonance today in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Following the remarks by the President of the General Assembly and the UN Secretary  General, the five precepts were chanted by the maha sangha of the Theravadha tradition and blessings were invoked by the venerable monks of the Mahayana tradition.
A sermon was delivered by scholar monk, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana Thera, who is the founding abbot of the Bhavana Society, West Virginia and Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera for North America. In his sermon, Ven. Gunaratana said that the Buddha identified the global problem of humanity as universal suffering, with the root causes of this suffering being greed, hatred and conflict within ourselves. He called upon all to practice Metta to rid themselves of these feelings, and said that the teachings of the Buddha can only be found in the hearts and minds of the people.
The sermon was followed by a devotional song, Himi Sanaramara, performed by Visharadha Shalika Aroshini.
Representatives of Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam, among others, addressed the General Assembly reflecting on the significance of the Day of Vesak.
The event was followed by a Dansala or distribution of alms in the lobby of the General Assembly Hall to all those who were in attendance.

Call for resolution of rifts between agencies
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed irrigation and water resources management authorities, the Mahaweli Consultancy Bureau and the Central Environmental Authority, to take prompt action to resolve all conflicts among agencies involved in the Yan Oya Reservoir Project and to accelerate the delayed resettlement programme and other relevant components.
It was learnt that due to the delay in releasing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) by the Mahaweli Consultancy Bureau, the resettlement of evacuated families, demarcation of alternative muddy lands and compensations for lands acquired, were adversely affected. Anuradhapura Government Agent and Head of Yan Oya Reservoir Project Progress Review Committee R. M. Wanninayake said that the delay being caused by the Mahweli Consultancy Bureau in providing the EIS, was unjustifiable and that the Irrigation Secretary had been requested to look in to the matter immediately.Although families had settled down at Omarakanda after receiving housing compensations, there were many legal barricades concerning house construction as jungle-clearing was only partly allowed by forest authorities.
The forest landscapes planned to be released from the Forest Conservation Department for the purpose of resettlement and for reinstating both muddy lands and highlands, was 1,400 hectares in Urawewa, Whalkada, Malporuwa, Kajuwattha, Kumbukwewa, Issanwewa, Omarakada, Moragama and Indulhitiyawa, come under both, the Trincomale and Anuradhapura districts. At present, inquiries into claims for acquired land are being held. It is understood that out of nearly 3,000 claims, inspection of suitability for granting compensation had been completed only in about 1,000 claims so far.
The construction work of the left bank canal, which is 20 km in length, is yet to be commenced and that of the south bank canal, shows only little progress. According to sources, it would take at least another two years to complete the construction of the two canals as a whole, having gone through processes such as land acquirement, payment of compensations, resettlement and soil tests. The government is to spend around Rs. 45 billion for the project.

Cambridge Analytica closes due to Facebook scandal
Cambridge Analytica, the data firm at the centre of this years Facebook privacy row, is currently in the process of closing and starting insolvency proceedings.
The company had been plagued by scandal since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans and at least a million Britons had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.
Cambridge Analytica denied any wrongdoing, but said the negative media coverage had left it with no clients and mounting legal fees.
Despite Cambridge Analyticas unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Companys customers and suppliers, the company said in a statement, which also revealed that SCL Elections Ltd, the UK entity affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, would also close and start insolvency proceedings.
As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration, they added.
As first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the company had started insolvency proceedings in the US and UK. At Cambridge Analyticas New York offices on an upmarket block on Manhattans Fifth Avenue, it appeared that all staff had already left the premises.
The Guardian rang the doorbell to the companys seventh-floor office and was met by a woman who would not give her name but said she did not work for the company. Asked if anyone from Cambridge Analytica or SCL was still inside, she said, They used to be; but they all left today.
The scandal centres around data collected from Facebook users via a personality app developed by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan. The data was collected via Facebooks permissive Graph API; the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebooks platform. This allowed Kogan to pull data on users and their friends, including likes, activities, check-ins, locations, photos, religions, politics and relationship details. He passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, in breach of Facebooks platform policies.
Christopher Wylie, the original Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told the Observer that the data Kogan obtained was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit. According to Wylie, the data was fed into software that profiles voters and attempts to target them with personalised political advertisements. Cambridge Analytica insists it never incorporated the Kogan data.
Kogan told BBC Radio 4s Today programme he was being used as a scapegoat.
He said, My view is that Im being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Honestly, we thought we were acting appropriately. We thought we were doing something that was normal.
Cambridge Analytica said it had been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both, the political and commercial arenas.
Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was suspended in late March after Britains Channel 4 News broadcasted secret recordings in which he claimed credit for the election of Donald Trump.
He told an undercover reporter; We did all the research, all the data, analytics and targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.
He also revealed that the company used a self-destruct email server to erase its digital history.
No one knows we have it, and secondly we set our emails with a self-destruct timer So you send them and after theyve been read, two hours later, they disappear. Theres no evidence, theres no paper trail, theres nothing, he added.
Although Cambridge Analytica might be dead, the team behind it had already set up a mysterious new company called Emerdata. According to Companies House data, Alexander Nix is listed as a director along with other executives from SCL Group. The daughters of billionaire Robert Mercer are also listed as directors.

Cine Pro Lanka International to expand production ventures
Cine Pro Lanka International which is part of the Senura Group of Companies is in the process of expanding their cinema related production ventures, the companys CEO Jude Mutugala said.
He said the company has been instrumental in introducing high quality film equipment to support the film production sector, and their production ventures include both television and cinema.
I am looking at a five year plan to fulfil our companys vision, which is to provide the best modern equipment and services to enrich the entertainment industry in Sri Lanka, said Mutugala who took over as CEO of the company in April 2016anka.
Jude Mutugala
He further stated that a sizable investment has been made by the company in getting down top quality equipment to cater to the cinema industry. The plan will firstly involve providing the best possible equipment to enhance the quality of cinema productions and audiovisual productions like TV commercials, which in turn will help the industry to become profitable. It is in a way empowering the industry to create a profitable market to cater their services to. We must invest in the correct sources and correct segments. The audiovisual and cinema production field has many segments and the specific needs of each segment depending on their capacity must be first identified and then addressed with regard to providing the best possible equipment and services, he said.
The company claims that it has been pioneered in providing certain high quality cameras to the Lankan industry. The best example being our latest addition, the Arri Alexa SXT, which was bought at a cost of about thirteen million rupees, with the cost of the lens being another thirteen million. Jude also said this top of the range camera has been used for the first time in Sri Lanka in shooting the upcoming film The Frozen Fire which has Kamal Addaraarachchi in the lead role as the late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera. The Frozen Fire is actually the first Sri Lankan movie to be filmed with the Arri Alexa SXT. The picture quality from this camera is of the topmost quality and is unmatched.
Jude formula for good business is coupling the topmost quality equipment with the best possible personnel service. This is especially crucial for foreign productions said Jude. The main value proposition I want our clients to see in choosing us is the quality of service. Another company can also make investments to provide the same brands of equipment. There is no difference there. But the quality of our staff and how they conduct themselves when they are on duty at a filming location is what marks the difference. We assure quality service with polite, efficient and disciplined personnel who carry out their tasks punctually with skill and professionalism. Developing the personnel will develop the business as well. That is something I believe in.
With a vision to enrich the industry that brings the art of moving images to the silver screen as well as the small screen, Cine Pro Lanka International is now on a mission to be a partner in the progress of the Sri Lankan cinema and television arts.

Investor-friendly reforms to take  centre stage in 2018 report on Sri Lanka
Sri Lankas plans to enhance its investment climate by introducing mechanisms aimed at reducing red tape and speeding up key processes will be given wide-ranging coverage in a report by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will shine a spotlight on the new single window initiative, which has a key role to play in minimising delays and reducing bottlenecks for businesses waiting for projects to be approved. There will be detailed coverage of the screening process that has been put in place to help accelerate decisions on project proposals.
OBGs report will also chart the latest developments in plans to set up investment promotion zones throughout the country, using the public-private-partnership model in many cases.
The Board of Investment (BOI) has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the firm will once again help to produce The Report: Sri Lanka 2018. Dumindra Ratnayaka, Chairperson, BOI, said he was thrilled to be working closely with OBGs team on its forthcoming report and documenting Sri Lankas efforts to boost investment levels.
The reforms introduced to improve the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka are timely, given the wave of infrastructural projects set for implementation and the high level of competition globally for FDI, he said. I look forward to helping Oxford Business Groups readers navigate their way through these new initiatives and assessing their significance for investors keen to play a part in the next stage of Sri Lankas development.
Michael Todemann, editorial manager in Sri Lanka, said OBGs partnership with the BOI over the years had undoubtedly given the Groups coverage of Sri Lankas evolving investment landscape an added dimension.
BOI is spearheading national efforts to boost foreign investment and has been instrumental in implementing the reforms required to strengthen the countrys status as a trading hub and preferred destination for FDI, while also working to diversify exports, he said. With these aims now gaining momentum, Im delighted that BOIs representatives will once again contribute to our research.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will mark the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group. It will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments.

KOPIA holds field workshop for onion farmers
The Korea Programme on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre organized a field workshop for 100 selected farmers from the two model villages of Galenbindunuwewa and Bulnewa, where they visited a large scale Commercial Onion Seed Production Farm in Galewela. This programme was facilitated as part of KOPIAs ongoing efforts to promote onion cultivation in Sri Lanka.
Since 2015, the KOPIA Centre has been assisting with the onion production in Sri Lanka, in cooperation with the Field Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI) of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in Mahailluppallama. The project aims to improve onion productivity in Sri Lanka by using Korean agricultural technologies, so that Sri Lankan farmers can become more self-sufficient.
As part of these efforts, the KOPIA Sri Lanka center has introduced the model village concept to Sri Lanka, focusing on promoting the production of onion seeds within the target area.
Through this initiative, KOPIA primarily provides rain shelters, storages, drip irrigation units, mother bulb cultivation and mother bulb vernalization facilities, agro-chemicals, etc., to the farmers of the model villages. In addition to this, capacity building measures are also introduced through knowledge transferring on appropriate technologies and providing training and exposure to the farmers.
The 100 onion farmers who took part in the latest workshop are those who have already begun to engage in commercial onion seed production. Working with them, KOPIA had identified the necessity of extra exposure for these farmers so they could gain a deeper understanding of the many challenges encountered in commercial onion farming.
The workshop/exposure visit took place at a farm in the Galewela area, the owner of which has over 30 years of experience in commercial crop production.
The farm which consists of 25 ha in total has been cultivated with big onions for seed production in 06 ha, with the rest of the land being divided among eggplant, hot peppers and tomato cultivations.
Among other things, the participants were able to gain firsthand knowledge during the workshop, on how to adapt new technologies on onion seed production in order to stimulate higher crop yields.
During this visit, Dr. Choi, the Director of KOPIA Sri Lanka Centre and Dr. Lee, the Korean Expert on onion seed production at KOPIA also made a presentation on onion cultivation techniques, onion seed production technologies, and seedling management technologies for the benefit of the participants.
The owner of the Galewela farm shared his work related experiences with the visiting group of farmers and emphasized on the main points to bear in mind in onion seed production. Apart from such locally based programmes, KOPIA will also facilitate an international exposure visit and training in Korea, for 10 selected farmers from the two model villages, together with two DOA researchers, in mid May 2018.

Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, addressing his senior officials including heads of departments and institutions on May 2, instructed to double the student intake to the technical and vocational training institutions operating under the various departments and institutions under his ministry and to upgrade their syllabuses to an international level.
This was his first meeting with the officials of his new ministry.
The minister said that a main reason for the existence of unemployment in the country, was the lack of technical and vocational competence among the youth.
He stressed that in addition to the possession of O-Level or A-Level qualifications, an individual must posses vocational qualifications to attain employment in the modern competitive industrial world.
He added that if someone possesses internationally-accepted technical or vocational qualifications, he would receive employment easily not only locally, but abroad as well.
However, today, most youth do not have such qualifications fitting for a job anywhere. Therefore, it is imperative that the intake to technical and vocational training institutions under his Ministry be immediately doubled and at the same time the courses of training be upgraded to international standards, he said.
That way, youth would be enabled to obtain well-paid employment opportunities even abroad, Minister Dr. Amunugama said.
The minister directed that the said purpose was mandatory and should be carried out with the next intake of trainees scheduled for July, this year.

Newly appointed Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday pledged to take the necessary measures to shift the Agriculture Ministry to its former building Govi Jana Mandiraya in Rajamalwatte, Battaramulla.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the current building which was the subject of various allegations and criticisms, after assuming duties at his ministry yesterday.
The Minister pledged to discuss with the relevant authorities to acquire the former building Govi Jana Mandiraya since it is the most suitable for the purpose.
In September 2015, Cabinet gave approval to acquire the Agricultural Ministrys building Govijana Mandiraya occupied by the Agriculture Ministry.
I do not want luxury buildings or any other facilities. I only want to provide better facilities to the farmers, he added.
Amaraweera said the Agriculture Ministry will assiduously continue the programme of encouraging toxin free farming introduced by the President without any abeyance or reversal.
The Minister pledged to take immediate measures to provide financial assistance to farmers those who engage in toxin free farming and will also take measures to provide subsidized fertilizer to the farmers without a shortage or any delay.
After the Local Government elections , the whole country remained unstable. This unstable situation badly affected the countrys progress. A Cabinet reshuffle was done according to a scientific manner and the relevant subjects of the ministries will be gazetted soon, Minister Amaraweera said.
Now we have no time to waste blaming each other. Everybody should understand that the UNP and the SLFP cannot implement only their party policies within the government. So the Unity Government should be continued by taking only the best policies of both parties, the Minister said.
He stressed that both parties should take the responsibility and work for the betterment of the country without engaging in party politics.

Over 32 kg gold smuggled from SL seized in Chennai
In a span of less than 24 hours, officers of the Indian Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Chennai Zonal Unit, seized a total of 32.249 kg of gold valued at Indian rupees 102.15 million.
The gold was being smuggled from Sri Lanka through coastal Tamil Nadu.It was smuggled into India by sea and being transported to Chennai for sale.
Six people were apprehended in connection with the case and all of them in their statements admitted that they purposely transported the smuggled gold to Chennai.
On Tuesday evening, DRI officials kept a strict vigil in the by-lanes of Mannady and observed a person on a two-wheeler receiving a heavy suspicious looking package.
The receiver of the contraband was apprehended by the officials. After detailed examination, the gold was found to weigh 12.149 kg.The accused were staying in a budget lodge at Mannady. DRI officials found a woman passenger carrying the smuggled gold and handing it over to another intermediary who had been staying at the lodge.
In a similar incident, DRI conducted a thorough search of a private bus moving from Keelakarai to Chennai, where a person was suspected of carrying smuggled gold. The officials identified him and his baggage and recovered 8.1 kg of gold from him.
In all the operations, a total 32.249 kg of gold was seized and six persons were arrested by DRI under the provisions of the Customs Act.
DRI warned that gold smuggling has been a recurrent issue in South India, and the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu are particularly prone to this illicit activity, due to its geographical proximity to Sri Lanka.
The previous year saw DRI Chennai Zonal Unit seizing more than 105 kg of gold smuggled via Sri Lanka through the Tamil Nadu coast. The locations most vulnerable to smuggling are Tiruchendur, Rameswaram and Vedaranyam.
Apart from the enforcement measures, the DRI has also taken up the issues of smuggling and other customs related matters at the policy level during the 28th Indo-Sri Lanka DG Level talks at New Delhi in February this year.
As a result, both administrations had firmly resolved to combat smuggling. The Sri Lanka Customs and the Sri Lankan Navy have also stepped up efforts to curb the smuggling of gold, narcotics, and other contraband.
In April, Sri Lanka increased the rate of import duty of gold to 15 per cent (from the earlier rate of 10 per cent), in an attempted move to curb smuggling.

Significant increase in ADB lending to Lanka
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) lending for Sri Lanka will see a significant increase up to USD 600-800 million this year, ADB Director General for South Asia Hun Kim said.
The average annual ADB lending for Sri Lanka in the last three years had been USD 300 million. Speaking to South Asian Journalists at the 51st ADB Board of Governors Annual Meeting 2018 at the ADB Headquarters in Mandaluyong City in Manila yesterday, Hun Kim said Sri Lanka is one of the countries benefiting from the capital increase of the ADB.
The ADBs lending for Sri Lanka this year will be USD 600-800 million, which is very big for the size of 20 million population of the country. Sri Lanka is one country we think should really grow. Three years ago, we were all talking about Sri Lanka emerging as new star of South Asia because it has all the necessary ingredients. It is not happening because there are not enough foreign investments and the exports are going down,the Director General said while stressing that the Sri Lankan Government must have a longer term vision to be in the new engine of growth and to bring its economic growth up.
But that would not be possible in traditional ways.
That is why the ADB is working on an Economic Corridor, Special Economic Zones and port-based development. With them, the country can find some new engine of growth. Long term investments must be focused on, but that can only come when Government has a vision for the future more than five years. When everybody is focusing on elections it would be difficult, he added.
He also observed political instability, especially after the recent Local Government Election results, have contributed to economic setbacks in the country.
Sri Lanka is supposed to do a lot better and it is a country with capacity. The next couple of years may be difficult for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a far organized country and it has very strong bureaucracy and civil society. If politics is stable all these countries in South Asia can perform.
They have committed people. However, South Asian politics is always a problem. With good politics it will really make a change, he commented.
He pointed out that Sri Lanka, being a country with high living standards and education levels, needs to focus on longer term plan to maintain those standards.
Sri Lanka is a country where people live very well. Sri Lanka needs to continue to move up. Without a long term plan, it will struggle in the years to come to maintain the high quality of living standards, he said.

SriLankan flights delayed due to several reasons
A variety of reasons had caused delays to several SriLankan Airlines flights yesterday, May 3.
The untimely sickness of a passenger inbound from the Gulf initiated a diversion to Cochin on one flight.
Another aircraft inbound from Kuwait was caught in a dust-storm and required attention from Engineering. Two other aircraft were delayed for technical reasons that have since been resolved. The lack of aircraft meant that a number of flights, namely UL884 Colombo-Melbourne, UL281 Colombo-Jeddah, UL314 Colombo-Kuala Lumpur, UL406 Colombo-Bangkok and UL 604 Melbourne-Colombo suffered prolonged delays.
SriLankan Airlines deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to our valued customers.All passengers who had checked in were provided complimentary hotel accommodation and or meals at the airport by the airline,the company said in a press release.

Twitter says all 336 million users should change their passwords

The company announced on Thursday it discovered a bug that saved user passwords unprotected on an internal log.
Twitter said it has since fixed the issue. Although the company said there is no evidence passwords have been leaked or misused, it is urging its users to update their passwords.
"As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you've used this password," thecompany tweeted.
The company protects user passwords via a process called hashing, which shows random characters in place of the actual passwords. But the detected bug stored the passwords in their original plain-text form to an "internal log."
Twitter(TWTR)did not specify how many passwords were stored there.
The company declined to comment on when the bug was discovered, how long it had been storing passwords in this manner and how many passwords were affected. But it reiterated to CNN "this is not a breach."
Twitter is prompting users to change their passwords via a pop-up window on the site that explains the nature of the bug and links to their Settings page.
The company also suggests widely recommended security tips, like turning on two-factor authentication, choosing unique passwords for every service, and using a password manager app to store them all.
CEO Jack Dorseysaidin a tweet the company believed it was important to "be open about this internal defect."
Meanwhile, Twitter CTO Parag Agrawaltweetedan apology for the issue.
"We are sharing this information to help people make an informed decision about their account security. We didn't have to, but believe it's the right thing to do," he said.
After receiving criticism for saying Twitter didn't have to go public with the breach, Argawal followed up withanother apology.
"I should not have said we didn't have to share. I have felt strongly that we should. My mistake," he said.

The Venerable priest focused on dispelling the myth that Buddhism as a philosophy offers a negative view with a focus on the afterlife. In this context, the sermon outlined the teachings of the Buddha on ways of ensuring a successful worldly life. He enumerated aspects which lead to continued development, in accordance with the dhamma, based on sincere effort, protection of assets, faithful friends and living within means. In the hour long discourse, Ven. Piyarathana Thera illustrated with examples, these four guidelines, for the respectful understanding of all attendees.

The Ambassador also described to the Thai audience, the construction of pandols and the concept of dansel in Sri Lanka during this holy period, which are also novel in relation to the Thai traditions in their observance of Visaka bucha. Ambassador Senewiratne explained the initiative of the Embassy to organize this dhamma sermon for the benefit of all, on the basis of a precept from the Maha Mangala Sutta which enumerates - Kalena dhamma savanang  Etan mangala muttamang, meaning that the timely listening to the dhamma is a blessing supreme.
