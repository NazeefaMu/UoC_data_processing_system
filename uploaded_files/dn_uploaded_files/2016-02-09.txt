Star Wars hits $2 billion global sales

US: Star Wars: The Force Awakens has soared to the $2 billion mark in global ticket sales, Disney announced Sunday, as the movie landed in fourth place at the North American box office, behind Kung Fu Panda 3 in the top spot.
The latest Star Wars franchise movie became only the third film ever to reach the $2 billion mark, and is only the second to do so in a first release, Disney said in a statement.
It also set a domestic record with $900 million in ticket sales on Wednesday, making it the only film in history to reach this milestone, Disney reported.
Weekend estimates showed that it would rake in $6.9 million Friday through Sunday for a grand total of $906 million since its debut last year.
DreamWorks computer-animated Kung Fu Panda comedy -- the third installment in the franchise -- meanwhile earned some $21 million in its second weekend out, industry tracker Exhibitor Relations predicted. Following the adventures of Po as he evolves from martial arts student to teacher, the US-Chinese production features the voices of stars Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Angelina Jolie.
The celebrity-studded Coen Brothers Hail, Caesar! a 1950s kidnap caper about a Hollywood fixer trying to keep a studios stars under thumb, debuted in second place with $11.4 million.

Death toll from Taiwan earthquake hits 34

TAIWAN: The death toll from a powerful earthquake that toppled a high-rise apartment building in Taiwan rose to at least 34, according to government figures Monday, with rescuers digging through rubble for survivors more than 48 hours after the quake struck.
More than 100 are believed to be still buried in the collapsed building from a disaster that struck during the most important family holiday in the Chinese calendar - the Lunar New Year holiday.
The government in Tainan, the worst-hit city, said that more than 170 people had been rescued alive from the 17-story building, which folded like an accordion after the quake struck.
Mao Yi-chen, 20, was rescued soon after the magnitude-6.4 quake hit before dawn Saturday, and her older sister Mao Yi-hsuan was pulled out Sunday in serious condition. A rescue worker had handed over a photo album and homemade cards found next to her for her family to collect, said local official Wang Ding-yu.
"He said that 'maybe your home is damaged, but memories of the family can last,'" Wang said.
The extended Lunar New Year holiday officially started Monday, but celebrations were subdued and both President Ma Ying-jeou and President-elect Tsai Ing-wen canceled the handing out of envelopes of cash in their hometowns, a holiday tradition for Taiwan's leader.
The Tainan Disaster Emergency Center estimated that 118 people were still trapped at the site of the collapsed building, many at the bottom of the debris. Tainan Mayor Lai Ching-te said rescuers were able to reach many people by using information from residents who got out about the possible locations of those still inside.
Earthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage, though a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.
The spectacular fall of the high-rise, built in 1989, raised questions about whether its construction had been shoddy. Tainan's government said the building had not been listed as a dangerous structure, and Taiwan's interior minister, Chen Wei-zen, said an investigation would examine whether the developer had cut corners.
Eighth-floor resident Huang Guang-wei was pulled out Sunday morning from a different section from where he lived, showing how much the building twisted when it fell, Lai said. It took rescuers eight hours to get Huang out, hei said.
Among the fatalities was a 6-month-old baby girl who was pulled from the rubble and rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A deceased man believed to be her father was pulled out 40 minutes later, Wang said.

Gammanpila hits out at a host of issues
A majority of the case heard in Court nowadays can be regarded illegal due to the absence of an Attorney General at present, claimed Parliamentarian and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila.
Addressing the press in Pita Kotte he said that while certain politicians were commending the decision to sing the national anthem in Tamil, saying it helped promote communal harmony, almost 98 percent of the 212 countries in the whole world sang their national anthem in only one language despite having a large number of dialects among the population.
Gammanpila also said he had wished to challenge Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to a public debate on the topic: "Who is tying to divide the SLFP" He said the SLFP had faced division four times in the past, that was in November 2014, January 2015, March 2015 and August 2015.
He also spoke on the Therevada Kathikawaka Bill, saying there was a funny act playing out in front of the in the media today called Ranawaka vs. Ranawaka: The JHU is opposed to the enactment of the Therevada Kathikewatha Bill - but the Cabinet of Ministers had approved the Bill, he said: Minister Patali Champaka Ranwaka is a member of the Cabinet of Ministers as well as the JHU. Therefore it would be interesting to see if Ranawaka would resign from the Cabinet or the JHU, he said.

Joint Opposition hands over Memorandum rejecting joint resolution to UN Mission in Colombo

The resolution tabled before the UNHRC jointly sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka undermined the countrys sovereignty and independence and as such the Joint Opposition in
Parliament completely opposed it. Although the Joint Opposition did not oppose any investigation into war time atrocities it should be done through a local mechanism only.
A memorandum to this effect notifying the total rejection of the UNHCR resolution by the Joint Opposition was handed over to the UN Mission in Colombo to be forwarded to the visiting UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Prince Zeid Raad al Hussien by Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena and Prof. Tissa Vitharana yesterday, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He said the Joint Opposition took steps to handover this memorandum because they had not received any favourable response form the UN Mission to the request they made for an appointment to meet Zeid to have a discussion with them.

Prince Zeid Raad Zeid Al-Hussein wraps up Sri Lankan visit
UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein today addressing a media briefing commented regarding his four day visit to Sri Lanka which came to an end.


The full statement by UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein :

Good afternoon, and thank you for coming.

I come to you shortly after wrapping up my visit here with meetings with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Leader of the Opposition, in which we discussed a wide range of issues that will have an important bearing on the future of Sri Lanka. Since arriving here on Saturday, I have also met the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, National Dialogue, and Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, as well as the Defence Secretary, Chief of Defence Staff, Army and Air Force Commanders and the Chief of Staff of the Navy.

In addition, here in Colombo, I visited the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, and the Task Force that will lead the forthcoming National Consultations on transitional justice. I also met a number of Sri Lankas finest thinkers and analysts, including members of its vibrant civil society organizations.

On Sunday, I visited the Northern and Eastern Provinces, where I met the Chief Ministers and members of the Provincial Councils as well as the Governors, and yesterday morning I was honoured to visit the revered Sri Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy, where I was graciously received by the Mahanayakas (Chief Monks) of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters. I am very grateful to them for according me this great privilege, as well as to the members of the Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities I met in Colombo, Jaffna and Trincomalee.

This has been a much more friendly, cooperative and encouraging visit than the one my predecessor endured in August 2013, which as you may recall was marred by vituperative attacks on her integrity, simply because she addressed a number of burning human rights issues that any High Commissioner for Human Rights would have raised at that time.

I am aware that some of the same people have given me a similar welcome  Ive seen the posters  but I am pleased that in the new environment in Sri Lanka, all voices, including the moderate voices of civil society, can at last be heard, even if sometimes the voices of hatred and bigotry are still shouting the loudest, and as a result are perhaps being listened to more than they deserve.

Sri Lanka has come a long way in the past year, as you, the media, are only too aware  given the much greater freedom you now have to write what you wish to write, and report what you feel you should report. The element of fear has considerably diminished, at least in Colombo and the South. In the North and the East, it has mutated but, sadly, still exists.

Virtually everyone agrees there has been progress, although opinions differ markedly about the extent of that progress. The white van abductions that operated outside all norms of law and order, and  as intended  instilled fear in the hearts of journalists, human rights defenders and others who dared criticise the Government or State security institutions, are now very seldom reported. The number of torture complaints has been reduced but new cases continue to emerge  as two recent reports, detailing some disturbing alleged cases that occurred in 2015, have shown  and police all too often continue to resort to violence and excessive force.

Several recent highly symbolic steps have been taken that have had a positive impact on inter-communal relations, including the decision taken to sing the national anthem in both Sinhala and Tamil on Independence Day, for the first time since the early 1950s. The following day, in a reciprocal gesture, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province paid a respectful visit to a Buddhist temple in Jaffna. And in January, the President pardoned the convicted LTTE prisoner who once plotted to assassinate him. These are significant steps on the path of reconciliation between these two communities, both of which bear their own deep scars from the years of conflict. I was pleased to learn that some major inter communal events are planned in the North and East to bring together large numbers of young people from all across Sri Lanka. In both provinces, the Governors are now civilians, which is another key improvement.

One of the most important long-term achievements over the past year has been the restoration of the legitimacy and independence of Sri Lankas Human Rights Commission. The appointment of new leadership of great integrity, through the proper constitutional process, offers a new start to revitalise this all-important national institution. I hope the Government will now swiftly provide it with the resources, and above all the institutional respect it needs, to enable it to fulfil its great potential, not only to provide human rights protection for all Sri Lankans, but also to offer expert advice on laws and policies from a human rights perspective.

Despite these advances  and others I have not mentioned  after nearly 30 years of conflict and acrimony, that not only cost tens of thousands of lives but also eroded so many vital components of the State, Sri Lanka is still in the early stages of renewal.

During this visit, I have met Sinhalese, Muslim and Tamil victims of the ruthless LTTE and other paramilitary groups. Family members of those who were assassinated. Mothers of children who were abducted or recruited. Muslims from the north who were forcibly evicted and expelled from their homes. Mothers of soldiers who never returned, and some of the many thousands of war widows from both sides. I am all too conscious of the suffering and fear that the years of bombings, killings and other abuses inflicted on this society.

I also met the mothers and wives of people who were apprehended, or surrendered to the security forces, and then disappeared. I have met relatives of people who have been in detention for years, without being charged with any crime, or who were charged solely on the basis of allegedly forced confessions. I met one woman carrying the emotional scars of her rape by security forces nearly 30 years ago during the JVP insurgency. Her pain, and that of all these victims and their families is terrible to behold, and it is cruel to prolong it if ways of alleviating it are available.

Distracted by this conflict, Sri Lanka has also failed to address critical issues facing women, people with disabilities, people with different sexual orientations, and other groups suffering discrimination such as the Plantation Tamils in Central Sri Lanka. I hope that these and other neglected or discriminated-against groups and minorities will now receive the attention they deserve, not least in the constitutional reform process.

Repairing the damage done by a protracted conflict is a task of enormous complexity, and the early years are crucial. If mistakes are made, or significant problems are downplayed or ignored during the first few years, they become progressively harder to sort out as time goes on. While the glass is still molten, if you are quick and skilful, you can shape it into a fine object that will last for years. Once it starts to harden in misshapen form, it becomes more and more difficult to rectify. Likewise if any of the four key elements of post conflict resolution  truth-telling, accountability, reparations and institutional reform  are neglected or mishandled, unresolved resentments will fester, new strains will emerge, and a tremendous opportunity to establish long-term stability, which in turn should result in greater prosperity, will be lost.

In the case of Sri Lanka, large parts of the country have been physically, politically, socially and economically separated from each other to a greater or lesser degree for much of the past three decades, and the effort to rebuild trust in the State, and between communities, will take years of political courage, determination and skilled coordination and planning.

When you visit Colombo, you see a bustling city, a mass of construction sites, clean streets, and flourishing businesses. You see a thriving tourist industry.

When you visit the North and the East, you see, in patches at least, damaged and depressed areas, poverty and continued displacement. Signs of physical development, certainly. And positive vision and ambitions among the elected representatives. But also more ominous signs of hopes that are not yet bearing fruit, and optimism that is already showing some signs of souring.

While there is much support for the very important proposed Constitutional reform, which should ensure that the rights of all Sri Lankans are fully recognised, there are also fears that at a later stage this may be achieved at the expense of other equally important processes such as truth-telling, justice and accountability.

While the Task Force appointed to lead the National Consultation process includes high quality representatives of civil society, there are concerns  including among the TaskForce members themselves  that the process is too rushed and has not been properly planned or adequately resourced.

There are some measures that could be taken quickly which would reverse this trend of draining confidence. First of all, the military needs to accelerate the return of land it has seized and is still holding to its rightful owners. While some land has been returned in the Jaffna and Trincomalee areas, there are still large tracts which can and should be swiftly given back. Once the land has been given back, the remaining communities of displaced people can  if given the necessary assistance  return home, and a lingering sore will have been cured once and for all. In parallel, the size of the military force in the North and the East can be reduced to a level that is less intrusive and intimidating, as a first step in security sector reform.

The Government must also quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining security-related detainees. In addition, the Prime Ministers recent statement that nearly all the disappeared persons are dead has created great distress among their families, who until then still had hope. This statement must be followed by rapid action to identify precisely who is still alive and who has died or been killed, properly account for their deaths  including whether or not they were unlawful  identify the location of their remains, and provide redress.

High on the agenda in every meeting I have had here, of course, were issues relating to the implementation of the resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council on 1 October last year, a resolution that was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and agreed with the consensus of all 47 Member States of the Council. The resolution laid out an eminently sensible pathway for the country to follow, and my Office was charged with following up on its implementation, including by reporting back to the Council on progress  or lack of it  next June, and again in March 2017.

The Human Rights Council resolution, and the comprehensive report on which it was based, and which it endorsed, aim to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights. The release of the report, and the ensuing resolution, unleashed a great surge of hope that finally we were all turning a corner in terms of starting to fully recognise what happened during the final years of Sri Lankas hugely corrosive and tragic conflict.

The Human Rights Council resolution was in many ways a reflection of the reform agenda that Sri Lankans had voted for in last years Presidential and Parliamentary elections. It sets out some of the tough steps that must be taken to achieve reconciliation and accountability and, through them, lasting peace.

There are many myths and misconceptions about the resolution, and what it means for Sri Lanka. It is not a gratuitous attempt to interfere with or undermine the countrys sovereignty or independence. It is not some quasi-colonial act by some nebulous foreign power. The acceptance of the resolution was a moment of strength, not weakness, by Sri Lanka. It was the countrys commitment to both itself and to the world to confront the past honestly and, by doing that, take out comprehensive insurance against any future devastating outbreak of inter communal tensions and conflict.

The world wants Sri Lanka to be a success story. It has seen the opportunity for lasting success in Sri Lanka, and that is why it has invested so much time and energy into providing that pathway laid down in last Octobers Human Rights Council resolution. I urge all Sri Lankans to make an effort to understand what that resolution and the report underpinning it actually say, and I urge all those in a position to do so, to make a greater effort to explain why the recommendations are so important, and why the United Nations and all those individual States  Sri Lanka included  endorsed them. Then perhaps the siren voices, who wish to undermine all reforms, all attempts to provide justice, accountability and reconciliation, will get less traction. The people who are trying to undermine confidence in these crucial initiatives are playing a game that is endangering the future peace and stability of this country.

For a country to be stable, to be a success, it needs to have a strong, impartial and credible justice system. The security services and the judiciary must function in the interests of all its citizens. And it was in these areas, that the countrys key institutions were seriously corroded and corrupted during three decades of conflict and human rights violations, including through its reliance on the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act and other emergency powers. And it is the integrity of these institutions, which depends on having the trust of the population, that the international community is trying hard to help Sri Lanka restore through the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report and in the resolution.

Sri Lanka has many excellent judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officials. But over the years the system they depended on, and which depends on them, became highly politicised, unbalanced, unreliable. The countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures. Virtually all Sri Lankans recognise this, and the Prime Minister commented on it at great length, and with admirable candour, during a 27 January debate in Parliament. Virtually every week provides a new story of a failed investigation, a mob storming a court-room, or another example of a crime going unpunished. Sexual violence and harassment against women and girls is particularly poorly handled by the relevant State institutions  especially when the alleged perpetrators are members of the military or security services  and, as a result it remains all too widespread.

It is for these reasons that the report and the Human Rights Council resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides. This is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems I mentioned earlier. But it is only one aspect  albeit a very important one  of the broad range of measures outlined in the 2015 UN report and resolution, and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate in Sri Lanka in recent days is unfortunate. Extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of Sri Lankas conflict, and they should not be allowed to undermine the countrys long term chances of recovery once again.

Only a year ago, large numbers of Sri Lankans voted for change, for reconciliation, for truth, for justice. It would be a great shame if a minority of extreme voices  on both sides  who are bent on disruption, were allowed to prevail by creating fear where there should be hope. Sri Lanka needs a serious debate about these very serious issues, on which its future depends. This needs to start with a thorough, frank and honest discussion of the detailed findings of the September 2015 UN report, as it is important that all Sri Lankans rally behind the process and better understand the point of view of all the victims on all sides.

The Government has shown the will to make great changes. But from the victims in the North and in the East, and also from some of the wisest analysts here in Colombo, I have heard fears that the Government may be wavering on its human rights commitments. I was therefore reassured this morning to hear both the President and the Prime Minister state their firm conviction in this regard.

Let me make it as plain as I can: the international community wants to welcome Sri Lanka back into its fold without any lingering reservations. It wants to help Sri Lanka become an economic powerhouse. It wants Sri Lankas armed forces to face up to the stain on their reputation, so that they can once again play a constructive role in international peace-keeping operations, and command the full respect that so many of their members deserve.

But for all that to come to fruition, Sri Lanka must confront and defeat the demons of its past. It must create institutions that work, and ensure accountability. It must seize the great opportunity it currently has to provide all its people with truth, justice, security and prosperity. I, for my part, will do all in my power to help that come about, and will continue to offer the services of my Office to accompany Sri Lanka through this very difficult process.

Thank You

Toe catch gives New Zealand series over Australia
Hamilton, Monday: A bizarre off-the-toe catch by Matt Henry brought a fairytale end to Brendon McCullums ODI career when New Zealand beat Australia by 55 runs in Hamilton Monday.
The victory in a game that was in Australias favour until Henrys dismissal of Mitchell Marsh, saw McCullum end his limited overs career with a 2-1 series win over the world champions and the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.
New Zealands Brendon McCullum celebrates winning the series after the third one-day international cricket match between New Zealand and Australia at Seddon Park in Hamilton on February 8. AFP
Australia, set a target of 247, had their tails up when they needed 83 off the last 16 overs with five wickets in hand and Marsh, their match-winner in Sundays second tie, in full flight.
But the momentum swung back in New Zealands favour when a Henry delivery edged off Marshs bat, on to his foot, and rebounded back to the bowler.
The umpire turned down an appeal from Henry.
But when the replay on the big screen confirmed what Henry suspected the umpires called for an official review which showed the ball had not touched the ground and a clearly angry Marsh was out.
Australian captain Steve Smith ultimately backed the dismissal but there were questions over whether the review would have been called had there not been a loud crowd reaction to the replay on screen.
The right decision was made. He was out. There was no doubt about that, Smith said.
I think Mattie Henry sort of thought there was a little something and it wasnt until we saw something on the big screen that the decision actually went upstairs so I was a little disappointed with that.
With Marshs decision the Australian innings collapsed with their last five wickets falling for 27 runs in 10 overs.
New Zealands innings had suffered an even worse meltdown when they lost their last six wickets for 23 to be all out for 246.
McCullum, one of the biggest hitters in the game, reeled off 47 in 27 deliveries to give New Zealand a flying start.
His innings included three sixes to give him 200 sixes in his 260-match ODI career which leaves him fourth on the overall list headed by Pakistans Shahid Afridi with 351. With McCullum at the crease the New Zealand run rate was near 8.5 but slowed after his dismissal.
Brief scores -
New Zealand - 246 in 45.3 overs- M. Guptill 59, B. McCullum 47, G. Elliott 50, C. Anderson 27, Hazlewood 2/45, Hastings 2/42, Boland 2/59, Marsh 3/34, Zampa 1/45
Australia - 191 in 43.4 overs - U. Khawaja 44, M. Marsh 41, G. Bailey 33, S. Smith 21, Henry 3/60, Milne 1/42, Anderson 2/16, Bracewell 1/15, Sodhi 2/31

'UNP, SLFP supporters should get together to build country'

Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister, Lakshman Kiriella queried as to why cannot the supporters of the two main political parties get together when the leaders of the two main political parties can get-together
The minister said so when he attended a Rural Road Rehabilitation Programme at the Pathadumbara Electoral Division in Kandy.
Under this programme, the development of the Poojapitiya-Dodamtenna road, Karaduwawala-Getathale road, Kasawatta-Poojapitiya road, Malwahinna-Neerella road, Vilana-Pallegama road and Bokkawala-Miliyadda road commenced.
The expenditure for the project is estimated at Rs. 481 million.
The minister said with the leaders of the two main parties joining, the country can plan on completing many matters of national importance.
"Since the party leaders are in line for a common rule, the supporters of the United National Party (UNP) as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should get-together and contribute in the Nation building process. No one has a right to stay away from this National Government as there are many unresolved issues in the country. It is the people of this country who are being inconvenienced. We can't stick to party differences and evade these problems. We must treat these problems as common to all people.
"After Independence, the two main parties parted and followed their agendas. When the UNP tried to solve the problems, the SLFP opposed and vice versa. This disagreement was carried out for over 60 years and resulted in a 30 year war which damaged our country's economy. But with the partnership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe, good governance came into being that provided permanent solutions for the problems faced by the country."
Commenting on the current political status of the country, Kiriella said: "Today there is no Opposition in the Parliament. Because of the 19th Amendment, the number of ministries was limited. Ministerial and deputy ministerial posts cannot be just handed over as in the previous regime, there is a limit. During the previous regime, Mahinda Rajapaksa gave over a 100 ministerial posts. But we cannot give away ministerial posts as we like as we cannot go pass the 19th Amendment.
"We are responsible for the people of this country. Therefore I invite SLFP supporters to join with the National Government's programmes instead of wasting time with the Joint Opposition".
Minister's Private Secretary Chamindrani Kiriella, UNP Pathadumbara Organizer Harindra Dunuwila, Pradeshiya Sabha Members Aruna Amunugama and Piyasena were also present.

Upbeat India to take on depleted Lanka in T20 opener

PUNE: Boosted by their 3-0 clean sweep of Australia Down Under, a confident India would seek to continue their winning momentum when they take on a depleted and new-look Sri Lanka in the first of three T20 Internationals here tomorrow (Tuesday).
After the comprehensive series triumph in Australia, these three matches would certainly act as the springboard for the hosts to begin their preparations for the Asia Cup T20 Championship which is beginning in Bangladesh later this month and the World T20 in March-April in India.
India will also look to win the T20 series to retain their number one position in the ICC T20I Championship table, which they achieved after sweeping aside Australia last week.
The hosts will definitely miss their Test captain Virat Kohli who was in glorious form in the T20 series in Australia, as well as in the preceding ODI series Down Under which India lost 1-4.
Even in the absence of a top shot like Kohli, who has been rested by the selectors before the more important Asia Cup and the World T20 events, the home teams batting strength looks pretty formidable for the new-look attack of Sri Lanka, the defending World T20 Champions.
In Rohit Sharma, who was also in top form in Australia, and Shikhar Dhawan - who took time to get going Down Under, the home team has a set of right-left openers who have repeatedly given the side great starts and they could be a handful for the largely inexperienced Lanka bowling attack on the Indian batting tracks.
The riches are evident in the rest of the batting order with the likes of Suresh Raina, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the recalled Yuvraj Singh, present along with the fit-again Ajinkya Rahane and Manish Pandey who played a match-winning knock in the final ODI in Australia but did not figure in the subsequent T20s.
With the matches being held in conditions favouring the slow bowlers more than the pace men, India are expected to go in with their regulars Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, along with the vastly experienced Harbhajan Singh who did not make the playing 11 in the three games Down Under. Also left-arm spinner Pawan Negi, the highest Indian buy in the IPL auction, is also in the squad and he would be itching to make the playing XI.
On the other hand, the visitors, who are being led by batsman Dinesh Chandimal, will be without their regular T20 captain Lasith Malinga and Test skipper Angelo Mathews for the entire series as they are nursing a knee injury and a groin strain respectively. Experienced all-rounder Tillakaratne Dilshan has also been ruled out of the opening game due to a hand injury.
Also absent from the visitors line-up are seasoned bowlers -- pacer Nuwan Kulasekara and spinner Rangana Herath -- to make the attack appear a bit thin on paper.
To fill up for the lack of experience in the squad, the Lanka selectors have recalled veteran Dilhara Fernando at the age of 36 after putting the tall and well-build pacer in cold storage in 2012.
Fernando was selected in the squad on the basis of his recent form in a domestic T20 competition where he picked up 11 wickets in four games. His inclusion is a gamble that the Lankans will be hoping pay off on this short tour which concludes at Vishakapatnam on February 14.
Dilshan, who is expected to be available from the second game in Ranchi on February 12, has been covered by the inclusion of newcomer Niroshan Dickwella, who was adjudged the best batsman of the Super T20 provincial tournament which concluded recently in the Emerald Isle.
The rival squads (from):
Sri Lanka: Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Seekuge Prasanna, Milinda Siriwardana, Danushka Gunathilaka, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedera, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilhara Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, Binura Fernando, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay, Niroshan Dickwella.
India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Ashish Nehra, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pawan Negi.

We have nothing to fear from India - coach Wijesuriya
Sri Lanka coach Roger Wijesuriya said his side's impressive win over England left him optimistic about the first semi-final of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2016 against favourites India in Mirpur today (Tuesday).
"India is a strong side, a good all-round side," said Wijesuriya. "We know their strengths. I know Indians play spin well but spin bowling is our strength and we will stick to that.
"If we play the way we did against England, there is no reason why we can't turn the semi-final in our favour.
Sri Lanka under 19
captain Charith Asalanka
"Our batsmen did not do well against Pakistan, but they showed up against England to back our bowlers and fielders. The batting has improved which is a good sign.
"We will take on the Indians with a lot of confidence. We have nothing to fear. It should be a very good game."
Rahul Dravid-coached India will rely on its all-round strengths to put it across buoyant Sri Lanka.
The power-packed Indians breezed through Group D with an all-win record against New Zealand, Nepal and Ireland, before crushing Namibia by 197 runs in the quarter-final.
Sri Lanka bounced back after a 23-run defeat to Pakistan in the last Group B match to stun a strong England side by six wickets in the quarter-final.
The in-form India side is rated as favourite, having won a tri-series in Sri Lanka last December, which also featured England, but Dravid refused to take victory for granted.
"We know what to expect from them," said Dravid. "They have a couple of seamers and a lot of good spinners. They bowl a lot of spin. Having said that, they also know what to expect from us.
"It should be a good contest. We have been playing very good cricket of late and the lead-up to the tournament was good.
"We need to play well, irrespective of whether we bat or bowl first. If we play good cricket and bring our A game to the party, we will give ourselves a good chance to win."
India's batting has been led by aggressive left-handed opener Rishabh Pant, who followed a 18-ball half-century against Nepal with 111 off 96 balls in the quarter-final.
Sarfaraz Khan has shored up the middle-order with three half-centuries in four matches.
Seamer Avesh Khan, with nine wickets in the tournament, and left-arm spinner Mahipal Lomror (seven) have led a steady Indian attack that has bowled out the rivals in three of the four matches. Ireland's 189 all out has been the highest total against India so far.
The winner will meet either host Bangladesh or the West Indies in the final on 14 February.
India will feature in its seventh semi-final, having won the tournament thrice. Sri Lanka, looking for their maiden title, will be appearing in its third semi-final.
When the tournament was last held in Bangladesh in 2004, Pakistan won the title defeating the West Indies in the final. India finished third and Sri Lanka was fifth.

West Indies stuns Pakistan to enter semi-finals

Skipper Shimron Hetmyer and Tevin Imlach hit half-centuries as the West Indies upset Pakistan by five wickets to cruise into the semi-finals of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup in Bangladesh on Monday.
Hetmyer scored 52 and Imlach made 54 to ensure a gallant 113 by Umaid Masood went in vain as the West Indies surpassed Pakistans 227 for six with 10 overs to spare in Fatullah.
The West Indies take on host Bangladesh in the second semi-final in Mirpur on Thursday. India plays Sri Lanka in the first semi-final at the same venue on Tuesday. Pakistans defeat prevented an all-Asian semi-final despite Umaids man of the match-winning performance, but the West Indies played better all-round cricket to emerge deserved winner.
Umaid came to the crease in the 15th over with Pakistan struggling at 40 for four and rebuilt the innings in the company of Salman Fayyaz after half the side was back in the hut by the 21st over.
Umaid, who had scored 13 not out and 10 in previous matches in the tournament, hit 15 boundaries and two sixes before he was out in the final over.
Salman remained unbeaten on a defiant half-century, which included three hits to the fence and a six.
The revival came after a two-wicket burst by seamer Chemar Holder and fiery fast bowling by Alzarri Joseph, who conceded just 28 runs in his 10 overs.
Once Josephs spell finished in the 36th over, Pakistan added a further 109 runs to set the West Indies a challenging target.
The Caribbean flair was evident as the West Indies raced to 100 for one by the 16th over. Hetmyer and Imlach put on 77 for the second wicket to take the score to 122 for one, before two needless run outs saw the total slip to 147 for four.
Shamar Springer was the fifth batsman to fall for 37 when 38 runs were still needed for victory, but Jyd Goolie (26 not out) and Keemo Paul (24 not out) saw their side home. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe upset the tournaments defending champion South Africa by eight wickets to enter the Plate Championship final for teams that finished outside the top eight.

* Super League quarter-final:
West Indies beat Pakistan by five wickets in Fatullah
Pakistan 227-6 in 50 overs (Umaid Masood 113, Salman Fayyaz 58 n.o, Chemar Holder 2-26)
