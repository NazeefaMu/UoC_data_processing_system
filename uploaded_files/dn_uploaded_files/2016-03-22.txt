De Villiers, Morris shine as S. Africa beat Afghanistan

Bombay, Sunday: South Africa captain Faf du Plessis praised AB de Villiers's "match-changing" half century as South Africa defeated Afghanistan by 37 runs in their World Twenty20 clash in Mumbai on Sunday.
The right-handed batsman scored a quick-fire 64 to propel the Proteas to 209/5 before Chris Morris's four wickets helped restrict Afghanistan to 172 all out on the last ball.
De Villiers smashed five sixes and four fours in his 29-ball knock as South Africa got their bid for a first international trophy back on track after an opening day loss to England.
"He wants to show he's a world-great batsman and I'm hoping today will make him really, really hungry to go out and score massive runs," du Plessis said of de Villiers.
"Not just to have small impacts of 20 run-bursts but actually have a match-changing impact and today he did that. He played beautifully," he added.
The skipper also lavished praise on Morris, who was named man of the match after he took four for just 27 in the Super 10 Group One match.
"He bowled with great intensity," the Proteas captain told reporters.
South Africa won the toss and opted to bat with elegant left-hander Quinton de Kock making 45 off 31 balls, including six fours and two sixes at the Wankhede Stadium.
Du Plessis made a tidy 41, which included seven fours and one six, before being run out in messy fashion in the tenth over but opener Hashim Amla only made five.
South Africa sat on 92/2 at the half-way stage of their innings before de Villiers came in and upped their run-rate, hitting Rashid Khan for an astonishing four sixes in the 17th over.
He was caught by Noor Ali Zadran off Mohammad Nabi near the boundary in the 18th though as he attempted yet another six. David Miller made 19 while JP Duminy was not out on 29 as South Africa set the Afghans a formidable run-chase of 210.
They made a flying start, racing to 50 in 3.4 overs, as destructive opener Shahzad did his best to frighten South Africa's bowlers in the early stages.
He hit three sixes and a four off a Kyle Abbott over.
"I did worry because that was not the way I wanted to start," said du Plessis.
"We need to get a lot better in the first three or four overs. We were a little soft in our execution and need to work on that."
But any hopes the Afghans had of causing a sensational upset were effectively over when Shahzad was bowled by Morris for 44 with the last ball of the fourth over.
"The target was slightly too much," a smiling Shahzad told reporters afterwards, adding that de Villiers was "the difference between the two sides".
Morris grabbed his second wicket shortly after taking his first when Afghan captain Stanikzai was caught behind by wicketkeeper de Kock for seven runs.
The right-arm paceman was the star of South Africa's bowling attack, also grabbing the wickets of Rashid Khan and Dawlat Zadran.
Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott and Kagiso Rabada all claimed two each. The only sour note for South Africa was the withdrawal from the field of Duminy because of a hamstring injury. AFP

Delhi likely to lose World T20 semi-final match

The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) is in the news again for all the wrong reasons, and it's likely that the semifinal clash of the ICC World Twenty20 2016 will be moved out of the Feroz Shah Kotla to some other venue.
The DDCA cannot sell tickets for the RP Mehra Block, which can accommodate close to 1800 spectators. "We were given time till Sunday evening to get clarity over RP Mehra block," said Ravinder Manchanda, the DDCA treasurer, on Sunday (March 20). "Since the case is in court, we have not got any clarity over the same.
"ICC wants to use that area for branding and also for seating purposes, since semifinal is a big game. We have not received an official word from BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) or ICC yet, but our deadline ended this evening."
The semifinal will be played on March 30. DDCA was in troubled waters over a number of issues, but got a go-ahead to host matches just before the tournament.

It is definitely not all over for us - Angelo Mathews

BANGALORE: There is a limit to what a captain can do and Angelo Mathews is having a torrid time trying to get his rather inexperienced lot of troopers (with the exception of a handful) playing together as match-winning unit.
Time is certainly running out for Sri Lanka as they try to sort out their own shortcomings in the ongoing ICC World T20 tournament where they are the defending champions.
So far Sri Lanka has won one and lost one out of the four matches they are scheduled to play in their group - Group 1. They beat Afghanistan pretty convincingly but against West Indies on Sunday, the old bad habits returned to haunt them and they succumbed to a seven-wicket defeat.
To hear Mathews complain of the middle order letting them down and about the sloppy fielding have now become all too familiar an excuse to accept because whatever happens on the field the end result is what mattered. In Sri Lanka's case it has been more losses than wins.
When a team keeps losing consistently it is very hard to motivate the players and keep their spirits up.
"We were being positive, but today we didn't assess the wicket as such. It wasn't the ideal wicket for batting - it wasn't coming on really well - we had to fight it out there. We just kept losing wickets," said Mathews after the West Indies match.
"We reassessed (but) by the time we reassessed it was a bit too late. Thisara [Perera] batted brilliantly. 150 would have been a challenging score on that wicket because it was stopping and turning quite a lot.
"It's just that we are doing mistakes here and there which actually cost us the whole outcome of the game. Today, the middle order collapse was (the cause for) the downfall. If we had another 20-25 runs on that wicket it would have been a different story. Unfortunately we didn't but we'll just shove it under the carpet."
Sri Lanka have a six-day break before they take on England on March 26 and South Africa on March 28 - both matches being played at the Ferozshah Kotla grounds in Delhi.
"We have a very good break going into the next games. So we'll work hard on our fielding, because we were so sloppy on the field again. We'll work hard on all the departments and try and win the next two games," Mathews said hopefully.
"We've been training so hard on our fielding, our batting and bowling. We've given ourselves the best chance in training; we've worked really worked hard with our fielding, with the fielding coaches on the techniques, everything. It's just that the pressure situations. We've seen even the best fielders dropping catches. Unfortunately for us, we've been dropping a few in the last couple of games, which we can't afford to do. If you drop a good player and if he's going to score runs we'll obviously end up losing," he said.
With only two tough games in hand, Mathews was optimistic about his team's chances of reaching the knockout stage of the competition.
"It is definitely not all over for us. We just lost only one game and we have two more games to go. If we win those two we will still be in (the hunt) for the semi-finals. We're just looking to win those two games, not looking too far ahead," Mathews said.
"We all need to take the responsibility because we got the players to do it. Unfortunately it's just not clicking.
One of the few positives to come out of the West Indies defeat was the bowling of young right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay who tied down the free-scoring West Indies batsmen with a fine spell of bowling that fetched him figures of 4-1-11-1 on his maiden appearance in a World Cup tournament.
"He flew in yesterday and he was terrific today. He bowled the best out of the lot, actually from both teams. He was gripping and turning the ball as well. He is always useful in the team and we'll definitely look forward to having him in the team (for future games)," said Mathews.

UPFA rebels to move No Faith motion against Champika

If proper action is not taken against Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka regarding the motor accident which occurred at Rajagiriya recently, the Joint Opposition will move a No Confidence motion in Parliament against him, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
Gunawardena said Ranawaka was not a namesake minister but a very responsible minister and a member of the Constitutional Council which appointed
Independent Commissions and as such he should show more impartiality than even those Commissions regarding incidents of this nature.
"As such speeding away in a vehicle after knocking down a person on the high road was a rather irresponsible act which set a bad example to even the Independent Commissions. This was one reason why the Opposition had opposed the appointment of parliamentarians or ministers to the Constitutional Council," the MP said.
Gunawardena said they boy who fell victim to the Rajagiriya road accident was still in a serious condition with loss of speech and since the government did not take suitable action against the minister ignoring circumstantial evidence, the Common Opposition had decided to move the No Confidence motion against the minister.
