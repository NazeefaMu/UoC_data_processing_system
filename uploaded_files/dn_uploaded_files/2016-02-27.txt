Four dead, 14 wounded in Kansas shooting
US: Four people were killed Thursday and 14 were wounded, several of them critically, when an employee opened fire at a lawn mower factory in a small Kansas town, police said.
Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said the dead included the gunman, an employee at Excel Industries, located in a tight-knit community north of Wichita.
Walton said the first officer to arrive at the scene shot the gunman, saving "many, many lives."
"This is a horrible situation, just terrible," Walton said, adding that his department received a call from the White House after the incident.
Walton said authorities had information on "some things that triggered this individual," but he would not elaborate.
The sheriff initially had said that up to seven people had been killed and up to 30 wounded but later revised the toll downwards.
The carnage was the latest in a string of mass shootings in the United States, where such attacks have become commonplace. Walton said the gunman, who he declined to identify, first fired at two motorists from his car, stealing one of the victims' pickup truck before heading to the factory.
He shot a woman in the parking lot with an assault rifle and then entered the facility unleashing a volley of bullets as people ran for their lives screaming "run, fire, fire," according to one witness.
Local media identified the gunman as Cedric Ford, 38, who worked as a painter at the factory and had posted a picture of himself on Facebook with an assault rifle.
Ford recently moved to the area from Miami, and had an extensive criminal record, including a history of prowling, loitering and illegal weapons possession, media reports said.
Walton said police surrounded the gunman's home after the shooting but his male roommate refused to allow them in, resulting in a standoff that continued unresolved late Thursday.
"We will make entry," he said.
The victims were transported to area hospitals, where five were listed in critical condition, as family members rushed to the factory for news of their loved ones.
One man said his 21-year-old nephew had been shot four times.
"I hear about these shootings at theatres and things, and it's just a mess... it's horrible," an eyewitness said, referring to mass shootings that have become a fact of life across the country.
"This guy had this planned."
Several employees at the plant told local media they believed that the shooter had emotional and mental problems.
"Someone said this guy got fired, got upset and just came back and shot people," Marty Pierce, an eyewitness who works at the plant, told KAKE television.
The Hesston shooting was the latest in a string of mass killings in the United States that include Saturday's rampage by an Uber driver that left six people dead in Michigan, the December terror attack in San Bernardino, California that left 14 people dead, and the December 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre that killed 26, including 20 children.
Gun violence claims the lives of about 30,000 Americans every year and mass shootings -- rare in most countries -- have been on the rise.
In a grim irony, Walton said his department had held a meeting last week on how to deal with an active shooting situation.
"Any place that thinks it can't happen here, wake up," he said. "Because it can happen."
"This is a fairly peaceful community," he added. "And to have something like this happen is tragic."

German Parliament approves tougher asylum rules
GERMANY: The German Parliament on Thursday approved new measures to tighten asylum rules in an effort to stem an unprecedented influx of migrants.
The package, which includes measures such as restricting family reunions for some migrants, was approved with a large majority of 429 votes to 147 against.
The new rules also lower the hurdles for the expulsion of convicted foreigners -- a key measure proposed after the New Year's rampage in Cologne, where hundreds of women reported being sexually assaulted and robbed in a crowd of mostly migrant men.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under intense pressure to reduce the number of asylum seekers in Germany, which saw an influx of around 1.1 million in 2015.
Under the new rules, some migrants will be blocked from bringing their families to join them in Germany for two years.
The measure applies to some rejected asylum seekers who still cannot be expelled because they risk torture or the death penalty in their own country.
The asylum application process would also be sped up, with centres set up to process applications from "economic migrants" who have little prospect of winning refugee status.
Berlin's aim in gathering these applicants in specific centres is to facilitate their quick repatriation, to free up resources for war refugees who urgently need protection.

Indian fishermen launch indefinite strike
As there are no signs of release of fishermen languishing in Sri Lankan prisons after the were arrested by Sri Lankan navy and their boats were impounded, the Indian fishermen launched an indefinite strike from Friday, and resolved to go ahead with their decision to lay siege to Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission office in Chennai on February 29.

A day after Sri Lankan courts extended the judicial remand of Rameswaram and Pudukottai fishermen by 15 more days, leaders of the fishermen associations met here on Friday and decided to strike work to express their protest against the Centres continued silence over the issue.

Though they had decided to launch an indefinite strike, the fishermen might resume fishing after a week as they could not afford to prolong the agitation for long, P. Sesu Raja, a fishermen leader, said.

They had only a few fishing days left in March before the 45-day mandatory ban on fishing came into force in April. The strikes badly affected the livelihood of scores of hapless fishermen but they had no option to draw the attention of the authorities, he said. Leaders of fishermen associations in six coastal districts and Karaikal were in touch and would finalise the strategies for the Chennai agitation. Leaders in Chennai were taking steps to obtain police permission for the agitation, Mr. Sesu Raja said.

We expect about 200 fishermen from each district to take part in the agitation, he said, adding the local leaders have arranged four buses for taking 200 fishermen from here. Family members of 27 fishermen, who were languishing in Lankan prisons, and owners of 79 boats impounded in the island nation would also take part in the agitation, he said.

In a counter move, the Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen had also announced that they would stage a demonstration in front of the office of Consulate General of India in Jaffna, on February 29 itself, to protest against any move to allow the Indian fishermen to fish in Sri Lankan waters, reports received here said.

The peoples trust placed on the government has eroded due to the failure of the government to take action against those who were responsible for these crimes. The people have been disturbed due to these activities.
A 13-year-old school girl in Vavuniya had been raped and murdered recently. The incident has sparked protests across the North-East condemning the rising incidences of sexual violence against women within the community and demanding the perpetrators to be brought to justice.

Akila at loggerheads with Peshala over appointments
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday, said that Provincial Council Ministers could get an education minister appointed according to their wishes, if they could not comply with the directives given by the line ministry.
The minister made this observation yesterday, referring to a dispute between him and the North Central Province Education Minister and Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, who had refused to carry out the directives of the line minister.

No foreign vessel could fish in SL waters - Amaraweera
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told Parliament yesterday, that there was no plan to permit foreign fishing vessels to fish in Sri Lankan waters under the Sri Lankan flag.
Participating in the debate during the Adjournment motion moved by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene, the minister said plans are afoot to develop the country's fisheries industry. The government would formulate a national policy to fulfill the needs of the fisheries issues. Top priority would be given to enhance local fish production.
He said the ministry has planned to promote and uplift the inland fishing and aquatic fish industry within the next year. This sector would earn more money for the country during the next few years. Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim also joining in the debate, said that maximum priority must be given to the fisheries industry.
Most of the people engaged in the fisheries industry are poor people.
It is necessary to implement a programme to uplift their livelihoods. We have to import fish because of the short sighted fisheries policies followed by all governments' previously. Steps should be taken to increase fish exports, while minimizing the imports to increase foreign exchange earnings as well as uplifting income generation of the fishing community.
Govt. making false excuses for not holding Local Govt. elections - Dinesh
The Commissioner General of Elections had informed the Cabinet of Ministers that he was unaware about the previous delimitation process, said Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said that the Prime Minister would make a statement on the matter and local government elections on a future date.
He made this observation in response to a special statement made by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2), calling for local government election to held without further delay.
MP Dinesh Gunawardana raising the question, said the extended terms of most of local bodies ended in March and elections should be held without delay. MP Gunawardena said the terms of some local bodies ended in March 2015, while the term of other local bodies ended in October the same year.
"The Government makes false excuses for delaying to hold local government election,", MP Gunawardena said. "The claim made by the government that the delimitation process is yet to be completed is far from the truth."
In response to this statement, Minister Kiriella said that delimitation had been done during the previous regime in the residences of former ministers, adding that it was revealed by the members of the Delimitation Commission.
JVP leader wants justice meted out to graduates over 35 years
Since the maximum current age for recruitment to government service is 35 years, JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the government whether some sort of justice can be meted out to unemployed graduates who do not meet this criteria.
The MP in a special statement under Standing Order 23 (2), said that there had been an agitation by unemployed graduates in Colombo on February 16, demanding that they be recruited to the government. The government, just like its predecessors, used police anti-riot squads and attacked the agitators. It was not the first agitation by unemployed graduates demanding for jobs. Since there is no proper solution to the unemployment problem of graduates, this problem kept on repeating regularly.
None of the governments that ruled this country could device a mechanism to absorb the services and skills of graduates to the public service though the government spends around Rs 400,000 to 700,000 for each undergraduate per year which is done out of tax monies of the people. In addition, parents of undergraduates too spend their monies to educate their children.
In addition, there are some other problems. Graduates who had been given jobs on various occasions since 1993 to 2016, were unhappy and unsatisfied with the way their services were granted. The graduates who had been recruited during the period 2012 to 2016, were paid a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000 each. How could a person expect to live on Rs 10,000 a month under the current cost of living
Newly passed amendments a betrayal of Lankan fishermen
Opposition Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti said the newly passed amendments to the Fisheries Act in the recent past, was a betrayal of Sri Lankan fishermen to international fishermen.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, joining the Adjournment debate moved by Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena.
Galappatti said the amendments had banned the Sri Lankan fishermen from fishing in international waters. He questioned as to why those fishermen sail about 600 to 800 km in to sea and return with the crop to the country.
At this stage, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the statement was misleading and added that the ban was imposed on those who illegally sail into international waters. He added that 90 percent of the fishermen engage in their employment only within our territorial waters.

Trump under fierce attack by rivals at rancorous debate
US: White House hopefuls Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio unleashed a barrage of attacks against Donald Trump during Thursday's raucous Republican debate as they sought to halt the billionaire frontrunner's seemingly relentless march to the party's nomination.
The three candidates exchanged some of the most heated and acerbic remarks of the entire 2016 primary cycle. They often talked over one another as they battled for supremacy in the final on-stage showdown before the "Super Tuesday" series of state wide votes on March 1.
Cruz and Rubio mounted a furious assault against Trump, blasting the frontrunner for hiring foreigners and challenging his commitment to conservative principles, but Trump largely stood his ground and swatted away the attacks.
Knowing that they need to change the campaign trail narrative quickly or risk Trump coasting to the Republican nomination, the two freshman senators launched broadsides against the brash billionaire, who lashed out at his challengers in what quickly devolved into a shouting match.
Rubio, seen by many as the primary mainstream challenger, appeared loose and aggressive against Trump. While he has hesitated to attack Trump directly on the campaign trail, Rubio seemed eager to engage and criticize his rival during the debate in Houston.
He immediately berated Trump over his immigration positions including having once supported a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. And he took him to task for having "hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled" in Trump development projects.
Rubio pointed to articles that described a 1980s lawsuit by a workers union against Trump for hiring 200 illegal immigrants from Poland to build the Trump Tower in New York.
Rubio also accused Trump of starting a "fake university" that bilked students out of thousands of dollars, and said that if the real estate icon had not received a massive inheritance from his wealthy father he would be "selling watches in Manhattan."
