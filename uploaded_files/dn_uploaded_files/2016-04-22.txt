Galle May Day rally will be harbinger of SLFPs glory ahead: Shan

The May Day rally of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party scheduled to be held in Galle will be a historic event with the participation of a massive crowd, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
It would be the foremost volley that heralds the renewed glorious political journey towards remarkable victory of the party at the next parliamentary election, he told a media conference about the SLFP May Day celebrations scheduled to be held in Galle. The people of the Southern Province are prominent in initiating revolutionary episodes that change the countrys political history. The people of the South were the forerunners who registered the first political victory in 1994 that led to the change of the 17 year suppressive regime that was in power since 1997. Hence the party decided to hold its 2016 May Day celebrations in Galle which would demonstrate the party mens unity, solidarity and their resolute faith and love towards the party, de Silva said.
We will defeat all subversive schemes of conspirators against the party. All faithful SLFP cadres are with the party and rally round President Maithripala Sirisena. There are a few who are knowingly plotting against the party aimed at fulfilling the needs of the conspirators against the party. We know that we cannot draw such sections to the right path for they are in a make-believe sleep. However real SLFP members who understand the destructive motives of plotters gradually rally round the party leadership, he said.
The Chief Minister who enlightened the fate of dissidents of any party in the past affirmed that such nonconformists had to take three options.
They had either to rejoin the party after some time or join another party and some had to retire from politics for ever. So we trust that some of our party men who are misled by conspirators against the party will rejoin the party after they understand the real malicious drives of them, de Silva said.
A party or any organisation should have only one leader and the members have to respect that leadership. We as dedicated SLFPers have always been loyal to the party leader. I have never seen S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the founder leader of the party or heard his voice for real. But we all respect him, the Chief Minister said.
Commenting on the moves by the Joint Opposition to hold a May Day rally, de Silva challenged them to have such demonstration without the participation of SLFP members.
There are a few minor political parties which are limited only to party name boards, he said.
All such parties are politically destitute. They have no party cadres of their own. As such, they try to divide our party and celebrate May Day with our people. I challenge them to organise a May Day rally without our people and solely with their members. I urge party men not to be misled by the false propaganda of schemers and to stand for party unity, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena wants to unite all sections of the party. He will not advocate any move that would lead for a division in the party. Loyalty towards the party is to be with the party leader. To be with the party leader is not an offence. It is a grievous fault to go against the party leader, the Chief Minister said.
Provincial Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilake said it was ridiculous to note that some extremist chauvinistic forces were planning to hold a May Day rally at Kirullapone.
The Kirullapone May Day rally is organised by members of some seven marginal parties who claim to be the so called joint opposition. The SLFPs May Day rally will be held in Galle. All SLFP members should attend the Galle May Day celebrations, he said. Provincial Minister Chandima Rasaputra said they would not allow anyone to destroy the unity of the party and urged all members of the SLFP to join the May Day rally in Galle.

UNP May Day rally dedicated to countrys workforce: Kabir

The UNPs May Day rally this year is dedicated to the committed workforce of the country as it is they that can pull the country out of the debt trap it is in at present, UNP General Secretary and Public Enterprise Development Minisetr Kabir Hashim said.
He was addressing the media at the partys coordinating office in Matara yesterday.
The UNP rally to be held at Campbell Park is scheduled to start at 2.00 p.m. The May Day procession will start at 11.00 a.m. opposite the B.G. Sirisena public playground.
The UNP General Secretary was in Matara to discuss the parties progress with the UNP organisers of Matara district. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera who celebrated his birthday yesterday and Co-Chairman of the Matara District Development Council and Member of Parliament Buddhika Pathirana were present at the media briefing.
This is the first May Day rally that the new government will be holding after being elected on August 17, last year. There are many people including our leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who made sacrifices for the party and the country. It is a committed workforce that we need to pull this country out of the debt trap it is in and bring Sri Lanka back to where it should be. Thats why our first May Day rally will be dedicated to the people with commitment, Hashim said. When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected in 2005 the per capita debt was Rs. 110,000 and the countrys foreign debt was US$ 21 billion. But at the end of his tenure in 2015, the per capita debt was Rs. 452,000 and foreign debt was US$ 44 billion, he said.
In the short time we have been office we have been able to establish an environment in which people can work with dignity.
We have increased the salaries of government sector employees and requested the public sector salaries to be increased. This is how we showed our appreciation to the dedication and commitment of our national work force, he added.
It is because of the commitment of the leaders and people that countries like Singapore and Korea are economically stable today, Hashim said.
