Flop of Asia -  Sri Lanka slammed after cricket exit
Colombo, Tuesday: Sri Lankan newspapers and fans lambasted the national cricket team Tuesday after the former champions were dumped out of the Asia Cup by up-and-coming Afghanistan.
The flop of Asia, ran the private Daily Mirrors headline, while the state-run Daily News said one-day cricket had hit a nadir.
The Island daily lamented the sad night for Sri Lankan cricket.
Afghanistan demonstrated their rise in international cricket with their 91-run win over Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Sri Lanka needed to win the Group B match to stay in the tournament but were outwitted by Afghanistan who put up a fighting total of 249 all out at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.
Sri Lanka, who now have lost 30 of their 40 matches since January 2017, had lost to Bangladesh by 137 runs in Dubai on Saturday at the opening match of the tournament.
The Mirror said the performance did not augur well for the World Cup in England and Wales next year.
Sri Lanka now require a great deal of soul-searching to be a competitive outfit in white-ball cricket before the 1996 World Champions become a laughing stock in the world -- if they arent that already, the Mirror said.
Disappointed Sri Lankan fans took to social media to went their anger, with many memes ridiculing the national team.
We could have stayed in the Asia Cup at least till India played its first match, said one social media user.
Indias first game, against Hong Kong, was scheduled for later Tuesday.
Another social media user ridiculed batsman Kusal Mendis who was out for a duck, saying there would have been more cheer if a different Mendis was included -- referring to a popular alcoholic drink known as Mendis Special.
Another fan speculated tongue-in-cheek that the poor performance was all part of a strategy to dupe other teams into thinking Sri Lanka were weak before next years World Cup. AFP

Improving financial literacy,  must for budding entrepreneurs

Improving financial literacy among Sri Lankans will help create a new breed of entrepreneurs and profitable business ventures across Sri Lanka, said Prof. H.D Karunaratne and Head of the Department of Business Economics, Faculty of management and Finance at University of Colombo.
Elaborating on competitiveness in local education sector, he noted that close to 35% of students are unable to get through ordinary level examination while only 10% of students managed to enter a local university in Sri Lanka based on the results was speaking at a pre- budget seminar organised by Business Economics Faculty of University of Jayewardenepura, under the theme, Striving for Export Competitiveness, held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Colombo On Monday.
He also cited less number of entrepreneurs and businesses in the country as one of the key reasons that the country hasnt been able to send Sri Lankan made products to international markets over the last couple of years.
Quoting statistics from a recently complied National Labour Force Survey in Sri Lanka, he pointed out that there are 229,000 employers in Sri Lanka. As a percentage, it is only a 3.9 percent, out of 8 million total working populations of the country.
Making a comparison between Japan and Sri Lanka, he said Japan accounts for 4.2 million businesses compared to one million small businesses and less than 900, 000 other businesses currently operating in Sri Lanka.
Also noting that Sri Lankas literacy rate particularly the financial and ICT literacy is not much comparable with other regional piers to be competitive in the global market, he said that Sri Lanka needs to improve financial literacy rate to have more businesses and profitable organizations in the future.
We need to introduce more languages to be learned. Today literacy doesnt mean read and write. It means that how many languages one can use properly to communicate on a daily basis, he said.
On the educational front, Sri Lanka has almost 10,000 schools, of which 6,000 and 3,000 are running only in Sinhala and Tamil languages respectively.
And also less than 1,000 schools are teaching Sinhala and Tamil languages. Out of the total population, only a mere 10% of Sri Lankans have the ability to properly communicate in English as a foreign language while 30% of Sri Lankans are literate on ICT.
He also stressed the need to get economic fundamentals right which include interest, exchange rates and the inflation.
I think that the entire economy should be stabilized. However the Central Bank alone cant stabilize the economy if people dont have the financial literacy, he said.
He also said that the public sector needs to have a sound knowledge to manage money, spent lavishly on some sections of the country including subsidies.
He said the country is focusing more on the revenue side rather than the expenditure side.
He also added that in Sri Lanka, there is an acute shortage of economists particularly young economists to formulate far-sighted economic policies and reforms. He said further that the country needs to focus on automation and innovation to redress issues mainly relating to the manpower rather than relying on importing foreign labour to address the current acute labour shortage in key sectors including construction sector in Sri Lanka.

2019 WC rocket explodes in launch pad at Abu Dhabi
So, the unthinkable has happened. The ardent cricket fans must have pinched themselves to make sure they were not dreaming when they woke to the bad news yesterday morning of our cricket team suffering a humiliating defeat to Afghanistan, and exiting the Asia Cup in the first round. It surely isnt a dream. We were right royally thumped out of the Asia Cup by a margin of 91 runs with 10 overs to spare, and the rocket that was bound for World Cup 2019 has exploded in the launching pad. Such is the sense of despondency sweeping across our die-hard cricket fans, and the cricket loving population at large.
It does not make much sense to perform a post mortem as the weaknesses were plain to see and were highlighted in these columns long before the campaign started. What is more infuriating to the ardent cricket fans of this country Is the total apathy shown by the leadership and the officials in charge of sports on the devastation taking place under their very noses. As already pointed out, the reason for such poor performances is certainly not dearth of talent as some incompetent people in the system attempt to show. An objective examination to try and pin point where the fault lines lie reveals:
Fault No.1: Is the inability to identify talent and slot players in the right format. The three Selection Committees appointed by the Jayasekera/Sumathipala coterie headed by Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya and Graeme Labrooy has not identified a single player who was worthy of a national cap. In fact, Labrooy went on record that Lasith Malinga was not in his World Cup plans. Look what has been exposed now. There has been a string of players who have been gifted national caps for one reason or the other who have exited the team faster than they entered. In the current context, the situation is much worse with the coach being entrusted selection responsibilities. Where does he find time to watch domestic cricket and identify new talent with his coaching work load Things get murkier when the support staff tries to justify selections to the press without focussing on their areas of responsibility. The Asia Cup squad was picked on the performances of a hurriedly organized T20 contest. The lack of technique in batsmen picked on this basis was clearly exposed during these two games. What is more alarming to note is the management team of expatriate locals were visiting their adopted countries whilst these matches were going on. Such is the ignorance and lack of care prevalent in the management team at present.
Fault No. 2: It is abundantly clear that there has been too much tampering with the techniques of the batsmen from the lack of form and absence of runs from the top order. The freedom with which these players made runs appears to have deserted them. How come
Fault No. 3: There appears to be too much outside meddling going on in all fronts. The cameras captured several instances where commentators were seen dishing out pre-match advice and pre-tournament pep talks, and comments on who should be captaining our World Cup 2019 team. For whose benefit is all this advice been dished out One can understand if such support was translating into motivating our team to perform to their potential which unfortunately is not the case. It would have been far better to seek inspiration from a player in the calibre of Arjuna Ranatunga who actually shepherded his team across the line and to World Cup glory in 1996.
One can go on pin pointing the weaknesses, but, that would achieve no purpose. What is abundantly clear is that this ship is way off course with an ill equipped crew to boot. The honourable thing to do would be for the entire selection and management teams to tender their resignations, so that with barely eight months to go the Minister of Sports can hurriedly assemble a fresh set of true professionals and draw up new plans and charter a new course headed for World Cup 2019.
But, this is Sri Lanka and no such thing can be expected where honour goes out of the window when livelihood and subsistence is on the line. Of course the Minister of Sports can demand for their resignation. That too is highly unlikely to happen considering what is happening in the cricketing ambit where the Minister of Sports has even chosen to ignore instructions dictated by the ICC to appoint an independent committee of management.
If none of the above is going to be happening, and the caravan is allowed to happily roll on, the least the Minister can do is invite the selectors and the management of the national netball team to take charge of selections and management of our team, and summarily dispatch the current cricket management to the IT Division of SLC so that everyone lives happily ever after - as people like to do in this resplendent island of ours - where Accountability is non-existent.

3D creature graffiti
Talk about graffiti today and youll find it has shed some of its old stigmas. In fact, the once rogue street art genre has been welcomed into the traditional art world and when you look at the work of Sergio Odeith, its easy to see why.
The Portuguese artist started creating graffiti in the 90s when it was first gaining prominence in the country. He started with simple sketches on street walls and train tracks but then advanced into large-scale murals.
Odeith continued to evolve and adopted the obscure signature style, which he refers to as sombre 3D. This technique combines angles, lines, and shadows to create an extraordinarily life-like effect. In 2005 he gained international recognition for his anamorphic art series, which looked like something out of a science horror fiction flick, with giant spiders appearing to climb off the walls at helpless passers-by.
Not surprisingly, the Lisbon-based muralist has since been asked to design pieces across the pond in the U.S cities of Baton Rouge, L.A, Charleston and Lexington and has even received business contracts with major corporations like Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Shell. Bored Panda

ADB provides USD 50 mn for rooftop solar power project
The Enterprise Sri Lanka projects which was launched by the Ministry of Finance and Mass media to inspire, assist and create a minimum of 100,000 new entrepreneurs has received Rs 8 billion ( USD 50 Million) from the Asian Development Bank for the rooftop solar power generation project.
The main objective of this project is to support governments Battle for Solar Power Programme to achieve the target of 200 MW by 2020 and 1000 MW by 2025 through solar power generation. Clean and sustainable power generation will be enhanced through the proposed project by increasing debt facilities and funding for the rooftop solar power generation, developing solar rooftop market infrastructure and bankable subproject pipeline. It is expected to add 50 MW to the national grid under this project.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka subsidized loan scheme has introduced a Donor funded refinance loan scheme to make provisions for rooftop solar power generation project with the aegis of the ADB. The households and the entrepreneurs will be provided maximum credit facilities up to Rs 7. 5 million on the lending rate of 8 percent per annum.
The Department of Development Finance of the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media which is the implementing agency of the project, will coordinate with the selected banks and financial institutions to provide credit facilities to the customers to purchase rooftop solar panels from reliable suppliers who have registered under the Sustainable Energy Authority.
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company Ltd (LECO) will support the project implementation by providing technical recommendations to the Financial Institutions regarding technical proposals of the applicants (customers) and reviewing and approving applications for connection of solar rooftop systems to the distribution network. In addition, customers will be benefited financially through one of the system among net metering, net accounting or net plus as a result of connecting solar electricity generated by this project to the national grid.
The total investment cost of this project is USD 59.8 million of which USD 50 million will be provided by ADB. Equity contribution by customers for the subprojects will be USD 9.8 million.

On-again, off-again relationships are very toxic
Did you know that on-off relationships can be toxic for your mental health Such relationships are associated with higher rates of abuse, poorer communication and lower levels of commitment, a new study reveals.
There are characters like Sam and Diane from Cheers, Ross and Rachel from Friends, and Carrie and Mr. Big from Sex and the City, which were a part of on-off relationships, keeping us entertained.
However, a researcher from the University of Missouri, Columbia says that the pattern of breaking up and getting back together can be harmful for an individuals mental health. He suggests that people in these kinds of relationships should make informed decisions about stabilizing or safely terminating their relationships.
Prior research has estimated that more than 60% of adults have been involved in on-off relationships, and more than one - third of cohabiting couples reported breaking up and later reconciling at some point. Compared to relationships without this pattern, on-off relationships are associated with higher rates of abuse and communication gap.
Breaking up and getting back together is not always a bad omen for a couple. In fact, for some couples, breaking up can help partners realize the importance of their relationship, contributing to healthier, more committed unions. On the other hand, partners who are routinely breaking up and getting back together could be negatively impacted by the pattern, said Kale Monk, assistant professor of human development and family science.
Monk and co-authors Brian Ogolsky and Ramona Oswald examined data from more than 500 individuals currently in relationships. They found that an increase in breaking up and reuniting was associated with more psychological distress symptoms such as depression and anxiety. They did not find meaningful differences between same-sex and heterosexual relationships in this pattern.
Partners break up and reunite for a number of reasons; a common one is necessity or practicality. For example, a person might stay in a relationship for financial reasons or partners might stay together because they feel they have invested too much time into the relationship to leave. However, Monk advises that former partners should get back together based on dedication, and not on obligation.
Monk suggested a few tips for couples that included, when considering rekindling a relationship that ended or avoiding future breakups, partners should think about the reasons that led to the break up to determine if there are persistent issues impacting the relationship.
Another step they can take is to have explicit conversations about issues that led to the break-up, especially if the issues will likely reoccur. If there was ever violence in the relationship, however, or if having a conversation about relationship issues can lead to safety concerns, consider seeking support-services when it is safe to do so.
One can also spend time thinking about the reasons why reconciliation might be an option. Is the reason rooted in commitment and positive feelings, or more about obligations and convenience The latter reasons are more likely to lead down a path of continual distress.
Another point to take into consideration is that it is okay to end a toxic relationship. For example, if your relationship is beyond repair, do not feel guilty leaving for your mental well-being.
Couple therapy or relationship counseling can also be of help. Even happy dating and married couples can benefit from relationship check-ups in order to strengthen the connection between partners and have additional support in approaching relationship transitions.
The findings appeared in the journal of Family Relations.

Australian cricket needs Smith back, says Waugh
Sydney, Tuesday: Australian cricket needs disgraced ex-captain Steve Smith and he is likely to be welcomed back with open arms, former skipper Steve Waugh forecast Tuesday, although it might be tougher for David Warner.
The pair are serving one-year suspensions from international and state cricket over their part in the ball-tampering scandal against South Africa in March, while opener Cameron Bancroft was banned for nine months.
We need him back in Australian cricket, Waugh told Fox Sports Australia of 29-year-old Smith, who has played 64 Tests.
You cant lose someone of his quality overnight and expect to replace it and hes still only relatively young.
All three players accepted responsibility for the scandal that rocked the sport, with Smiths tearful apology on his arrival back in Australia tugging at the heartstrings.
Waugh said fans still adore him.
The Australian public, they are forgiving, he said. He (Smith) made a mistake and hes paid a heavy price for it.
But if he gets back out there and plays with the same enthusiasm and passion, he loves playing cricket, he loves scoring runs, he wants to get back playing for Australia, I think Australians will move past what happened before.
They obviously remember it, but theyre big enough to realise you can make a mistake and grow from that and be stronger.
Warner, a dynamic batsman but a divisive figure in the game, may find it harder to earn acceptance again.
He was charged by Cricket Australia with developing the plot to use sandpaper to alter the ball and telling Bancroft to carry it out.
Despite this, Waugh said he hoped Warner would also get a second chance.
I hope so, you have to give guys an opportunity to redeem themselves. Theyve apologised and paid a heavy price, he said, but warned it would not be easy for any of them to bounce back to the top.
Its going to be a challenge for all of them to come back, its not going to be as easy as people think, he said.
Youre out for 12 months, the game does move on, you lose that aura of invincibility a little bit, you become a bit more fragile, a bit of self-doubt creeps in.
So its going to be a real challenge for all three of those guys to come back strong. AFP

Bangladesh to move Rohingya to an island from next month
BANGLADESH: Bangladesh will next month start moving 100,000 Rohingya refugees to a remote island, officials said Tuesday, despite warnings the silty strip is prone to violent weather.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled on October 3 to officially open newly-constructed shelters for the displaced Muslims on Bhashan Char, a muddy islet that only emerged from the Bay of Bengal in 2006.
The controversial plan is already behind schedule. Officials previously said they wanted to start moving refugees from overcrowded camps near the border with Myanmar to the island in June, before the monsoon began.
The navy has fast-tracked construction of shelters and evacuation centres for 100,000 refugees and nearly three-quarters of the project is complete, a senior disaster management official told AFP.
Initially, 50 to 60 Rohingya families will be relocated in the first phase beginning next month, said the official, Habibul Kabir Chowdhury.
Bangladesh, a low-lying riverine country vulnerable to rising sea levels, is prone to tropical cyclones, especially in the Bay of Bengal between April and November.
Hundreds of thousands have died from natural disasters in the last 50 years, mostly in coastal areas near Bhashan Char.
The island is one hour by boat from the nearest land but violent storms make the journey by sea dangerous or sometimes impossible.
The plan to relocate refugees there was revived after 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, fleeing a violent crackdown in Myanmar in August last year, poured into southeast Bangladesh and overwhelmed existing refugee camps.
Rights groups have warned the silty strip is uninhabitable and prone to flooding and other natural disasters, and urged Bangladesh to drop the idea.
But the government pumped $280 million last November into transforming it into a habitable site.
A navy official told AFP a three-metre-high (nine feet) embankment had been erected around the entire island to make it flood-resistant.
We're ready to receive refugees, he said, asking for anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press.
Secretary of the Disaster Ministry, Shah Kamal, said the refugees would be able to access humanitarian relief on the island and receive training in skills such as fishing. - AFP

CA TURNS DOWN WIGGIES REQUEST TO DEFER  CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
A request made by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran to defer contempt of court proceedings filed against him was yesterday rejected by the Court of Appeal.
Wigneswaran through his lawyer K.Kanag-iswaran PC made an application to defer contempt of court proceedings until the Supreme Court makes an order regarding a leave to appeal petition filed by his client.
However, the Court of Appeals two-judge-bench comprising Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Janak de Silva decided to proceed with the contempt of court charges.
The Court of Appeal made this order as a part of contempt of court proceedings filed by B.Denishwaran alleging that the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and Ananthi Sasitharan and K.Sivanesan have willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Province.

The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran to expel B.Denishwaran from functioning as the provinces Fisheries and Transport Minister.
The petitioner B.Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister.

Calzaghe's coach and father Enzo dies
London, Tuesday: Enzo Calzaghe, who coached his son Joe to two boxing world titles at different weights and an undefeated 46-bout career despite never boxing himself, has died aged 69.
The Sardinian-born trainer also coached Gavin Rees and Enzo Maccarinelli to the WBA light welterweight and WBO cruiserweight titles respectively. However, it will be the remarkable association with his own son, 'The Pride of Wales', for which he will forever be remembered.
"The family are devastated to have to announce the death of our beloved Enzo," the Calzaghes said in a statement."Enzo led an incredible life both inside and outside of the boxing gym and his loss is a devastating one for the entire Calzaghe family."
Enzo Calzaghe began his training career in very modest surroundings.
His first training facilities were in a shed in the south Wales town of Newbridge, but it evolved into one of the finest developers of boxing talent in the United Kingdom.
Joe won world titles at two weights, retiring as the undisputed super-middleweight world champion having held the WBO version for almost 11 years. AFP

ASSASSINATION PLOT ALLEGATIONS
CID INQUIRY WILL REVEAL TRUTH- PM
The Government awaits the report of the CID inquiry into the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decide on future actions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was responding to a question by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara assured Parliament of an impartial and transparent inquiry into the alleged conspiracy while also assuring the security of the President and the former Defence Secretary.
The JO MPs agitated in the House demanding the Government to interdict DIG Nalaka de Silva till the probes were over. They also accused that IGP Pujith Jayasundera was working hand in glove with DIG de Silva.
The Prime Minister also said that if former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa thinks that there is a threat to his life he can request for more security, adding that the Government is ready to act on such a request. Given the intra-party crises that he is faced with, of which even we are aware, perhaps he may be feeling perturbed, Wickremesinghe said.
I thank you for the interest shown on the Presidents security. However, who among you showed any concern when his security was removed when he came out as the Common Candidate Did any of you speak of his security then the PM asked from the JO MPs also urging them not to make political mileage over the issue.
The PM replying to the concerns said any flaws on the part of the IGP, if true, would come out from within the Police during the investigation. As soon as I returned to the country, I ordered the IGP to hold an immediate inquiry into the allegation. The President, Police Commission and the IGP have also given the same order. Now, let the inquiry be carried out, said the PM.
The PM told the House that the subject minister and he refrain from divulging all the information in their possession that might affect the investigation. We will take steps as of the evidence we receive, he said.
Minister Madduma Bandara said the Police have requested for the unedited voice and video clips of the press conference conducted by Namal Kumarage in Kandy from media organisations that covered it, adding that those were yet to be received. He said the mobile phone of Kumarage has been taken into the CID custody.
He said it is upto the Police Commission to take disciplinary action if needed against DIG de Silva once the preliminary investigations were completed. Responding to a demand by the JO to impound DIG de Silvas passport to prevent him going overseas, the minister said the relevant authorities have been given the necessary instructions in that regard.
The Police and security forces provide adequate security to the President, who is also the first citizen of the country. Even though, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was not a Sri Lankan citizen we undertake to provide adequate security to him too, he added.
Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said the security of Namal Kumarage had also been taken care of.
JO MP Dullas Allahapperuma charged that the IGP was implicated in the alleged conspiracy. JO MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara alleged that the IGP had been seen at the Kelaniya temple taking part in a Bodhi pooja with DIG de Silva.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Deputy Minister Sriyani Wijewickrama said they were not satisfied with the IGPs actions with regard to the incident and demanded that he be sacked and carry out the investigations under a new IGP. She also demanded to suspend DIG Nalaka de Silva and to arrest him immediately.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena raising a question under the Standing Order 27 (2) said, The entire country and the international community are shocked by the recent revelation of the assassination plot. There is a serious allegation against a DIG of planning to get the support of the underworld to kill the President and the former defence secretary. Security authorities are slow to conduct investigations into this. This issue could lead to anarchy in the country.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella pointed out that MP Gunawardenas statement can stand in the way of the investigations. This is an attempt to interfere in investigations. I am a lawyer. I understand the damage this statement can do, he added.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed the House that he summoned the IGP on Monday to discuss the matter. As soon as I got to know about this, I phoned the IGP and the Police Commission. I too have a responsibility to ensure the security and well-being of all. However, do not use this matter to get media attention, he told the JO MPs.

India has banned the keeping of elephants in zoos, because the animals show a lot of distress at being chained for so long. They have released some elephants that were in zoos into a Safari Park.
Elephants have the same sensitivities as humans.
Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. We must set an example to other Buddhist countries. There is no wisdom greater than kindness. Radiate your kindness to every living being without any discrimination, the Buddha has said.
Indian Minister Maneka Gandhi who is also an animal rights activist has appealed Sri Lanka to send the elephants in Dehiwala Zoo to the Ridiyagama Safari Park to live free.
As animal lovers of Sri Lanka, we thank Indian Minister Maneka Gandhi for her great efforts to help elephants in our country. As Buddhists and animal lovers, we always support her for her good work.

Speaking to the Daily News, Dr. Aluthge said this was a conspiracy led by several ministers to clamp down on the GMOA and spread false allegations.
This was clearly an initiative led by several ministers to suppress the GMOA in order to cover up their corruption, he said.
He said that the complainant was not disclosed, adding that GMOA would request the Commission to present the original complaint.

Distinguished connections
The Japanese Cultural Exhibition 2018 was held last week with the usual enthusiasm and turnout. Once more various Japanese crafts were featured at the exhibition. On a sad note, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma attended his last Japanese Cultural Exhibition in Sri Lanka last Saturday at the premises of the Hotel School. It was no doubt a bittersweet occasion for the distinguished ambassador who has called Sri Lanka a home for quite some time. Now he will be returning back to Japan, and as one chapter closes in his life another one opens. He will return back to Japan to start another life in another vocation.
Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma, said he is humbled and pleased to be a part of this exhibition which is being held for the third year at the hotel school.
Participating associations
This is an opportunity for all to enjoy Japanese culture. I understand much effort has been put into this event and I must congratulate the Japanese Language Teachers Association and the participating associations. I am impressed by the fact that more and more Sri Lankans are taking an interest in Japanese culture and embracing it.
As a citizen of Japan, I am tremendously pleased that all these associations which are run by Sri Lankans, are promoting Japanese culture and that they are enjoying themselves in the process. That shows how the Japanese Culture has taken root in Sri Lanka, said Suganuma.
He further stressed that the circulation and exchange of ideas through various discourses is doing a lot of good for both countries. New innovations will soon be introduced to our respective cultures through our interaction.
The interaction between our two countries will usher in a new age as the world changes. This is how cultures develop and flourish. I am very glad that this exhibition is being held again. I have been here for more than three years and I see that there is an increase in activity taking place when you think of Japanese- Sri Lankan relations.
This is not only high-level visits on both sides, we have more Japanese companies coming into Sri Lanka. We see a lot of tourists coming to Sri Lanka from Japan and I see a definite increase in arrivals. We see Sri Lankans, in turn, going into Japan for various purposes. So many exchanges are taking place, explained Suganuma.
Support and friendship
He also wished all involved great success and that his successor will soon take over from him. Suganuma said that he along with his wife have really enjoyed their stay in Sri Lanka.
People have been so nice and we have visited beautiful places in Sri Lanka. The job has been very rewarding. Thank you for all your support and friendship. As for me, I may retire from the ministry and do something else. So we are leaving for Japan soon. My successor will no doubt continue this very good tradition that we have every year, said Suganuma.
President of Japanese Language Teachers Association, Heshandrika Perera commented that diplomatic ties between Japan and Sri Lanka have existed for over 60 years.
This annual event  the Japanese Cultural Exhibition, is organized by the Embassy of Japan in association with the Japanese Language Teachers Association of Sri Lanka. This gives us the opportunity of strengthening our ties of love and respect that we have towards each other. We hold a special place in each others hearts. We are teachers involved in teaching the Japanese language to Sri Lankan students that enables them to communicate with the Japanese people thereby enabling them to learn more about Japan and Japanese culture, stated Perera.
Perera stated that we all know that the Japanese have preserved their culture which spans thousands of years and has seen new economic and technological changes.
This event will open ones eyes to a vibrant, proud and rich culture alive in all it wondrous ways. A culture that has mesmerized the outside world and been an inspiration, said Perera.

Dr. Lucas wins TT silver at the Asia Pacific Masters Games
Dr. Gerard Nimal Lucas was the sole medalist from Sri Lanka at the Asia Pacific Masters Games held in Penang, Malaysia from September 8 to 15. He won a silver medal in the over 75 TT mens singles.
Thirteen veteran table tennis players from Sri Lanka (11 men, 2 women) participated in the Asia Pacific Masters Games. In the Over 50 mens team event, the Butterfly team comprising Lalith Priyantha (Captain), Mohamed Ilmi and Nihal Perera were the losing semi-finalists. In the Over 75 mens singles event, Dr. Nimal Lucas beat Heng Teng Boey, a Malaysian player in the semi-finals by 3 sets to one and lost to Yoshiaki Kadoguchi, a Japanese player in the finals in straight sets.
As the number of entries in the age categories of 30, 40 and 50 events exceeded expectations and because only 8 tables were available for the matches, the organizers of the Masters Games extended the tournament by one extra day. Since it was difficult to change the flight schedules and accommodation, Dr. Lucas (partner Mohamed Laffeer) was deprived of playing in the Over 70 Mens doubles and the Over 70 mens team event.

Memorial lecture
Dudley  Senanayakes vision for freedom
The words progressive and reactionary are being bandied about on the floor of this House. What is the criterion by which a measure is judged progressive or reactionary Surely any measure that increases the content of individual freedom of persons, be it economic, social, cultural or otherwise, is a progressive measure, and any measure that tends to diminish or inhibit that freedom is reactionary. As there cannot be freedom without economic wellbeing, there cannot be real freedom without political and individual freedom as well.
 Dudley Senanayake
Dudley Senanayake, three times Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, is considered one of the nations most eminent liberal thinkers of the 20th century.
He was a man who came from wealth, accumulated from graphite mining and coconut plantations, and is said to have been a talented sportsman and a gifted student in school. He had his tertiary education in Cambridge, England, and earned his Barristers before returning to Ceylon in 1935. He was briefly an advocate in the Supreme Court, and then his father, D.S. Senanayake pressured him into joining politics.
While his father was Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake served in the Cabinet as Agriculture and Lands Minister. For several years, he developed Sri Lankas irrigation infrastructure and agricultural capacity. In his first year, Dudley Senanayake began the Gal Oya Project, which would eventually make some 120,000 acres of land arable.
After his father died unexpectedly in 1952, Dudley Senanayake was chosen as the new Prime Minister. The younger Senanayake was said to be reluctant to take on this prestigious position. His acquiescence, however, did not last for long: the next year, the price of rice rose, and subsidies were cut, creating wide dissatisfaction with the UNP. In 1953, Senanayake resigned, due to health reasons, or, as some speculate, out of grief for the deaths that were caused by the hartal that year. This was one of two shorter terms that Senanayake served as Sri Lankas Prime Minister.
Senanayake re-entered the political fray during the tumultuous years during and after the assassination of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1959. A general election was called in March 1960, after which Senanayake held his second term as Prime Minister, serving for only four months.
Senanayake became the Opposition Leader in Sri Lankas Parliament, embroiled in a duel with Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, whose political inclinations bent towards the elimination of individual freedoms. Senanayake advocated ardently for more liberal ideologies, and against Bandaranaikes curbs to press freedom, for example. Dudley Senanayakes nephew, Rukman Senanayake, once told the Daily News that media institutions were completely a private entity back then. Politicians never influenced journalists. But they maintained a good relationship. Rukman Senanayake recalled that journalists used to meet Dudley Senanayake when he was Prime Minister, over breakfasts at the family home, Woodlands. Though politicians and journalists met, his nephew said, they were still given the freedom to report with impartiality.
Dudley Senanayake maintained the position of Opposition Leader until 1965, when he was able to form a government following that years elections. He served his longest term as Prime Minister between March 1965 and May 1970. During his final tenure as Prime Minister, one act which leads history to view Dudley Senanayake as tolerant was elevating the Tamil language to official status in the Tamil-speaking areas. This came after S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike replaced English with Sinhala as the official language of Sri Lanka. Dudley Senanayake did so against the wishes and grumblings of his own party, and, calling for an end to ethnic animosities, he said, I will not barter the rights of any community for the glory of political office.
He established universities and colleges, implemented educational reforms, and even established the Poya holiday in Sri Lanka. Today, Sri Lankans view Dudley Senanayake (a life-long bachelor) as a man who devoted the majority of his life to the development and betterment of his country. Each year, in commemoration of the service he rendered to the nation, Dudley Senanayake is remembered by a memorial lecture.
Global legacy
The speaker at this years memorial lecture highlighted the global reach that Dudley Senanayake had, and positioned him within the hallowed halls of some of the worlds greatest political leaders. Gordon Mackay, a former member of the South African Parliament, the current Acting Secretary of Liberal International, and, oddly enough, a self-proclaimed neutral liberal was an interesting choice to deliver the lecture.
Mackay was born in 1981, at the height of the final chapter of apartheid, he said, and growing up, he was deeply sceptical of liberalism in politics. During the end of apartheid, confronted with mass state violence, Mackay described the Liberals in the South African Parliament as tepid and ineffective, conferring little faith in their abilities to citizens like himself.
Liberals at the time also retained a position of qualified franchise  something which would change by the mid 1980s  which lingered in the minds of anti-apartheid activists and would leave many natural liberals outside of liberal politics, said Mackay.
Mackay described the inadequacy of liberalism as it existed during apartheid, and the necessity of innovative activists to expand its definitions to bring about South Africas peace negotiations, which took place in the early 1990s and in 1994, South Africa held its first multiracial elections to select a president. Much of this, said Mackay, was brought about through the engagement and expansion of liberalism by a pivotal activist, as well as a contemporary of Dudley Senanayake Nelson Mandela.
Mandela, said Mackay, like Dudley Senanayake, had a deep commitment to justice and fair play; an unwavering belief in democracy, the rule of law and freedom of speech, and, a deep desire to achieve ethnic amity.
During this time, Mackay spent a year in Switzerland, where he was introduced to Dudley Senanayake through a series of lectures offered by graduate students on global liberal thinkers.
What grabbed my attention about Dudley Senanayake, he said, was a statement made by him during the Throne speech on April 22, 1960. Mackay said that the speech impacted him enormously, and even came to define my own personal brand and belief in liberalism.
The section of Dudley Senanayakes speech Mackay quoted was the following:
The words progressive and reactionary are being bandied about on the floor of this House. What is the criterion by which a measure is judged progressive or reactionary Surely any measure that increases the content of individual freedom of persons, be it economic, social, cultural or otherwise, is a progressive measure, and any measure that tends to diminish or inhibit that freedom is reactionary. As there cannot be freedom without economic wellbeing, there cannot be real freedom without political and individual freedom as well.
It is this last line that would later be articulated by my party in the Democratic Alliance, said Mackay, that would make it possible for me to finally commit fully to liberalism and the pursuit of liberal values.
You see, he continued, Dudley Senanayake was articulating what many liberals still today fail to grasp: that freedom is not true freedom unless the individual has the wherewithal to use that freedom to attain self-actualisation and live the life he wants to live, free from the severe constraints of poverty.
Mackay spent the majority of the rest of his speech describing the pursuit of liberalism through economic empowerment. He talked about European economic outlooks, the trends of capitalism towards severe economic disparity, and also the failure of liberal leadership to provide new and relevant ideas to bring forth political liberalism into this era.
Sadly, he said, in an age when we have need of intellectual giants and leaders of deep integrity, we are burdened with small-minded, self-interested and petty leadership, epitomised by Donald Trump in the US, but reflected in leaders around the globe, including Duterte in the Philippines, Erdogan in Turkey, and Orban in Hungary, with the ever-increasing illiberal governments in China and Russia, which could easily make liberals despondent.
Mackay seemed to revive the former part of Dudley Senanayakes quote that emphasised the importance of social and cultural freedoms to the individuals freedom as well.
We have a plethora of honest and honourable leaders to whom we can look to as guiding lights. Dudley Senanayake is just such a leader.
This years 18th Annual Dudley Senanayake Memorial Lecture was not a call for a return to an age with leaders people now recognise as honourable. Rather, it was a call for current leaders to borrow their ingenuity, and their unchallenged integrity, as Mackay put it. And furthermore, rather than concede and compromise liberal values to appeal to people who think differently, Mackay called upon leaders to recommit, unambiguously, to liberal values.
While the best liberals have always been pragmatic, he said, we must not let our pragmatism undermine our fierce commitment to the sanctity of the individual, and the creation of an equal society, in which all people can reach their full potential.
Mackay quoted Senanayake again, proving to the audience Senanayakes relevance today to reaffirm liberal values: The greatest feats of man have been the achievements of a free and unfettered mind. And, under a totalitarian form of government, with all that it implies, with all its ramifications, the mind of a man can never be free.

Enterprise Sri Lanka to challenge entitlement culture - Eran
State Minister of Finance and Mass Media Eran Wickramaratne said Sri Lanka has a deeply entrenched entitlement culture which works against the entrepreneurial culture.
He said rationale for introducing Rs 60 billion Enterprise Sri Lanka program was to challenge that entitlement culture in Sri Lanka.
He was speaking at a pre-budget seminar organised by Business Economics Faculty of University of Jayewardenepura under the theme, Striving for Export Competitiveness.
The event was held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo on Monday.
Insisting the need to create a new breed of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, Minister said Sri Lanka accounts for mere two percent or 230,000 entrepreneurs, out of the total working population where as total number of entrepreneurs in Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh and China accounts for 19 percent, 22 percent, 11 percent and 7.5 percent respectively, compared to their total working population.
He said further the speedy implementation of public sector reforms is vital to take the country to the next level. In addition he said it is also pertinent to take necessary steps to iron out prevalent systematic corruption at all levels of the public sector.
The present system is bringing some level of accountability, but we need to see that extend a lot more for the public sector as a whole, not only for politicians, he said.
On the revenue generation front, 80 percent of all the revenue in Sri Lanka comes from three institutions which include Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs and Department of Excise.
Other 20 percent comes from another 300 institutions. We have to get these institutions working in the most efficient way. There are no questions about it. Otherwise we cant run this country, he said.
Service levels at these institutions are unacceptable. We believe it is the customer who must speak for the service. We have to follow a customer centric focus when it comes to delivering government services to the general public, he said.
Speaking on existing and proposed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), he said FTAs are basically creating an environment for Sri Lanka to establish much needed business links with the rest of the world.
The Minister however accepted that Sri Lanka is generally weak on the implementation part of FTAs.
He said the Sri Lanka Pakistan FTA hasnt really materialized on the ground.
Despite the fact that many people criticize the Indo Lanka FTA, Sri Lanka has benefitted a lot under this FTA, he said

Ever controversial, Maradona makes  winning debut in Mexico
Culiacn, Tuesday: Controversial and combative as ever, Diego Maradona made his Mexican coaching debut Monday with a 4-1 win for his new club, the second-division side Dorados.
It could hardly have been otherwise in the country that saw the Argentine legend score his infamous hand of God goal as he led his country to the 1986 World Cup title.
Alternately grinning and defensive, Maradona thumbed his nose at his critics after Ecuadoran forward Vinicio Angulo scored a hat trick to give Dorados the win over Cafeteleros of Tapachula.
Some people said Maradonas useless. There were a lot of stupid people going on television to fill up the time, Maradona told a packed post-match press conference in Culiacan, Sinaloa, his new clubs home base.
I hope theyll come to the pitch now and look at my record and see what were actually doing, see that I know how to do this.
Maradona, 57, vowed it was just the beginning for the struggling club, who leapt from 13th place in their 15-team league to 10th with the win over last-place Cafeteleros.
But not all Dorados fans are convinced.
Maradona arrived to a heros welcome last week, but has also been the butt of more than a few jokes about why someone who has battled publicly with drug addiction might take a job in the heart of Mexican drug cartel country.
Im not expecting much. Maradona has never shown himself to be a good coach. I think there are better coaches than him in Mexico, said Kevin Juarez, a 26-year-old fan, ahead of the match.
The one good thing is that Maradonas arrival has drawn the worlds attention to Dorados, he told AFP.
Maradona once coached the Argentine national team, including at the 2010 World Cup, but the rest of his managerial career has lacked the sparkle of his playing days.
Other fans in Sinaloa are more optimistic.
With Maradonas help, this club can gain a little character and get promoted, said fellow fan Hector Cuen, 40.
I cant see anything bad in Maradona coming to Culiacan.
Even El Diego only managed to fill Doradoss 20,000-seat stadium to about half capacity -- though that was still more than double the average attendance at the clubs most recent home matches. AFP

Exploring  the endless  opportunities
Composure and professionalism are key to her success as a leader. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl of Ilma International Girls School Maryam Mubeen, who believes in making a difference by accepting others and believing in them.
Mubeen points out that self-belief can make a difference in anyones life, opening up so many avenues.
Young people today need a role model who has managed to achieve his or her aspirations in spite of adversities. For example Khaled Hosseini migrated to the US as an Afghan Refugee at the age of 15, knowing no English at all, several years later while practising medicine, he released his first best- selling novel, Kite Runner and today he is an author of four books, what we understand is there are no limits to what someone can achieve, because the possibilities are endless, said Mubeen.
Smooth connection
Mubeen and her fellow prefects are thoroughly professional. On duty, it is all about work. Off duty, they are just friends.
My secret to success is my coordination with my board of prefects and the guidance of family teachers and seniors. With each person on my board I have a smooth connection, so we share opinions very freely, duty is professional but off duty, we are great friends. And that I believe prevents a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunications that could occur, explains Mubeen.
Mubeen points out that her school brought her out of her shell. This was inevitable when responsibility was placed in her. She had to rise to the occasion.
Looking back on time, I see myself as socially anxious and introverted. Over a year ago when I became house captain I had to break free of my shell, a hundred new people with a hundred new viewpoints and a hundred mistakes to learn from. Change is inevitable and today all credit goes to my school for making me an independent, confident and sociable person. I am who I am today because of my school, said Mubeen.
Being ethical is a quality she values highly. It wins you friends and supporters because they trust you.
Gender equality
As a Muslim, the leader I admire is Prophet Mohammed, for his humility, courage and support of gender equality. Being ethical is what is important and that makes people want to work with you, and that gives way to success, said Mubeen.
Mubeen feels we must break out of cultural restraints and women, in particular, must realize their potential.
I want to change the way the world sees women. Today in most developing countries, women do not have the means to educate themselves, nor do they have a proper solid profession in most developing countries. This is because of cultural restraints mainly, so by taking the initiative, I want to inspire all the women to unleash their potential, and discover their skills and become leaders in society, points out Mubeen.
Mubeen has so many dreams such as being a Marine Biologist, Gynaecologist and a UN Activist. Her talent and hard work no doubt will help her achieve her dreams.
I have many dreams. Being a marine biologist is one, being a Gynaecologist is another. The former because of my passion for oceanic studies, the latter because I want to also serve my community. I want to make a difference in the world. I want, to inspire women to do something for themselves. To show the world that they are independent. And along with those, my other dream is to be a UN activist for peacemaking, added Mubeen.
Various hardships
There are so many people in this world who are undergoing various hardships. Most of what we take for granted in Sri Lanka they dont have. There is such suffering in the world.
The problem other people my age are facing in other parts of the world concern me. The war in Iraq and Syria, hunger in Africa and racism in America. And here in Sri Lanka, we have a bustling life in Colombo, peace in the suburbs, beauty in the borders. The difference is massive. I want to bring a change to the lives of all people, who have not seen what we see every single day, said Mubeen.
She also laid emphasis on the importance of technology saying that it is a powerful driving force in the world today.
I like exploring traditions and meeting new people. Everyone is different so the experiences are never-ending. Technology is mind-boggling. I like discovering my own skills at it because it is something that is vast and massive in the whole world and that is what is taking the world forward, stated Mubeen.
The world would be idyllic if we just accepted each other. However, this goal is not unachievable. We just need to accept others and look beyond our differences- our shared humanity.
Positive attitude
Patience and composure are key. From my own experiences, I say, if people accepted others differences there would be much fewer problems in the world, said Mubeen.
You need to think of life positively. Life will come with its challenges. You need to have a positive attitude.
De-stress by doing what you love to do. Preferably something aesthetic like travelling and painting and thinks about the good that will come in the end instead of bothering about the hurdles, stated Mubeen.
She is secure in the belief that everything in life happens for a reason and seeks advice when faced with an obstacle.
Firstly I would assess the gravity of the obstacle and decide whether the stress I feel is compatible with the weight of the obstacle. So after ruminating I would talk to my peers and get their advice because when you have everyones opinion, you can weigh out the pros and cons and decide on the solutions we need in order to overcome the obstacle. Patience and composure are key and believe that everything happens for a reason, keeps me going, stated Mubeen.

New Delhi, Tuesday: Sparks generally fly when India take on Pakistan at cricket, and Wednesday's Asia Cup clash in Dubai will be an emotionally charged fixture as always.
AFP Sport looks at five of the most memorable previous encounters, the first since Pakistan thrashed India by 180 runs in the Champions Trophy final in June 2017.
- Dark day -
On the same day the teams were playing a one-day match at Sialkot in Pakistan on October 31, 1984, the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her bodyguards in New Delhi.
Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri were piling on runs for India when the news came. Pakistan's president Zia ul Haq ordered the match stopped, and India's captain Sunil Gavaskar wanted the same.
"Obviously, we weren't in any frame of mind to carry on and, sure enough, the ODI had to be abandoned," Vengsarkar told India's Telegraph later.
"Thirty years have gone by, but it's a day one can't forget," he said.
- PM's XI -
Imran Khan's best bowling figures of 6-14 were in a one-day international against India March 22, 1985, but for the swashbuckling Pakistan fast bowler it was all in vain.
Khan ripped apart the Indian batting line-up at Sharjah in the UAE to send the opposition packing for 125. But Pakistan's own batting imploded, skittled for just 87.
Khan -- now Pakistani prime minister -- was still man of the match, however.
- A sword for a six -
The match that will always evoke the bitterest memories for India, and the sweetest ones for Pakistan, was on April 18, 1986, again an ODI in Sharjah. With Pakistan needing four off the last ball to win, India's Chetan Sharma ran in and bowled a full toss -- which Javed Miandad swatted for six.
Miandad, who was presented with a golden sword, became a national hero, while Sharma faced barbs and insults on his return home.
- Tendulkar's tears -
A century from Sachin Tendulkar, India's most celebrated batsman, was usually a recipe for success in the 1990s and 2000s but not in the 1999 Test match against Pakistan in Chennai.
Chasing 271 for victory, Tendulkar brought India close with a sparkling 136, but Pakistani off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq got him out and India eventually lost by 12 runs.
A sporting Indian home crowd gave the Wasim Akram-led side a standing ovation, but Tendulkar was heartbroken.
Weeping in the dressing room, according to then-coach Anshuman Gaekwad, the "little master" refused to come out of the dressing room to receive his man of the match award.
- Misbah's mishit -
An India-Pakistan final in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup and a sell-out crowd in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2007 was a perfect setting for cricket's newest format.
Pakistan's Misbah ul Haq was on the cusp of taking his team to a memorable win with his gritty batting in a chase of 158.
But then came a moment of madness as Haq tried to play an audacious paddle shot to seal victory against paceman Joginder Sharma in the final over.
The ball went high into the waiting hands of Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India celebrated like never before as Haq missed a chance of a lifetime. AFP

Goethe for today
The great German poet, novelist, playwright, scientist and thinker, Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749  1832) is regarded as the giant of world literature. It is accepted this celebrated work Faust is the play translated into most languages placing no second count to Shakespeare. His was an entire life dedicated to writing simple lyrics, maxims and reflections to lengthy ballads and volumes of narratives and notes linked to aesthetics, literature and philosophy.
As noted by Stephen Spender in his work titled Great Writings of Goethe (A Mentor Book), Goethe is sometimes described as the last man to have the qualities of a Renaissance genius. He certainly has claims to be universal. As Spender further notes, he is a poet who could  to the credit of the aristocrat who was the ruler of the little state of Weimar  be described as a poet among the princes. Besides writing Faust, the well-known play, he was a statesman, administrator, scholar and scientist. The simple and profound works show a sense of humanism that has deep roots in oriental religions.
Surface observation
Take, for instance, this simple poem titled as Found as translated from German to English by Michael Hamburger.
Once in the forest, I strolled content,
To look for nothing  my sole intent
I saw a flower shaded and shy,
Shining like starlight
Bright as an eye.
I went to pluck it, gently it said:
Must I be broken,
Wilt and be dead
Then whole I dug it, out of the loom,
And to my garden, carried it home
There to replant it,
Where no wind blows,
More bright than ever
It blooms and grows.
Commenting on the poetic vision of Goethe, the literary critic Spender states that the poem rests on several layers of meanings other than the surface observation one reads line by line. It is symbolic of the inner flowering of an individual who possesses the plant of knowledge required for existence. He notes that Goethes position as a poet happened to be a turning point in the modern poetry.
Romantic sickness
Interpreting most other poems inclusive of those found in Faust, Spender goes on to say that Goethes view of poetry is mostly what is the opposite of the common eye view. His was the opposite of that of the Romantic School. At times, as he notes opposite views converge Goethes name and creations are linked with those of other great poetic geniuses like Shakespeare and Dante. Spender also says that Goethe in his youth had experienced the Romantic sickness and learned to know it as something which brought him to the verge of suicide, despair, madness even.
The man who, looking back at his past, at the end of his life said he had never known a week in which he had not endured agony, who despite his health was subject to serious bouts of illness  lived most of his days very close to dissolution under the surface of his resolution (Spender). Goethe continuously had the habit of noting down his various types of thought in notebooks that have gone into volumes one good collection comes in the form of a book titled as Maxims and Reflections (Penguin Classics 1998) as translated and edited by Elisabeth Stopp from German sources.
The compiler professor of these maxims and reflections has assembled 1413 pieces categorised into groups that appear as culled from various known and unknown jottings of Goethe. As a reader, I found some quite modern, terse and blissful. The compilation triggers off from the following.
Favourable realisation
We enjoy looking into the future because by our secret longings we so much want to bring about a favourable realisation of the vague possibilities that move to and fro in that realm.
The next one goes as follows:
It is not easy for us to be int eh company of many people without thinking that chance, having brought together many, should also bring us our friends.
A very short maxim of Goethe goes as:
Every spoken word evokes its contrary meaning.
In Goethes Maxims and Reflections are observed two ways of creative thinkers. Goethe in his reflections embark on varied subject areas such as art, politics, aesthetics, ethics, literature and all sciences. It is said that throughout his long, hectic and various lifestyle Goethe had the habit of jotting down his passing thoughts on theatre programmes, visiting cards, draft manuscripts and even bills at a time when the term communication was never heard as a subject discipline in social sciences, Goethe defined the term as follows:
To communicate is natural, to accept what is communicated is an acquired art.
In many ways, it seems that Goethe had lived and thought beyond his time. We see the modernity in age-old stages.

Handspun harmony
Walking through the winding hallways of the BMICH last week, one would think that one was wandering through a Middle Eastern bazaar. The inauguration of Shilpa Abhimani 2018, Presidential Awards Handicrafts Competition & Exhibition had all the allure and the beauty of the East that fascinates the West. The Handicrafts were of a unique Sri Lankan identity and were the pride of Sri Lanka.
Daily News visited the inauguration that saw the attendance of many dignitaries including Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Buddhika Pathirana, Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu and Chairperson National Crafts Council Heshani Bogollagama.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, commended the craftsmen for their efforts, calling the field of crafts one of great value that has a long history in Sri Lanka.
This traditional festival showcases designs of great beauty and innovation from around the country. This is not just a competition but a carefully planned arts festival contributing to the growth of the Sri Lankan Crafts Sector. It is all about hard work. Our government is now working on a project touching on the revival of traditional textiles and womens handicrafts in North and East provinces. We are also expanding our crafts training centres under the NCC (National Crafts Council) while conducting various training courses and workshops around the country for our future craftsmen that touches on various important and timely subjects, said Bathiudeen.
He pointed out that he has no doubt that such initiatives will give our Sri Lankan Craftsman more opportunities in the future and a promising future.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Buddhika Pathirana pointed out that the National Crafts are, our historical and traditional legacy.
This has been handed down through the centuries. It goes hand in hand with our Sri Lankan Culture. Regardless of their background, these handicraftsmen carry with them this legacy I talk about. Sri Lanka and India are connected by the traditional Arts and Crafts. We also have ties with other countries in our region through the Arts and Crafts. We need to go forth into the future and at the same time preserve these handicrafts. That is the challenge which we face right now. This is the journey those in the crafts sector must take along with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The challenge is protecting our handicrafts and placing it in the hands of the coming generations to carry with them into the future. For this we must adopt a carefully studied strategy, said Pathirana.
Pathirana pointed out that if you take our arts and crafts and our heritage it cannot be measured in terms of money.
We need to protect our craftsmen from being exploited, and this is something the NCC should take very seriously. So with the leadership of our minister, we are now taking the necessary steps. We need to fully use the benefits of modern information technology. I feel we need to put our trust in media such as Facebook, regardless of the fact that some people say it is a liability. We do not stop air travel just because planes crash We need to find out how to solve the problems that FB presents. Prohibiting FB is not the answer. How do we use the advantages of FB economically We know that people access the internet and email through their smartphones. Technology is evolving! explained Pathirana.
Pathirana pointed out that in the future there will be unthinkable development and changes. The field of entertainment will be transformed in unimaginable ways and we need to keep up with the changing times.
Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu stated that Sri Lanka like India has a tradition of Handicrafts and that the handicrafts in both nations have a very long history citing the Sigiriya Frescoes and wood carvings in temples.
Our craftsmen are master craftsmen with exceptional skills. The history of Indian Handicrafts goes back to almost 5000 years. There is evidence of handicrafts from the Indus Valley Civilization. Indian handicrafts have earned a place for itself in the world. People travel hundreds of miles to view these handicrafts. Handicrafts in Sri Lanka and India tell a unique story. Each handicraft leaves a legacy. There is a niche market out there for handicrafts and products made out of organic products which are natural, and this is now growing, said Sandhu.
Sandhu pointed out that we need to innovate and grow together.
Even Gandhi promoted a handspun fabric as a symbol of freedom and self respect. He said that he was a firm believer of working with hands, and said that he saw god in every thread that he put through the spinning wheel. People to people relations are the pillar of Sri Lanka and Indias partnerships. This partnership is expanding in handicrafts. Indian Handicrafts are not unknown to Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankan creations are very popular with Indians. Hundreds of Indian tourists take beautiful Sri Lankan products back to India. Such interactions create opportunities to exchange ideas. Shilpa Abhimani is a unique event where an international platform is provided to the artisans. I congratulate NCC for conducting this event. I would like to say to the craftsmen of Sri Lanka that their hands are magic. It is their skills that ensure the continuity of tradition and the cultures, explained Sandhu.
Chairperson National Crafts Council Heshani Bogollagama commented that the aim and goal of the National Crafts Council are to preserve, develop and promote the invaluable national handicrafts sector of Sri Lanka.
Around 26,000 handicraftsmen from all parts of the island have been registered with the National Crafts Council. We understand the need to recognize these craftsmen and show the world their capabilities and talents, which is part of why we are holding Shilpa Abhimani. Our Kings of Sri Lanka recognized these craftsmen in the past and we feel that they must be recognized once more by the president of Sri Lanka. We feel our craftsmen deserve to be recognized in the highest way possible  the presidential award, said Bogollagama.
Bogollagama also commented that under the leadership of Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen along with the National Crafts Council, in the space of three years, they have found solutions to many of the problem within the industry. Along with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, many new programs were launched.
Along with the Ministry of Education, the NCC, launched Shilpa Navoda to popularize handicrafts and make it attractive amongst the youth of Sri Lanka. We the NCC is always behind our craftsmen helping them with all facets of the industry helping the economic situation of these craftsmen. We are greatly pleased to hold Shilpa Abhimani and the programs that come under it because through that we are helping these craftsmen get through their difficulties.
At the Provincial level, 1418 creations which won awards at the provincial competitions were featured national competition - The Shilpa Abhimani 2018, presidential awards competition and exhibition. Under Shilpa Navoda a very successful school handicraft competition was conducted last year. Because of this success, a special handicraft training workshop for school children was launched. Over 10,000 school children were trained in the handicrafts to ensure the next generation takes this forward, explained Bogollagama.
Bogollagama also pointed out that uplifting the livelihoods of these poor craftsmen and helping them to solve the problems they face with the modern market is part of the mandate of NCC.
This year Shilpa Abhimani 2018, saw a record number of over 8000 crafts, brought forward by over 4000 craftsmen to participate in this competition. We are grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena for giving us the opportunity to hold a presidential award winning the competition and give the highest felicitation for our craftsmen, stated Bogollagama.
Bogollagama thanked Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu for the help rendered by the Indian Government to the NCC in the field of Sri Lankan Handicrafts. The Indian Cultural Center has always assisted the NCC in all national events hosted by the NCC.
We are grateful for the Indian High Commission who funded Rs. 20 million, to establish a marketing village in Hambantota for our rural craftsmen. This will be opened to the public later this year, said Bogollagama.
The craftsmen at BMICH were from all parts of the island including Mannarama and Moneragala, with trade stalls selling products made out of Thal Kola. Batik, Lace, embroidery, pillow cases, patchwork, silver jewellery, brassware, lacquer, clay ornamentals, musical instruments, Dumbara designs, reed and grass creations, cane and bamboo products, masks, handlooms and wood carvings, products made out of red clay and terracotta and pendants were at the stalls. Some craftsmen had been at the previous Shilpa Abhimani events, making a comeback.
The environmental friendly natural products that were on offer at the stalls are an option to plastic and polythene usage and other artificial products. The products on offer were at a very cheap price when compared to how much it would cost at a shop in Colombo. There is a major discount when compared to a boutique in Colombo. The craftsmen could also sell their products directly to the customers.
The first stage saw the workshops, conducted around the country in all 25 districts, where there was a participation of senior lecturers from Moratuwa University and the University of Visual Arts, featuring awareness programs, where the craftsman was made aware about new trends. The second stage was the provincial competition that was completed before the national competition and exhibition which took place from the September 12- 16, at the BMICH - That is the national competition - the Shilpa Abhimani presidential awards competition and exhibition and the international crafts festival.

Tamil Short Story in English Transcreation
Journey to remember
This is a Tamil short story taken from a collection titled Eelaththu Ulaviyat Sirukathaikal (Lankan Psychological Short Stories) compiled by K S Sivakumaran. Written in 1960 and published in the Thinakaran Vaara Manjari, it is titled Inam Inaththudan (Birds of a feather flock together). The rendition in English is as follows:
The Batticaloa mail train driven with a Diesel engine from Colombo Fort reached the Gal Oya railway junction passing through the western, north western, and north central provinces.
Its past midnight now. Shortly a coal engine driven train will leave for the eastern capital Batticaloa (Maddakkalappu).
I am seated in a fully packed third class compartment. The passengers are mainly workers employed in the Gal Oya Scheme and Ampaara.
There is a whistle, and visibly a greenlight and the locomotive slowly moves.
As the train is speeding a little a young man comes running and gets into our compartment. He is wearing a long sleeve shirt and pants to match. Between his lips an Ardath cigarette lies as he carries his luggage with slight uneasiness.
He has his hair combed well and looks smart and steady. He sits opposite my seat while I light a cigarette.
I begin to continue reading the novel of Alberto Moravia.
Hkkum  a light cough. I look at the direction where the faint noise comes. It is the new passenger He looks at me sharp without lifting an eye lid. For a moment I am disturbed and finds difficult to manage myself. I have seen his face somewhere before. A brief twirling of his lips with a faint smile ran through. I try to smile back. But I know its not a natural one. Only a cultivated false smile.
Since I live in Colombo, how can I show my 32 teeth to an unknown man and degrade myself
A cool wind blows through the widows. The speed of the train was disgusting- a slow coach. The worst train service is the eastern line only.
I dislike the speed of the train. This Gal Oya- Batticaloa line the slowest coach run by the CGR. The speed of the Diesel engine is much faster than the coal run engine.
I am interested in finish reading the erotic novel by Alberto Moravia but my attention is now turned on the guy sitting opposite me.
Although I want to speak with him but my false middle-class pride prevents me from doing so. I close the book, the window too and crush the cigarette butt under my shoes.
I am whistling La Paloma, the Lain number featured in a Thamil film too, and look at him as if he is a non-entity.
His lips are twirling as if he wants to say something.
Look friend you have grown big now. Are you in Colombo now Cant you recognize me I am Sellathurai,, he drags his name.
The sudden voice of his seem familiar to me. Even his face slightly reminds me of someone I knew long years ago. But I cant recall where I have met him.
We were classmates at the Aanaipanthy School, no You have forgotten me I suppose. You are Sivakumar, right
Yes, Yes, its only now I can remember. What are you doing now
I am in Trinco, Chum. I work for a shipping company there. Going to my place now. Came in the Trinco train and boarded this train at Gal Oya station. Are you studying or working
I am still studying
Good. Unlike me disturbing my studies. Good and pride for us you are studying and becoming a big man.
O K. Whats special these days in Batti town Are there any developments there I am going there after six years
He seems to be astonished that I am speaking good Thamil instead of the Batticaloa dialect. He may even dislike me for that.
But for me I can speak English fluently. In Thamil, unless I speak in grammatical Thamil, I find it difficult to speak colloquial Thamil. It may be due to my Colombo atmosphere and the people I associate with. Although this youth wears western style clothes, yet he speaks with me in Thami and that too in Maddakkalppu Thamil. Its many years since I have heard the East Lanka variety of dialects. So, I want him to speak more and more using those dialects.
He lights a cigarette and calls me, Come will you, lets have a glass of beer. Its nice to have it in the chilly night. We can sit in the Buffet and chat
No, please, I dont take alcohol. Thanks.
Surprising! Living in Colombo, doesnt take drinks. Beer is good for the body
Maybe. But I have some principles I follow
There is a sudden change in his face. He must be realizing that he should speak with me with some respect. He doesnt seem to be much educated. I wonder if has passed his SSC even. He works in a company wearing trousers and shirts. My mind thinks like this. No end to pomposity and showiness.
Perhaps, most of the youth in Maddakalappu are like this. He maybe just an example like a morsel of rice in a boiled pot of rice. Anyhow I must go there and see for myself.
So, when are you returning to Colombo he asks me.
I really dont know, I maybe there for a week in the town. O K. Are there any changes in the town, I reminded him.
What change! Its the same like before. Why, arent you going to see it yourself and stopped the conversation. He doesnt want to talk further. Me too did not want to bother him anymore.
The Restaurant car boy came shouting Koppi Koppi. . I call him buy a cup of Coffee to Sellathurai. But he refuses to accept the coffee. Perhaps he too has his genuine pride. I buy one for me, its not coffee but hot water mixed with sprinkling of some dust in the name of coffee.

LB Finance to curb deforestation
The islands trailblazer in end-to-end offerings for financial services, LB
Finance PLC initiated and launched Thuru Wawamu a project to curb deforestation in Sri Lanka, which will be steered by the companys CSR committee. The Thuru Wawamu initiative seeks to plant 50,000 saplings by 2021, marking the companys 50th anniversary and long-established desire to protect the countrys natural resources and indigenous wildlife.
The company also partnered with a one-of-a-kind Mobile App Thuru to drive the engagement extending it to the public masses.
LB Finance representatives will facilitate the project and conduct awareness drives at schools, national parks and public spaces across the country while encouraging citizens to plant a sapling and adopt a tree, deepening their awareness, understanding and appreciation of the environmentwith renowned actor Sathischandra Edirisinghe stepping in as Brand Ambassador.
According to the World Bank, the forest cover of Sri Lanka has decreased from 36 to 29 percent in the last 28 years. By the same token, conservationists say that up to 80 percent of Earths land animals and plants live in forests, and many of them cannot survive deforestationequally important, meteorologists say that deforestation is one of the main causes of the current global warming trend.
The Mobile App, Thuru which LB Finance has partnered with, is currently available on Google Play and Apple Store. Users that download the app can register the saplings they plant and upload pictures of them over time, to the excitement of environmentalists worldwide. As an incentive, LB Finance will offer users a bonus interest through the LB Yasaisuru fixed deposit accounts. The company recently announced that around 5,000 saplings had been planted in
Amapara, Galle, Trincomalee, Moragahakanda, Matara, Colombo, Kottawa also with the support of the staff members of LB Finance.
Commenting on this distinct initiative, LB Finance Managing Director Sumith Adhihetty said, By integrating sustainability principles within our business strategy, we are ensuring that the needs of our environment are met alongside the requests of our customers. Planting trees is one of the easiest and most sustainable ways to positively affect our environment. Trees improve air quality by producing oxygen. They also store carbon, offsetting harmful by products of fossil-fuel burning. We hope that this project will inspire others to preserve our
natural heritage. As a responsible corporate we look forward in creating better life standards for future generations and thereby have identified that a healthy environment is crucial in creating such standards. In view of this, the management of LB Finance together with the companys CSR team has taken steps to carry out this Mission Thuru Wawamu, 50 50Thousand project and for it to be completed with 50,000 trees at the time of celebrating the companys 50th anniversary in 2021.
The tree-planting project reflects LB Finances strong commitment to corporate social responsibility. Recently , the company developed 126 pre schools and sponsored school equipment for some visually impaired students in Sri Lanka. The finance giant has also invested in a water purification site for Bishop Edmund Peiris College in Chilaw and is currently constructing a drug rehabilitation center in Galle.
The future will not only be marked by our ability to evolve and adapt to change, said the Management and the CSR Committee Members of LB Finance, Thanks to initiatives like Thuru Wawamu that will help inspire a new generation of Sri Lankans to take conservation seriously. Among the technologies that will save the environment, electric cars and bio-fuels are not the only ones that play a special role.
We at LB Finance are dedicated and committed towards environment sustainability and will ensure more than 50,000 trees are gifted to the nation when celebrating our Golden Jubilee.

Mahanayakes seek Govt. intervention to defeat divisive forces
The Mahanayakes of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters yesterday called for the governments intervention to defeat nefarious forces trying to destabilise the country by creating disputes among the Buddhist community.
Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter Most Ven.Thibottuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera and Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most.Ven. Warakagdoa Sri Gnanarathana Thera in a letter to the President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said various forces are in operation in the country to create division within the Buddhist community with an ulterior motive of destabilising the nation.
The letter said that laymen and those clad in robes are in the process of spreading myths by distorting the Tripitaka Dhamma.
Several laymen and monks are engaged in activities which are against the Dhamma and Vinaya (Buddhist doctorine and Discipline) by using subtle manoeuvres to distort the Sacred Dhamma by giving various interpretations, the Mahanayake Theras stated in their letter to the President and the Prime Minister said.
The Mahanayake Theras said that as the government is bound to protect and promote the Buddishsm as per Article 09 of the Constitution, action has to be taken against these nihilists without delay.
The Mahanayakes also said that the government should declare the Buddha Jayanthi Thripitaka Ganthraya prepared by the Tripitaka Grantha Sampadaka Mandalaya as Sacred State property and legal provision should be brought to protect them.
The letter was issued yesterday under the hands of the Mahanayakes of Asgiriya and Malwatte chapters following a lengthy discussion over the issue with the Karaka Sangha Sabha members of both Chapters and Pirivenadhpathis of the Vidyalankara and Vidyodaya Privienas at the Malwattu Maha Viharaya yesterday.
Four monks who were acting against the Dhamma and Vinaya by distorting Budhist teachings were summoned to the Malwatte Maha Viharaya. The members of the Karaka Sangha Sabha of both Chapters told them that they had involved in distorting Dhamma.
The members of the Karaka Sangha Sabha of both Chapters warned them not to indulge in such activities in the future. They were also informed to remove their sermons posted on social media forthwith.
These monks promised the Mahanayake Theras that they would not get involved in any activity that would harm the prestine Dhamma. Lekakadhikari of the Malwattte Chapter Ven.Pahamunu Sumangala Thera said that they would be expelled from the Sasana, if they get involved in such activities again.

About 72 percent of the work on the last phase of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is complete and is on track to be completed by June, 2019, OCH Phase III RDA Project Director N. K. L. Netthikumara said.
He said the third and last phase of the OCH (OCH-3) from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya extending 9.63 kilometers, is a four-lane expressway with two interchanges (Kaduwela and Kadawatha) including toll plazas and facilities.
Three viaducts over 6.3 kilometers in length are being constructed over Muturajawela wetland, Ragama and Kadawatha, close to the starting point of the proposed Colombo-Kandy Central Expressway.
Once the third section from Kaduwela to Kerawalapitiya is complete, the OCH will link the Southern Expressway and Colombo Katunayake Expressway. It will then act as a link between North and South, bypassing the inner city area, thereby easing traffic in the city, he said.
The second phase of the Outer Circular Highway from Kaduwela to Kadawatha opened in September 2015 while the first phase from Kottawa to Kaduwela opened in March 2014. The third stage of the project is implemented by the Road Development Authority under the supervision of the Highways and Road Development Ministry with financial support from the Chinese government.

Presidential Commission probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan Airlines
Over USD 100 million obtained  by SriLankan not settled - Witness
Four loans amounting to over USD 100 million obtained from the Peoples Bank by SriLankan Airlines (SLA) since 2015 have not been settled so far, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into alleged malpractices at Sri Lankan Airlines, Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd and SriLankan Catering learnt on Monday.
Three loans amounting to USD 100 million and one loan of Rs.13.35 billion had been obtained by the company in 2015, 2016, and 2017 on different purposes, including settling the fuel cost for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.
Assistant General Manager (Corporative Banking) of Peoples Bank Kumari Nayana Senaratne testified before the Commission yesterday.
SriLankan Airlines was incurring heavy losses since 2008 after the management of the company was taken over by the then government from the Emirates Management. These losses resulted in the company having to face many problems, including a financial crisis.
In such a situation,in July 2015, the company had asked for a Term Loan of Rs.13.35 billion from the Peoples Bank citing that it was in a need of money to settle the cost for fuel owed to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.
The bank, on the approval of its Board of Directors had issued this loan to the CPC as requested by SriLankan Airlines on a Letter of Comfort (LoC) which expired on March 31, 2016 issued by the Central Bank (CBSL) as a security. However, the company had been failed to repay this loan amount by the date of expiry of the LoC. Later, the CBSL on a claim lodged by the bank had extended the validity period of the LoC time by time till December 31, 2018 due the continuous failure of SriLankan Airlines on the repayment. However, the Commission came to know that although, at least one cent of the capital payment had not been settled, the company had paid Rs.3.9 Billion as the interest for this loan amount by January 31, 2018. The Peoples Bank however, told the Commission that this loan is not yet considered as a non-performing loan.
The second loan amount of USD 32.5 million had been issued by the bank to SriLankan Airlines on two letters of request issued by the General Treasury and the Prime Ministers Office as per a discussion held with the Treasury Secretary in April 2016 for the Restructuring of SriLankan Airlines, including the payment of compensation for the cancellation of the lease agreement on A350 airbuses. This loan had been issued by the Peoples Bank in the same month on the approval of its Board of Directors on a LoC valid till April 30, 2017. The validity period of this LoC had to be extended time by time till December 31, 2018 due to the non-payment of the loan. By January 31, this year SriLankan Airlines had been able to settle an amount of USD 3.10 Million as the interest.
The third loan of USD 42.5 million was issued by the bank in August 2016 on a request made by the then CEO Suren Ratwatte for Working Capital. This was also issued by the bank on a LoC valid till October 7, 2017 as security and the validity period of the LoC too had been extended time by time on the failure of the repayment by the company. However, an amount of USD 3.25 Million had been paid as the interest by the company by January 31, 2018. SriLankan Airlines again on March 7, 2017 via a letter had requested an amount of USD 25 million as a loan from the Peoples Bank to recover the loss it faced due to the closure of the BIA runway. In the same way, the LoC issued as a security for this loan too had been extended due to the failure of repayment. The amount of interest had been paid for this loan by the end of January this year is USD 1.18 million.
However, on the inquiry of the Commission, the Assistant General Manager was of the view that these loans will be settled by SriLankan Airlines as there is an involvement of the Treasury with these deals.

Currency depreciation against US Dollar, common experience faced by many countries:PM
Currency depreciation against the US Dollar is a common experience faced by many countries including India and Pakistan, in recent times, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The PM made this observation in Parliament yesterday, in reply to concerns by the Joint Opposition that the Sri Lankan Rupee had hit a record low against the US Dollar.
The US Dollar had gained strength in recent weeks, while the value of many currencies have depreciated as a result. The prices of goods had gone up in many countries. We can facilitate a separate debate on the issue if the Opposition requests, the PM said.
The PM, replying to concerns by JO MP Bandula Gunawardena that one dollar was Rs 167.15 as at yesterday and that it impacts the countrys oil importation costs, said the Government has to tackle the problems created by global trends. He added that the benefits as well as disadvantages of fluctuations in the oil prices of the world market have to be endured.
Even though the prices of oil had dropped in the world market, the then Government did not reduce oil prices in the local market and thus gained profits. We will not do that, he added. In the meantime, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage responding to a question by UNP MP Hesha Vithanage, said the fuel prices could increase again as per the price formula, but however, observed the prices would drop by February - March next year. She also said the Cabinet yesterday, discussed that the vendors who increase the prices of goods when fuel prices increase, do not reduce the prices when fuel prices come down. She said the Ministry would take measures to address this problem.
JVP perturbed over Presidents handlingof Cashew nuts issue
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday, expressed his disappointment over the way in which President Maithripala Sirisena handled the Sri Lankan Airlines issue over low quality cashew nuts served on flights. Rathnayake said that President Sirisena seemed to have forgotten that the responsibility of the National Carrier ultimately falls on him. MP Rathnayake also observed that the bad press cost the Airlines a billion dollar loss.
The President should have summoned the Chairman of the Airlines and given directions to put a stop to the matter of concern, without announcing it publicly, MP Rathnayake pointed out.
MP Rathnayake made these observations, joining the Second Reading of the Carriage by Air Bill and the Regulations under the Civil Aviation Act. MP Rathnayaka speaking of the Bandaranaike International Airport, pointed out to Transportation and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, that the Public Hearing System in the Airport complex did not operate properly. According to Rathnayaka, the hearing system is not audible to some parts of the complex. Rathnayake also requested the government to listen to the grievances pointed out by the Immigration and Emigration officers who recently called for trade union action.
MP Rathnayake further questioned as to what inquiry or action would be taken by the Transportation and Civil Aviation Ministry in reference to serious frauds and scams reported in the BIA. He also questioned as to what action had been taken based upon the recommendations forwarded by the Weliamuna Report which inquired into the alleged frauds taken place at Sri Lankan Airlines. Rathnayake also observed that somewhat closer to Rs. 4 MN was spent for the affairs of the Weliamuna Committee.
MP Rathnayake also requested the Minister to provide information to the Parliament Oversight Committee over the process of granting permission to private domestic flight services to operate in the country. He also said that the JVP is not against granting permission to domestic airline services.

Speaker shows concern over lack of quorum
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya raising concerns over the abrupt endings of Parliament due to lack of quorum of MPs, urged all MPs to prevent recurrence of such instances in the future.
Making an announcement at the commencement of Sittings yesterday, the Speaker stressed that maintaining the quorum of 20 MPs during the sittings is a legislative responsibility of both the Government as well as the Opposition members.
You are well aware that a huge sum of public money is being spent on Parliamentary sittings each day. It is a very unfortunate trend that the legislative business including the Bills, Regulations and Resolutions have to be postponed due to lack of quorum of MPs. Therefore, I urge you to prevent similar instances as experienced in the past few weeks in the future, he noted.
New Medical Council will operate givingpriority to public welfare: Health Minister
The new Medical Council Ordinance Bill would be presented to Parliament within the next two months, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne informed the House yesterday. The new ordinance would allow the formation of a medical council that confirms to international standards, Minister Senaratne said. The new medical council shall operate giving priority to the welfare of the general public, he observed.

He pointed out that the Government Medical Officers Association is in isolation against the establishment of the said new council.
The Minister also said that a committee of three had been appointed to draft the said Bill, with the agreement of the Medical Council.
In response to a question by MP Thushara Indunil, Minister Senaratne said that the government would have the Galaha Hospital reopened after completing the renovations.
Galaha Hospital underwent serious damages during the tense situation that erupted in Galaha recently.
MP Bimal Rathnayake raises concern over SLAS exam fraud
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday, raised concerns over a fraud that had allegedly taken place at the Sri Lanka Administrative Examination. MP Rathnayaka questioned whether the government had taken a decision to cancel or suspend the results of the SLAS examination due to the alleged fraud. If yes, he demanded that the Examination Department take the responsibility of letting such a fraud take place.
59 persons were recently selected as the highest scorers in the examination. Their personal files had been brought in to the Public Administration Ministry. Meanwhile the government had said that an examination fraud had taken place.
However, there is a significant time span between the date of the examination and this allegation.
Usually, when such a fraud had been revealed, it happens immediately after the completion of an exam. But in this instant, they had even selected the best scorers when this fraud allegation had surfaced.
The government will have to give a clear answer to the public concerning this matter, MP Bimal Rathnayake further said.
India to develop PalalyAirport in Sri Lanka
Airports Authority of India to prepare detailed project report
State-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) will prepare a detailed project report for the development of the Palaly Airport in Sri Lanka.
This would be the first project for the AAI in the island nation and we are trying to get engaged with our neighbours, an AAI official said.
In a release issued on Monday, the AAI said it that had signed an agreement with the External Affairs Ministry for preparation of a Detailed Project Report for development of the Palaly Airport in Sri Lanka.
Palaly Airport is situated in Northern Sri Lanka.
The official said all technical and design aspects would be covered in the DPR, which is expected to be completed within three months time.
The AAI had developed more than 60 airports in metro and non-metro cities in India and now the AAI wishes to leverage its expertise to other countries on a larger scale, the release said.
The AAI manages more than 120 airports in different parts of the country. THE WEEK
Palaly Airport would not be sold, but handed overto SLAF for developing it:Minister de Silva
Transportation and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva denied Joint Opposition allegations that Palaly Airport would be sold to India. Instead, the Minister said that the government after much deliberation, had decided to handover the responsibility of developing the Palaly Airport to Sri Lanka Air Force. The Civil Aviation Authority together with the Ceylon Tourism Fund, had allocated Rs. 750 MN and Rs. 1,000 MN for this development project, Minister de Silva pointed out.
This government is very much concerned about the national security of the country. So, we contemplated much before deciding as to whom we would handover the responsibility of developing this airport. Following the development, Palaly Airport would be able to facilitate A320 aircraft. The airport will be able to facilitate international flights as well in the future, the Minister observed. Minister de Silva also observed that there is a high demand for an airport to facilitate private jets, which would generate a significant revenue to the country.
The Minister made these observations, while commencing the Second Reading of the Carriage by Air Bill and the Regulations under the Civil Aviation Act.
Minister de Silva said that the Ministry would develop the Ratmalana Airport, Koggala and Digana domestic airports as well. He said that they are awaiting a feasibility report for the proposed domestic airport in Bandarawela.
Minster de Silva also said that the government is to call for tenders again with reference to the second runway of the Bandaranaike International Airport. He explained that initially, the government was to come into an agreement with JAICA to develop the said runway, but was not able to support the high expenses. Hence, the government would be calling for tenders again, he said. He said the government is still conducting a study on selecting the land to construct the runway. Minister de Silva observed that the government would take all necessary steps to cause minimum impact on the people living in that area.
The Minister also said that they are to install E-Gates at the BIA, as a solution to decrease the rush at the airport gates by 60%.
In response to certain concerns raised by several JO MPs, Minister de Silva said that no type of privatization would take place concerning any domestic airport.
He also denied allegations that Sri Lanka Flight Information would be privatized.

PC hospitals to get drugs data network
The extension of the computerised drugs data network to Provincial Council maintained hospitals commenced on Monday.
Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne Senaratne said the computerised drug data network had cost around Rs. 900 million and its extension programme will be completed by mid next year.
The computer software will be extended to hospitals managed by provincial councils this year he said addressing the Provincial Health Ministers conference held at the National Blood Transfusion Centre on Monday.
There was a shortage of nearly 44 to 79 types of medicinal drugs in the country as highlighted by the media when I assumed duties as Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, he said.
The State Pharmaceuticals Corporation had destroyed a stock of outdated medicinal drugs valued at nearly Rs 350 million in 2014. The main reason for this was the unsystematic distribution network. This drug shortage was overcome in 2016 by introducing a computer software to Central Government hospitals, he said.
Dr.Senaratne said only a stock of outdated drugs worth Rs 40 million was destroyed by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) in 2017 after the introduction of this computer software.
The World Health Organisation too had identified Sri Lanka as the first country in the world to streamline the medicinal drugs distribution network by introducing a drug data network. He hoped to introduce this as a project proposal before the World Health Organisation shortly.
Dr. Senaratne said that there had been information about certain pharmacists trying to create an artificial drug shortage for political reasons. The Ministry had launched an investigation into it.
An investigation was also being carried out at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital.
The Minister also presented computers to Provincial Health Ministers and Provincial Health Services Directors at this event.

Stressing the importance of properly fulfilling duties and responsibilities, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday gave a clarification on his decision to summon the staff of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Austria, back to the country last week.
President Sirisena observed that the Ambassador and the staff will return to Sri Lanka within the next few days.
President Sirisena said that he made the decision as his communication team was not able to contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Austria for four and a half hours.
I wanted to get in touch with our Ambassador over an official matter, the President said.
My communication team attempted to contact the Embassy for four and a half hours. There are six telephone lines at the Embassy. None of the lines were answered. This embassy is concurrently accredited to four or five other countries.
If they do not answer a single telephone call coming from six telephone lines, neither the staff in the embassy nor the representatives in the other countries will receive any message.
This is the reason why I took such a decision, the President said.
President Maithripala Sirisena made these observations while addressing the International Ozone Day Celebration 2018 held at the BMICH yesterday morning.

Probing the  assassination plot
The whole episode surrounding the alleged plot hatched by the former Terrorist Investigation Division Head (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as disclosed by a Civil Society activist has raised more questions than answers. Namal Kumarage, a leading figure of an anti-corruption movement made the allegation against the TID Head in dramatic fashion last Wednesday by playing an audio recording containing what was said to be the voice of DIG de Silva discussing a detailed plan to cause harm to the lives of the President and the former Defence Secretary.
The CID on the directions of the IGP got cracking right away and commenced investigations subjecting the complainant to a 10 hour grilling after which it sought a court order to obtain the unedited footage of the media conference wherein the full recording was played to the media of the voice said to be that of the TID Head detailing the plan to harm the Head of State and the former Defence Secretary. DIG de Silva, in the meantime, had been relieved of his duties as Head of the TID and transferred to the IT Unit of the Police as is the normal procedure when a police officer is being investigated.
There appear to be many questions surrounding the whole matter. No doubt, DIG Nalaka de Silva is a hard boiled cop and the post of DIG and his appointment to Head the TID certainly had not been conferred on him lightly, but possibly after a full evaluation of his record in the Service over the years. It is thus mind boggling indeed to comprehend that such a high ranking officer in the Police Service -a DIG no less- freely discussing a plot to assassinate a Head of State, on an open, non-secure line with Namal Kumarage.
It could not have been lost on the DIG that telephone conversations can be traced to their source with the sophisticated devices now in use. He certainly could not have been unaware of the details of the investigations into the Lasantha Wickramatunga and Thajudeen murders where the sources of the mobile phone conversations between the perpetrators were ferreted out from the Service Providers and their identities established without any difficulty. The investigators must probe why the former TID Head, DIG Nalaka de Silva, a veteran Police officer, chose to throw caution to the winds and openly discuss a plot to assassinate the countrys Head of State and also who could be the hidden hand behind the plot.
It is also revealed in the telephone conversation between the DIG and Namal Kumarage that the said killings were to be carried out by the lieutenants of notorious drug lord Makandure Madush who is absconding from court, having fled the country and is conducting his criminal activities from abroad. This, in a way, reveals the extent of Madushs reach as allegedly estimated by a senior police officer since President Sirisena is provided with the maximum security for a Head of State. It was further buttressed following the discovery of a pistol with live ammunition that was found in the possession of a security guard of MP Namal Rajapaksa at close range of the President during a function attended by the latter during the early days of his Presidency. Similarly, the former Defence Secretary, a prime LTTE target at one time, too is protected by a massive security cordon which has been augmented on several occasions. Under ordinary circumstances, one can hardly fathom as to how a group of criminals can penetrate such a security wall in the case of the President and the former Defence Secretary. But if a senior police officer apparently thinks that Madushs group can break even such a tight security cordon, it must be investigated thoroughly. Madush is already known to organise contracts from his overseas base, so the Police must investigate whether it is within the realm of possibility that he can target a Head of State.
The Police must also probe why DIG Nalaka de Silva openly discussed a plot to harm the lives of the President and former Defence Secretary with such nonchalance over the telephone knowing very well that the plan is likely to be exposed. The other aspect that should be probed is whether the plot is an attempt to gain political mileage by certain interested parties. The CID would do well to consider all the angles in their investigations including the possibility of political interests trying to advance their hidden agendas. A full probe into the background and antecedents of the so called Civil Society activist too should be brought into the equation. How a movement which has apparently dedicated itself to fight corruption gets embroiled in an assassination plot too should be looked into. There appear to be missing pieces in this whole jigsaw and the police must leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of this sordid episode.

The role of  expressions  in Indian  classical dances
The role of expression and interpretation of the meaning of verses in dance are popularly known as Abhinaya in Indian cultural dances. Abhinaya plays a major role in certain Indian classical dance forms. It is one of the most outstanding features and factor among the Indian classical dances. Abhinaya means the interpretation of songs through hand gestures and facial expressions. The dancer expresses and expounds the Manotharma of the songs through Bhavas (interpretation emotions) and Rasas. The essence of Abhinaya is called Bhavas and the substance of Brava is called Rasas. The concept of Bhava can be seen not only in dance but also one can feel it in the way of singing in the vocal music.
In the olden days, the hereditary members of the Isai Vellala families preserved the Bhavas and Rasas in dance and music. Through Abhinaya the dancer reaches the hearts of the audience. In music, this is done through Raga or the tone. By the way of singing the musician reaches the hearts of the people.
The ability in expressing Abhinaya (Bhavas and Rasas) differs from person to person. Abhinayas were referred to by Adiyarku Nallar the commentator of Sillapathikaramas Molliya Moli which means language without language only through expressions. Through Abhinaya the people all over the world are linked together. Handling Abhinaya totally depends on the dedication, experience and involvements in the art. In Indian classical dances, as compared to Nirthya, the way of performing pure Nirtha is more technical and mechanical, mainly in the execution of Adavus and poses.
In Nirthya the personal ability, imaginative creativity and experience play a major role. Ancient temple dance Sadir (the earlier form of Bharatha Natyam) danced by Nautch dancers used various subtle movements in dance with lip movements, eye and eyebrow movements. The Nautch dancers were called Devadasis. Their way of interpretation of songs was direct. Each Indian classical dance has its own unique style and standard.
Most of the dances were solo performances but with the passage of time, all the dances were performed as group dances. Bharatha Natyam, Mohini Attam, Kuchipudi, Odissi and Kathakali are still performed as individual dances. Many present-day Bharatha Natyam dancers study Abhinayas from Kuchipudi, Kathakali and Bhgavatha Mela artistes. During the pre-Indian Independence period, all the above dance forms were only male dance forms.
Abhinayas of Kuchipudi and Kathakali are very rich. Still, Kuchipudi has more affinity with Bharatha Natyam. Originally, Kuchipudi and Kathakali were performed by males with exclusive expressions.
There was evidence that many Devadasis and non-Devadasi dancers learnt Abhinaya nuances and mastered their Abhinaya skills under Kuchupidi teachers.

Rupee depreciation is temporary - Alawathuwala
The depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar is temporary and moreover it is significant that the value of many world currencies have depreciated, when comparing with the dollar rate, Home Affairs State Minister J.C.Alawathuwala said.
Due to the world economic crisis, the value of a number of many world currencies, including those of India, Pakistan, Australia, the Philippines, United Kingdom, Turkey, Indonesia, Russia, have depreciated when compared with dollar rate, he said.
Alawathuwala was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
He said the depreciation of the Indian currency is 12 per cent, Pakistan 17 per cent, Turkey 20 per cent, Russia 18 per cent, Indonesia 11 per cent, Australia 10 per cent, Philippines 7 per cent and United Kingdom 8 per cent.
Even the EURO by depreciated by 4 per cent. However the depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee is only by 7 per cent, he added.
Considering the world economic downturn, it is inevitable to have a certain depreciation of world currencies. Accordingly, ours are not an exception, he added.
State Minister Alawathuwala pointed out it has been reported that during the last regime, the value of the Sri Lankan rupee had depreciated by 12 per cent on some occasions.
However, it cannot be expected that the rupee value will depreciate more than 9 per cent under this government, he added.
He claimed that the media has never portrayed the true picture in this regard and has also failed to state that it is not only the Lankan rupee, but the value of many other world currencies have also shown a depraeciation against the dollar rate.
When asked about the fuel price formula, he said that the Joint Opposition has no ethical right to talk on this subject as the highest ever fuel price was reported during the last regime.
During the Rajapaksa regime, the prices of fuel were not reduced even when the Supreme Court ordered to do so, Alawathuwala alleged.
When a group of Chilaw fishermen asked that the price of kerosene be reduced they were shot at, he said.
The prices of fuel were brought down drastically as soon as the present government came to power. Even today, the prices of fuel are lower than during the Rajapaksa regime, he said.
He added that fuel price formulas are available with a number of counties including Japan, India and the United States.
When world fuel prices go down, people are benefitted. We utilised the fuel price formula for the peoples benefit, he said.
Alawathuwala said the government will take measures to ease the burden of the people no sooner the world fuel prices come down.
Speaking on the Cost of Living, the Sate Minister said that there should be a controlled price for daily commodities of the people.This will control the black market and unauthorised price hikes.
When asked about a possible bus fare hike, he said the relevant Ministers will take the most appropriate measures regarding this issue.
The government has launched several fruitful programmes, including Gamperaliya, Enterprise Sri Lanka and so on for the benefit of the country and the people.
atarian Mahinda Rajapaksa has created a many issues within the Joint Opposition. He had allegedly said that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa would be the next Presidential candidate as that his son Namal Rajapaksa is not qualiefied to contest due to the age limit. But, Mahinda Rajapaksa refuted all this on his return to the country. That is the nature of Mahinda Rajapaksa, State Minister Alawathuwala said.

Sarfraz, Rohit promise  blockbuster India-Pakistan clash
Abu Dhabi, Monday: Rival captains Sarfraz Ahmed and Rohit Sharma played down the hype surrounding the much-awaited India-Pakistan clash in Dubai on Wednesday, insisting that the Asia Cup is much more than a contest between the arch-rivals.
But despite their claims, millions of fans across the border and elsewhere in the world will be watching the Group A clash, with a sold out 25,000-crowd expected at Dubai Stadium.
The game is the first between the sub-continent rivals since Pakistan thumped India by 180 runs in the final of the Champions Trophy at The Oval in June last year.
The two teams are facing each other for the first time in the United Arab Emirates since 2006, the last of their regular matches which were also held in Sharjah between 1984-2000.
Sarfraz, who led Pakistan in that memorable Champions Trophy triumph, denied that his team will have a psychological advantage.
"We will not take that Champions Trophy win in our minds," said Sarfraz on Monday, a day after his team thumped qualifiers Hong Kong in their first match of the tournament.
"That was a different atmosphere (in London) and conditions. It was a year ago so that's history so we will enter the ground with a new strategy and passion."
India will also meet Hong Kong in Dubai on Tuesday to tune up for the big match.
- India without Kohli -
India's regular captain and world-class batsman Virat Kohli has been rested for the competition to help his aching back after a gruelling tour of England.
But Sarfraz refused to accept Kohli's absence will make much difference.
"No doubt he (Kohli) is their captain and a world-class batsman but I think they (India) have a good team even without Kohli.
"They have good players who have done well for India. So I don't think it will make much difference to India. Their batting is very strong so I can say that it will be a good match."
Sarfraz has told his players just to enjoy the occasion.
"My message to the players is not to bother about the result and do (their) best and when you do that you get a positive result in all matches because there are five other teams as well," he said.
Five-time Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are in Group B.
India have won the event -- which started in 1984 -- six times, while Pakistan have been champions twice.
Two teams from each group will qualify for the Super Four stage, with the top two to reach the September 28 final.
So barring any upsets against Hong Kong, India and Pakistan will also face off again in the Super Four on September 23.
India skipper Sharma said his team will be looking beyond Pakistan.
"It's always exciting to play Pakistan, but it's not about one team as well. There are other teams also eyeing the title," said Sharma, who has the rare record of scoring three one-day international double hundreds.
- Searing UAE heat -
All six teams have to endure extreme hot conditions in the UAE, with the temperature scaling to over 40 degrees Celsius and expected to rise further in the coming days.
Sharma said his side will get a chance to assess the conditions in their match against Hong Kong.
"Once we finish the first game we will look at Pakistan, what their strengths and weaknesses are. Looking at the pitch, I think we have the perfect combination and the guys to do the job.
"A few players have come from England so it's going to be a challenge for them.
"For the rest of us, we have been here for the last four days so I can probably say we are very much used to the conditions.
"It's game time, so we have to focus on the game rather than the conditions."
Teams
Pakistan: Sarfraz Ahmed (captain), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Shan Masood, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Haris Sohail, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Amir, Junaid Khan, Usman Khan Shinwari, Shaheen Shah Afridi

Searching for 'Nicole'
Boy meets girl, girl gives boy wrong number: some people might take it as a hint, but one Canadian student decided it was a challenge.
He emailed 246 women at the University of Calgary with the first name Nicole in search of the one he had met the night prior - causing many of the women on the mass email chain to strike up a friendship.
We have this Nicole network now, said communications student Nicole Manaog.
The girl gang formed after Carlos Zetina met one Nicole on Thursday when the pair apparently hit it off - but Zetina only managed to snag her first name and a wrong number.
So he sent out an email blast, Met you last night and you gave me the wrong number, he wrote in the subject line.
But as a Dutch exchange student, Toetenel does not have an email address affiliated with the university in Canadas Alberta province.
The other women, however, began a long thread and soon created a Facebook page they dubbed Nicole From Last Night to have a mass conversation sans Zetina.
We created a Facebook page and weve been chatting that way, said theater student Nicole Rathberger. Its kind of neat that weve been using the technology to get to know each other.
Some 15 of the Nicoles met up at a bar near the university campus, and the real Nicole was finally made aware of the situation through a friend late Friday.
She is expected to attend the next meeting of the Nicoles, along with a least 25 more women. Zetina finally received word from the object of his affection via text message. The two plan to get coffee next week, Rathberger told AFP, a date to which the other Nicoles have not been invited. AFP

SLASSCOM launches program with University of Colombo
The stage is set to establish data science as the third pillar within Sri Lankas ICT exports with the launch of the Training Program in Fundamentals of Data Science offered by the Center for Data Science, Department of Statistics, University of Colombo.
The course fee of this program is subsidized through the National Export Strategy (NES) initiatives through the Export Development Board (EDB) and Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM). Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman SLASSCOM, identified the importance of growing the countrys capacity and capability in the areas of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence as key for growing the industry and for our skills to remain competitive. Currently Sri Lankas IT exports are estimated to be over USD 1.2 billion and is the fifth-largest export earner offering Software/Product Development and Business Process Management (BPM) services. The industry is growing rapidly with the potential to reach USD 5 billion by 2022 with a workforce of 200,000 employees.
Due to multiple technological advancements, the ability to capture data generated by various processes has become more viable and inexpensive.
With the availability of data, computation power and evolving data analytics, organizations are rapidly moving towards data driven decision making. This trend has created new career opportunities for Data Scientists, for those with skills in statistical data analytics, big data analytics, computer programming and a passion to extract information from data. The ICT sector in Sri Lanka which had previously focused more on software development and BPM can now explore new ventures by combining programming and database management experience with data analysis to emerge as data analytics companies.
Data scientists are very much in demand around the globe and has increasing career prospects in Sri Lanka as well. This has been highlighted in multiple studies including the LinkedIn 2017 Emerging Jobs Report, where Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists top the list. However, there is a considerable shortage in Data Scientists in Sri Lanka which has hindered the expansion of data analytics industry. This is mainly due to the lack of combined knowledge in Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics and the knowledge of the industry domain. Having identified this need, the Department of Statistics of University of Colombo, through the newly formed Center for Data Science collaborated with the SLASSCOM to structure and promote this course on the Fundamentals in Data Science, to provide a strong foundation for those venturing into careers in Data Science.
This program is targeted towards professionals who already have skills in computer science such as programming and database management, those who have industry domain knowledge seeking to familiarize with data analytics or STEM graduates seeking a career as Data Scientists. The programme is structured as five short courses and an individual mini-project. The topics addressed include an introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis using R, Data Management, Introduction to Statistical models, Introduction to Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Big Data, followed by the individual mini-project. The course duration is four months with 15 hours of lectures and lab content for each course and a mini-project. At the successful completion of the short courses, the mini-project would need to be delivered within four weeks. The programme will be conducted by a panel of lecturers at the Department of Statistics, University of Colombo and experts from the industry as visiting lecturers.

Sri Lankan arrested in Milan for human  trafficking not a diplomat  Foreign Ministry
The Foreign Ministry confirmed that a Sri Lankan with a diplomatic passport had been arrested at the Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy while trying to smuggle four youths into the country recently.
However, his diplomatic passport had been cancelled upon completion of his contract and although he was required to surrender it, he is suspected of being engaged in human smuggling using his diplomatic passport.
On to information received by the Daily News, the Sri Lankan identified as Jameel Ibra Lebbe Haji of Maradamule, Kalmunai resides at the Maligawatte National housing scheme. Having obtained a doctorate in International Studies at St. Petersburg in Russia, he had been employed as the Counsellor at the Embassy of Jordan from 2012-2015 sent by the Rajapaksa regime.
The 63-year-old was holding a diplomatic passport number D3643493 at the time, which was later cancelled and he had obtained an official passport. Although his diplomatic passport was recalled in 2015, he had not surrendered his diplomatic passport.
He is employed at the Foreign Employment Bureau as a Manager where he serves to date. However, he has not notified the Foreign Employment Bureau of his trip and had left without approved leave.
When the Daily News contacted his second wife Jameela, she claimed that she had no knowledge of his trip to Italy or with whom he had travelled. She said that he had promised her to return last Saturday but had neither contacted her nor notified her of his whereabouts.
I have no idea who Jamil went with and what happened. I know the same information as you do. Do you know who he is with asked Jameela, who was tending to a toddler at the time the publication got in touch with her via phone.She said she had no idea who Jamil had gone with or what had happened to him. He didnt tell me before he left.
Jameela said that her husband used to travel overseas with his first wife, but she had no contact with her. She said that although she had tried to contact her husband, she had not been able to get in touch with him. She denied any knowledge of his activities, adding that so far, no one had contacted her regarding her husbands whereabouts.
Jamil was arrested recently for posing as a diplomat and had tried to illegally take four young people into Italy, but was arrested by the officers of the Malpensa Airport Border Police Bureau in Milan.
He had arrived in Italy from Doha with his wife and four the youths-two girls and two boys who appeared to be in their 20s and presented the documents to immigration officials for verification proceedings.
He had produced both his wifes and his diplomatic passports for inspection, which had Schengen visas issued by the French diplomatic authority.
However, the Italian authorities had been suspicious of the authenticity of the passports of the four youths and they were taken to the immigration office.
The diplomat reassured the officials that the two young women were his daughters and the two young men were his nephews.
However, upon investigation the Italian immigration officers were able to discover that all four passports of the youth were falsified by reconstructing the biographical page, which was made using raw materials and sophisticated printing materials.
According to reports, the four original passports of the youth were found inside the hand luggage of the diplomat. They had left the country using their original passports, but, produced the fake diplomatic passports in Italy.
Jamil too had travelled out of Sri Lanka using his official passport, but produced his cancelled diplomatic passport in Italy.
Further interrogation of the youth by the Italian Migration officers revealed that the four youth were not related to the diplomat, and he was only accompanying them for a fee of 4,000 Euros each.
His wife and the four youths were deported to Sri Lanka.
Speaking to the Daily News the Acting General Manager of the Foreign Employment Bureau W.M.V. Wansekara said Jamil had not obtained leave from the Bureau prior to leaving the country. It has been confirmed that Jamil had left the country on September 7 using his official passport.
Yesterday we had a meeting and took a decision to initiate disciplinary action against him, Wansekara said.
Jamil is currently held in a Milan prison and the FEB confirmed that an official from the Sri Lankan Consular Office had visited Jamil on Monday. However, the FEB stated that they had yet not received a full report regarding the current status of this issue.
The Daily News made several attempts to contact former Foreign Employment Minister Dilan Perera for a comment but our efforts proved futile.

Sushi scoffer
In a bizarre turns of events, a German triathlete has been banned from an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant after he ate too much sushi.
Jaroslav Bobrowski, 30, paid just 16 euros for his meal at Thai Thuna last weekend as part of the deal, before munching down 100 plates from the revolving carousel.
However, when Bobrowski went to pay for his meal, the staff told him he was no longer welcome.
Bobrowski, who stands at 5ft 7ins and weighs 12st 4lbs, told Passauer Neue Presse that he is on a special diet in which he fasts for 20 hours a time. In the remaining four hours he stuffs himself until I am full, he said.
When the time to break his fast came, Bobrowski headed for the restaurant in Landshut, Bavaria. Bobrowski told Bild that none of the restaurant staff raised any qualms during his mammoth meal, but it was when he got to the till that he sensed trouble.
Trying to make amends, he offered them a sizeable tip to make up for the excess food he ate - but it was rejected. Instead, staff told him to get out and never return.
Talking to the newspaper, 25-year-old host Tan le said, He eats for five, thats not normal.
The story emerged after Bobrowski posted a complaint on Facebook that subsequently went viral, making news all over Germany.
He has even been dubbed sushi-man and the sushi-wolverine after scoffing down so much food in one sitting. Fox News

Ten pc bus fare hike likely
Action will be taken on the request of private bus associations for a 10 percent bus fare hike due to the increased fuel prices, based on a proposal submitted to the Cabinet, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday.
The Transport and Civil Aviation Minister was responding to the statement of several private bus associations that they would launch a countrywide indefinite strike from September 24 midnight following the increase in the diesel price if a fare hike is not granted.
The minister said he had received a request from the All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) to increase bus fares by 10 percent. However, the final decision would be taken by the Cabinet.
A report will be prepared by the ministry after taking into account the various factors of the price formula, the minister added.
The National Transport Commission will also compile a report on the percentage of any fare hike which will be submitted to the Cabinet, shortly.
Minister de Silva said the ministry has decided to convene a special discussion with private bus associations on September 19 at 9 am to solve the problem after considering their views.

The Third Attempt
It is believed that the American Public especially remembered the classic statement made by the French philosopher Montesquieu in 1748 when he expounded his thesis on the Separation of powers. According to him as history shows, if an individuals power is not curtailed and controlled by an equal amount of power, that individual will eventually end up misusing that power. Hence, we should always control power through power. Therefore, in order to protect the state and democracy and to stop a constitutional autocracy from building up, the American public along with the Congress brought in the 22nd Amendment to the American Constitution in 1951
These days, a serious amount of discussion is taking place in the media as to whether the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can contest for the upcoming Presidential elections for the third time. This idea stating that there is no legal barrier for Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest for a third time was brought up by none-other than the henchmen and slaves of Mahinda Rajapaksa representing the Joint Opposition. Their argument is that the 19th Amendment made to the Constitution of Sri Lanka does not apply to Mahinda Rajapaksa, as it has no retrospective effect and therefore there is no constitutional barrier for him to stand up for re-election.
But those who stand against this idea state that the whole argument presented by the Rajapaksa supporters are legally fraught and with the enactment of the 19th Amendment no person can contest for the Presidency more than two times. Nevertheless, arguments made for and against this particular issue are saturated with legal undertones therefore making it difficult to provide an absolute conclusion for a lay human being who has no understanding of law. But one must remember that the implications of such suggestions do not merely concern the domain of law but has moral and ethical aspects attached to it. Therefore, from a political perspective, Mahinda Rajapaksas attempt at contesting for a third time is extremely unethical and morally wrong.
Executive Presidency
The much talked about executive presidency, which is theoretically called a Presidential system of government, was introduced to the world by United States of America by the constitution which they adopted in 1787 which eventually came into force in 1789. According to the constitutional provisions of the American constitution, the executive powers of the state are to be carried out by the President chosen by the public for a period of four years. Interestingly, the Constitution of the United States of America did not contain a limitation on the number of times an individual can run for the Presidency. Despite this, George Washington who became the first President of the United States of America, held the post twice and declined from contesting for a third time. After Washington, till 144 years passed, meaning till 1933, 31 Presidents ruled America and nobody stood up for re-election after completing two tenures in the office which thereby established a very valuable democratic political tradition within the American polity.
Even though the historical experience was such, Franklin de Roosevelt, who became the 32nd President of the United States of America, after finishing two tenures in office, decides to contest for a third time and won the election in 1941. Roosevelt became the first President in the history of American to contest the election three times. Even after three terms, Roosevelt showed no signs of retiring and in 1944 he again contested and become elected as President. But in 1945, he died and Harry. S. Truman took over the Presidency in 1945 itself.
The American public, due to this behaviour of Roosevelt, clearly understood that a limit has to be enforced to the number of attempts a single individual can contest for the Presidency in order to protect the age old democratic political traditions and to curb the possibility of allowing a Constitutional autocracy to grow by warping the very provisions of the Constitution enforced to ensure democratic governance. It is believed that the American Public especially remembered the classic statement made by the French philosopher Montesquieu in 1748 when he expounded his thesis on the Separation of powers. According to him as history shows, if an individuals power is not curtailed and controlled by an equal amount of power, that individual will eventually end up misusing that power. Hence, we should always control power through power. Therefore, in order to protect the state and democracy and to stop a constitutional autocracy from building up, the American public along with the Congress brought in the 22nd Amendment to the American Constitution in 1951.
This amendment then limited the term of the Presidency for two tenures and it legally applied to all the individuals who were Presidents in America prior to its enactment. The most important thing to note here is that no President who was in office prior to this amendment never went to courts and challenged whether it is applicable retrospectively. Further, no President who was elected to office after that particular amendment never attempted to even change the clause in the hope of staying in power beyond two terms.
This example is one among many which shows how much the Americans respect, love and protect the traditions related to democratic principles of governance. After 1789 all the states which established Presidential systems of governments, excluding the states which has only one party or states which maintain authoritative systems some way or the other, limit the number of times an individual can contest for the Presidency to two terms.
Second Republic constitution
The Presidential system of government was introduced to Sri Lanka by J.R. Jayewardene in 1978 with the enactment of the Second Republic Constitution. J. R. Jayewardene took the American System as an example in creating the Presidential system of government in Sri Lanka. The office of the President thus created under the 1978 Constitution had far reaching executive powers and was very strong when compared to the office of the President in United States of America which made and make critics call it a constitutional autocracy. Even though the case was as such, J.R. Jayewardene took measures to curb the rise of a long term individual autocrat by inculcating certain provisions in the Constitution by way of bringing forth some checks and balances. The election of the President by the public, limiting one term to six years, the clause stating that an individual cannot contest beyond two times for the post of president and that the president is responsible to the parliament in carrying out his duties and function given in the constitution are some examples of such checks and balances.
Family affair
Hence, the most important two out of these are the limit applied to the number of times one can contest for the post of President and that the President should be elected at a Presidential Election by the people. By the 18th Amendment to the constitution, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa repealed article 31.2 of the 1978 Constitution. Here, the most important restriction and check enforced by J. R. Jayewardene to ensure democratic governance and curb autocracy was destroyed and taken out. Mahinda Rajapaksa enacted this change with the hope of establishing himself as an autocrat within the state for which he violated all known principles of democratic governance. Further, Mahinda Rajapaksa through this constitutional change managed to carve a path to ensure that, the heirs to the throne after him will be from his own immediate family and nowhere else.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 re-established the provisions of article 31.2 which was abolished by Mahinda Rajapaksa thereby again stating that no individual can contest for the presidency beyond two terms. Article 4.2 of the 19th Amendment states that No person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the people, shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the People. Thus, the henchmen of Mahinda Rajapaksa are actually trying to re-interpret this particular article in a fraught manner to bring back Mahinda Rajapaksa into power again. They argue that this article does not retrospective application and hence, Rajapaksa can contest for the 2020 Presidential elections without any legal hindrance.
When analyzing this situation, what becomes evident is that the supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa have forgotten the whole political ethos of the 19th Amendment and are desperately attempting to mislead the civil society by using one article of the said amendment.
The main idea of the 19th Amendment is not to bar this one individual called Mahinda Rajapaksa from coming into power, but to ensure democracy within the governance structures and to stop an autocrat coming into power on constitutional terms. Therefore, this does not apply to the former President Rajapaksa alone but to anyone who gets elected to the post of president in Sri Lanka and it further acts as a safeguard of democracy, good governance, rule of law and constitutionalism.
It will be possible to create a functioning democratic political system within Sri Lanka if the public and the state gets used to such democratic traditions and principles. Thus, it becomes evident that the Mahinda Rajapaksa supporters by promoting such false and fraught propaganda are trying to break away from the democratic traditions of governance and establish an autocratic system of rule within the country.
Should we allow such anti-democratic and nepotistic forces to come into power All those who love democracy should ask their conscience this very important political question. We also have to understand one important point here: that there is a legal as well as a moral and ethical base to politics. Mahinda Rajapaksa supporters have totally left out and forgotten this much important moral and ethical aspects of politics. So the public should seriously consider whether they should hand over the power of the state to such people who are overtly undemocratic in their political aspirations.

UN probe wants Myanmars  army removed from politics
MYANMAR: Myanmars powerful army should be removed from politics, UN investigators said Tuesday in the final version of a damning report reiterating calls for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
A brutal military crackdown last year forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Demands have mounted for those who waged the campaign to face justice.
The UNs 444-page probe is the most meticulous breakdown of the violence to date. It says the militarys top leadership should be overhauled and have no further influence over the countrys governance.
Myanmars military dominates the Buddhist-majority nation, holding a quarter of seats in parliament and controlling three ministries, making their grip on power firm despite political reforms which began in 2011.
But the report said the countrys civilian leadership should further pursue the removal of the Tatmadaw from Myanmars political life, referring to the nations armed forces.
The UNs analysis, based on 18 months work and more than 850 in-depth interviews, urges the international community to investigate the military top brass for genocide, including commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing.
Myanmars army has denied nearly all wrongdoing, insisting its campaign was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents who staged deadly raids on border posts in August 2017.
But the UN team said the militarys tactics had been consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats.
The report says an estimated 10,000 people were killed in the crackdown and that was likely a conservative figure.
Investigators said the Tatmadaw should be restructured and the process should begin by replacing the current leadership.
Myanmar only recently emerged from almost a half century of military junta rule and Aung San Suu Kyis democratically-elected government remains in a delicate power balance with the generals.
Their presence in parliament gives them an effective veto on constitutional changes, making any transition to full civilian control extremely difficult.
Three key ministries -- home affairs, border and defence -- are also in their hands, giving them carte blanche to conduct security operations with little oversight.
It is impossible to remove the army out of political life without changing the constitution, and the military have a veto over constitutional changes, Mark Farmaner, from Burma Campaign UK, told AFP.
The UN team said there were reasonable grounds to believe that the atrocities -- including systematic murder, rape, torture and arson -- were committed with the intention of destroying the stateless Rohingya, warranting the charges of genocide.
The mission, created by the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, did not focus its sights entirely on the army.
It directed specific criticism at Suu Kyi, whose global reputation has been shattered by her failure to speak up for the Rohingya against the military.
While acknowledging that the civilian authorities have little influence over military actions, the report said that their acts and omissions had contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes.
Pointing to deeply entrenched impunity in Myanmar, the investigators said the only chance to obtain accountability was through the international justice system.
They also pointed to failings of the UNs office within Myanmar, alleging that quiet diplomacy was prioritised and that those who tried to push the UNs Human Rights Up Front approach were ignored, criticised, sidelined or blocked in these efforts.
The independent UN team will present its findings to member states of the Human Rights Council in Geneva later on Tuesday, after which Myanmar will have a chance to respond to the allegations.

Unclear who is behind CDSs impending arrest - Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister and SLFP spokesman Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday said that both the President and the Prime Minister were not informed about the impending arrest of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne and it is still unclear who is taking the responsibility for this impending arrest.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, Minister Samarasinghe underlined the necessity of ascertaining the reason for arresting the Chief of Defence Staff, bypassing the President and the Prime Minister.
Before arresting a person who is holding an important position, the first thing they should do is keep the Defence Minister informed, he said.
The Minister condemned the allegation levelled against the President by TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran over the overseas visit of the Chief of Defence Staff despite his being summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to give a statement.
Responding to a question by a journalist at the media conference regarding this statement by MP Sumanthiran, Minister Samarasinghe said, Sumanthiran is always attempting to create the ground for the hounding of the countrys war heroes. That is why he is always proposing to bring international judges to Sri Lanka.
If the President was not aware that the Chief of Defence Staff was summoned by the CID to record a statement, how can he stop him from going abroad for an official matter he asked.
During the special Cabinet meeting last Thursday, the President said that it was a grave wrong to take military personnel into custody without having sufficient evidence to even file a case against them after granting them bail.
During the meeting, he informed the Cabinet that there is no argument with regard to the process of taking action regardless of the status of a person whose involvement in a crime has been proved, said the Minister.
Minister Samarasinghe said that senior military officials were being taken into custody, held in remand for many months, and released later with no charges being filed against them.
Responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the allegation of conspiracy to assassinate the President, Minister Samarsasinghe said that this is a serious allegation that should be investigated without any delay, to ascertain the truth.

US-China trade war  enters new phase
US: US President Donald Trump on Monday effectively broadsided one of the world's largest trade relationships, announcing plans to proceed with tariffs on another $200 billion in US imports of Chinese goods.
Taken with the $50 billion in tariffs already in place, this means roughly half of everything Americans buy from China -- their largest source for imports -- is now subject to punitive import duties.
Whole industrial sectors stand to feel the effects, including agriculture, manufacturing, textiles and retail.
Meanwhile, China, which is America's third-largest export market, has vowed to counter-attack with plans to slap tariffs on another $60 billion in US exports, meaning about 80 percent of US exports to China would be subject to retaliation.
Here is a rundown of some of the products in question.
The Trump administration says its aggressive stance is to pressure Beijing to change policies that allow for the theft of US technology and undercut American producers.
Trump started out in July and August with a more modest $50 billion round of tariffs targeting aircraft parts, computer hard drives, machinery and appliances, optical and surgical equipment as well as autos -- goods Washington said had benefited from unfair trade practices.
But Monday's announcement moves things up by an order of magnitude. According to a preliminary list released in July, the administration is now targeting $8.4 billion in plastics, $64.8 billion in electrical machinery, $55.1 billion in appliances and $25.8 billion in furniture as well as broad ranges of seafood and meat. Other items that have been on the US target list since the summer include milking machines for dairy cows, incubators for baby chicks, flight data recorders, x-ray tubes, bulldozers and arc lamps as well as motorcycles and mopeds. Chinese imports from the United States grew by nearly 500 percent over the past five years, such that as of 2017 Chinese buyers accounted for almost one in every five dollars in US export revenue.
Beijing has since accused the United States of starting the largest trade war in economic history. In retaliating, China in July announced tariffs on American agricultural goods and autos. Also in Beijing's crosshairs are exports like hybrid electric and off-road vehicles, coal, dump trucks, asphalt, MRI machines and motorcycles, among other items. Harley-Davidson will have to bump up the Chinese price of its iconic motorbikes at least 20 percent, a store representative in Beijing said. That adds to the American beef, pork, many types of fish, and dozens of fruits and nuts that were taxed in July.
The most painful perhaps is the tariff on US soybeans, which chokes off a key export market for American farmers, who shipped $14 billion of the beans to China last year.
If China then slaps tariffs on another $60 billion in US goods, this will bring total US exports subject to Beijing's retaliation to $110 billion, at 2017 sales levels.
With 50 days to go before crucial mid-term elections and many in Trump's own Republican party are queasy about Trump's trade wars, which have drawn loud objections from senior figures within the party.
American officials said Monday they were conscious of the need for American businesses to find alternate suppliers before the tariffs hit.
If the tariffs go to 25 percent at the beginning of the year, you will have had almost six months to get your business ready for that, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday.
In a further attempt to cushion the blow, Washington canceled plans to put tariffs on about 300 product categories, including hot consumer items like smart watches and Bluetooth-enabled devices, chemicals for manufacturing, agriculture and textiles, as well as bicycle helmets, and children's high chairs, car seats and play pens. - AFP

The success of Ladies College Netball team was due to the support and encouragement of principal Eesha Speldewinde, coach Pushpa Navaratne, teacher in charge Brenda Rajapaksa and sports co-ordinator Kamala Kulathilaka said head coach Deeptha Senerath Bandara who took great pains to mould them into a formidable team.
Holy Family Convent Kurunegala who dominated the schools netball scene during the last few years gave a disappointing display winning only the under 16 runners up title and losing to Hillwood College in the under 18 tournament and Visakha Vidyalaya in the under 20 tournament.
Ishani Madushika of Holy Family Convent, Kalutara was picked as the best player of the tournament.

Expects big turnaround against England
Weve let the whole nation down - Mathews
ABU DHABI, Monday: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was at a loss for words to describe his teams two batting collapses in back to back games that led to their exit from the ongoing Asia Cup cricket tournament in the UAE.
To be honest I dont have any answers. It was very disappointing where our batting was the main reason on both occasions. We are a much better team than this, this was a shocking performance, said a disappointed Sri Lankan skipper after his teams 90-run defeat at the hands of Afghanistan.
Bangladesh you cant take them lightly theyve played the same guys for almost 10 years. The Afghans have played really good cricket over the past one and half years. Its embarrassing but its not an embarrassment to lose to Bangladesh and Afghanistan who played better cricket than us. But its shocking the way we batted in both matches, he said.
Sri Lanka were put out for totals of 124 and 158 in the two matches.
We havent done that badly the tri-series in Bangladesh we won that, but yes we lost the series to South Africa and the Nidahas trophy. We admit our limited-over performances havent been upto the mark, admitted Mathews. We need to find solutions because we are only months away from the World Cup. Losing like this is extremely embarrassing to me and the entire team, weve let the whole nation down.
Mathews said the batting debacles had nothing to do with talent but with handling pressure in the middle during situations.
We all have shown what we are capable of in the last series against South Africa. Its just that pressure handling and the situation handling wasnt good on both occasions. We cracked under pressure. That is just purely mental. We need to find a solution, we just cant move on like this, said Mathews.
Handling pressure is something the coach cant do anything about. The players will have to learn how to handle pressure and on this occasion we were extremely poor. Credit to the Bangladeshis and Afghans they squeezed us and never let us off the hook, he said.
Commenting on the fielding Mathews said, We were slightly better than the last occasion, our ground fielding and catching was okay today. The bowlers and the fielders did their part to restrict the opponent to 249 which on these wickets are very much gettable. I would put the blame purely on the batting unit. We all take responsibility and it was just deplorable and shocking to all of us.
We need a big turnaround for in a couple of weeks time we will be playing England and its going to be a tough series once again. This kind of performance is unacceptable, Mathews said.

The Waste Land in Sinhala
Why translate the untranslatable
Eric Ilayapparchichi an award-winning Sri Lankan writer has published a Sinhala translation of T. S. Eliots most controversial long poem: The Waste Land. The title of the translation is Mudu Bima (which can be translated back into English as Barren Land). If my understanding is correct, this is the first time that a translation of Eliots work appears in Sinhala.
As soon as I received a copy of Eric Ilayapparchichis (Eric) translation of Eliots masterpiece, I questioned whether Eliots work could be translated into Sinhala to give the inherent meanings embodied in the original texts. I also had another question why people take the trouble to translate. In the case Erics translation of The Waste Land he has not just translated the original 433 lines that Eliot penned in his masterpiece. Eric has produced a publication consisting of 256 pages devoting the bulk of the book to provide explanatory notes aiding the Sri Lankan reader who may not be familiar with the background to The Waste Land which has quotations from several languages and references and allusions to many subjects. So why translate untranslatable poetry into Sinhala Ms Google helped me to find an interesting quotation:
So why translate My first answer is that poetry in translation simply adds to the total of human pleasure obtainable through a single language. It opens up new language worlds within our tongues, as every good poem does. It revitalises our daily, cliche-haunted vocabulary. It disturbs our assumptions, jolts us with rhythms flatter or stronger than we're used to. It extends us in the way real travelling does, giving us new sounds, sights and smells (Carol Rumens. www.guardian.com. 28 Sep 2007).
Though Eric has not stated specifically, I realised that being a talented poet himself, he has translated Eliots work simply to add the total of human pleasure obtainable through a single language and to offer that human pleasure to the Sinhala reader who may not be familiar with T. S. Eliots work at all. What was Erics motive for translating this difficult poem Is Eric alluding to something else about him or larger issues that he is observing in his native country The second question came to my mind after reading Erics latest Sinhala poetry collection Abali (broken pieces) in which he shares powerful insights about Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, there have been no reviews of his latest collection of poetry either in Sinhala or English. I sincerely hope this translation would generate a healthy dialogue in Sri Lanka. The purpose of this short review is to answer the question of whether Eric has given us the pleasure of reading The Waste Land in Sinhala. Has he offered us a beautiful or faithful translation of Eliots original text
My reading of T. S. Eliots work goes back to the mid-1970s. While working as a freelance writer, I had the privilege of reading Eliots work under the tutelage of veteran journalists Dr Edwin Ariyadasa who has the gift of reciting most of Eliots work by memory. I could remember one of our afternoon meetings at the Pagoda caf in Fort where Dr Ariyadasa used to entertain his friends (including the journalists from Lake House, and elsewhere) with cakes and tea. Our conversations covered diverse subjects. One day, Dr Ariyadasa asked me whether I have read T. S. Eliot and when I answered in negative, he recited from memory the first stanza of The Waste Land and explained the allusions embodied in it. Then, I was unaware of the existence of Eliot or his work. My initial exposure to Eliots work began under the tutelage of Mr Ariyadsaa who frequently encouraged me to read Eliots work is knowing my interests in blank verses (nisadas Kavi). In response, I look for the book, and essays by TSE and borrowed books from the Colombo public library and the British Council and I used to read them with the help of Mallalaseka dictionary. My readings include a book about Ezra Pounds influence on the original manuscript with pictures of annotations and changes Pound suggested after reading the original text of The Waste Land. That was during my golden 20s something in the mid-1970s and I was a totally ignorant soul of western literary texts.
Most of my generation was the product of the S W R D Bandaranayakes swabhasa (national) language policy and the English were not important then. Ever since I have read and studied among other writings, Eliots work as opportunities emerged.
While living in Australia, I have studied English literature and have had mentors who knew Eliots work. I have listened to TS Eliot reading his work on YouTube and have understood how he emphasised certain words, phrases to give specific allusions to words.
Now having the privilege of accessing the privilege of thousands of databases, I find time to read peer-reviewed academic journals, popular articles written by critics and journalists on Eliots work with new interpretations and analysis to TSEs texts.
Thus, I believe I am qualified to comment on Illayapaparchis quality of translation as an avid reader of poetry (including Sri Lankan poetry) with a good understanding of the original work by TSE which Illayaparachchi has chosen to translate.
According to some scholars, The Waste Land is the most influential poem of the 20th century similar to Eliots other controversial poem 'The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock,'. The Waste Land was first published in the in the British journal The Criterion. A month later it appeared in The Dhal; in the USA. It was published as a book in England in 1923 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf as a Hogarth publication. When the poem was published as a book Eliot added explanatory notes to provide a context to the poem. It has numerous references to Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism.
Since the publication of The Waste Land in book form, it has been subjected to both positive and negative criticisms. Even today many scholars from the East and West have dissected and critiqued the poems by raising more questions than answers. Some Indian scholars familiar with Sanskrit has critiqued the accuracy of Eliots use of Sanskrit at the end of the book. Now after 95 years of the publication of The Waste Land, Eric, the poet, novelist critic and a librettist has bestowed the Sri Lankans to read The Waste Land in their native language; Sinhala, a task many writers would dare to touch. Indeed, poetry is difficult to translate and in particular poets like Eliot who infuse their work with complex cultural, mythical and linguistic allusions that even western readers find difficult to follow. However, Eric has taken the challenge and we must congratulate him for his fearless endeavour with gratitude.
For those who had the privilege of reading a facsimile copy of the original text of The Waste Land drastically edited and annotated by Ezra Pound help understand the metamorphosis of the book that we have the privilege of reading today. The story does not end there. Eliot has included many quotes in his poems quoting directly and indirectly by referring to several sources. The Waste Land consists of some quotations from several languages: French, Italian, Greek, German and Sanskrit. Further, it has direct references to other literary works of Shakespeare, Dante, and Blake and of course one of my favourite Irish writers James Joyce.

Wonder of reading
Many a man in this digital era complains that they do not have time to read. Yet, I do cultivate time every day to read a book or a newspaper despite heavy schedules of work as I know the wonder of reading.
I like to read because every minute of our life that passes is irreversible and so precious and I want to exploit that time with a useful work. I like to read as the wealth of knowledge I get from reading cannot be stolen or deleted unless some sort of paralysis takes hold of my brain cells, yet what I have gained from reading can be shared with a generous mind.
I like to read because I can go to the past - to the origin of this world or even the eras before that. I can meet the kings and queens, their kingdoms, their rise and fall. Besides, I can learn the wonders and miracles of new inventions and discoveries and how they affect the world and people respond to them. I can go to the future and see how life on this planet would be.
I can go into the sun, moon, an active volcano or to the farthest point of this universe without spending a colossal amount of money and time. I can climb up the highest point of the mountain Everest or explore the deepest point of the ocean without any protective suits but by the most comfortable vehicle of reading.
I like to read because I can have access to the worlds most prestigious universities, hotels, libraries, museums, zoos and what not. I like to read because I like to get lost in the creative thoughts of great writers and find different layers of meanings of their writings. Not only that, I can blend the knowledge that I have learnt from books and what my teachers have taught me and come up with new ideas to see the world from a different perspective.
I like to read a book rather than allowing my fingers to run on a keyboard of a computer and eyes getting tired from the radiation of it because reading a book requires no electricity, no particular place or no health hazards of any sort, but a wise and a healthy mental exercise.
I dont think with this information, I can arrive at a conclusion. Yet, it is only through reading that such pleasures can be derived. In short, such elevation such enlightenment can never be experienced or gained by anything else other than reading!
