A can of worms
The breakthrough made in the underground activities of certain high ranking officers in the security forces has, no doubt, opened a can of worms which is bound to cast a pall on the tales of valour and heroics of the armed forces in general during the Eelam war. This side of the dark picture of the war against terrorism escaped the public attention largely because all the focus was on the battle and the capture of towns, hitherto held by the LTTE, dominating the news. This climate provided the ideal backdrop for sinister forces to put into operation their dark deeds knowing that these will be subsumed in the cacophony of victories announced on a daily basis, as the forces kept marching on.
These sinister forces were well aware that in the prevailing triumphalist milleu the public will refuse to believe any wrongdoing on the part of the forces, and, even if they did, the larger picture of the war victory would have vested them with immunity. On the other hand, this was the time when the minority Tamils, especial those wealthy, were most vulnerable to the machinations of these evil forces, being defeated and isolated on all fronts, what with the victory juggernaut marching on. Hence, the coast was clear for those unsavoury elements within the security forces and police to make hay while sun shines.
No sooner the new government was elected to power, investigations were launched into the seamier side of the security establishment. What is now being unearthed is a whole subterranean world of intrigue, crime and cover ups, with names, hitherto held sacrosanct, being exposed.
The latest to be arrested is Commodore D. K. P. Dassanayake, former Navy spokesman. He was taken into custody from the Welisara Naval base after investigations revealed his role in the abduction of 11 persons in and around Colombo in 2008. All the abductees, barring two, were members of the Tamil community. It has transpired during the investigations that the abductions were carried out for ransom demands. The missing persons were abducted by an unidentified group in Dehiwela, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. This was a time when the war was fought in all its intensity and where impunity reigned, with Tamil nationals selectively targeted, the operations masterminded by high ranking officers of the security forces and the police. The law, as they say, is silent during times of war and this exactly was the case during the closing stages of the Eelam war. It was also a time when the dreaded White Van roamed the streets picking up journalists and critics of the government, with the war giving blanket cover for these deeds.
Commodore Dassanayake is now being held in remand. He was brought to court in an ambulance, following a pattern that is associated with our politicians but a poor reflection on a war hero for whose release there is today a huge clamour by JO politicians, the Sangha and pan nationalist bodies, who are accusing the government carrying out witch-hunt against an individual who was in the forefront to defeat terrorists. The accusations sometimes verge on the bizarre, with the Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka attributing all the natural disasters and calamities to visit the country on the arrest of the country's war heroes'.
No one recalls what calamity befell the nation when the greatest war hero of them all, the war winning former Army Commander, was dragged away and thrown in jail. Certainly not the fall from power of those responsible for this dastardly deed.
That 77 avalanche
Today marks 40 years in the landslide victory of the UNP in 1977. The first result announced was Samanthurai, won by M. A. Abdul Majeed, that heralded the UNP avalanche that ended with 138 seats for the party, with the SLFP reduced to 8 (including three multi-member constituencies) and the Left completely wiped off the electoral map. Even JRJ, it was said, was astounded by the enormity of the victory which secured for the UNP a five sixth majority in parliament.
Up until then, whenever the UNP won, it was always with a very slender majority, and, more often than not, it had to cobble together a coalition to obtain a working majority, as happened under Dudley in 1965.
The 1977 victory also threw up many dynamics. It ushered in the first Executive Presidency in the country with the introduction of a new constitution. For the first time in post Independent Sri Lanka, a member of a minority party was installed as Leader of the Opposition (A. Amirthalingam -TULF). The UNP victory also a marked watershed in the country's socio-economic sphere with the introduction of the market economy throwing open Sri Lanka to the outside world and set the tone for a revolution on the development front.
There are today only a handful of survivors of that mind-boggling electoral triumph of the Grand Old Party, with Ranil Wickremesinghe, then a fresh faced youth, today soldering on as Prime Minister.

Sri Lanka celebrated 150 years of Ceylon Tea on July 5th and to mark this grand occasion the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Tea industry hosted a tea party at 5pm in every time zone creating a 24 hour chain across the world.
Amaya Resorts and Spas too participated in this Ceylon Tea Party and was more than happy to show its appreciation for the tea that has made its stamp around the world and satisfied so many tea lovers and given the country the title of producing the best tea. The resorts  Amaya Beach, Amaya Lake, Amaya Hunas Falls, Amaya Hills and Amaya Langdale, hosted a High Tea at each of their resorts.
To mark this grand occasion Maliban Biscuits made two special biscuits, Earl Grey and Ginger biscuits with 150 years imprinted on it, which were served to the guests. Along with these biscuits, each resort served its version of High Tea with some mouth-watering finger foods and cakes pairing it with a perfect cup of Ceylon tea.
The guests from each and every Amaya Resort truly had a wonderful time and even got a little history lesson as to why our Tea is considered the BEST in the world.

Chester Bennington: Linkin Park vocalist 'took his own life'

Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington has died aged 41, LA County Coroner says.
The coroner said Bennington apparently hanged himself. His body was found at a private home in the county at 09:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Thursday.
Bennington was said to be close to Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell, whotook his own lifein May.
Formed in 1996,Linkin Parkhave sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.
The band had a string of hits including Faint, In The End and Crawling, and collaborated with the rapper Jay-Z.
The album Meteora topped the Billboard 200 chart in 2003 and is regarded as one of the biggest indie rock records of all time.
The band had been due to begin a tour next week.
For a generation growing up in the early 2000s, it would have been hard not to find someone who didn't own a copy of the band's debut album Hybrid Theory.
It's sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and remains one of the biggest selling albums released since the start of the millennium.
Linkin Park's successful trick was to fuse elements of metal and rock with rap and hip-hop to shape the nu-metal genre on songs such as Crawling, In The End and Numb.
Arguably their biggest asset was Chester's powerhouse voice. He had a huge, raspy vocal which suited their stadium-filling, singalong anthems.
Whilst his vocal persona could be described as angry and harsh, in person he was warm, articulate and funny.
The band's most recent album, One More Light, saw a different direction as they worked with prolific pop songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter - and collaborated with UK grime artist Stormzy.
He leaves a wife, and six children from two marriages.
The singer is said to have struggled for years with alcohol and drug abuse, and has talked in the past about contemplating suicide as a result of being a victim of abuse as a child.

Harm in place of healing
I live behind the Castle Street Hospital for Women, down Model Farm Road. My house overlooks the back compound of the hospital.
For the past several years the Castle Street Hospital has been burning hospital waste intermittently, along the wall that borders their property from ours. I have complained by telephone many, many times to no avail. Recently, in April 2017, they began burning every single day.
When I telephoned them they said it was because the CMC was not picking up their waste. I filed a complaint with the Director of the Castle Street Hospital Dr. Gamini Seneviratne and copied it to the Central Environment Authority, the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, President Maithripala Sirisena and the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senarathne.
All of them replied with copies of letters sent to the Castle Street Hospital to stop burning their waste lest they face legal consequences.
Apparently, these letters and direction given by the ministries and from the Secretary of the President himself, holds no sway with the hospital as they continue to burn hospital waste, polluting the neighbourhood and endangering my family.
The latest episode was on July 13, 2017. They have been burning waste, despite the directives almost every day this month, even burning at night and sometimes for two to three days at a stretch.
I look after my mother who is 89-years-old and who has had cranial surgery over one year ago. She has difficulty breathing when inhaling this polluted smoke from the hospital premises. So do I, and all the other persons living in my house. We have had to call in the emergency doctors at Medi Help several times over this.
One day the fire was so high it burnt the mango tree, the Kithul tree and the Kathuru Murunga tree on our side of the wall. Doctors and other staff members had to rush in with buckets of water to stop the blaze lest it spread to the houses located on our side of the wall. In the meantime, we are inhaling toxic fumes on a daily basis-emanating from the hospital.
Is it right for a hospital of all places, to be causing harm to people instead of what they should be doing healing people
What message are they sending to the public when they thumb their noses at directives sent by the Ministries and the President himself Who is running this country The Castle Street Hospital, this is shameful and needs to stop immediately.

Constitutional Assembly: Joint Opposition divided
The Joint Opposition (JO) group is divided over the Constitution making process with one group insisting on immediate withdrawal from the Constitutional Assembly (CA) and the other adamant on remaining in it.
The Federation of National Organisations led by Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara yesterday lashed out at the Joint Opposition (JO) for deciding to remain in the Constitutional Assembly.
This was after the five Parliamentarians from the National Freedom Front, led by Wimal Weerawansa decided to leave the assembly.
The CA was formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year to formulate a new Constitution.
All 225 MPs are members in it and its first sitting was held on April 5 and appointed a 21 member Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to deal with the core issues relating to the Constitution.
In the meantime, six sub-committees were appointed by the CA on fundamental rights, Judiciary, finance, public service, law and order, centre-periphery and their reports were placed before the CA by the Prime Minister on November 19, 2016. The CA has so far conducted four sittings.
Dr. Amarasekara, speaking to the media in Rajagiriya in the wake of the National Freedom Front (NFF) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa pulling out of the CA, made a scathing criticism on the other JO members for not following suit.
We condemn the JOs decision to continue in the CA. The JO is acting against the advices of the Chief Prelates. The people will stand against the JO and reject them in the next election, he warned.
However, when the Daily News spoke to Prasanna Ranatunga, who represents the JO at the Steering Committee of the CA along with MP Dinesh Gunawardena, said they have not taken any immediate decision to withdraw from the Constitutional making process. He said they would participate in the next round of Steering Committee meetings due next week.
We have decided to let the constituent parties of the JO decide separately as to whether they wish to continue in the CA or not, he added.
Dr. Amarasekara further accused MP Dinesh Gunawardena for writing secret letters to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe over problems that have cropped up in the Constitutional making process.

Cooking made easy with Sera coconut milk
Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL) formulated Sera, a smart and versatile solution. Sera is a premium liquid coconut milk, made available in convenient 180ml UHT packs.
The thickness and consistency of Sera coconut milk is no different from that of the first extract of the freshest and juiciest coconut and is devoid of artificial flavours, colours, additives and preservatives means that it will preserve the authenticity as well as the natural aroma, taste and texture of any curry.
Whats more, Sera comes with a shelf life of one year and this enables the product to be stowed away in large quantities in pantries, ensuring that it is close at hand at all times.
The secret to formulating long-lasting, thick, rich coconut milk lies in CBLs state-of-the-art, precision-based manufacturing process, wherein kernels of coconuts of the highest quality are completely separated from their shells, and subjected to high temperatures followed by steam infusions and tetra packaging thereafter.
This effective process ensures that all the natural elements and flavour of the coconuts are locked in and that the product is safe and healthy for consumption over a long period of time.

Elephant owners whose elephants were taken into the Wildlife Department custody filed a motion in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court seeking an order to release 21 elephants for them to use the elephants in the upcoming peraheras (processions) yesterday.
The elephants were taken into the custody by the Wildlife Department from the owners claiming that they were possessing them without valid licences.
When the matter came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID was notified to appear in Courts on July 25 to inquire into the matter. Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana appearing for several owners of the elephants made the request through a motion.
It is to be considered on next hearing date. Prosecutors had informed Court that 38 illegally caught wild elephant have been taken into Wildlife Department custody following the CID investigation into a massive racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties.
The prosecutors alleged that the suspect Samarappulige Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan was the mastermind behind the racket and that the investigations revealed that suspect was directly involved in selling 39 wild elephants and the captured elephants calves being sold for 15 years.

When I was involved in trade union activities, I held discussions with former Presidents and was able to solve issues. Former Presidents respected doctors.They were late Presidents such as J. R. Jayewardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the discussions that were held between trade union leaders and heads of state were entirely different from today. Current trade unions give priority to personal problems and political issues.
He was addressing the second Annual General Meeting of the Graded Medical Officers' Union held at the SLFI in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that he accepted the invitation extended to him by the Graded Medical Officers' Union, as it was good to see that truth could be informed even to a part of the doctors by taking part in the event. The salaries paid to doctors and engineers are not adequate. Doctors' salaries should be increased and by taking this step, we could stop them leaving the country.
"I will support doctors to get their privileges back and solve their salary anomalies. I always dedicate myself to meet the demands presented by professionals, even though they criticize me.
Quarters also would be provided to doctors before the end of next month, using foreign investments. Now doctors' transfers are expedited by the Public Service Commission and therefore there would be no issues concerning them.

Democracy deficit stands exposed
Machinery wears out with time and over-use losing their value and utility. Besides, advance of technology makes them redundant even before they wear out necessitating their replacement with advanced machinery. A similar thing happens in the realm of conceptions too. For example, truth is also replaced by better truth, after or even before it wears out. Thus Newtonian truth was replaced by Einsteins truth, flat earth by spherical Earth etc. This confirms the philosophers view that truth is always relative with each relative truth containing a germ of absolute truth.
We were pushed into this philosophical introspection on hearing the repeated pronouncement of yahapalana politicians and their sycophants that democracy was consummated on January 8, 2015. No doubt, it was a historic victory and a forward step of great significance for it marked a transition from despotic family rule to a civilized government. Yet democracy cannot be stagnant and it has to march forward incessantly.
History testifies to the fact that democracy has developed in width and depth since the time of ancient Greek civilization. It nevertheless does not minimize the significance of ancient Greek democracy. Hence pronouncements that there is already too much democracy in the country are false. They are also dangerous for if there is too much it has to be curtailed.
Counter Terrorism Bill
We would like to look at certain developments that point to a democracy deficit under the yahapalanaya. Take for example the proposed Counter Terrorism Bill. It retains some obnoxious clauses that were in the Prevention of Terrorism Act such as the admissibility of confessions before a police officer as evidence. The major defect is that such legislation is not made available for public consultation before being adopted by Parliament. The same is true of many other bills which show certain contempt for or mistrust of public opinion. This smacks of bureaucratic insolence, to say the least.
It has been the practice of governments to appoint Commissions of Inquiry whenever an issue springs up as a means of dowsing public agitation. The recommendations of such commissions are rarely implemented. The fate of the LLRC and Paranagama Commissions despite pre-election pledges is an example. Some are not even made public.
Even some minor steps that could have been taken to bestow transitional justice to the victims of the fratricidal war that ravaged in the country for 30 years have not been taken. For example, not even a list of the disappeared has been made public despite agitation by concerned family members of the disappeared. The tragedy is many of the disappeared were children handed over to the security forces after the conclusion of the war.
Two and half years after the January 8th victory, many promises such as the appointment of a Truth Commission and the opening of an Office of Missing persons remain on paper.
In bringing legislation the Government has failed to consult relevant trade unions and other stakeholders, as for example in the case of the proposed Inland Revenue Bill. Definitely this is a democracy deficit that has the potential of leading to industrial action by the working people with serious consequences.
Civil society organisations
Much worse is the rejection of public demands without any justifiable grounds to suit vested interests. The attitude of the government, especially of the Minister in charge, with regard to the 65,000 housing unit project in the North is a case in point. The people request brick and mortar houses but the Minister insists on building pre-fabricated houses. The project is to be given to Arcelor Mittal of India. The District Coordinating Committees of Jaffna and Kilinochchi, elected MPs of the area and civil society organisations have unanimously rejected the Mittal project. Residents allege that it is not suitable on environmental grounds and its cost is twice as high as building brick and mortar houses. For example, a similar housing unit built by the National Housing Development Authority costs Rs. 800,000 while that of a pre-fabricated unit built by Mittal would cost RS. 1.8 million. Also, such brick and mortar houses could be built using local labor. Besides a Cabinet sub-committee has called for fresh tenders for the project. Even that advice has been not heeded. Why such obstinacy is a moot point.
Attempts to incite the public against trade unions and other sections of the population in defense of their rights and demands also poses a question mark over the direction the Government is heading for  whether it is an unfriendly direction. Excessive use of the so-called minimum force by law enforcement authorities against demonstrators is also becoming more regular.
Peoples mandate
Most local government bodies stand dissolved for over two years. Government has shown no urgency in completing necessary legislative and administrative measures necessary to have elections to these bodies expeditiously. This gives rise to a suspicion whether the government is willfully delaying elections in order to gain time to put their own house in order.
In todays world democracy has progressed far. It is much more than just representative democracy. It has been our practice elected representatives no longer can be trusted to faithfully carry out the peoples mandate. Once elected, they become masters instead of servants of the public.
People should have a greater say in public affairs. Ways and means of achieving their participation Constitution Assembly should undertake with popular consultation. An extension of the hard-won democracy on January 8th could be achieved only in advancing towards a form of participatory democracy.
Corruption, fraud etc. are not compatible with genuine democracy. The failure of the Government in fighting these vices is also a democracy deficit with wide repercussions. The principal cause for this deficit is the inter-party and intra-party differences in the Government and the actions of the Joint Opposition. The inter-play of all these factions and groups caused by power politics is a principal reason also for the failures of the Government, including the abandonment of the 100-day programme.

Dengue fever is on the rise again in the Ampara district coastal areas. Awareness programmes on dengue prevention are being conducted.
Due to rains, low-lying areas along the coastal belt are inundated which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Residents who have mosquito breeding locations were identified and were warned to clean their premises.
Garbage kept for a long time is another cause for the spread of dengue, officials said. Residents were warned that legal action will be taken against offenders.
The main drainages along trunk roads and internal drainages are being cleaned and distilled to prevent the spread of the disease. Bare lands are also cleaned.
Those who suffer from fever for over two days should seek immediate medical attention from a qualified doctor or a State hospital, officials warned.

DSG Dileepa Peiris gives evidence
Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera:
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris yesterday identified Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera in the Court of Appeal as the person who involved in the alleged offensive behaviour at the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25 last year.
DSG Dileepa Peiris gave evidence regarding the contempt of court action filed against Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court.
When the matter came up for inquiry before the Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, DSG Peiris informed that in the evening of January 25, 2016, he got to know through a policemen at the court premises that Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address the Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknsligoda was just over.
Former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate, informed Court that he was to take legal action firmly against the monk since the offence took place in his presence. He further said he had never experienced such an offensive behaviour by a person in his 12-year judicial career. Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made this remarks in response to a query made by Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva.
Magistrate Dissanayake yesterday concluded his evidence and DSG Peiris will be further testified on next inquiry date.
Gnanasara Thera started addressing Court without obtaining permission thus obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept White Mans Law (suddage neethiya) and requested to release remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner that obstruct Court proceedings, but he continued to do so, the Magistrate said.
Gnanasara Thera began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General branding him and members of Attorney General Department as Napunsakayo, (impotent persons) he said.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnasara Thera.
The Court of Appeal proceeding has listed eight persons, including Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
Further inquiry into the matter fixed for July 26.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred the Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence under Article 105 of the Constitution.
A charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused on a previous occasion.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda was over. The Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
The Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He sought Courts jurisdiction to take legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

GSP+ will up demand for cables - ACL Cables Chairman
An increase in FDI due to GSP+ and the general increase projected for GDP growth by the Government of Sri Lanka would lead to an increase in demand for cables and electrical items in the years to come, ACL Cables Chairman UG Madanayake said in the comapnys latest annual report.
A continued upward trend in interest rates will have a direct negative impact on consumer spending and construction-related activities. This may also lead to a decline in demand for cables and an increase in competition in the dealer market which caters to house builders, Chairman Madanayake told company shareholders.However according to Madanayake, the pressure on the exchange rate will continue to be a challenge to the companys cost structures.
We have been experiencing an increase in wage structures due to increase in demand for labour from the construction and service sectors.
Therefore, it is imperative that we invest in new technologies to improve productivity and efficiency.
Changing weather patterns would have a negative impact on the investment climate since many more resources would be spent on reconstruction and damage control rather than on new development projects, he said.
Since 2008, we have not seen an impressive economic growth - either in the Western world or in the Asian countries. This is one reason why our exports have not shown an impressive growth. Therefore, the challenge facing Sri Lankan exporters is to look for niche markets while maximising the benefits of GSP+.
To cater to the upcoming demand for cables in the years to come, the group has planned to increase production capacity keeping in mind efficiencies, productivity and latest technological developments, ACL cables Managing Director Suren Madanayake said.Moreover, the growth in the local construction sector helped ACL to record an increase in turnover. Increased purchases by government organizations and the private sector contractors and investors boosted company turnover.
Favorable metal prices at the London Metal Exchange (LME) during the first half of the financial year significantly helped ACL to improve its profit margins. Metal prices have shown an upward trend and we may see volatility of prices in the coming year. This will have a direct impact on our margins. The demand for cables is likely to remain at a satisfactorily level due to positive growth momentum in the construction sector.
However, this growth momentum can be disturbed by adverse weather conditions which disrupt normal life and economic activities of people.
He further added that regaining of GSP Plus facility from the European Union may fuel economic activity of the country due to increased Exports and inflow of FDI and will have a very positive impact on the localdemand for Cables.(IH)

Indias dream run to be no. 1  Sri Lanka is where it all began
We play a brand of cricket to be ruthless and to win at all costs - Shastri:
Two years ago is where it all began for India in Sri Lanka when they arrived as the seventh ranked Test team in the world and after losing the first Test at Galle recovered to win the next two Tests and with it the series 2-1. Virat Kohli by then had taken over the reins from MS Dhoni and was making his debut series as captain. That turnaround proved to be the platform for India to reel off six consecutive Test series wins against South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia and today be ranked as the number one Test side in the world.
Kohlis team has arrived in Sri Lanka not just for three Tests as was the case in 2015 but for a full gamut of 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and a one-off T20I.
Explaining the transformation that took place Kohli said, We still remember for us as a squad after the tour of Australia in 2014-15 that we found ourselves being no. 7 in the world. From then on the transformation started this particular series in Sri Lanka gave us belief after being 1-0 down. What it taught us was to come together and come closer as a team and understand our strengths and weaknesses and be defining the rules that we play in Test cricket and take the team higher in the rankings.
Within 12 or 14 months from then we were the no. 1 side already in the world, we just touched it and then onwards we have solidified it. I still believe in the team and everyone in the team believes and knows that this is where it all started for us. Losing the Test in Galle was quite a dent for us mentally. The way the team came together was iconic as far as the last two years are concerned, said Kohli at the media conference held at Movenpick Hotel yesterday.
Respect the opposition
At the start of a new series we see the roles have changed and that Sri Lanka are now ranked no. 7 and India are no. 1. But even though Sri Lanka are not the side they once were Kohli said they would not take any team lightly.
We pay equal respect to any opposition because you can be a strong or weak side but the game is the same, you still have to bat and bowl. You have to earn your victories. I do feel if you want to win a series in any country in the world you have to play good cricket and have to work very hard for it for which we are ready to do.
Like Sri Lanka at present India were at the time going through a transition period and explaining how they came out of it Kohli said, When we started our plans to make a comeback in Test cricket the very first thing we spoke about when we played Sri Lanka was the difference in experience in Test matches between the two sides which was vast. Sanga (Sangakkara) was still playing and Angelo (Mathews) was in the side as well so was Rangana Herath and Dhammika Prasad and all these guys. The team was not even closer by the number of Test matches but what we told everyone in the group was what matters is how much you believe more than the opposition.
You might have played 100 games but if a guy who has played 10 games has more belief than him he is going to end up doing well on the field. This game gives rewards to people who are brave and who are willing to do the hard yards. It is something we have certainly accepted as a team and worked towards. Transition initially can take a few months but after that its all about mentally how much you feel you are ready to be at that level and all that counts, Kohli said.
What has made India tick as the no. 1 Test team is the professionalism they display at every level.
You have to respect the game and you have to take care of the fitness levels, be professional in practice, and be professional in the way you prepare for a Test match. You cant just turn up for a Test match thinking well see how it goes, said Kohli.
Theres a lot of preparation, visualisation and hard work that goes into starting off one Test, a series or two. This team takes equal onus of that and the responsibility and that is the only way you can get results. If the players feel they are responsible for what goes on in the field thats when the professionalism comes out and people start preparing in the background, not many people see but thats what counts.
Keeping in mind Sri Lankas track record at home they beat the no. 1 ranked Australia side last year, Kohli said, Sri Lanka is very strong at home and that is something we are aware of and it is something we will always keep in our minds throughout this tour.
Fond memories of Sri Lanka
Ravi Shastri the newly appointed Indian coach said that his role was to get the players in the frame of mind so as to go out express themselves on the field.
We want the guys to out there and express themselves and play a brand of cricket thats ruthless, where you play to win at all costs. No compromise on that, said Shastri. If you look at Sri Lankas track record playing at home is as good as any side in world cricket right upto the best. As an Indian team we are not going to take them lightly, we will not take things for granted. We like to be consistent so that we keep our no. 1 position in place and above all we look to improve. If we dont look to improve there is no point playing. Youve got to try and raise the bar. 
Shastri who is no stranger to Sri Lanka said, The first stamp on my passport was Sri Lanka when as an 18 year old I came as an under 19 player, my first stint as a broadcaster was also in Sri Lanka in 1994 and now my first stint as a coach also happens to be in Sri Lanka. Obviously there is some connection. Its such a fabulous island with great people and fond memories for me.
Sri Lankas one-day captain Upul Tharanga who was present on behalf of Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal who was down with a viral flu said that the Indian series gave Sri Lanka an opportunity to express themselves against the worlds no. 1 ranked side.
The Test win against Zimbabwe has given the players a lot of confidence to face India. We know what we should do when we are playing such a strong side as India. We know the challenges that are ahead of us and we are preparing for it with our coach Nic (Pothas), said Tharanga.
India open their tour with a two-day warm-up game against a Sri Lanka Cricket Presidents beginning at the CCC grounds from today before moving into the three-Test series at Galle from July 26.

Japanese Govt. grants US$ 611,710 for demining Northern Province
The Japanese Government has decided to provide a grant of US$ 611,710 to Mines Advisory Group (MAG) for humanitarian demining in Northern Sri Lanka, Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma said.
The grant contract was signed between Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganum and MAG Technical Operations Manager Rownan Fernandes at the Embassy of Japan in Colombo yesterday.
Suganuma said that that the project is aimed at clearing of mines to help support the livelihood development in the Northern Province of the country to enable the displaced people to return and resume their livelihoods.
He also said that development projects would be conducted in the Northern, Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces to rehabilitate the irrigation system and water supply with the aid of the Japanese Government.
The Japanese Ambassador further said that the Japanese Government had provided a sum of approximately US$ 30.1 Million for demining activities in the North and East under its Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP).
MAG Technical Operations Manager Rownan Fernandes said that MAG Sri Lanka and the Japanese Government had enabled the removal and destruction of over 10,000 landmines during the past three years. The removal of these potentially lethal items have helped tens of thousands of people to resettle and rebuild their lives in the Mannar District by providing safe lands for agriculture, housing, schools and other community infrastructure, he added.
Fernandes further said, Early this year, MAG successfully completed a systematic survey, which commenced in 2015, in six mine contaminated districts in Northern and Eastern provinces. The Japanese Governments of support was inevitable to achieve this milestone, while continuing the clearance operations in the Mannar District, MAG is also looking forward to commence clearance activities in Mullaitivu District in partnership with the Japanese Government, under this new project.

JVP all out to defeat new tax Bill
Tax concessions and exemptions hitherto given to many vital sectors of the country have been withdrawn by the new Inland Revenue Bill, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said the new Bill that will replace the Inland Revenue Act of 2006 has been prepared to cater to IMF demands.He said they will do all in their capacity to defeat it.
Addressing a press conference at the JVP headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday, the JVP Leader said the Bill could only be defeated by a peoples movement outside Parliament.
The new Bill has withdrawn the 50 percent concession hitherto provided to the income obtained from stage dramas and first print of publications. Those involved in music industry were earlier exempted from income tax, but the proposed Bill has made them liable to pay income tax. The aid given to undergraduates, the gifts of the President, the rewards given to elderly people upon maturity of life insurance will also be taxed, he said.
The MP pointed out education, innovation, agriculture and Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs will also be badly affected due to increase of taxes.
The tax on the prizes of lottery draws has been increased from 10 to 14 percent. The Bill has proposed more tax revisions than a budget. All employees earning more than Rs 500,000 per year will have to pay the PAYE tax.
The tax exemptions on professional bodies such as the Chartered Engineers' Association, Sri Lanka Banking Institute, Universities, Ayurvedic Medical Council, Sri Lanka Medical Council, Sri Lanka Printing Institute, Energy Conservation Fund have been removed, he noted.
Sri Lankans working for foreign companies will also be subject to income tax as per the proposed Bill. However, the income of foreigners who work in Sri Lanka has been exempted from the tax, he added.

Lankas first all-suite hotel to come up in Panadura
White Heaven Hotel Panadura along with a Chinese partner would build Sri Lankas first all-suite 100 room hotel in Panadura. Managing Director, White Heaven Hotel, Sunil Silva told Daily News Business that he has already acquired a one and a half acre land bordering the sea and river in Panadura for this project. We will start construction by next February and the project would be completed in 18 months,he said.
The Chinese investor from Beijing is already involved in the real estate and construction business for the past 19 years in China having built and managed over 12 sky scrapers.
This is the first time the company is venturing overseas,he said. Silva was also a partner and an investor with Chinas J. J. Construction for Sri Lankas first purpose built Chinese five star hotel, Jie Jie Beach which opened in Panadura early this year. The project is a US$ 30 million investment and hotel is now managed by the Jetwing Group.
Silva said that they invest around Rs 800 million for this project which would be a BOI approved venture.
The unique feature of this hotel too would be that modern building techniques by Chinese construction team were used to build the hotel. This the reason we would be able to complete the project in eighteen months.
As we are using engineers architects and several workers from China construction cost too would be reduced by nearly 25%. He also said that in this hotel too they will have 90% power generated from solar and it would be given to a local or foreign hotel operator to manage once its being constructed.
We will have 100 rooms with each room having their own Jacqui, kitchen and many other facilities.
He said that they are leaving almost nine months in advance until March to obtain all necessary approvals which was the main delay for their first JV project, Jie Jie Beach.

Lankan businessmen should strive to negate imbalanced trade
Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah invited the Sri Lankan business community to further explore emerging trade and investment opportunities to make Malaysia as a preferred export destination for Sri Lanka or as an ideal source of imports for local needs.
High Commissioner noted that existing trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and Malaysia must be further enhanced since the contribution of Sri Lankas exports to Malaysia compared to Malaysias exports to Sri Lanka is getting imbalanced.
He was speaking at the 23rd annual general meeting of Sri Lanka-Malaysia business council, held in Colombo. It is the objective of the Malaysian government to deepen trade and investment opportunities in potential sectors in Sri Lanka, and to this end, the Malaysian High commission in Sri Lanka is committed to promoting Sri Lanka as a potential investment destination among Malaysian business community.
In 2015, total trade between Sri Lanka and Malaysia has grown by 12 percent compared to year 2015.
Sri Lankas textile exports to Malaysia have declined in the recent past and gem and semi precious businesses are also not marketed well in Malaysia.
The High Commissioner further noted that Sri Lankan government as well as the relevant authorities in the field of tourism industry should come up with a well -planned marketing campaign to promote Sri Lanka as a preferred designation among Malaysian travelers.

In league against the malady
It took more than seventy years for our country to eliminate malaria which killed more people than wars have ever done. The state workers, both officers and their subordinates worked with great devotion and sacrifice to successfully end the mans fight against (Anopheles) a mosquito. From house to house, office to office, pits to drains, to streams and river beds, everywhere where water was stagnated, homesteads to lands and in all malarious areas, they sprayed insecticides. It was by an organised body called the Anti-Malaria Campaign that worked every day everywhere in the country not, on a particular day or in a particular place intermittently. It was a regular operation, a non-stop operation throughout seven decades.
The anti-malarial used prior to 1925 had been Quinine. Whilst in the same year pamaquin, mepacrine was introduced in 1930, Paludrine was discovered in 1944. I remember having swallowed that yellowish tiny Quinie tablet sharp in taste during an era when the entire country was inundated by the epidemic. I was a brat of five years when these discoveries went into the annals of history. But, when Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane abbreviated as DDT was introduced in the fifth decade of the bygone century, I was a well-bred chap who understood the society. I well remember the way how they launched the campaign. I was a victim of the mosquito.
Mosquito breeding places
The spraying of this insecticide took place in the form of an attack on our houses. The houses were turned upside down and looked ransacked at the end of the operation. On the beds and underneath, on the mattresses and underneath, on the walls, on the ceilings, roofs, reefs and rafters, on the furniture, kitchens, toilets, bathrooms, lavatories and the backyards were sprayed leaving nothing in the precincts or in the environs. This was done in each and every house in the country. Its chemical action was so powerful that the heat of it and the smell remained for many months with un-faded patches. And, no land, no estate, no drain, no stream, no brook side, no riverbed, shrubbery, forest or jungle was spared.
As we reached the stage of ending malaria, a pandemic pestilent disease known as dengue began to spread in the country caused by
(Aedes aegypti) another mosquito. As it grew into an epidemic in 2013, the Health Minister was compelled to get down to the streets in Colombo to study the sanitary situation in the city where he found mosquito breeding places in large scale, stagnant and contaminated water and decomposed garbage everywhere he went.
Awakened by the knock up of the Minister, there were a number of Public Health Inspectors in uniforms after six decades galloping behind to keep pace with him who was leading faster than them in post-haste. All television stations have telecast this instance.
The appearance of the Public Health Inspectors who disappeared about six decades ago was a matter for the surprise for me because these invincible people were not visible in locations where they should have been in their uniforms until the Ministers knock up. They gave it up on their own accord and reported to work, occupied seats in civvies and became white collar workers playing up with people whom they should have inspected regularly. This high handed act existed because of the negligence of the health department and the successive governments that were not interested about the sanitation among the population.
Nobody took notice of this situation and nobody insisted that they should be on the field in uniform, not, on chairs in offices, the whole day. As a result, the daily inspection of homes, homesteads, lands, the urbanised areas, the eateries and catering services were abandoned. It became history and forgotten forever. Since then, we found blocked drains, pits filled with the water turned out to become breeding places for mosquitoes, worms and flies and stench emanating polluting the air. Food catering services became cesspools.
The result of this willful negligence over many decades bore fruit recently in the form of a catastrophe drawing the attention of the whole world.
The attempts so far taken from 2013 to eradicate dengue and the mosquito have failed and we have come across thousands of patients and deaths in the region of three hundred by now.
Keeping environment clean
This situation cannot be overcome by sending 5,000 youths around the country from the SLFP youth League as declared recently. This was done by the past regime too. These were suggestions from the wise guys and wiseacres to hoodwink the people who ruled. The rulers accommodated those impracticable suggestions to pacify their boot lickers. Those boys and girls and men and women had good fun going around the towns and villages at state expense, collected their allowances and left. It ended in one round. This time too, it happened as the youth league leaders declared and ended in one round similarly as it happened during the past regime.
There is no necessity to talk so much about keeping the environment clean. I presume both the right and the left side of the parliament have spoken several billions of words about doing this. Words of mouth cannot make a country clean. Its only the intention and devoted work and concentration of the people led by the health workers could keep the country clean.
There is one remedy. Its the only remedy. Its the responsibility of a house holder to keep the home and the homestead clean. It is the responsibility of a trader to keep the trading centre and precincts clean. Its the responsibility of the respective councils to keep the townships clean. Its the responsibility of the Heads of Institutions to ensure that their departments are kept clean.
Its the responsibility of the Regional Ministers in  charge to see to it that these responsibilities are executed satisfactorily. Its the responsibility of the Cabinet Minister of Health to oversee. For this purpose, he must have his delegates namely, the Public Health Inspectors, a punctilious team.
First of all, it must be understood that the function of the P.H.I. is not a sedentary one. Its a job of work in the field, involving travelling and walking from house to house regularly and punctually.
The calibre of the P.H.I. is the important factor that has to be taken into consideration when recruitment is done. They must be well screened and their family backgrounds must be checked, as respectable people who believe in decorum  correctness of behaviour and dignity have to be recruited for this position as they are expected to mix with families. Many complaints were received during the past regime about arrogant and aggressive Public Health Inspectors who have been indecent and abusive when meeting with ladies in houses in the absence of their patriarchs. The recent example came on page 03 of the
Daily News of 15.07.2017 under the caption Dengue Inspector attacked with a knife. There couldnt have been smoking without fire. A person who builds a harmonious understanding relationship with the people will not face a situation like this. Instead of being aggressive they must work with them in tandem.
A P.H.I. must be attached to each and every Grama Niladhari division. There are about 300 houses in a division or in the region of that number or more or even less, some times. There are five working days in a week for the public servants. According to this example, a P.H.I. must visit sixty houses a day and in the five day week, the individual will visit the 300 houses. This has to go on, on rotation for some time and later on in a zigzag. Going zigzag will enable the P.H.I. to detect or to identify the house holders who neglect maintenance or flout instructions. This rotation will take a Public Health Inspector to a house four times during a month and go zigzag will create surprise visits to keep the house holders awakened.
Regular inspections
During these visits the P.H.I. must handover to a house holder a booklet containing instructions to be followed in respect of keeping a house clean and maintaining an environment free from pollution with a record sheet to be hung in a distinctive place to enable the P.H.I. to record presence on inspection and remarks as well.
The Public Health Inspectors prime responsibility is to educate the residents and lead them to maintain their homes, homesteads and lands to sanitary standards. Regular inspections will make the householders and land owners to compulsorily attend to the maintenance of their residences and properties.
The success of this assignment depends on the rapport the Public Health Inspector maintains with the residents. This functionary must become a relative of the general public and maintain close and cordial relations with them who then becomes part and parcel of their daily life. This will facilitate the P.H.I. to lead them to lead a healthy life by education which every housewife will willingly accept. Imposition of fines and prosecution are only a persecution.
The successive governments and the people are responsible for this situation. Whilst the peoples responsibility is to maintain a healthy environment, simultaneously, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that standards are maintained by the people. However, there is an excuse for both parties as this country was a hell on earth for thirty years during which three decades everything had to be given up unwillingly and unwittingly under the catastrophic circumstances. Therefore, the imposition of fines and prosecution at this moment is unjustifiable. It is seen as a persecution. Once the people are educated and if the educated people flout or neglect responsibilities enforcing the powers vested in the Public Health Inspectors or other authorities will be justifiable.
Many thousands of officers and their subordinates who were attached to the Anti-Malaria Campaign are not among the living today but, those who are among us will remember the humble work they did painstakingly walking through the length and breadth of the country engaging in all the nooks and corners undergoing trials and tribulations for more than seventy years. Its because of their dedicated services that we are today free from Malaria. The certificate that Sri Lanka got from the World Health Organization to that effect is a tribute to them.
Dengue cannot be eliminated in a day or two. Its a Herculean task. Its only through a campaign similar to the Anti-Malaria Campaign we could anticipate an end.

Linear Squared to fast track growth
Linear Squared to develop portfolio of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence products for apparel, telecommunications, financial services and FMCG sectors
Linear Squared, a company that solves complex business problems using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), has successfully raised a significant amount of investment to fund the next phase of its growth.
This new funding round was led by BOVCapital, the first Sri Lanka- and Singapore-based venture capital fund focusing on Sri Lankan ventures, with funds earmarked for developing a portfolio of products addressing key business problems for local corporates, as well as other growth opportunities.
In the era of big data, in which businesses accumulate data related to their customers and processes at an unprecedented rate, Linear Squared discovers solutions to complex business problems that are often hidden within data itself.
Linear Squared makes ML and AI, which was previously thought of as advanced technologies used only in robotics, accessible to a wide range of businesses.
According to Dr. Sankha Muthu Poruthotage and Rajith Munasinghe, co-founders of Linear Squared, One of the biggest challenges the businesses have, even globally, is to derive actionable foresights that can deliver positive business outcomes out of massive amounts of data they have. This requires not only expert understanding about ML and AI but also, deep domain expertise. We as a company integrate all these elements in perfect harmony to provide ML and AI solutions that are designed to drive business outcomes. The investment and the global knowhow that BOVCapital brings will help us get there faster.
Linear Squared already has some of the leading brand names in Sri Lanka such as Dialog, WSO2, MIT, Brandix, and Fonterra in their client portfolio. The company is also in the process of developing a portfolio of ML and AI driven products for the apparel, telecommunications, financial services and FMCG sectors.
Rajan Anandan from BOV Capital is the Chairman of Linear Squared. Along with him, Prajeeth Balasubramaniam (BOVCapital), Jithendran Gajendran (JLN Investments) and Dr. Sankha Muthu Poruthotage form the board of directors of the company.
BOVCapital will do whatever it takes to help put Linear Squared and Sri Lanka on the data revolution map. Comprising a group that includes mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists and software engineers, all with globally renowned academic and professional training in data science, Linear Squared has the rare opportunity to disrupt the way key decisions are made in apparel, telecommunications, financial services and FMCG, resulting in a true global appeal for its products. We look forward to helping Linear Squared achieve its full potential, said Prajeeth Balasubramaniam, General Partner of BOVCapital.

Love in the Himalayas
Her face adorned a thousand posters, commemorative plates and badges that had been made to mark the occasion and her demure looks apparently won over the public in the country famed for its invention of Gross National Happiness. She was 21, a student at Regents College in London when her life changed forever.
He was 31, an Oxford graduate and a fan of basketball and Elvis.
They met for the first time at a picnic when she was seven, and he was seventeen. Struck by her beauty and the glow of inner goodness within, he got down on his knees and said, when you grow up, if I am single and not married and if you are single and not married, I would like you to be my wife, provided we still feel the same.
The wish of Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the fifth king of Bhutan - and the prince charming of the Himalayas came true on 31st October 2011, when he married Jetsun Pema, dubbed the Kate Middleton of the Himalayas the daughter of a pilot, fluent in Hindi and English - as well as Dzongkha,the national language of Bhutan - but modest despite her accomplishments.
As the youngest queen in the world right now, on her wedding day the young bride glided along in a traditional wraparound skirt and ornate coloured heels surrounded by red-robed monks,in a small, private ceremony mixing Buddhist spirituality and medieval tradition, in the heart of an ancient monastic fortress in the countrys former capital.
Dressed in the most wonderfully colorful array of national costumes for her multiple wedding celebrations, she yet looked slightly nervous as the king solemnly placed an embroidered silk brocade crown on the head of his beautiful bride, to make her his queen. He then sat back down on the Golden Throne and placed his Raven Crown on his own head, his new wife sitting to his left and a giant golden Buddha towering behind them.
Earlier, in the most sacred part of the ceremony, the king, his father and the countrys chief abbot, the Je Khenpo, had sought the blessings of the Shabdrung Namgyel, a lama who unified the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan in the 17th century and whose embalmed body is preserved in a small chamber within the fortress. Access to the chamber is so restricted that not even the royal bride was allowed to enter. Instead, she prayed and prostrated herself in an outer chamber before the kings father emerged to place around her neck five scarves blessed by the Shabdrung, and presented her with a golden chalice containing curd that had been transformed into holy ambrosia.
Later, the ceremony moved to the throne room where she prostrated herself before the king himself. She then presented him with the cup of ambrosia from which he sipped, before crowning her. Monks chanted blessings for the royal couple while long trumpets droned and offerings were made for their well-being and long life.
The ceremony kicked off three days of celebration in the Himalayan land. In the afternoon, thousands of people gathered by the side of the white-walled dzong or fortress of Punakha, where the king was entertained by traditional dances. As usual, he spent much more time mingling with wedding guests and ordinary Bhutanese people than sitting still and listening to the entertainment.
Deeply in love with Jetsun the king renounced his right to take multiple wives and vowed that she was the only woman he would ever marry. After the ceremony, he told a small group of reporters how happy he was. I have been waiting for quite some time to get married, he said. But it doesnt matter when you get married as long as it is to the right person. I am certain I am married to the right person.
Meanwhile, Karma Tshiteem, the head of the Gross National Happiness Commission joked: You can be sure that our happiness too, is increasing.

The lure of Treasure
Treasure. Are there any men (and women) who fail to be enticed by this very word  People have paid dearly, sometimes with their own life, to get their hands on treasure. Yes, treasure can consume your life before you ever touch the mother lode. This week we focus on treasure.
Not surprisingly, treasure has been luring film makers since the 1920s. The quest for treasure us an ideal avenue for the film maker to show the extremelengthto which usually good people will go to acquire sudden wealth. This week, I have selected two films, one from the USA and the other from Sri Lanka, directed by two world famous directors, to show the filmmakers obsession with treasure.
The first one is the superb The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (John Huston, USA, 1948) and the other is, of course, the timeless Nidhanaya (Lester James Piries, Sri Lanka, 1972/73), which essentially means The Treasure. These are compulsory viewing for film buffs. Physical disc or online streaming (whatever floats your boat), grab a chair and watch these two masterpieces. Note that Nidhanaya was digitally restored recently, but we do not whether a consumer copy of that print exists. With Martin Scorseses World Cinema Foundation (WCF) being involved in the restoration, we can hope that Nidhanaya will be released on blu-ray by WCF via The Criterion Collection, which has already released two WCF collections.
*******
The Treasure ofthe Sierra Madre
After the credits, a close-up of a lottery list shows the winning numbers drawn in the Mexican National Lottery, dated February 14, 1925. The camera pulls back to the hands of a man holding a lottery ticket and comparing his number with the posted winners. The scraggly-looking, unkempt, dirty, unshaven scrounger [later identified as Fred C. Dobbs "Dobbsie" (Humphrey Bogart)] who is betting on a fortune, tears his losing ticket to pieces and throws it away in disgust. That is how the quest for treasure begins.
In this classic adventure film, two rough-and-tumble wanderers, Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt), meet up with a veteran prospector, Howard (Walter Huston), in Mexico and head into the Sierra Madre mountains to find gold. Although they do discover treasure, they also find plenty of trouble, not only from ruthless bandits lurking in the dangerous Mexican wilderness but from their own insecurities and greed, which threaten to bring precipitate conflict at any moment.One of the film's posters clarified the theme: "The Nearer They Get to Their Treasure, the Farther They Get From the Law!."
To this day, this movie is known for its definitive portrayal of greed on screen. This movie is known for its exquisite cinematography by Ted McCord. Shot mostly on location in Mexico when location shooting was still a novelty, the movie has spectacular landscape shots.
If you have the old special edition two-disc DVD, keep it. If you are new to the film, Blu Ray is the way to go. Warner has done a very good job in restoring this black and white treasure (!) but you will be even more interested in the almost six hours of extras, headlined by the excellent Eric Lax (biographer of Humphrey Bogart) commentary. This is one of the best movie commentaries you are ever going to hear  every sentence, very word has a purpose here.
The other extras includeJohn Huston: The Man, The Movies, The Maverick, a two hour look at the man and the legend, hosted by none other than Robert Mitchum, and featuring interviews with a glut of people who worked with him; Discovering Treasure: The Story of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, another really interesting 50 minute feature on the background of the film, including the mysterious author of the original novel, B. Traven; Warner Night at the Movies, the recreation of what going to a theater in 1948 to see Sierra Madre might have been like. Here you get (after an optional Leonard Maltin introduction) a trailer for Key Largo, a Newsreel, a cartoon (Hot Cross Bunny, and a short entitled So You Want to Be a Detective.
*******
Nidhanaya (Treasure)
In this groundbreaking movie, Willy Abeynayake (Gamini Fonseka) finds an oldmanuscript which states the location of an ancient treasure hidden by a king in a rock cave. According to the manuscript, he has to sacrifice a virgin woman who has four black birth marks in her neck to get the treasure.
One day he accidentally comes across a young woman (Malini Fonseka), who has four black birth marks in her neck. He gets to know her, spends time with her and finally decides to marry her. She notices that her husband always spends time thinking. One day she asks him about it andhe replies that he has to do a religious custom to appease a deity in a rock. His wife agrees with him and helps him with all the arrangements, not knowing what could be in store for her.
After going to the rock, the man starts to fulfill the custom and finally he kills his wife as a sacrifice. But, nothing happens and he could not access the treasure. He comes home and writes the complete story in his diary. He realises that he cannot go on any longer after what he did to his loving wife.
Nidhanaya (1972) is one of the best films made in Asia. Nidhanaya was also included in the global list of 100 best films to be ever made that was compiled by the Cinematheque Institute of France to mark the World Film Centenary. Nidhanaya was entered for the 1972 Venice International Film Festival where the film won the Silver Lion of St. Mark award. It also received a certificate as one of the outstanding films of the year at the London Film Festival.
Nidhanaya was based on a short story by G.B. Senanayake whose film rights Piries bought beforeitcould be snapped up by others. Music was by Premasiri Khemadasa while the screenplay was by Tissa Abeysekara.
Nidhanaya deserves to be seen by the younger generations and also preserved for posterity.

Magical forest creatures from avocado pits
Jan Campbell was preparing an avocado for lunch one day when she was struck by the beauty of the pit inside, an object most people throw away without a second thought. After weeks of pondering its potential, a deeply pigmented surface scratch inspired her to carve away its layers until a beautiful piece of art appeared.
Ever since that day, the Irish artisan has been turning avocado pits (or 'stones,' as she calls them) into tiny, intricately detailed figurines inspired by Celtic folklore. She carves the tranquil faces of forest spirits, the flowing hair of ancient goddesses, and even a handful of wild mushrooms now and then. The miniatures can be simply displayed as statues, or worn as pendants, and are meant to provide the holder with a unique sense of companionship and comfort. Bored Panda

Marriage made on earth
In the backdrop of the Israeli-Indian alliance are realities of occupation, suppression and misery.
Two things I cannot banish easily from my mind: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus remark that the marriage between Israel and India was made in heaven, and an article on Shylock in the latest New Yorker.
Stephen Greenblatt, the articles author, teaches at Harvard but learnt his English literature at Yale, where in 1961 he was denied a research assistantship for being a Jew. Orally telling the 18-year-old that Yales Jewish students were genetically programmed to wheedle money out of the university, a financial-aid officer rejected his application.
Goaded by the slur-soaked rebuff, Greenblatt went on to become one of the worlds best-known literature scholars and a student also of ethnic and religious apartheid. His New Yorker article brings to life the segregated Venice of the period when Shakespeare was alive. It also touches on the cruelties that Europes Jews faced in preceding and succeeding centuries.
I must not steal from the article. Those who can access it will obtain a brilliant analysis of Shylock and of how Shakespeares immortal character found a life beyond what the playwright may have intended, and beyond what The Merchant of Venice plot required.
Pointing out, moreover, that some Christian writers in 17th century-Europe articulated the misery of victimised Jews, Greenblatt also acknowledges that today other ethnic groups and religions have replaced Jews as the focus of the sort of hostility he ran into in 1961.
Palestinian territories
The story of todays Israel is wider than that of Netanyahu, but most in India are unaware of that width. Not many know that American as well as Israeli Jews are among the sharpest critics of Israels occupation of Palestinian territories. Or that Israels oldest newspaper, Haaretz, is relentless in its exposure of Arab hardships in Israel and in the Palestinian territory, where Israeli settlements have taken over the highest and best lands, in the process almost halving the Palestinian area.
A recent Haaretz issue underlines the inhumanity, illegality and difficulty in the Israeli attempt to convert Jerusalem, the eastern half of which was captured by Israel in 1967, into a homogeneous Jewish city. Despite new (and internationally unlawful) Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the decay of the citys Arab sectors, nearly 30 per cent in Jerusalem are Arabs, who, however, are not permitted to vote for the Knesset (the Israeli parliament), unlike Arabs in other parts of Israel, who vote.
Given such realities, the notion of a heaven-made Israeli-Indian alliance sticks in ones throat. A down-to-earth partnership between Indian and Israeli citizens loyal to human dignity would be better, if also more courageous. And one asks if drones and other purchases would require Indias silence on the question of Israels treatment of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs.
Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who signed numerous MoUs in Israel and was the first Indian leader to give Palestine a miss while visiting the area, refrained from saying that India would recognise Jerusalem as an exclusively Israeli or Jewish city, or that Indias embassy in Israel would be shifted to Jerusalem, for centuries sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The world is not yet so pragmatic as to produce a musical of an Israeli-Indian romance where a screen of roses and an anti-terrorist wall combine to hide the realities of occupation, suppression and misery.
Israels friends
Tragically, terrorism is part of the real world that Jews and Arabs inhabit in Israel, Palestine and the neighbourhood, as it is part of real worlds elsewhere. But it was not wholly absent in other freedom movements that we honour. Historians can point to periods in the 20th century when terrorism was a nice word in the vocabulary of Hindu nationalists in India and Jewish nationalists in Israel.
Disharmony among Palestinian leaders is also another unhelpful reality. Still, some Arabs and Jews work together to seek nonviolent solutions for the Palestine/Israel question, even if their impact is not as loud as we might like. The security that walls, drones and missiles provide for Israel from one tense day to the next cannot match the security that can come if its Arab neighbours choose to become Israels friends.
A pipe dream Even if it is, I wish Prime Minister Modi had given expression to something like it while he was there. Even within India, what future is there if we conclude that bitterness between divided neighbours is an unalterable and permanent reality Doesnt every family find out that putting hurtful incidents to one side is the only way to go forward
In any case, India becoming a major power will not excite the world unless Indias voice is raised in favour of reconciliation and justice, which are two sides of a single coin.
Utopian Perhaps. On the other hand, what would you call an Indo-Israeli honeymoon on a magic carpet that floats above dispossessed and ordered-about Palestinians To me that would be a disgraceful betrayal of those in whose laps we were raised. Even worse, it would be a slamming down of our consciences.

No need of divisive constitution: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan yesterday said they did not want a Constitution that would create divisions in the country.
He said they need a Constitution that was aimed at addressing the root cause of the national question and would bring a resolution to the same.
The Opposition Leader made these remarks when he called on visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop at the residence of Australian High Commissioner in Colombo yesterday.
Sampanthan said he was confident that if the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party members in the government work together, formulating the new Constitution can be fulfilled.
We dont want a Constitution that divides the country, but a Constitution that will address the root causes of the national question and eventually be a resolution to the same, and we are committed to working on these lines to frame a new Constitution, he said
Sampanthan briefed the visiting Foreign Minister on the current situation of the Constitutional making process and highlighted that the UNP and the SLFP must work together at this crucial time to overcome barriers and obstacles that are threat to the process.
The country never had a Constitution based on national consensus. This is an opportunity to frame a Constitution based on national consensus which should not be missed, Sampanthan said.
He cautioned that if these efforts fail, there will be consequences which will have an adverse impact on the country.

No SLFP MP will leave govt.- Duminda
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said he was certain that no SLFP Parliamentarian will leave the Government.
Dissanayake was responding to a question from a journalist at a press briefing in Colombo, about speculation that 18 SLFP Parliamentarians are planning to leave the government shortly.
Dissanayake went on to say that there is no need to panic and take a decision on whether to leave the Government at this juncture as the bipartite agreement between the UNP and SLFP will go till December.
However, it can be considered whether to leave by December when reaching the end of the bipartite agreement, he added..
He noted that the political stability of any country is a key factor for attracting foreign investments.
It is natural to have disputes within any political party. The SLFP is not an exception. It doesnt mean that the Government is unstable, he said.
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that the media should act in a responsible manner when reporting disputes as such reporting may convey a wrong picture that there is no political stability in the country. This wrong image may be a hindrance to attract foreign investment.

No travel, trade restrictions on Sri Lanka: WHO
WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Sri Lanka based on Disease Outbreak News of the Emergencies Preparedness, Response section of the WHO website, the WHO website says.
According to information in the website, the statistics of the dengue outbreak is 4.3 fold higher than the average number of cases during the period between 2010 and 2016.
The monthly number of cases exceeds the mean plus three standard deviations for each of the past six months.
Preliminary laboratory results have identified dengue virus stereotype 2 (DENV-2) as the circulating strain in the outbreak. Although all four DENV have been co-circulating in Sri Lanka for over 30 years, DENV-2 has been infrequently detected since 2009, the WHO website said.
Meanwhile, the Epidemiology Unit sources said 97,125 dengue patients had been reported from the country by July 19. The highest number of dengue cases, 41,054 had been reported from the Western Province.
About 21,282 dengue cases had been reported from the Colombo district. The second highest number, 14, 386 had been reported from the Gampaha district. About 5,976 dengue patients had been reported from the Ratnapura district, the sources said.

Nurses warn of trade union action if demands not met
The Government Nursing Officers Union (GNOU) yesterday warned the government of trade union action if their demands are not met by August 20.
According to chairman of the Union Ven Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, his union is committed to safeguard the professional rights and privileges of the nursing community. We will launch a trade union action if the government fails to grant the nursing staff the revised allowances by August 20, the Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Heda Medura in Narahenpita yesterday, Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said the Health Ministry should implement the circular issued by the Treasury Secretary in December 2014 in respect of the allowances of nursing staff.
The Health Minister is attempting to implement a circular in respect of the allowances of nursing staff after having secret discussions with Saman Rathnapriya. We do not want that to be implemented, he said. The Thera said his organisation held a number of discussions with the Ministry Secretary and higher officials of the Ministry to get the Treasury Secretarys circular implemented.
The Good Governance Government has failed in granting the benefits ensured by the circular, he said

Online payment platform for Customs declarations launched
An online payment platform for Customs declarations has been launched under the Central Bank.
The government ministries including the Finance Ministry have been integrated for three years via the platform, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne yesterday said. He said it was launched to put all the government institutions online for the benefit of the society.
The State Minister was addressing the gathering at the ceremony held at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel Ivy Room to launch the platform .
He said of the tax collected, 80 percent was indirect. If we need to bring about social justice, we have to reduce the indirect tax to 60 percent while increasing the direct tax to 40 percent, State Minister Wickramaratne said.
Is it justice when we collect the same tax on a loaf of bread from a person whose monthly income is Rs. 20,000 and from a person who earns Rs 20 million a month. We have to make these changes considering such situations, the State Minister said.
He said the Customs, Inland Revenue Department, and Excise Department was contributing 85 percent of the inland revenue and all the other 300 institutions only 15 percent.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy and Customs Superintendent A. W. S. I. Silva addressed the gathering. Secretary to the Treasury R. H. S. Samarathunga, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury S. R. Artigala, Director General of Sri Lanka Customs Chulananda Perera were present.

Over 2,000 hectares of paddy lands in Matara destroyed by floods
Over 2,000 hectares of paddy lands have been destroyed in the Matara district by the recent floods.
According to Matara Assistant Director of Agriculture N.M.A.Dharmapriya, about 8,000 farmer families in the Matara district were adversely affected.
According to surveys carried out at Divisional Secretariat Division level in the district, the largest number of paddy lands of 337 hectares had been destroyed in Divisional Secretariat Division of Welipitiya.
A total of 330 hectares of paddy cultivated lands in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Division, 310 hectares of paddy cultivated lands in the Mulatiyana Divisional Secretariat Division, 180 hectares in the Pitabeddara DS Division, 174 hectares in the Pasgoda DS Division, 165 hectares in the Weligama DS Division and 100 hectares in the Athuraliya Divisional Secretariat Division had been completely destroyed.
Tender paddy plants and recently sown paddy lands in the Matara district have thus been badly affected by flood waters, Matara District Assistant Director of Agriculture Dharmapriya said.
As relief measures, the Agriculture Ministry has provided seed paddy to affected farmer families in the Matara district, he added.

Paradise Lost regained!
Three hundred and fifty years after it was first published, John Miltons epic revolutionary poem about the fall of man, Paradise Lost, continues to find relevance around the world, with research revealing that new translations in the last 30 years outnumber the previous three centuries output combined.
More than 50 academics around the world collaborated to research a new book, Milton in Translation, discovering that the works of the 17th-century author have been translated more than 300 times and into 57 different languages. These range from Faroese and Manx to Tamil and Tongan, from Persian and Hebrew to Frisian and Welsh.
The scholars, led by Purdue Universitys Professor Angelica Duran, Birmingham City Universitys Dr Islam Issa, and Grand Canyon Universitys Dr Jonathan Olson, found that translations of Paradise Lost often mirror[ed] periods of rebellious ideology or nationalism. In Soviet Estonia, the translation was an act of national resistance against the USSR, they said, while in the Middle East, translations took place during the Arab spring uprisings. Yugoslavian political prisoner Milovan Djilas translated Paradise Lost into Serbo-Croatian in the 1960s while he was imprisoned, writing the epic out on toilet paper with a pencil, and smuggling it out of prison.
We were surprised by the number of languages [Milton] is translated into, said Issa. We expected lots of translations of Paradise Lost, but we didnt expect so many different languages, and so many which arent spoken by millions of people, such as Manx. You assume Spanish or French, but you dont assume Welsh and Manx.
Paradise Lost is, according to Issa, a very universal story  Adam and Eve, the fall  its timeless. And with Milton specifically, there is the revolutionary nature of his writing. He was a republican who played a part in the execution of Charles I, he was anti-Catholic, and theres his characterisation of Satan, trying to revolt against God the father. As a result, at times of political and religious struggle, such as countries trying to move away from Soviet rule, or the Middle East during the Arab spring, people are translating these revolutionary ideas.
First published in 1667, the blank verse Paradise Lost tells of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit / Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste / Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, / With loss of Eden. Miltons Satan is cast out from heaven with his rebel angels, Hurld headlong flaming from th Ethereal Skie / With hideous ruine and combustion down / To bottomless perdition, there to dwell / In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire. He goes on to tempt Adam and Eve, and to bring about their expulsion from Eden.
Milton in Translation, which is published on Thursday by Oxford University Press, is, say the scholars, the first ever detailed research into how Milton has been translated and read across the globe. Issa said: This book shows the real reach of literature, even if its from 350 years ago. It also confirms that Miltons works, particularly Paradise Lost, have themes that are both universal and adaptable to different contexts. -Guardian

Paris Accord  waiting for the one-eyed physician
The day was Sunday July 4, 1955 and time around 10 oclock in the morning. This is the day which gave me my first jolt in life.
We were informed by a neighbour that my father had met with an accident at Dodanduwa and had been taken to the Galle hospital. He was a reputed ayurvedic physician at Gonapinuwela and used to treat a lot of patients from Baddegama, Hikkaduwa and Dodanduwa.
On this Sunday, he left home at about 8.00 am on the bicycle to see some patients at Hikkaduwa and Dodanduwa and he had been travelling from Hikkaduwa to Dodanduwa along Galle Road to see another patient when this accident had taken place.
Fortunately, there were only some bruises. The police officer who was investigating told us that he had been crossing the road when a car had come from his blind side  my father had only his left eye - and knocked him down and that he should avoid crossing on the bike and get down and cross and then start riding again.
Although I never thought about that patient who was waiting for him at Dodanduwa on that day, today I tend to think about what would have happened to the patient.
Paris Accord  the comparison
I tend to think that the Paris Accord is also like my father who had only one eye. Paris Accord also looks at climate change only through temperature and carbon dioxide and is blind to precipitation and water vapour.
Of course, there would be a few differences in that while in my fathers case, only the safety of his mobility was impaired, but not his ability to diagnose and prescribe.
However in the case of the Paris Accord, the diagnosis has already been faulted and as such prescription will also be at fault. Another aspect is that my fathers patient will only wait for a few hours and then would seek medical assistance elsewhere; but in the case of Paris Accord we may be waiting till 2100 AD to know that the whole treatment had been based on CO2 and temperature and not the total array of symptoms.
Unlike in my fathers case, the patients lifetime is much longer and hence the ailment may change a lot during this lifetime.
Roadmap to 2100
The Paris Accord has already diagnosed climate change to be mainly due to the excessive CO2 generated by the combustion of fossil fuels.
The diagnosis is as follows: This CO2 generated by combustion of fossil fuel increases temperature of the atmosphere.
Then this increased temperature due to CO2 will make the atmosphere pick up more moisture to maintain constant relative humidity. When this additional water vapour enters the atmosphere, it would make the atmospheric temperature go up further.
So, the one-eyed physician (OEP) prescribes what is to be done as follows: Instead of using coal  the fuel with the highest percentage of C in the fuel or the fuel which would emit the highest amount of CO2, i.e. 0.37 kg of CO2 per every kWhr of energy generated, we should use other fuels which emit lesser quantities of CO2 per unit of energy generated; for example, gas which emits only 0.23 kg of CO2per kWhr.
We knew when we use another fuel with a lesser fraction of carbon, the other fraction could be hydrogen to give us the balance energy; and this hydrogen will obviously yield newly formed water vapour during the combustion process.
The OEP may have thought that since the global precipitation per year is about 40 times the total amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, every water molecule which gets into the atmosphere from below would also come down in a matter of 7-14 days irrespective of the temperature at which it enters the atmosphere or the parcel of heat content it takes up with it.
The OEP may have thought that precipitation is not a problem; after all it is only H2O and it is something we experience everyday.
Based on this hypothesis, OEP says that only water vapour that could stay back in the atmosphere for any period longer than 2 weeks is the water vapour getting into the atmosphere to retain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature due to extra CO2 in the atmosphere.
Integrated Global System Model Version 2 (IGSM 2) developed by MIT Joint Programme on the Science of Policy of Global Change clearly indicates that the climate scientist community has missed out on the newly formed water vapour (NFW) generated by the combustion of hydrogen containing fuels - oil and gas  introduced in order to reduce the greenhouse gas effect due to CO2 from fuels like coal.
International Energy Agency
When any group promotes keeping the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere below a certain value  a peak beyond which we should try to reduce CO2 concentration in order to limit the increase in temperature - it implies that the group considers (a) CO2 to be the main reason for the increase in temperature and (b) any effect due to H2O to be due to the positive feedback only.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) very proudly says that the only fuel they intend to increase usage is natural gas. Even in their Energy Outlook  2013, they say that they intend to be using 18% more of natural gas in 2035 than that which they used in 2011.
This is exactly what the OEP would have prescribed. CO2 is very harmful, H2O is what we drink; so generating energy while reducing CO2 and producing more H2O is good climate policy. They probably didnt see the harmful side of NFW.
Is natural gas worse than coal
I thought that the best way to convince the climate scientist community regarding the ill effects of NFW over CO2 is to present a comparison table of their effects on the climate. For this comparison I have the usage of coal, gas and oil in 2011 as given in the IEA document. For this comparison, I have identified a few parameters and computed their values for the three fuels coal, oil and gas quantities used in the year 2011.
I have computed the temperature increases due to CO2 alone, NFW as well as any H2O vapour getting into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated atmospheric temperature arising from CO2 and NFW.
These values are given in the table below.
Please note that I am fully aware of the non-linear behavior of the relationships I have used in these computations and am confident that the basic conclusions regarding the relative impacts of CO2, NFW emissions from different fossil fuels considered would be accurate.
I can also explain each and every entry in this table. I leave it to the climate scientists to work these parameters using the different modeling techniques, sophisticated software at their disposal and either verify or nullify the figures given in this table.
I am more interested in the comparison to be drawn between the three fuels rather than in the absolute values of the parameters considered.

+ This is the NFW in products of combustion stream.

*These figures do not include water in the products of combustion stream (NFW).
The outcome of these computations can be summarized as follows;

(1) Potential for increased precipitation due to fossil fuel combustion is zero for coal, highest for gas being almost double that for oil for the same amount of energy released.

(2) Depletion of oxygen in the atmosphere is also zero for coal, highest for gas being almost double that for oil for the same amount of energy released.
(3) Total overall increases in temperature for gas and oil, per unit of energy released, are respectively 68% and 44% higher than for coal.
Paris Accord  One-eyed Physician
When we look at these figures one could easily see what the one-eyed physician, who sees only the impact of CO2 and temperature increases, would do to the global climate.
When the Paris Accord talks about limiting (a) CO2 in the atmosphere and (b) temperature to 20C only by 2100 AD, the accord is definitely turning a blind eye towards NFW and precipitation and we have to wait till the OEP completes the assignment in 2100. In the meantime, all of us will get washed away by the increased precipitation reminding me how my father was hit by a vehicle which was coming from behind. Now that we know what Paris Accord  the one-eyed physician will bring us, we need to identify how we are going to resolve these issues. For us to do that we should know what we will have to confront.
Nearly 60% of natural disaster related fatalities in the world is due to flooding. Right now we are confronting wild fires in USA and Canada and floods in Japan. We have just got over from flooding in California.
Chile, a country using near 35% of both hydro and coal power was also experiencing wild fires only a few months ago.
Thus we need to get over increases in temperature and precipitation both and the above table shows us that neither coal, oil nor gas is going to help us. Right now, coal will give us some consolation in that its contribution to both these happens to be the lowest.
Paris Accord  future prospects
If Paris Accord were to identify a source of energy, without any emissions, which is of universal applicability across the world, there obviously cant be any other better than the solar energy. As it is been practiced today, the main options are (a) solar parks of various types such as photovoltaic, concentrated solar thermal , etc. (b) rooftop installations and (c) floating solar installations. These do have advantages, disadvantages and limitations associated with each of them. A Nobel Prize winner in Physics has said that the main reasons for global warming are (i) deforestation and (ii) tarred road surfaces.
The solar parks, of course, implies deforestation thus depriving the global forest cover certain amounts of (a) absorption of CO2 thus disturbing the material balance of the globe, (b) reflection of solar radiation thus disturbing the energy balance of the globe and (c) water vapour getting into the atmosphere through transpiration disturbing the water balance between the atmosphere and earths surface.
All these are detrimental to the environment and will lead to global warming.
It is in this light we present our innovative highway solarisation  that is dedicated infrastructure to generate electricity to power electric vehicles or main grid using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above highways as a solution for climate change - which will enable mankind to tap solar energy to generate electricity and at the same time eliminate 1.4 kWhrs of global warming for every 1 kWhr fed to the main grid or for charging battery electric ehicles thereby negating a significant portion of environmental damage due to highway construction, as a solution for climate change.
Conclusion
We should thank President Donald Trump for making us relook at coal as a source of energy in a more holistic fashion and drawing our attention to the possibilities of photovoltaic solar as having enormous potential to provide energy for American citizens. He has also made us draw appropriate and relevant comparisons between contributions of coal, oil and gas towards climate change and we would not be surprised if he decides to promote coal power again in USA at 30 to 60 degrees North (we need to note that this is in view of how Hadley and Walker circulations affect USA). Of course, he will surely get American climate scientists scrutinize the data we have provided. In a genuine endeavor to bring in a solution for handling all three climate parameters temperature, precipitation and wind, he may look at highway solarisation as another solution devoid of coal, gas and oil.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing in SL - a window of opportunity
There is increasing hype and attention drawn to pharmaceutical manufacture in Sri Lanka.
Pharmaceutical manufacture is indeed an attractive global industry in which Sri Lanka could participate and prosper. Estimated at USD 1 trillion in 2015 and expected to grow to USD 1.4 trillion by 2020, the global industry size is certainly large and growing consistently. Opportunities in pharmerging markets are growing rapidly and present new and untapped potential. However, there are reasons why Sri Lanka remained insignificant in its pharmaceutical manufacturing capability and capacity, while our regional peers zoomed ahead over the last few decades and must be addressed.
India has emerged as a significant player in the global pharmaceutical industry with a well developed eco system, recording USD 15 billion export revenues in 2015. It is also one of the fastest growing segments of the Indian economy. We have a window of opportunity to leverage the strengths of our immediate neighbour and create a vibrant industry in Sri Lanka which could become the next pillar of our economy. However we must be careful not to squander the opportunity.
The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is at a nascent stage contributing less than 15% of the national requirements. However, the industry has grown consistently over the recent years and is approximately double the size it was 4 years ago. The buds of a re-emerging industry dormant for nearly 50 years. A robust pharmaceutical manufacturing industry would benefit the country in many ways. Saving valuable foreign exchange, increased employment creation, technological advancement and R&D and potential foreign exchange earnings from exports, to name a few.
Considering recent developments in the global pharma landscape, it is not beyond us to achieve a billion dollar export industry in a few years, recognized for consistent quality in our selected segments of the industry. In order to realize the potential of this opportunity we need to act fast and intelligently. The much touted geo-strategic location of Sri Lanka would certainly be an advantage. However, there are many other things we need to get right. First of all we need to identify the right segments of pharmaceutical manufacture to enter into where we are able to builds scale, efficiency and competence and ensure a coordinated effort in this regard. Thereafter, we need to attract sufficient industry participants with adequate capital, but more importantly, product and manufacturing expertise along with the right marketing and market access competencies. Simultaneously, we would need to develop a talent pipeline to operate these high tech enterprises in an efficient and effective manner.
Reaching near self sufficiency and creating a new export industry that could support the Sri Lankan economy and create better health outcomes for our citizens is not an opportunity that presents itself often. The time is now! All stakeholders both public and private must plan and work together to realize the opportunity presented for our benefit and for the generations to come.

Police defend Ryan Jayalath attempted arrest: Inquiry into conduct of CCD

Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath is wanted by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) of the Police for forcibly entering the Health Ministry premises and damaging its property, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Stating that the CCD would arrest him shortly, Gunasekara however said a separate investigation would be held on the conduct of CCD officials during the attempted arrest of Ryan Jayalath on Thursday at the OPA premises.
A tense situation arose yesterday when the CCD attempted to arrest Ryan Jayalath following an anti-SAITM discussion at the GMOA office located at the OPA building.
It was reported that some of the Police officers were in civvies.
As the crowd gathered at the OPA premises protested, the Police had left without taking Jayalath into custody.
Asked about this incident, Gunasekara said there is an arrest warrant against Jayalath, also stating that the Police could arrest him even without a warrant for the offence of storming into the Health Ministry building.
However, the conduct of the CCD officers during the incident has also been questionable. Therefore the Police will conduct a separate investigation into it, he said.

Prasads work lauded at Nawa Kalakaruwo 2017
Nawa Kalakaruwo 2017 an annual exhibition opened to newcomers to the Artists arena where many renowned artists of today gained recognition through their participation in this annual event in the years gone by. This years event of Nawa Kalakaruwo held for the 21st consecutive year had some notable work by 33 artists.
Amongst these participants was a name which raised many eyebrows when they saw his work - Prasad Abu Bakr, who is a notable journalist over the years made his appearance at this years Nawa Kalakaruwo to many art lovers and critics surprise.
However this is not the first appearance that the scribe is making in the field of arts.
I worked in many aspects of art long before I won recognition as a journalist said Prasad who had a very successful exhibition in 2015 organized by the Alliance Francaise De Kotte and sponsored by the Pegasus Reef Hotel under the title ABU Collection.
According to Prasad he began his artistic journey in the early seventies when he was barely 16 year old under the direction Cora Abraham who had her own art school Melbourne Art Classes.
I was not able to take part in any major art exhibitions at the time, other than in the annual students exhibition held by the school said Prasad stating that he was privileged to be the only student at the time to be given a scholarship at MAC as Abraham recognized his talent and guided him through to reach the level he has reached today both artistically and socially.
Prasads career in the arts started as a designer for Batik wall hangings and dress fashion in 1971 and he worked at many batik factories and took part in many overseas batik promotional fairs during that period until in 1982 he found employment in the middle east as window dresser to a well-established perfumery and fashion house  It was not until 1986 that Prasad actually made his major public appearance as a fashion designer presenting his collections at many fashion shows in Colombo  the young explorer in vivid fields who worked as an interior designer during the refurbishment of The Royal Oceanic Hotel (The Beach today) owned by the Jetwing group, later Prasad had a break to work with the National Design Center as an external designer to an ILO funded design development programme in 1989. This also led Prasad to work as an external designer with the Department of Small Industries and later as a consultant to the National Craft Council.
Prasads onset to the field of journalism in 1997  the year he also had his first ever one man exhibition of paintings at the Lionel Wendt Gallery  began as a graphic artist appointed to design the artwork for the first ever Sunday Observer Magazine which was a weekly supplement of the main broadsheet weekly the Sunday Observer.
As he perfected the supplements artwork aspects and his keen interest and contribution to the paper as a writer and photographer was taken notice and he was subsequently appointed the editor of the magazine where he continued and developed into becoming a writer over the years.
So my recent emerging as an artist is nothing new says Prasad stating that he has already exhibited at four major one man events since 1997 solo art exhibition at the Lionel Wendt, two solo photography exhibitions titled Discovering Sri Lanka in 2001 and another in 2005 both at the Lionel Wendt and his last solo painting exhibition titled ABU Collection 2015 at the Alliance Francaise De Kotte auditorium in 2015.
His recent work has taken a turn towards mixing both his passions towards photography and painting and molding them in fusion to produce a series of unusual imagery that has won the hearts of many art lovers and critics alike  Nawa Kalakaruwo was an eye opener to him because this is the first time he has had the opportunity of showing his work besides other artists collectively.
I have been invited to participate in two more major group exhibitions due this year and I am looking forward to them said Prasad stating that he is proud that he has quietly retraced his steps back to discovering the artist in him and working in an environment where he belong most!

President signs OMP ACT
Not confined only to those affected by war:
Another step in path to sustained peace:
President Maithiripala Sirisena yesterday signed the Office of the Missing persons Act. The Act was unanimously approved in August 2016, awaiting executive sanction which was granted yesterday.
Parliament passed the Act titled Office of the Mission Persons Act No. 14 of 2016 for which the objectives include to provide for the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons; to provide for the searching and tracing of Missing Persons; to provide assistance to relatives of Missing Persons; for the setting up of a database of Missing Persons; for setting out the procedures and guidelines applicable to the powers and functions assigned to the said office; and to provide for all matters which are connected with or incidental to, the implementation of the provisions of this Act.
President Sirisena tweeted the signing of the Act last evening saying I signed the Office of Missing Persons Gazette today.
This marks another step forward in Sri Lankas path to sustained peace.
Addressing a Press conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the office would not be confined to those who were affected during the war.
People in Lanka think we have sold the country and people abroad think we have done nothing. There are a lot of things we have done, he said before going onto explain efforts of the government during the past three years.
Transitional Justice has four mechanisms, and among those is the Office of the Missing Persons. This doesnt only look at the period of civil disobedience, it also looks into the Sinhala insurrections in 71 and the JVP insurrection is also in that. But nobody talks of that he said.
Karunanayake said that the Act will now follow the normal process.
The normal process will follow with the Constitutional Council nominating people and the President will then decide who the Chairman should be.
Speaking at the Conference, Karunanayake also insisted that UN Special Rappateour on Human Rights and Counter Terrorism had made irrelevant statements.
We have brought these issues up and hope the UN will make amends. They are only rappaterous who come and give a report and not a part of the UN he said.
Earlier, Emerson speaking at a Press Conference at the United Nations compound in Colombo made critical remarks on the reconciliation process and mechanism.
Karunanayake further said that Accountability would not originate judicial action.
Accountability is a different one, which I dont want o bring at this moment, because I am ill equipped to answer it. It certainly is a very dexterous area and that is not an issue which is binding. All the others are only review process; they are nothing which originates judicial action, he said.

PUCSL approves CEBs Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan
Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, granted approval to the alternate Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018- 2037 of the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB), with the view of ensuring energy security and continuous supply of electricity in Sri Lanka.
The LCLTGEP has been compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037 which includes several optional plans.CEB recommended the base case plan under least cost principals to be implemented for the next 20 years.
PUCSL held a public consultation on the LCLTGEP 2018-37 where stakeholders were given an opportunity to raise concerns over the plan. PUCSL also undertook lengthy studies on all the optional and recommended plans that CEB submitted.
In these studies, PUCSL accommodated the adjustments of updated fuel prices, the cost of externalities (social and environmental costs) to identify the least cost plant addition sequence based on the most sustainable technology to avoid electricity shortfalls in the country.
PUCSL approved 242MW of Major Hydro, 215MW of Mini Hydro, 1389MW of Solar, 1205MW of Wind,85MW of Biomass, 4800MW of Natural Gas, 330 MW of furnace oil based power and 105MW of Gas Turbine power to be added to the electricity generation system in 20 year period.The same plan was studied and proposed as an alternate plan in the LCLTGEP 2018-37 by CEB.
However, it was not proposed as the base case plan by CEB under least cost principals, considering the cost of investment which was USD 15,607.70 million (LKR 2,323.67 billion- without updated fuel prices and externalities costs)
But, after adjusting the updated fuel costs and externalities PUCSL derived at the same alternate plan under least cost principals with the investment cost of USD 13,336 million even lower than the proposed base case plan of CEB.
The investment cost of the proposed base case plan of CEB stood at USD 14,894.64 million

PUCSL stresses on need to start Kerawalapitiya LNG plant soon
The Director General of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday warned that the Kerawalapitiya Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plant would need to be started soon if they are to keep to the CEBs timeline of commissioning it by 2019.
Plans for the 300MW LNG plant was put on hold last week after certain irregularities were found in the tender procedure to select the company which would construct the plant. The plant has been in the planning stage for the last 10 years.
We have to award it now if we expect to keep to the timeline. It is still not clear whether there is a delay but there is a dilemma. The Procurement Committee has to decide on that and they have to decide soon, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said yesterday addressing a media briefing on the Commissions decision on the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP). The scenario they approved, removes coal out of the picture and has LNG play a big role in the countrys energy mix in the next 20 years.
Kerawalapitiya is the first LNG plant proposed in the CEB plan, the DG said explaining that given the time constraints, the CEB had proposed that it be a dual fuel plant in the short term. The PUCSL has continuously warned that the country would face an energy crisis soon if they did not keep to the approved generation plans and implement what has been proposed. Over the last 20 years, the country has had to resort to diesel and thermal power plants to meet increasing power needs as the long term power plants proposed for over 20 years have not materialized.
The situation we are here right now, whatever the reasons, is due to non-implementation.
In the 2013 plan, we spoke of Sampur, we expected it again in 2015, then in the 2018 plan we expected it in 2021. Subsequently it was taken off. If Sampur had been there by 2018, we would not need to be talking about diesel plants now but since it is not there, we need to bridge the gap quickly, Kumarasinghe said.

Row over no gravy ends in death
A row over no gravy at the dinner table resulted in the death of one elderly woman and caused grievous injuries to another middle aged woman and her young daughter.
A 42-year-old man from Mahawela, Matale area had reportedly hacked to death his mother-in-law and also attacked his 39-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter, after he found there was not a single serving with gravy on the dinner table.
The mother and daughter who have been admitted to the Matale hospital is said to be in a critical condition. The man had fled the area following the attack and police have launched a manhunt..
A neighbour, an eyewitness to the incident, said she had heard heated arguments from the deceased persons house and had gone to see what was happening.
When I approached the house I saw Wije attacking his wife with a large knife. Then his mother-in-law and daughter also came running from inside pleading with him to stop. He then attacked both of them with the same weapon as well, a neighbour said.
Then, I too went in and shouted at Wije to stop attacking his family. But he turned on me as well and threatened to kill me if I did not leave. He seemed to be under the influence of liquor. He was complaining about not having a single serving with gravy for dinner, she said.
Also she said that Wijes wife who was seriously injured had returned to Sri Lanka only on the 14th of this month after working in a middle eastern country. The Police are conducting investigations.

Speaking to Daily News Business, he said that Sri Lanka urgently needed a large conference facility to accommodate a large number of stalls. BMICH is not adequate to host larger events and due to this Sri Lanka is losing out on the MICE segment.
The Minister said that they have identified an area within the BMICH to build a conference facility. I have written to former President Chandrika Kumaratunga in this regard and am awaiting her response, he said.
The Minister said that they will invest the Rs 1 billion that is allocated for the project and added that they would look for foreign funding for the balance financial requirement. Asked if any foreigners were affected due to the dengue epidemic he answered in the negative.
Yes, there were a few cancellations and some adverse travel advisories. But arrivals are once again picking up and we are confident that the industry can reach the US$ 3.5 billion revenue target and 2.5 million arrivals by 2017 end.

Sam The Man - we never forget!
Colombo  1957,a boy who had just left school was asked to play the Saxophone for Leonard Frankes band The Manhattans. He never looked back. Music was to become his life for the next sixty years. It took him from the Royal Albert Hall in London to the United States, Salzburg-Austria, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Zambia, The Middle-East, India, Pakistan and Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
The importance of being Nihal Samarasinghe, popularly known as Sam the Man,is more than being an icon of the Sri Lanka English popular music scene.A man like Sam had to be around for sixty years in post-independent Sri Lanka, to lead us confidently in singing the songs of the dominant global culture. As a nation, competing in international arenas with our own dialect of Sri Lankan English, with its own Sri Lankan English linguistic diction, he had to be there.
Men like Sam were the pioneer builders of that popular self-confidence of Sri Lanka as an English speaking nation, singing the popular songs of the English speaking world, anywhere in the world. He earned the accolade King of the Sing Along, having introduced the first Sing Along Concert in Sri Lanka in 1997, together with the Ys men of Sri Lanka.
Sixty years after he left S.Thomas for a career in music, he was laid to rest on Sunday, July 16 2017. His old school in Mount Lavinia in a rare gesture of condolence lowered the school flag to half-mast. It was perhaps the first time that S.Thomas College had honoured an old boy for his music, in this manner. When he was taken away from his home at 50 Hotel Road, Mount Lavina after a simple Buddhist ceremony, college prefects sang the college song before his casket, and carried him away.
He played his Saxophone and sang his songs in his eightieth year in life. That was the beauty of his existence. He leaves behind powerful memories of how he gave brave and beautiful expression to his songs. Those who performed with him with The Jetliners in the 1960s and later with his own Sam the Man and his Gaylords have said of Sam, music had an unexplainable fascination for Sam, the chords coloured his life describing him as a man with an inimitable style of performing.
His music of the night which reverberated from the sanctums of the Old Thomians Swimming Club, leaves behind the echoes of the  Tennessee Waltz, Beyond the Reef, Stranger on the Shore, My Way, Its only a paper Moon, Marie the Dawn is Breaking to the moments of sunset at the Terrace of the Mount Lavinia Hotel with Red sails in the Sunset, South of the Border, Ill take you home again Kathleen or the evenings at the Harbour Room of the Grand Oriental Hotel in Fort with Hell have to go, Moonlight and Roses, Banks of the Ohio, to Darling how can you forget so soon.
This was his flamboyant life style for six decades. Sam the Man with his Saxophone and his songs which brought happiness and left memories of great moments to hundreds in Sri Lanka and overseas, as one of Sri Lankas true international entertainers.
There was also a routine disciplined lifestyle of Sam the Man in Mount Lavinia. He derived his strength from the simplicity of his life style which enabled him to sing along to his eightieth year. On Sunday mornings he used to walk to the Sunday fair at the Mount Lavinia junction looking for herbs, a fascinating organic collection that turns up at the stalls of small vendors, to make his nectar for healthy living. Then three or four times a week he used to walk to the S.ThomasSwimming Pool, for the swims he used to relish.
Away from the glamour of the lights of the many evenings of his life, he knew how to live his life in relaxed comfort. Of course Sam and his wife Felicia were bestowed with a home in one of the few remaining gardens on Hotel Road. Their son Nuwan is pursuing his own career in computer engineering, and his own interest in music in the United States.
It was in that tiny world of the mens changing room of the S.Thomasswimming pool that he used to hold sway. His conversation with a few of us, the regulars who hardly knew much about music, turned into a fascinating exercise. He enlightened us from the history of Jazz and its New Orleans days, to popular English country music, and the issues in creating good taste in western music and song, in Sri Lanka.
He was trying to tell us we have never belonged outside the global home; we all cannot but share with others across the world. They were contained in the iconic nature of some of those songs of the international popular English music scene, he sang for us in Sri Lanka.
In the evening of his life Sam the Man, the icon of our club left with us a picture of a man who has led a meaningful, productive and disciplined life in the Sri Lanka popular English music scene.

## Title: Striving to become the Sapphire capital

Striving to become the Sapphire capital
Last year, Sri Lanka raked in over Rs. 19 billion in exports of its famous gemstones, data from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority shows.
But, government officials say the real value of the gem industry is probably much higher.
Thats because Sri Lankas trade in coloured gems supports a booming black market.
Some estimates by the Gem Authority put the total number of people employed by the industry, both directly and indirectly, and 500,000. And because the state owns the rights to anything extracted from the ground, thats potentially a lot of government revenue.
But, out on the ground, in the supply chain linking miners and local gem traders from the interior to the big showrooms and buyers in Colombo, the gem trade remains kind of a Wild West.
A former chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority told the Daily News this week that he believes a majority of gems are sold on the black market, to avoid paying taxes.
This is backed up by a 2015 study, by the Oxford Business Group, which found that the actual value of gem exports is probably significantly higher than the reported numbers, due to unofficial business, smuggling, and undervaluing.
The government agency that regulates the gem trade wants to implement a stricter gem certification scheme to wrangle business out of the black market.
But, a unified solution seems far down the road.

Blue gems, black market
Sitting in his home in Ratnapura, which means, literally, city of gems, former National Gem and Jewellery Authority Chairman Asoka Jayawardena said he believed only a small percentage of excavated gems are sold on the open market.
Many usually sell it to people they know, he said. This way, they avoid paying taxes, he added.
To declare a gems value in an official sale, at an open auction, for this people have to feel patriotic and that they are doing something for the country, he said. Only then will they care to pay their dues properly.
Jayawardena said the government is losing a lot of value amidst a global sapphire boom.
Forbes reports that sapphires are now rivalling diamonds in popularity for engagement rings. This surge is largely driven by the fact that Prince William of England proposed to Kate Middleton with a Sri Lankan blue sapphire engagement ring.
The ring previously belonged to Princess Diana, after Queen Elizabeth II was given it as a gift on a visit to Sri Lanka. The publicity has driven up demand for Sri Lankan sapphires specifically.

Putting a history to the stone
But, right now theres no official way for an international buyer to be sure their blue gem is actually an island sapphire.
When you take a diamond, their processes are extremely strict. Every stone has a history, Jayawardena said. If Sri Lankan sapphires had to go through a similar certification for origin as diamonds, he said, a lot more value would be brought back into the official market. Buyers would be assured their blue sapphires were authentic, and from Sri Lanka.
Back in Colombo, current government officials say they are working on creating such a process.
Thats a good idea, Director of Valuation K.L.D. Dayasagara said at the headquarters of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority on Thursday. But thats a lot of work.
Dayasagara said to develop a mandated certificate to ensure a sapphires Sri Lankan origins, the government authority would have to develop a deep database of information about sapphire composition worldwide.
He said that theyd have to obtain primary samples of sapphires from other gem-producing countries, like Nigeria and Madagascar.
Every gem has distinctive features, like birth marks, that indicate the place they were formed, Dayasagara said. These are called inclusions.
To certify sapphires as Sri Lankan sapphires, data on the gem inclusions need to exist in a single place.
Dayasagara could not say when exactly such a certificate would be rolled out, or if there is a specific programme spearheading this work.
Its probably two years down the road, he said. Its part of a broad effort  to promote Sri Lanka as the sapphire capital.
He agreed with former Chairman Jayawardena that a lot of sapphires and other gems are lost to the black market. Its probably about half and half, he said.
To export gems, its a small payment, half a percent, he said. But people smuggle gems to get around the fee.
That is nature, human nature, he added. It happens when you can carry a stone worth billions just in your fist.

Certification: its a crazy world
Out in the myriad gem showrooms of Colombo, gem sellers dont have much of an appetite for the governments plan.
Whatever we export already goes through the Gem and Jewellery Authority, said Ihthaisab Hussein, a jewellery manager at Zam Gems.
Zam is one of the largest gem and jewellery exporters in the country, according to their promotional materials.
The government values it, we cant even undervalue it, he said. Any way, it has to go through them.
He pointed to the many ways of certification that already exist. Hussein said that for their largest pieces, they get certificates from large international labs, like the Gemmological Institute of America or Gem Research Swisslab.
These labs analyse gems for colour, carat, clarity, and cut. They also can tell if a gem is a fake or not. For smaller pieces, Zam has three to four in-house gemmologists, Hussein said, who can issue a certificate for a buyer.
But ultimately, its the buyers choice of where they want a certificate issued from, if they want one at all. Private labs exist in the city, like the Gemmological Institute of Colombo and the French Gemmological Laboratory.
Both the GIC and FGL turned down requests by the Daily News to speak about their facilities.
Dayasagara, of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, says that the lab he directs is the domestic standard.

Fake stones
But, there are complaints about the government lab. A small-scale gem seller in Ratnapura, the heart of the gem trade, said he and other merchants have been asking the National Gem and Jewellery Authority to set up a facility to test for fakes in their city for years.
Now, they have to send their products to Colombo for certificates, which can add unnecessary delays and kill sales.
He wished to remain anonymous as to not compromise his business.
Testing and certification is important because gem sellers dealing in fake gems is a real problem, according to Dayasagara. He said that even on Wednesday, a gem owner came in with a certificate from an Indian lab that did not say whether the stone was fake or not.
In May, police arrested a gem shop owner for selling fake blue gemstones to a tourist in New Zealand.
The jewellery authority is beginning to make it mandatory for all gem shops to have certificates, Dayasagara said. To obtain a permit next year, they must show that 15 percent of their stock has certificates.
To issue that many certificates, well have to work around the clock, Dayasagara said.
Mahmood Farook is a gem seller at Serene Gems, in Bambalapitiya. He said many of his shops stones already carry certifications from the government gem authority.
Our most important product is trust, he said.
He added that he didnt have an opinion on certifying sapphires for origin, as most of his business was focused on selling to local buyers and tourists face-to-face, and not through the export market.
On a wall on the back of Farooks shop is a picture of Kate Middleton, now Duchess of Cambridge, displaying her Sri Lankan sapphire ring. In display cases, sapphires glittered in all shades of blue, offset by red rubies and garnets, and yellow topaz.
This is our Sri Lankan pride, he said. At the end of the day, we have to sell good gems  because we have a reputation, no

Tax on abandoned land, a welcome move: WPC CM
The public showers praise on the Western Provincial Council for imposing the <U+200B>two percent
tax on the total value on abandoned lands in order to control dengue. It is observed that many land owners have since visited their abandoned lands and cleaned them up, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Western Provincial Council Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that presently it was the abandoned state lands which needs to be cleaned up as the public clamour for it. The issue would be brought to the notice of the President. A formal request would be made from all Cabinet Ministers to get the abandoned lands belonging to their ministries cleaned up as soon as possible in order to control dengue mosquito breeding.
According to the Chief Minister, fogging (fumigating) is useless when it comes to controlling the Dengue menace due to dengue mosquitoes hiding in places where the fumes do not reach directly. Therefore, fogging only helps give the public just mental satisfaction. All types of chemicals used for mosquito control such as mosquito coils, Malathion, etc are poisonous to the people. It would take at least two years to find a scientific solution for the control of the dengue mosquito. Therefore it was the responsibility of the people to keep their premises free of mosquito breeding sites.
The CM does not have any right to dump garbage at Karadiyana. This garbage storage would be modified, while a new project would commence soon. Garbage only from certain areas such as Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Dehiwala, etc., will be disposed there.
Responding to a question posed by a journalist, he said that he would campaign for filling up the entire nomination list from women candidates in the upcoming Provincial Council elections, which would not only be 25 percent. But here in Sri Lanka, less women come into politics because of culture., etc. Responding to a question posed by a journalist, he said that he would campaign for the filling up of the entire nomination list from women candidates in the upcoming Provincial Council Elections and not only 25 percent, but here in Sri Lanka, less women come into politics because of the existing culture in the country.

UK Human Rights Report indicates improvement in Sri Lanka: Expresses concern over inter-communal tension

The United Kingdom (UK) Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 2016 report on Human Rights and Democracy noted that while Sri Lanka saw progress it several areas, much remained to be done.
The human rights situation in Sri Lanka saw some improvement in 2016. The Government of Sri Lanka made progress against some of its commitments reflected in UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 30/1, but much remains to be done, the report said.
It highlighted in particular inter-communal tensions stoked by the hate speech of members of extremist nationalist groups as well as discrimination against LGB&T persons:
Inter-communal tensions remained an area of concern, it said,  adding that discrimination against LGB&T persons remained a problem,.
It welcomed the passing of legislation establishing an Office of Missing Persons, saying it was an important step towards reconciliation, and said that it hoped the constitutional reform process would address issues of devolution and introduce a Bill of Rights.
The Sri Lankan Government is committed to repealing the much criticized Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and is drafting new counter-terrorism legislation which it intends will be compliant with international human rights standards, the report said.These would be important steps in removing historic grievances and strengthening human rights and the rule of law in Sri Lanka.
It reported that the government announced further land releases in 2016 and that while the military maintained a significant presence in the north, the lower profile it took was generally welcomed.
The UK has consistently called for the acceleration of land releases and the demilitarisation of the north. Some prisoners held under the existing PTA were released, though many remain in detention without charge,  the report added.
Reports of surveillance, intimidation and harassment by the security forces (have) continued in the north and east, although at much lower levels than under the previous government, it further said.
Sri Lanka continued to engage with the UN and invited a number of UN experts to visit the country, including the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the report said, adding: He reported full cooperation by the government, but raised concerns about the standard of detention centres and continued cases of torture.
'The UK continued to support Sri Lankan Government efforts to develop a more capable, professional and accountable police force, with the aim of reducing the risk of human rights violations, including torture, and improving public confidence in the rule of law, the report said.
'The UK also provided support for the UNs work on reconciliation and peace building, and demining in the north. The then FCO Minister for Human Rights and the Commonwealth, Baroness Anelay, visited Sri Lanka in November and underlined the UKs commitment to support reconciliation and accountability.'
'The minister also highlighted UK work to help tackle sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka and the importance of accountability and tackling the stigma suffered by victims. She welcomed the Sri Lankan Governments endorsement of the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict earlier in the year.'
In 2017, the UK will continue to support and encourage Sri Lanka to make further and faster progress on human rights. We will continue to work with the Sri Lankan Government, international partners and civil society to support delivery of the commitments that Sri Lanka has made to promote accountability, reconciliation and human rights and look forward to the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lankas progress before the HRC in March 2017, the report said.

In the aftermath of the conflict, the United Nations, through the work of its agencies, funds and programmes on the ground, has assisted with the safe and dignified return and resettlement of civilians uprooted by the conflict.
The UN has also encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to adopt policies to promote political reconciliation and a credible accountability process for allegations of wartime violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.

Indirect tax needs slicing to 60%
Over 80% of Sri Lankas tax revenue is collected via indirect taxes and this should be brought down to 60% soon, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne.
Speaking at the implementing a state-of-the-art online payment platform by LankaClear for Customs payments in partnership with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka the Minister also said that it was sad to note that persons earning Rs. 20, 000 to 200, 000 pay equal amounts of taxes of those who earn Rs two million and this too should change.
The Minister said that the three key tax collecting institutions are Inland Revenue, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department and they account to 85% of government revenue. The other 300 plus state institutions only account to 15% of the government revenue, Wickramaratne said.
Commenting on the LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP) he said that it is a great tool to take Sri Lanka closure to a cashless society. We also observe that online and cashless transitions are on the rise and over Rs. 1.7 trillion transactions were done via SLIPS system. In addition there was ATM transaction done to the tune of Rs. 244 billion last year.
The Finance State Minister said that the entire country should move towards a cashless society and the government will also automate all state institutions in three years and steps were taken in this regard.
Governor Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, said that this is a red letter day for Customs department which was set up 200 years ago in 1809 which makes it one of the oldest, Customs administrations in the world. This is also an import mile stone in Sri Lankas crusade towards moving to a digital economy.
W. S. I. Silva Superintendent of Sri Lanka Customs stated that this was one of our key initiatives and fulfills a long awaited requirement of all our traders. Sri Lanka Customs have strived to improve efficiency in all our processes to provide an enhanced service to importers/exporters and general public and reaching this milestone was yet another positive step in this direction. We perform over Rs. 2 billion transactions a day and this platform would help them to provide a more efficient service.Prior to launching this revolutionary platform, only the importers, exporters who maintained their bank accounts at the two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank, were able to make direct Customs payments online while other importers, exporters had to go through a tedious process, explained Anil Amarasuriya Chairman LankaClear.
The new system would totally eliminate the previous inefficient payment process that resulted in unnecessary delays and impacted the businesses of the importers, exporters.
This initiative was taken as a result of Sri Lanka Customs requesting the support of the Central Bank to facilitate the importers/exporters to make online Customs payments on a real-time basis from any bank in the country.
The customers can now directly connect to their respective bank via any channel connected to CEFTS (Internet, Mobile, ATM or Over the Counter) to make the required payment to Customs. Further, these payments will be credited on a real-time and 24 X 7 basis using CEFTS to the designated SL Customs bank accounts at Bank of Ceylon or Peoples Bank. LankaClear system provides SL Customs with the required payment confirmation details on a real-time basis while the relevant reports and other information to be provided had also been agreed upon mutually for reconciliation purposes.
The settlement of the payment between the two state banks and other commercial banks would be via Central banks Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and will be under the direct regulation and supervision of the Central Bank. LankaClear payment systems are Payment Card Industry  Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Version 3.2 and ISO 27001:2013 certified to ensure the highest level of security compliance. T
hese standards are internationally recognized and widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to ensure the security of payment transactions.
The initial system went live with the participation of Bank of Ceylon, Sampath bank and Commercial Bank while the seven other banks who have already been certified with the new system would also go live shortly.

No coal power deemed cheaper
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday approved the No coal scenario of the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) Least Cost Long Term General Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 as they pointed out that the cost of externalities would make no coal power generation cheaper than that with coal.
This is in line with the government policy of not building any new coal power plants in the near future. The President has directed the CEB to target 70 percent of power generation to be from renewables by 2030.
With coal removed from the table, the PUCSL has approved 242MW of major hydro, 215MW of mini hydro, 1389 MW of solar, 1205MW of wind, 85MW of biomass, 4800 MW of natural gas, 330MW of furnace oil based power and 105MW of gas turbine power to be added to the electricity generation system in the next 20 years. The Commission also hoped that in the next generation plan, the CEB would be able to increase the number of renewables to 60 percent of the mix, at present it stands at around 45 percent.
The CEB had earlier submitted three scenarios including the coal scenario (base case or preferred option), no coal scenario and the limited coal scenario.
Subsequent to public consultations and our studies, we asked the CEB to submit more scenarios and they did and we chose to go with the no coal scenario, said the PUCSL, Director General, Damitha Kumarasinghe as he announced the regulatory bodys decision on the long term power generation plan for the country.
Kumarasinghe further explained that the two main considerations taken into account in their decision was the cost of fuel and that of externalities- the latter which the CEB had not taken into account in their own calculations.
The CEB has chosen to cost coal at USD 69 per metric ton based on Lanka Coal prices based on the average prices in the last two years and LNG was priced at USD 10 /MMBtu according to Japanese Crude Cocktail (JCC) prices.
The PUCSL however had chosen to base all fuel prices on index prices to get a more realistic value,
With transportation and unloading costs, we costed coal to be USD 81 per metric ton (according to the Newcastle coal price index) and LNG to be 8.4$/MMBtu (JCC prices but similar to the recommendation by the Petroleum Resource Development Secretariat), Kumarasinghe said.

Advocating reconciliation friendly media
Three sensitization workshops were organised in Colombo, Kandy and Kurunegala Districts to advocate reconciliation friendly media to Journalists by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation. Over 150 Journalists discussed the 'Role of Media' in conflict transformation, reconciliation and peace building.
The Ministry under the direction of President Maithiripala Sirisena has developed a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in which reconciliation friendly media has been identified as an important initiative.
Globally it is acknowledged that the media has an important and strategic role to play in building national integration and peace building. At the workshop, the Journalists identified that media can contribute to conflict transformation on one hand and also contribute to the escalation of conflict on the other hand. Discussions illustrated that media can make or break the peace, said the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, V. Sivagnanasothy.
The discussions by journalists highlighted that based on international experiences, in Kenya the media spread hate messages which created atrocities and led to genocides in the early 1990s. Subsequently, the Kenyan government established a team to monitor hate-speeches on social media. Such conflict barometers with a number of high-intensity conflicts helped to track the progress on peace building which helps journalists to report on the peace status of the country.
Media influences to shape perceptions, condition behaviour and impacts the minds, attitudes, emotions of readers and community at large. The journalists at the discussion pointed out that the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity be respected while fair and non-discriminatory reporting is a prime responsibility of journalists. Journalists are truth tellers but, media has a moral responsibility to promote reconciliation. Discipline in Reporting on conflict related issues were considered as important by many professionals. The workshop discussed that conflict sensitive journalism focuses on democratic, pluralistic and just society.
Peace journalism is where editors and reporters make choices about what to report and how to report - to create opportunities to value non-violent responses to conflict. The discussions highlighted that 'Peace Journalism' is seen as a special mode of socially responsible journalism which contributes to peaceful settlement of conflicts.
In this context, the participants discussed that Journalists can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The role of Journalists as a neutral disseminator be objective, impartial, integrity, ensure fairness, and balance in reporting. The Journalists openly discussed that the professionalism of Journalists gets eroded due to personal emotions, interest, prejudices, audience preference, lack of ethics, concern for being overly market oriented or economic oriented, influenced by negativism or influenced by elite groups or one-sidedness or socially irresponsiveness and failure to look at diverse perspective.
The Journalists concluded the careful presentation of facts, reliable and varied sources, experts opinions, supporting documents, accurate quotations and fair representation of major view points are vital for a balanced journalism. The media helps to create political setting, policy setting and public opinion which help to bridge gap between perpetrators of conflict and victims. The sensitization workshop concluded that the Journalist's professional responsibility of independence, objectivity, impartiality and truth telling and fairness are fundamental while the social responsibility and public interest demands peace journalism and reconciliation friendly media that focuses on Journalists being a part of the solution to the problem and help to build sustainable peace, harmony and national integration and reconciliation said Mr.V.Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
At the workshop the Journalists also observed and endorsed the declaration on national integration and reconciliation which was initiated by the Ministry during the national integration and reconciliation week declared by the Cabinet of Ministers in January 2017.
This workshop was attended by Hon.A.H.M.Fowzie, State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, Mr.V.Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Mr.Imtiaz Bakeer Markar, Chairman, Bakeer Markar Centre for National Unity and Senior Government Officials , several Journalists and academics .

ANTIC CHARMS WITH VINTAGE STYLE
Juliet Coombe discovers a colourful lifestyle historic house/hotel concept ANTIC with stunningly vibrant rooms, highlighting how the historic buildings were made with coral and shells, ranging up to regal suites overlooking the magnificent rampart walls.
Mohamed Irfan Ismail, creator of ANTIC, a hotel brand that celebrates the history and the living artistry of Galle Forts merchant life, was himself born in this ancient citadel four decades ago; the love for it has never left him. Ismail spent his early childhood years exploring the old colonial houses where family and friends lived and would share wonderful stories over mouth-watering food and spice-tea. And, as the sun set, he would play cricket on the rampart walls near his historic home, 68 Leyn Baan, and it was in these halcyon years that he realised the true importance of the four hundred year old Fort Galle. However, the thirty-year civil war forced his family to look overseas for work opportunities and education, something which Ismail hugely appreciates, as he knows how much this has taught him from learning French to business skills and, most importantly of all, the true value of his historic home.
A surprise element
Ismail, over tea, will wax lyrical, the fort is so special, with its mystique and magical charms that are something you cant really explain; its something you have to experience. It was out of this that his wish to share ANTIC was born and he combined all his skills as a designer and salesman, I am a passionate gemologist by profession, and one can see this in his ANTIC jewellery collection, which mixes the artistry of history with vibrant interior designs that form the ANTIC Galle Fort jewellery collection that captures the iconic spirit of the fort. Even his light fittings set into a boat helm are made from different coloured bottles and to tell the story of the fort, instead of being in pictures inside, he has made the exterior frame work of the building his gallery space, to depict the colourful story of colonial history, trade and tradition, for the world and all that walk past. Ismail explains, They might not stay this timebut they will remember the art which is full of stories and return and that is all any hotelier wants.
As an entrepreneur with a love of the French language and the golden age of trade, when the Dutch East Company ruled the waves, Ismail is not frightened to wave the rules to create truly special experiences for his clients from a dream wedding, complete with ox cart procession, to celebrations with a surprise element, including cooking classes that dare to be different, teaching you the art of making short eats and throwing roti like a professional. For him, the client is king or queen as he puts it, with a twinkle in his eyes and he would rather everyone remembered the city and the kindness of its people than have to put their credit card on life support. Why Well, its simple; Ismail wants you to tell everyone, as nothing, not even Google, is as powerful as word-of-mouth. His long term ambition, being a modern day merchant with vision and a love of the high seas, is to create ANTIC as a global brand so he can show the world how important historically his island Sri Lanka is, and in the process share its rare qualities of hospitality that you will have to search the world hard to match.
The ancient citadel
Ask him why this is so important and he will explain that Muslims are highly respected here and part of a community made up of all religions. Muslims are proud to take part in organising Sinhalese festival sports, contributing to cultural events and being part of the annual Buddhist Vesak festival, feeding all that visit the ancient citadel over the two-day religious holidays. It is a place where people, young and old, matter and the ancient wisdom of sharing is more important than what you gain in this lifetime; people have the wisdom in their souls that tells them it is not what you tweet or post on Facebook that matters, but the knowledge you leave behind for future generations.
Ismail, in a bid to save these historical houses, this season, has opened the stunning ANTIC 64 and also the ANTIC Shaheen Falcon House, where the author of Around The Galle Fort in 80 Lives once lived, with the best positioned four-bedroom villa property, with en suite bathroom overlooking the walls and old working Lighthouse that can be enjoyed in the heart of the old city. A place where, through her many books and typed notes, you will discover the true voodoo of this fascinating spot. A place she says is An area populated by traditions, inherited and invented, inverted and subverted. As the rays cross over the walls and then light up the rooms of this delightful four-bedroom villa, one can sit outside on tea planters chairs and watch the lighthouse guide the fishermen and occasional cruise vessels safely back into the harbour.
An extraordinary place
Staying in one of ANTICs portfolio of historic houses is like living poetry, full of old worldly opulence and all the colours of a rainbow, shrouded not by water but by men and women, spanning the entire genealogy of genes and a race whose story is spun on a mosaic-like pastiche and fabric, composed of architecture consisting of a fragile beauty and robust synthesis. A naturally agile environment, tamed by its dwellers, left over from the golden age of trade, untamed by its possibilities and a language astutely and acutely coloured by comical humour and laconic intelligence.
Galle Fort, in truth, is a heaving behemoth of idyll and irony, a haunting paean and lusty song that inspires the Fairway Galle Literary Festival of writing, gourmet food events and other important cultural shows. ANTIC now lets you share this quirky paradise; a simple world with incredible historic sites, where people still matter more than anything else, and the only noise is the seagulls and crows, mixed with the rickety racket of the fish sellers on singer bikes, and the musical din of the daily street food vendors blended with the call to prayer five times a day, the clatter of church bells and the Buddhist daily chants. An extraordinary place where curses become accursed, cupid rests in potions and religion is why the spirit of the place lives on in everyone who visits, staying in one of ANTICS fabulous collection of properties, from the Artist House, which is beyond fabulous at 3/1 new lane 1, Fort Galle, to number 64 on Leyn Baan Street and now 42, Hospital Street, opposite the lighthouse and by the Meran mosque; there is truly something here for everyone who wants to experience life the way the people of the old quarter have done for generations and in stunning interiors that are playful, fun as well as theatrical, which will make every stay truly memorable.

Australian FM promises major assistance to combat dengue
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop announced a major Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka.
She made the announcement when she called on President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidents Residence in Colombo yesterday.
Recalling that President Sirisena made a special mention about the spread of dengue and chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka during his recent state visit to Australia, Bishop said Australia would launch two programmes to assist dengue prevention.
Foreign Minister Bishop said Australia would provide Rs. 58 million for the World Health Organisation to implement immediate dengue prevention, management and eradication programmes in Sri Lanka.
She said Australia will provide additional Rs. 118 million for a research partnership between Australias Monash University and Sri Lankas Health Ministry to test the introduction of naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to eradicate dengue fever from Sri Lanka.
Bishop said the bacteria prevent transmission of dengue virus among humans. It has shown success during the last six years in countries such as Brazil, Columbia, Australia, India, Vietnam and Indonesia.
The bacteria have the ability to block other mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and Chikungunya as well.
President Sirisena expressed his gratitude to the Government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the people of Australia for providing assistance at a critical time.
He said several agreements and MoUs were reached during his visit to Australia.
The two countries should implement them to ensure benefits to the people, he said.
The Australian Foreign Minister thanked the President, the Government and the Navy for cooperation extended to curb human smuggling.
The President said the two countries should cooperate to curb illegal trafficking of narcotics.
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando, Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon and Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson were also present.

Beef and Buffalo..!

India has a peculiar problem at the moment: Beef has been banned more or less throughout the country, and armed gangs roam, searching vans and trucks, thrashing those they think are carrying the flesh of cows and bulls.
Unfortunately, apart from taking the law into their hands, most of those vehicles are not transporting beef but buffalos meat.This is getting embarrassing! said a senior government official, Our prime minister himself has said that this kind of attacking should be stopped!
What do you plan to do I asked, Increase the police force along highways and other roads
No, we plan to train the country to recognize the difference between buffaloes and cows! We have already started classes. You may peep in and see!I looked into a class filled with cow vigilants, ruffians and mobsters, still carrying bloodied sticks, glued to the blackboard, some even taking notes.
This, said the teacher, Is a buffalo!
There was a murmur throughout the room, with certain of the mobsters looking at each other in amazement, Many of them never knew the difference! said the official and then stopped short as a vigilant got onto his feet and challenged the teacher, How do you know he asked and all the other mobsters agreed.
Well there are definite differences! said the teacher.
Are you a meat eater asked another cow vigilant.
That has nothing to do with what I am teaching you today! snapped the teacher a little afraid.
That is not a buffalo, that is a cow! shouted the class, and rose together walking threateningly towards the teacher.
This here is a cow! shouted the teacher, showing immense presence of mind and putting up a picture of a cow, See the difference!
The mob stood still for a moment, then shook their heads and went back to their places.
The buffalo! continued the teacher, his voice a little scared after having escaped a sure lynching, Is black in colour and its horns are very different from a cow!
I watched as the vigilants hastily scribbled notes, some even drawing both the cow and buffalo and placing them side by side on a page in their notebooks.They will carry those notebooks now, when they go beef hunting! said the government official with a smile.
I looked at the official a little puzzled, Tell me, I said, Are these cows and buffalos carried as meat in the trucks or as live stock
Meat of course! said the official.
Then how will they differentiate what is beef and what is not I asked curiously.
The government official looked scornfully at me, You cant expect us to do everything at one go do you he asked, With the limited funds sanctioned by the government, We can only teach them what is cow and what is buffalo!
And so the lynchings, murders and thrashing continue throughout the country as a democratic government with a Constitution which promises freedom for its people, interferes in the eating habits of its people..!

Big in talent!
The Girls of Hillwood College Kandy are some of the most accomplished Thespians when it comes to school drama. Dramatic Moves features Hillwood College, Kandy where confidence and charisma are generated under one roof and then successfully enacted on stage.
Teacher in charge of Drama Thilini Wijeratne feels that it is really this charisma the girls have developed that helps them.
Passion for drama
Drama society of Hillwood College Kandy is one of the oldest societies in school. I too was a member of it when I was a student of HCK. However, I was made the teacher in charge from 2010 onwards, said Wijeratne.
Throughout the years Hillwood has maintained an excellent track record and have a reputation for top quality plays.
We got selected to perform at the final round many times at Shakespeare Drama Competitions organized by Colombo Rotary club and have won the Best Outstation Production award many times and the Best Outstation Actress and Supporting Actress awards. Last year, at the Kandy Shakespeare festival, we won the Best Girls production award and Keshala Perera was adjudged the Best Actress. Apart from that, we have won zonal and provincial level in drama organized by the Ministry of Education, said Wijeratne.
The girls are definitely passionate about drama and enjoy it thoroughly.
Our main strength is the passion for drama. Girls love taking part in Shakespeare dramas and they are thrilled to do musicals. They acquire a lot through drama, especially self-confidence, they get rid of stage-fright and develop understanding and respect for another person. Stage acting makes a person very charismatic and at the same time makes her sensitive towards others emotions, explained Wijeratne.
Talent is there from the nursery to Advance Level. They take part in performances at an early age of five until they become eighteen. So HCK is big in talent.
They become charismatic and socialized individuals. They have a better understanding and broader approach towards issues in life. They have explored and seen the world before others in their own class. They do not stick only to the school syllabus. We have worked with experts like late professor Ashley Halpe and Bridget Halpe when it comes to Shakespeare and Lakshmi Wickramaratne and Radhika Jayathilake for musicals. So, their readings of the texts are of a very high level and their expertises are immensely valuable for the students. Simply this is the springboard for young talent to come out or identified, elucidated Wijeratne.
Working with the girls is a special experience.
I think I am lucky to work with young, energetic students like them as I learn a lot from them. They are more modern and technical. So my theories are better practiced with their technical competency. Irangani Serasinghe is my personal favorite on stage and in screen. I like to see at least one or two girls from HCK to come up to that level so HCK Drama Society can be proud of creating the platform for young actresses who are culturally rich to emerge, shared Wijeratne.
Humorous acts
Vice President Saadia Jameel, chose the correct word  Unleash Last year the drama that we performed on our English Day we took it to the Zonal level and we were placed third. The talents of the committee members are definitely strength to us. One of the skills we have acquired is stage presence, clarity and audibility, everything a thespian and an individual should possess. We had one girl in Grade 11 who was scared to talk out loud, but then when she started acting, she overcame that inhibition, said Jameel. Drama starts at a very young age at Hillwood.
Our Primary Drama Circle is going for the all island competition next week. They won zonal and provincial and they are going to the all island, stated Jameel.
Unlike in speeches where you need to know grammar, drama is nothing like that because you can memorize a script and you just come forward and show your skills and presence and you get the opportunity to unleash yourselves.
Playing a boys role is not difficult for me because I always end up playing boys roles. I feel more confident playing boys roles than girls roles. Humorous acts are really famous in our school as well as Shakespeare. Over the years the numbers of students taking part in drama has really increased. And now it is going strong and it is fun. Practices are in the night after all the other activities are over. We come in at around 7pm and we finish practices by 9pm, pointed out Jameel.
Manageable
Secretary Purni Godahenage, feels that drama puts you at ease with anyone you meet and gives you the ability to go up and talk to anyone.
All our girls are very talented. Drama helps you speak freely to people openly. Drama can instill confidence in a person by speaking and standing in front of a crowd and reciting your lines. I think playing a boys role largely depends on the movements that you make. It is a little different than the girls. It is a little hard but it is manageable, said Godahena.
Hidden talents
Committee Member, Lasni Rajapaksha, voiced a similar opinion
What I have received from drama are the speaking skills and ability to face a big crowd and talking to people without fear. I feel drama can bring out your hidden talents, said Rajapaksha.
Tomboyish
Committee Member, Minna Azmy said she definitely enjoys doing drama.
One memorable play we have done is Anne Arky by Lindsay Price and it was one of the best plays we have done. That drama was so good. It was a parody of Anne of Green Gables. Drama is the best way to develop self -confidence. It helps us get rid of stage fear. It gives us the opportunity to improve language. It is something that we enjoy doing. In addition to our studies it is a good extra-curricular activity to have.
Maybe because I am tomboyish, I prefer acting as a boy, it is easier for me to get into a role as a boy, said Azmy.
Make a small twist
Committee member Salomi Navamani, said drama is all about old friends.
Even on school basis and even when we go out and we are asked to act, we can do it because we have developed that skill in school. More importantly it gives confidence. All of us bond really well. We have been together from Grade 6 doing dramas. The chemistry from that young age has been developing up to date. It is so good to get to work with them. The younger girls have the potential and the capability to take drama forwards when we leave. They are very responsible. The inter-house competition held the year before from last year was really competitive. It benefited the actresses, said Navamani.
Navamani feels that when stepping into the skin of a character it is mainly research and the expert guidance of the teachers.
If you are someone who is scared to present yourself, it is a good start for you. Everything is prepared all you have to do is make a small twist on your side, perform and just enjoy yourself and stick to the fact that you have to entertain the audience, said Navamani.
The girls all unanimously agreed that drama will thrive at Hillwood College in the future because of the dedication from the students and the teachers. The girls they say are very enthusiastic. As Godahenage said the talent at Hillwood is really big!
At inter-house level they need to make their own scripts and are given a prize for the best script. It is not only for the acting. They give points for the script, dedication and the acting. The girls are all from different streams (Arts, Math, Science and Commerce) but they come together when doing drama. They are now good friends having met through drama.
Daily News also spoke to the Intermediate level dramatists at Hillwood College Kandy.
Definitely interested
For Dhamindi Senarathne the field of drama is nothing new to her.
I do English Literature so it helps me to get to know more about the subject. You get a lot of new experiences doing drama. I want to get into the drama field because I have always been able to act. I am definitely interested in it. Doing drama you learn to cope with everybody and work for the drama and not for yourself, said Senarathne.
A very good way
Anuththara Elpitiya feels drama builds character. Drama is a very good way to develop your personality such as public speaking. You get to know the ways of speaking to the audience. When we were in the Middle School we did a production of Sound of Music. I got to play the part of Captain Von Trapp. So that was a very good way to get over the fears of speaking. Coordination is also really important when you do drama. Drama is a very good thing for your future. It supports you to build as a person, said Elpitiya.
Very different
Lavanya De Mel, showed much resilience and adaptability.
I first got into drama when we did Sound of Music. I was Maria. Before that we had only done Shakespeare competitions and Shakespeare was very different from Sound of Music. Drama teaches you to do a lot of hard work. We practice very hard. Because of our dedication, we became better each day and you could see the progress. This year lots of new personalities came onto the stage, before it was only a small group of people. Their hidden talents all surfaced. We learnt a lot about each other, said De Mel.
Need to adapt
Kanjini Dissanayake went from a nun to Caesar!
When you act you get to be a wide variety of personalities. So you are a completely different person. When I did Sound of Music I was a Nun. When we did Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra last year, I was Caesar. It is crazy how you have to change your personality! So you really need to adapt to the role and to the environment. It was hard getting into Caesars skin. You really need to practice and deepen your voice and walk properly. But towards the end it was okay. I was also motivated by everyone. All the teachers were helping, said Dissanayake.
Really productive
Hiruni Hitihamu spoke about looking at things from different perspectives. Drama helps you and gives you the opportunity to express yourself in a different way. In drama you get different characters and you have to think from their perspective. That is very helpful in developing their confidence to go out there and speak to the audience. That helps you develop your personality. So I think it is really productive, said Hitihamu.
Confidence
Rachel Sun felt that she got a lot of strength from her cast members. When we did Macbeth,and I was really nervous to be honest to be in front of people! But when I was with my friends they gave me confidence. So I think drama gives you a lot of confidence, said Sun.
Daily News also met the Primary School Girls who were especially adorable and sweet. They were very precocious and talkative. They excitedly spoke about their achievements. At the Zonal level they won the first place. They won first place at the provincial level as well. And now they are getting ready for the all island.

Brexit blamed for au pair shortage
UK: Negotiations over Britains withdrawal from the European Union have barely started, but some British families are already feeling the bite as the number of au pairs coming from across Europe declines.
Brexit had an impact, without any question, Rebecca Haworth-Wood, president of the British Au Pair Agencies Association (BAPAA), told AFP.
I estimate that au pair applications for the UK are at least 50 percent down compared with this time last year after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Compared to 2015 last years numbers were also very much lower due to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit referendum on June 23, 2016.
Every year, about 40,000 British families welcome an au pair -- a young person keen to improve their English andtravel who looks after children in exchange for lodging and some pocket-money.
There are usually more au pair applications than families needing their services but that may be changing as parents turned to the popular online forum Mumsnet to voice their growing desperation.
Instead of the normal flood of applicants on AuPairWorld I had to do all the chasing and matching, one parent wrote on Mumsnet.
Eventually we found someone but it was such hard work. Bloody Brexit. Another parent wrote: The agency have informed us hardly anyone wants to come to the UK. A third said: Its horrific this year. We usually have over 100 applications. This year its us doing all the applying (to girls who have over 100 responses).
At the heart of the problem is the uncertainty over travel and residency rights for EU nationals as the British government has made putting an end to freedom of movement one of the cornerstones of its negotiating stance.
AuPairWorld, an agency based in Germany, said it had seen applications for Britain drop from 21,000 in the first half of 2015 to 12,000 in the first half of 2017.
We can only speculate about the reasons but it might very well be Brexit and all the uncertainties around it, the agencys spokeswoman Susanne Becker told AFP.
People might fear that they will soon need a visa. And of course, no one knows who will be able to apply for a visa, how difficult it will be and how much it might cost, she continued. For the BAPAAs Haworth-Wood, the terror attacks that have struck Europe in recent months may also be to blame for young peoples reluctance to travel.
While waiting for the UK government to explain what immigration system they want to implement for au pairs, Haworth-Wood is keen to reassure, saying: At the moment nothing has changed. We want Europeans to know they are very welcome! . - AFP
