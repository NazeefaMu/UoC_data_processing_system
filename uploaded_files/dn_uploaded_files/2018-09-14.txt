Baby-talk to bond with dogs
Using dog-speak is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice.
Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker who used a high pitch.
The researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in dog-directed speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies.
Dog-directed speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the universitys department of psychology explains: This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isnt a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.
During the tests, phrases such as youre a good dog! and shall we go for a walk were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example I went to the cinema last night. The speakers then mixed dog-directed speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words.
Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both dog-directed speech and dog-related content.
When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant. The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences; however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

PCoI on SLA, SLCL, Mihin Lanka
SriLankan transacted six bonds  with Peoples Bank
The SriLankan Airlines (SLA) had six bonds transactions with the Peoples Bank and four of them to the face value of Rs. 25 billion were done with the intervention of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as a third party, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) learnt yesterday.
Assistant General Manager (Peoples Bank Back Office Branch) Chandrasiri Fernando testified before the PCoI on SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Limiting and Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Limited yesterday.
It was revealed that the ownership of three of the four Treasury Bonds to the face value of Rs. 18.1 billion were transferred to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) from the SLA in 2014. Later, the Corporation has sold them to the Peoples Bank and earned money for settling the fuel cost that the company was due to pay for the Corporation.
The other bonds transaction between the SLA and the Peoples Bank took place in March 2014 and bonds to the face value of Rs. 6.9 billion had been sold directly to the bank by the company at a settlement value of Rs. 7.3 billion. The due payment had been deposited to the CPC account by the bank as per the written request of the SLA, the witness told.
The other two transactions took place in March and December in the same year when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issued bonds to the three State banks, Peoples Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and the National Saving Bank in exchange of the SriLankan Airlines shares owned by these institutions. The CBSL had issued two Treasury Bonds with the face value of Rs. 1.137 billion and Rs. 168 million to the Peoples Bank for the purpose as a direct placement. The Commission will inquire into these three institutions today.

Bhopal tailor admits to  killing 33 truck drivers
INDIA: A tailor in Bhopal admitted to killing 33 truck drivers and their helpers. Adesh Khamra from Mandideep committed the first murder around 2010 in Amravati and the second one in Nashik. Soon he spread the net in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Khamra admitted to killing 30 people when the local police had nabbed him last week after a three-day chase. He was caught red-handedly by a woman SP Bittu Sharma  a taekwondo black belt and Asian Games bronze medalist in judo. She nabbed him at gunpoint in the jungles of Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Later on Tuesday, he said that he had killed three more people which makes him the deadliest killer of India. A report by The Times of India said that he had killed the truck drivers to give them salvation.
When dealing with two murder cases of truck drivers, neither the woman cop nor SP Lodha Rahul Kumar knew that they were on track to nab Indias notorious serial killer. This is a once-in-a-lifetime case, said SP Lodha Rahul Kumar. Co-accused Jaykaran reportedly told the police that whenever they asked him the reason for killing the drivers, the accused would laugh and say, They lead hard lives. Adesh Khamra had said to the co-accused, I am giving them mukti, freeing them from pain.
Friends and relatives of the cold-blooded murderer were shocked to hear the news. A neighbour of the accused in Mandideep reportedly said, He was a quiet man, well behaved. There is no way anyone will accept he has the blood of so many on his hands.
Bhopal DIG Dharmendra Choudhary said the 48-year-old accused had trapped his target truck drivers by befriending them. While Khamras men were busy looting the cargo of the truck, he would strangle the drivers to death using a rope. Police also found that Khamra used to ensnare the truck drivers by offering them drinks with drugs. He would then strip them of their clothes and murder them to destroy their identity. The bodies were later dumped under culverts or on hilly roads in various states. - INDIA TODAY

Build resilient rural  economy - Hegde
Shivani Hegde- Managing Director/CEO, Nestl Lanka PLC emphasised on the need for building a resilient rural economy  that would also benefit the rural farmer community.
She said, given the vulnerability of the crucial weather patterns of which Sri Lanka is now a major victim, it is important to build, and to support the rural economic growth as a priority. As Sri Lanka is now self-sufficient in rice, dairy sufficiency can also be achieved by putting a spotlight on the dairy and agri economies.
Explaining what her company has done so far in improving rural economic factors in Sri Lanka, Hegde said, the company has taken steps to encourage farmers to expand coconut cultivation areas and also to persuade dairy farming industry.
She added there is a strong case for Sri Lanka to build a thriving rural sector as successful agricultural economies contribute 14-17% to the GDP, compared with 6 % contribution to the GDP by Sri Lanka.

From buyer driven to producer driven networks - Dr De Silva
The Sri Lankan government is lowering import tariffs and removing border restrictions to encourage more foreign investments and know-how that will increase higher-value exports and fast-track economic growth, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Dr Harsha De Silva said.
The country must diversify exports and shift to making more complex, high-value products in future, as Thailand and Vietnam have done, instead of continuing to export simple, low-value products,
We need technical expertise; knowhow is crucial for growth. We need to move from buyer driven to producer driven production networks, as intermediate goods are the ones that trade the most, he told an economic forum organized by Sri Lankas Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in Colombo yesterday.
He spoke on the theme Turnaround; Shifting Gear from Slow to Fast Track. We need investments to come in. We need to lower border taxes so production networks can be a reality. Thats why we are removing para tariffs and border restrictions.
De Silva said new immigration laws are coming with Cabinet approval that will give visas for companies which employ specialists and other experts and that will help transfer technology.
He added erecting walls around the country should not be done. We need more connections. We need integration. We should focus more on the Indian Ocean region than South Asia. Free trade agreements and economic zones will pave way to rapid economic growth. Many centuries ago, we were a prosperous country, because we were engaged in global trade during that era.
It is not possible for us to carry on growth if we do not make a turnaround; we have to change the way we do business. We can learn from our own experiences and from our competitors.

With entrepreneurs being identified as an essential pillar to solve unemployment and help strengthen economic development in a country, the CA Sri Lanka Business Plan Competition, will kick off season 3 next month, in an effort to nurture entrepreneurial skills among the countrys student population.
The Business Plan Competition - 2019 organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), for the third consecutive year, is calling for applications from schools from across the country, to compete at the competition, which will commence in January 2019.
The competition is open to students sitting for the GCE Advanced Level examination in 2019/2020 from the commerce stream. Schools interested to participate in the competition can submit their applications to the Institute from October to December 2018. Each participating team must comprise of four students, who must present a business plan to the panel of judges in English at both the regional and national levels.
QUT Business School of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane has once again come onboard as the Strategic Partner of the 2019 competition, which is organised in association with the Sri Lanka and Australia Chamber of Commerce (SLACC).
The winner of the grand finale of the Sri Lankan competition will fly to Brisbane, Australia to take part in the BlueShift Case Competition organised by the QUT Business School of the Queensland University of Technology, which will be held in May 2019. Speaking at a press conference, President of CA Sri Lanka, Jagath Perera said that it is the collective responsibility of professional bodies such as CA Sri Lanka to ensure Sri Lanka transitions towards an innovation-driven economy which can be spearheaded by entrepreneurs with unique vision.
Assistant Dean (International) of the QUT Business School, Andrew Paltridge said QUT has been committed to developing business skills in students at all levels through the use of competitions for many years.
He said the university runs the largest international case competitions in Australia at both Bachelor and Master levels, and also the largest high school competition in BlueShift. Once again the QUT Business School is looking forward to partnering with CA Sri Lanka and SLACC to run the CA Business Plan Competition. This is the third year that QUT has been involved and once again we will sponsor the winning Sri Lankan school to come to Australia to compete in the BlueShift Business Case Competition for high schools, he said.
He said that the previous two winners of the CA Business Plan competition, the Mahamaya Girls School and the Ananda Boys College, have both been worthy winners of the local competition and had the opportunity to travel to Australia where they have undertaken a series of social and professional development activities in addition to competing in BlueShift.
President of SLACC, Kalum De Silva said that the Chamber is thrilled to partner with CA Sri Lanka and QUT in launching the CA Business Plan Competition for Sri Lankan schools for the third year in a row. This time the competitions have grown to another level with over 130 schools from around Sri Lanka expected to be taking part. We believe this will not only help showcase the potential of our future generation but will also enable us to foster greater relationships between Sri Lankan and Australian educational institutions. We are excited to see what is in store this year, De Silva said.
Chairman of the Media & Communication Committee, Laknath Peiris said that Sri Lanka has a severe dearth of entrepreneurs, even though the country is blessed with talented individuals.
With this objective in mind, Peiris said that the Institute is taking every effort possible to create visionary entrepreneurs, who will ultimately lead Sri Lanka to reach its true potential.

Cascading grandeur
Juliet Coombe potholes it while exploring Sri Lankas second highest waterfall, Diyaluma a stunning natural wonder in its own right
You can hear the noise of the waterfall long before you see it, and the immense spray covering all the surrounding plants with a refreshing misty spray that makes everything ever green around it.
On the way to our waterfall adventure we reach a row of highly decorated and beautiful Buddhist shrines by the road at which point we stop, whilst Eranda my butler guide from Jetwing Kaduruketha takes me through the ritual for giving us good luck on our journey up the mountain.
A coin is posted, a short prayer made and we both apply two lines of chalk to our foreheads. Suitably blessed for a safe onward journey, we continue on to the falls. There are thousands of rubber trees along the way, with their spiral cuts and little tappers with white goo oozing out, in various states of maturity. We also see cocoa trees with smallish teardrop shaped buds on them that will grow much bigger but only can be eaten as orange-like fruit rather than made into drinking cocoa.
You will also notice endless smaller plantations, near dwellings along the steepening road, of pepper trees that stand like wide pillars with a mass of broad leaves, and of course the ubiquitous paddy fields and coconut plantations, too.
At one point, I marvel at how high the coconut trees grow with such narrow trunks, before they broaden out in later years  how can they take all that weight without snapping Its the race for the light and the surrounding massive trees that make them grow so high.
Suddenly, we have reached the bottom of the falls and, whilst Im very impressed with the 720 odd foot waterfall and its wispy white trail down the sheer rock face, Im disappointed theres no pool at the bottom that we can swim in. Its certainly very high and impressive but not as impressive in a bad way as the story Eranda then relates to me of two couples who had climbed half way up together and then thrown themselves to their deaths.
An extraordinary, sad tale of disallowed marriage and disabilities seemed to be at the root of the two couples tragedy but why did they go to the trouble of getting all that climbing gear and climbing up all that way when they could have driven and walked to the top Onwards and upwards we must go.
Eventually we arrive at the bustling village of Koslanda, where, next to the Buddhist shrine, we see an immense Bo tree with its branches spanning both the high road and low road, and beyond. On our return journey we, Eranda, Passad (the tuktuk driver) and I, stopped in one of the kades, Thangavelu, for tea and a snack; the Tamil staff were very friendly, the food excellent, the tea very refreshing and all for less than half the price of a Starbucks espresso with your name on it. Eranda, after speaking with the manager of the kade, tells me that this town is multi-faith and multicultural and everyone gets on very well and peacefully.
After a bit more driving we finally arrive near the top of the mountainside where the track ends and the walk begins. As we trek round the mountain, we come out to the most superb view across a horizon of hazy hills and forested valleys and stand there gazing motionless for some time, Eranda views the distant hills through his binoculars.
He then, almost immediately, spots a black and white horny lizard next to the path, which is cool enough to let me put my camera within inches of its majestic head. Further on he stops and points to a tree, overhanging the path and asks, Do you know who has done this I see a light brown underside to a low and large branch and reply Is that mud Yes. Its a little high for a cow isnt it Yes, he nods very encouragingly, in a charades type manner, such that I realise Im on the right track and ask, incredulously, as for some reason I think were too high up, if its an elephant. Yes, and if we see one we must stay absolutely still as they can get angry and charge. As we traverse around the top of the mountain we descend past a lemon grass patch to views of smaller waterfalls set in completely unspoilt wild surroundings that almost look savannah-like. I half expect to see a group of leopards basking in the midday sun, amongst the grassy tufts near large elephantine rocks that dot the countryside like sleeping dinosaurs.
A little way on, we come to the top of Sri Lankas second highest falls, characterised by beautifully eroded smooth boulders and potholes the size of Jacuzzis filled with clear rushing water that beckons me hither like sirens. Eranda, almost hopelessly, looks at me with pleading in his eyes and rather hopelessly warns me about flash floods and the big black cloud just upriver of us suggest a massive down pour. The views from here are truly breath taking, especially when you look over the edge to see humans as small as pinpricks moving about below you, and allow your imagination that one crazy moment of thinking about what it would be like to jump from here. Instincts kick back abruptly with a very brief but intense instance of vertigo as you pull back from the edge.
After drinking in the views fully and taking loads of pictures, we start our journey back, though not completely, for I want to have a proper dip in this lovely fresh water but in a place where flash floods are not going to turn me into the next local news headline. We temporarily deviate from the return path to some bigger pools that are perfect and after taking some more pictures and then the rain starts and we get absolutely drenched from the thunder clouds whirling around like dervishes. The rain hammered down until we got back near the bottom and Eranda demonstrated his flying angel act, to celebrate a great adventure that took us to the heady heights of seeing the countries awe inspiring 720 foot water fall, one that comes thoroughly recommended for lovers of nature in all its forms.

Trial against Prasanna Ranatunga
Case to be  taken up today
Following a request made by defence counsel, the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was yesterday postponed for today (14) by the Colombo High Court.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and a third person on the charge of threatening a businessman demanding the balance money out of Rs. 64 million.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne, a junior counsel appearing on behalf of MP Prasanna Ranatunga moved court that the trial be fixed for another date since his senior counsel Anil de Silva, PC, was appearing before the Court of Appeal over another case. Accordingly, the case was re-fixed for trial today by the Colombo High Court.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court decided to proceed with the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of the third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading court from the beginning of investigations. MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused, Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as court productions against the three accused in this case.

CB writes to Nomura Holdings on  erroneous report
Senior Deputy Governor of Central Bank, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe has written to President and Group CEO of Nomura Holdings INC, Koji Nagai asking them to correct an erroneous report on Sri Lankas exchange rate which was quoted by several global media organisations.
The letter in full;
I write with reference to the articles published by several international media sites quoting a new analysis by Nomura Holdings Inc., which shows that seven emerging economies are at risk of an exchange rate crisis.
According to these articles, Nomuras analysis, which is based on the Damocles Index, lists Sri Lanka as the country that is most vulnerable to an exchange rate crisis. The article that appeared on www.ft.com quotes Nomura analysis as saying Sri Lanka had the worst outlook, and with reserves of less than five months of import cover and high short term external debt (US$ 160 billion), (Sri Lankas) refinancing needs are large.
Given the fact that Sri Lankas short term external debt is nowhere near the US$ 160 billion figure that your analysts have quoted, it appears that you have made a serious computational error with regard to Sri Lankas vulnerability, Sri Lankas short term debt and liabilities are currently estimated at US$ 14.3 billion. Needless to say, such an erroneous report is likely to trigger a disturbance amongst investors, and could cause irreparable damage to Sri Lanka given the current volatile global market conditions.
I am certain that Nomura Holdings Inc., understands our concern, and I shall be grateful if you could immediately correct this error, and provide similar publicity to the correction without any delay.

Chamaris double in vain Sri Lanka Women lose ODI series
Sri Lanka Women skipper Chamari Atapattus fine double of scoring a half century and capturing three wickets proved a vain effort as her team fell short by eight runs to secure a win in the second ODI against Indian Women at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka Women did very well to dismiss the strong Indian batting line up for 219 to leave themselves with a chance of leveling the three-match series.
But after being in a position to win at 165-5 in the 42nd over Sri Lanka buckled under pressure to be dismissed for 212 to lose by seven runs. Three run outs also didnt help Sri Lankas cause.
Apart from Atapattus 57 off 95 balls, veteran all rounder Shashikala Siriwardene chipped in with a useful knock of 49 off 91 balls. Nilakshi de Silva made a valiant attempt to get her team across the line with a determined 31 off 19 balls before being ninth out at 207.
India Womens total was made up by half centuries from skipper Mithali Raj and Taniya Bhatia.
With this win India Women take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
The final ODI will be played at Katunayake on September 16.
Scores:
Indian Women 219 in 50 overs (Mithali Raj 52, Taniya Bhatia 68, Dayalan Hemalatha 35, Udeshika Prabhodani 2/45, Sripali Weerakkody 2/36, Chamari Atapattu 3/42)
Sri Lanka Women 212 in 48.1 overs (Chamari Atapattu 57, Shashikala Siriwardene 49, Nilakshi de Silva 31, Mansi Joshi 2/49, Rajeshwari Gayakwad 2/37)

China welcomes the remarks made by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the two countries co-operation under the China-proposed Belt and Road (B&R) initiative has benefitted both countries and their people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press briefing Thursday.
The comment came after a CNBC report saying Wickremesinghe had denied the claim that the country was ceding control of strategically vital ports to China. He also said he didnt believe the country was falling into a debt trap caused by Chinese loans.
Chinas aid to Sri Lanka had never been attached to any political conditions.The B&R initiative will continue to contribute to regional development and connectivity in the future, Geng said, the Global Times reported.

Chinese  farmers  swap sheep  for skis
CHINA: It may be hot outside but that doesn't stop doctors and former shepherds on skis snowploughing on giant white treadmills on the outskirts of Beijing -- part of the battalions of workers learning the sport ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
China is scrambling to build enthusiasm for winter sports ahead of the Games with an ambitious goal to increase the number of fans tenfold, to 300 million, by 2022.
The doctors, nurses and former sheep farmers are part of this mammoth effort, training for several days a week over the past year to make the cut as volunteers and workers during the Games.
The training continued through the searing summer in Yanqing district on the outskirts of Beijing, which will host several events in 2022, including Alpine skiing, bobsledding, skeleton, and luge.
Amid balmy temperatures outside, the students stood on skis on two inclined treadmills that were sprayed with water inside a gymnasium.
Lang Enge and his team of 25 farmers and shepherds practised their moves to be able to do whatever the government arranges for us, such as cable car maintenance work, snow gear repair and operating artificial snow machines.
Almost all farmers sold their sheep in our village, there are no shepherds now in Yanqing, says Lang, 29.
The sheepherders decided to sell their flocks after the local government told them they could keep them but could no longer take them to the mountains due to overgrazing.
Lang sold his 300 sheep and decided to focus on skiing instead.
The local government finances all the training, promising jobs related to the Winter Olympics. Lang and his friends hope that by learning to ski, they can land permanent jobs in ski resorts after the Olympics.
In the meantime, Lang is working as a temporary traffic and public security employee for the local government. He said other farmers are working as taxi drivers, factory workers or car salesmen.
Doctors and nurses are also training at the same gym, but for a different challenge: working as medical volunteers who can rush down a slope to help an injured athlete.
It's a challenge for me. I hope to have more time to do my best, said Jiang Wei, 30, a nurse at the local hospital, before jumping into the skiing simulator, wearing elbow and knee pads and a helmet, as an instructor gave her advice.
The farmers appeared more confident on the slope simulator, slowly slaloming on the moving carpet while the doctors and nurses were still grabbing onto a security pole at the bottom of the treadmill.
I think the people I trained will be suitable for these jobs, said E Yinchun, one of the trainers.
China is not the first country to train medical staff to ski for the Olympic Games, where athletes can get injured by attempting risky jumps and making high-speed turns.
But for the farmers in Yanqing this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a better-paying job.
Lang and his team have left the countryside for good and now they are working for the district office while they prepare for the big event in February 2022.
What will happen after the Games is still uncertain. Especially, he said, now that there are no sheep farmers in town.

Citizens' Mail
Overpricing and middlemen cause the increase in CoL
I recently channelled a doctor through an e-channelling service and paid Rs. 275 for this channelling service. This charge was unnecessary if the private hospitals allow the patients to pay through their own portal or we can use internet banking and pay into the hospitals account at the bank.
If I didn't use this service, I would have to go to the hospital or blood collection centres to pay for this. In this electronic age, where we can pay online for many products and services, why are they creating unnecessary new avenues to rip money from patients
The portal can limit the number of patients per specialist and then accept payments on a first paid first booked basis. Private hospitals must be more responsible to society and not squeeze every penny from a patient, as most who visit these are middle-class people. Similarly, the margins of the supermarkets are as much as 40 to 50%. So, you can imagine a product which is around Rs. 100 at the factory may end up to be nearly Rs. 200 or more in the hands of the customer. This is because the poor customer pays many middlemen in the supply chain.
This is not necessary if we source items straight from the producer - the best example is the glut of vegetables in Dambulla where price is low, whereas in Colombo we pay high prices.
My appeal to the Health Minister to request private hospitals to obtain payments through their own portal on a first paid first booked basis.

CCP 51st Annual Academic Sessions inaugurated
Developments in medical field discussed
Hundreds of South Asias most prominent physicians are collaborating to discuss critical developments in the medical field, at the 51st Annual Academic Sessions of the Ceylon College of Physicians (CCP), inaugurated on Wednesday at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
The Academic Sessions span four days, with 18 symposia and 18 teaching capsules, 12 plenaries, and three special workshops. Participants are from Sri Lanka, as well as India, Pakistan, Singapore, Australia, the UK, and the U.S.
There is a contingent of people coming from overseas with their knowledge, said Professor Saroj Jayasinghe of the University of Colombo. Therefore, it is a forum for people to update their knowledge.
Jayasinghe said he personally gains a lot form the Sessions. It is a place where you exchange and learn from others and network. It is a forum where you can share your findings and your thoughts, he said.
While a wide range of urgent medical topics are discussedincluding digital healthcare, ethical dilemmas in the changing medical field, evolution in the treatment of cardiological, neurological, and end of life diseasesthe takeaway from the 51st Annual Academic Sessions is comprehension.
Comprehension asks how cells, organs, people, physicians and environment interact through various micro and macro-scales. It sheds promising light on the future of medical education and healthcare in Sri Lanka, he added.
Participants consider the edification of medicine for current and aspiring physicians. At present, medical understanding, as well as practice, looks at diseases in an isolated manner, which Jayasinghe said is reductionist.
The way most students and doctors think tends to be mechanistic and reductionist, and that comes from our education, he said. Jayasinghe, in his a lecture on Systems Science, says the future of medicine is, where you try to show the linkages of things, which may appear to act in isolation, but if you look at it, its the result of a system acting in coordination.
For example, having a heart attack might reduce blood pressure, which affects the kidney.
And the kidney can malfunction and cause kidney failure, said Jayasinghe. As a result, you will stop excreting urine, which will mean you have more fluid, which worsens your heart function. So its a cycle. If you understand a person, you have to understand all this because if a person is critically ill, the whole system becomes sensitive to minor changes, he said. The future of medicine that the CCP espouses is from this systematic, interconnected approach, reflected in a number of talks given at the conference, including by Professor Anand Zacharaiah from the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India.
Zachariah focuses on the contextualisation of medical knowledge to address health needs.

Possessing 8.1 grams of heroin
Drug kingpin  Siddique, four  others acquitted
Lakmal Sooriyagoda
Controversial drug kingpin Mohammed Wasim Mohammed Siddique and four others who had been indicted for allegedly possessing 8.1 grams of heroin were yesterday ordered to be acquitted and released from the case by Colombo High Court, after noticing several contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted the five accused including Mohammed Siddhique under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984 for possession of 8.1 grams of heroin in the Maharagama area on February 03, 2003.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order even without hearing the evidence of the defense on grounds of serious contradictions between two prosecution witnesses. However, Mohammed Siddhique will remain in remand custody over another case filed against him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
While handing out the judgment regarding the case, the High Court judge observed that evidence given by Colombo Crimes Divisions ASP Priyantha Jayakody and other officers of the same division was contradictory.
Taking into consideration facts, the court further observed that prosecutors have failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and ordered that they be released from the case.
The first accused Mohammed Siddique had been arrested in Pakistan and brought to Sri Lanka on March 18, 2015 and he was held under CID custody for a period of six months on a Detention Order issued by the Defense Minister.
Counsel Laksman Perera appeared for the accused.

On The Fast Track to a Turnaround
Give top priority to foreign investment - Arun Kumar
Foreign investment needs to be a high-priority area for growth and employment generation in Sri Lanka, said Arun M Kumar, Chairman and CEO, KPMG India.
Delivering the key note address at the inaugural session of Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018 under theme On the Fast Track to a Turnaround held at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo yesterday he said that Sri Lankas foreign investment has remained below 2% of GDP over the past twenty years. In addition, new FDI in the past few years has been predominantly infrastructure oriented with only a relatively small proportion reaching sectors that are associated with global value chains
India has set an example in the neighbourhood. With progressive FDI policies and an activist approach to inviting investment, India has become one of the largest destinations of foreign investment, he said.
Private sector investment has remained constrained because the business environment has not been conducive and the public sector has played a dominant role in the past. Since the governments budgetary resources are limited, the private sector is expected to play a larger role in infrastructure development through PPPs, he said. Policies to improve the investment climate, complemented by upgrades in the quality of infrastructure and human resources, need urgent attention to catalyze domestic investment and attract FDI.
Breaking from the past, Sri Lankas new Inland Revenue Act, approved in October 2017 aims for a transparent, unified, and even-handed legal framework. Consistent implementation of this new rule-based system could help unlock long-term investment decisions. More generally, it is vital to cut the red tape hampering businesses to attract greater FDI from a various sources, he said.
According to him KPMG India has worked extensively with the Governments of various states in India in the area of investment promotion. Sri Lanka could adopt best practices from the various states investment promotion boards to restructure Sri Lankas Board of Investment, towards purely promoting FDI and away from regulating FDI and managing export processing zones.
Ease of doing business is increasingly a key diagnostic parameter for global investors today. In India, KPMG has been working actively with Indias Department of Investment Policy and Promotion (DIPP) as well as with many states to help measure and improve Ease of Doing Business.
India, as you all would know has made a remarkable improvement in its ease of doing business rankings this year, a 30 - place jump, higher than any other country, he said.
This jump was driven by improvement in many parameters like construction permits, paying taxes and insolvency resolution. Most importantly, it is the relentless implementation and on-ground results which made all the difference.
Look at micro institutional fixes - Dr De Mel
Sri Lanka will need to look at micro institutional fixes to address most fundamental issues faced by key economic sectors in particular, the agricultural sector to improve productivity to a large extent, said Dr Nishan De Mel - Executive Director, Verit Research (Pvt)
Highlighting the need to make the agricultural sector more productive, he said that post harvest losses in the country ranges from 18-42%, depending on the product.
He said, Sri Lanka has not been successful in implementing a system of plastic crates just for the movement of agricultural produce, nevertheless, other countries in the region has significantly improved the agriculture productivity in terms of delivery of goods using this simple technology.
We are not able to do that simple thing. Its a simple micro change that can make an enormous difference in the economy, he said.
Commenting on less productivity in the public sector in Sri Lanka, he said Sri Lanka has replaced the competent public sector by appointing much less competent people to various positions and this has significantly lowered the overall productivity and led to increase the levels of corruption at every level of the sector.
That is actually hurting simple reforms in this country, he said, Noting that we live in a broken system, he said further that most private sector companies in Sri Lanka as well as policy makers, researchers and international lending organizations such as IMF has learnt the art of surviving in this broken system.
We survive in a broken system. Its like surviving in a gorilla community in which rules dont apply and everybody tries to be the biggest gorilla. In this system anybody can manipulate the political gorilla and build the system to work just for them and everyone works for their own self interest, he said.
To break this manipulative system, he suggested that everyone including private public sector individuals and civil societies need to find a collective way of fixing the loopholes in the existing system. Or else there is no other way to solve it. For me, Sri Lanka seems to be very good at living in a repetitive cycle, he said.
And to realise the true growth potential of the economy, he stressed the need to understand existing and foreseeable challenges and to come up with proactive policy measures to rectify those issues and to garner better economic benefits.
ETCA will further extend its scope- Eran
State Minister of Finance and Mass Media Eran Wickramaratne said the government wouldnt divert from the path of its ongoing fiscal consolidation measures and would take further necessary steps to achieve set growth targets of Sri Lankan economy.
According to the minister, there are two exogenous factors generally impact Sri Lanka, which include unpredictable weather patterns and escalating fuel prices.
In 2015, our budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was in excess of 7 percent, the present government managed to bring it down to 5.5 percent and we are hoping that it will go below 5 percent in 2018, he said.
Nonetheless, he said that adverse weather impacted over 20 districts in Sri Lanka in 2017 and it was one of the reasons, the government deviated somewhat from its fiscal consolidation efforts.
The Minister also said Sri Lanka has gained significant benefits from original Indo-Lanka trade agreement more than India has. According to him, Sri Lanka has been increasing its exports over the years and said the government is confident that the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA), a diplomatic arrangement that seeks to add to the existing free trade agreement between India and Sri Lanka, primarily in relation to trade-in services and the service sector will be further expanding this scope.
Commenting on Sri Lanka -Singapore FTA, he said that the country needs to begin inking much needed trade links especially with East while making more trade integration with South Asia.
There is no other way for this country unless we are ready to compete. Our market with a population of 21 million wont make any huge difference to the living standards. We have to access larger markets and also to be the gateway to the South Asian market, he said.
He however noted that FTAs are not going to increase Sri Lankas exports immediately.
He also publicly accepted that there are hiccups in the implementation of the Inland Revenue Bill and also noted that Sri Lanka is moving towards rule based system, taking discussions away from politicians and bureaucrats.

Fisherman clung onto boat for a day
Sri Lanka Navy on Wednesday recued a fisherman who clung to his wreaked trawler for a day after it was involved in a collision with a moving ship, about 30 nautical miles off the Galle coast.
The Navy also retrieved the bodies of four others of a total of seven fishermen on board the fishing trawler Malindu Putha.
The trawler had left the Beruwala coast on Tuesday and the accident had occurred early that morning.
Eranda Puspakumara, 26, the fisherman who was rescued, recounting the drama at sea, said after the collision, he was thrown into the sea, while the other fishermen were stuck inside the trawler.
We did not notice the ship until it collided with our boat. However, I could swim back and cling onto the wrecked boat. I kept on clinging until I was rescued by the Navy the next day.
On information received by the Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre (MRCC) from a merchant vessel about the ill-fated trawler, a fast attack craft of the Southern Naval Command swiftly launched an operation to rescue the fishermen and their trawler on Wednesday.
The Navy brought the fisherman they rescued to the Galle Harbour and rushed him to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital for treatment. The dead bodies were handed over to the Galle Police for post-mortem examination.
The Navy is continuing its search operations for the two other missing fishermen.
Meanwhile the Fisheries Department has initiated a comprehensive inquiry into the accident under directions of the Director General.

French  Spiderman becomes citizen
FRANCE: The migrant hero nicknamed Spiderman for saving a child hanging off a balcony by scaling a Paris apartment block with his bare hands has become a French citizen, according to a government decree.
Nimble 22-year-old Mamoudou Gassama from Mali was granted a fast-track to French nationality and a job in the fire service after the daring rescue in May.
This act of great bravery exemplifies the values which help unite our national community, such as courage, selflessness, altruism and taking care of the most vulnerable, said the official document published Wednesday. Gassama, who had been in France illegally, was catapulted to global fame by the extraordinary feat captured in footage seen by millions on social media.
The video showed the former construction worker jumping from one floor to the next, hauling himself up with impressive athleticism towards the four-year-old boy dangling above.
He was congratulated in person by President Emmanuel Macron two days later and also met Malis President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in the capital of the West African country.
Gassama arrived in France in September 2017 after travelling the perilous Mediterranean migrant route and found a job in the construction industry despite not having the right to work.
He has received international acclaim for his bravery but activists have accused the French government of hypocrisy, pointing to its treatment of other migrants.
In August a controversial asylum and immigration bill was signed into French law, designed to accelerate asylum procedures by cutting the maximum processing time.
The new law was passed despite opposition on the left which decried an effort to limit arrivals while the far right saw the measure as not going far enough.

Fundamental  problem of money  and banking
Continued from yesterday
Fourth, customers do not have the assurance of their transaction records in electronic books and accounts in the event of a disaster as they do not have physical records to claim their interests. The IT is not a god-given machine to do everything and the correct status of so-called cyber security risk management is known by only few IT staff. The regular senior management oversight is not feasible on IT risk management in contrast to conventional banking processes. The senior management has to rely on what few IT staff and random audit
The modern monetary policies also can cause some noises to banks by changing interest rates and liquidity conditions in the inter-bank market, mostly overnight,as they cannot do much in present private/bank money-dominant systems. Inter-bank liquidity is mostly connected with daily cash flow management issues and strategies of some banks which has nothing to do with the wider liquidity position in the economy. As the responsiveness of the monetary policies on credit and consumer price index-based inflation driven by various external shocks is negligible in modern economies with high intermediation of private money, the overall demand for bank money would stay in the trend of business and economic environment without a major response to small adjustments of the monetary policies generally phased out for several years in terms of theoretical views for the long-run which never ends
staff report which are of highly technical jargon. Fifth, risk of stealing or misusing customer funds internally by some bank staff can become routine as internal pass-word controls can be manipulated and compromised for friendships. It is usual that banks rush to any innovation competitively and invariably end up in disaster. The prime cause of the last global financial crisis was the innovative structured products marketing and the next crisis could well be connected to the unmanaged electronic money and banking.
Less Business HR and Marketing and more Internal Controls
Application of business HR and marketing focusing on competition, innovation and profit needs to be cautious. In other businesses, shareholders are prepared to take both risks and returns and close down businesses in the event of catastrophe. In banking, depositors, i.e., nearly 90% of funding base, are not prepared to accept risks where the monetary system is not prepared to write-off bank-created money. HR management and marketing which are centered around profit-based performance targets have caused immense banking vulnerabilities. If financial engineers manufacture banking products and receive sugar high remuneration based on the present value of model-based future cash flows on such products, what pays out today is the hard cash earned/realized from already risky lending business.
There are ample instances that bank financial statements are manipulated while mis-selling, cross-selling and market manipulations are carried out to show the achievement of performance targets. A recent revelation of a global bank that a segment of staff led by some senior managers opened about 3.5 million fake bank and credit card accounts and 528,000 potentially improper online bill-pay enrollments during 2011-2015 period in the mask of better services to customers in order to charge fees on such accounts to meet marketing/sales targets is unbelievable. Nearly 5,300 staff connected to the incidence were immediately fired. The banks new Chairman recently responded that the number of such improperly opened accounts was still unknown. Overall, this irregularity has caused immense risk to the stability of the bank.
Instances of the grant of large bank loans to connected parties as reported from time to time are also connected to dark corners prevailing in potential breach of bank internal controls and banking practices which will end up in financial crimes at a cost to retail deposit base as the wholesale depositors are at a bargaining position. The immediate response of banks to news of such instances of improper businesses has always been that nothing wrong has happened. Regulatory fines charged from global banks on such unethical practices and mis-representation of financial condition are reported to be huge around US$ 300 bn. in 2009-2015. The two latest instances reported in the US are a fine of US$ 2 bn. on alleged misrepresentation of its loan quality and a fine of US$ 4.9, the largest ever charged from a single institution, on alleged mis-selling of mortgaged backed securities from two high street banks.
Banking is a more internal controls-based discipline/profession by respecting the integrity to protection of customer and bank funds. Whenever these is any loss to customer funds or bank funds, either internal controls may have been breached by some employees or existing internal controls may not have been adequate. No ambitious performers and aggressive marketeers should be permitted to breach internal controls and limits because they invariably end up in scandals as the conventional integrity is compromised for their ambitions. All reported bank rouge trades are connected to breach of internal controls for profit. Nick Leeson, Jeromy Kerviel, Kweku Adoboli and London Whale are historic names in such scandals whereas a large number of such names go unpublic. In general, both impressive profits and losses are indications of overall mis-management of funds in high risks. Therefore, the fitness and propriety of all levels of bank staff in terms of conventional descriptions should be the foundation of the HR and marketing in banks. Accountability mapping linked to the fitness and propriety for senior management to be responsible for respective business lines and operations is a new area of bank integrity management.
Promote Customer Relationship
Tracing customer conflicts and resolving them without losing the customers need to be practiced as part of good banking and not as part of good banking law. From the beginning, bank staff try to win against the customers grievances in most instances. The origin of the conflict may be a lapse of the bank itself in identifying the customer at the time of selling a product not suitable to the customer or imposing new charges without the knowledge of the customer. Therefore, the KYC/due diligence which is now confined to detect customers links to unlawful businesses should be extended to focus on mapping and improving the customers transactions worthiness gradually and targeted to attract the customers next generation also to the bank.
Research and development in customer base including market surveys of customer-needs and service satisfaction will help customer promotion because banks have to create customers and help them to become wealthier through basic financial intermediation and payment services. Customer guide books/hand-books covering products, costs, benefits and terms and conditions in place of ad-hoc marketing leaflets (that are scattered around the counters as seen in many pharmacies) will educate both public and bank staff on banking and promote relationships because all come to know their roles in banking transactions. If depositors also come to know that they cannot have banking services without running the systemic risk and their deposits are not risk-free, they may minimize their herd behavior of running on banks on bad information.
Everybody knows that banking cannot be advertised similar to fast foods or branded products because there is ethics not to steal money from or by banks. The products-marketing is to sell products somehow whereas products-awareness is to help consumers to buy products suitable to them. The latter is what banks should follow in relationship banking. However, if all banks compete for same customer groups in respective locations, especially few business groups, corporates and wealthy individuals, not only banks get trapped in deadly concentration risks, the markets and the economy which are the foundation for banks also will not expand. This is where banks have to find active business models to target wider customer segments such as community banking within the intermediation. In any case, banks getting into groups and conglomerates to engage in diverse businesses for synergies and diversification will end up in catastrophe for both banks and economies as they bring unknown business risks to already risky banking. No bank board or senior management is aware of how those conglomerates operate as even managing a small bank is a big action-research project.
No Panic on Monetary Policy Noises
The modern monetary policies also can cause some noises to banks by changing interest rates and liquidity conditions in the inter-bank market, mostly overnight,as they cannot do much in present private/bank money-dominant systems. Inter-bank liquidity is mostly connected with daily cash flow management issues and strategies of some banks which has nothing to do with the wider liquidity position in the economy. As the responsiveness of the monetary policies on credit and consumer price index-based inflation driven by various external shocks is negligible in modern economies with high intermediation of private money, the overall demand for bank money would stay in the trend of business and economic environment without a major response to small adjustments of the monetary policies generally phased out for several years in terms of theoretical views for the long-run which never ends.
Modern inter-bank-liquidity-based-open-market-operations-driven monetary policies have created a wide global network of financial dealers in asset markets inclusive of foreign currencies to gamble on the monetary policies through the artificially created volatility in interest rates and currency prices and to make profit at a loss to some others through speculations and volatility created by languages of new forward guidance-based policy communications. The Turkish President in his national speech made on August 10, commenting on the currency turmoil erupted in the Turkey in early August labeled them as economic hitmen of interest rates and currency plots.
As long as banks stay out of speculative dealings, monetary policy noises cannot have a major impact on banking systems in modern economies because banking is the ground manger of the macro economy as compared to desk-top managed monetary policies. In market environment, banks tend to supply bank money to match its demand, and any excess supply of bank money cannot prevail long because it would be costly to banks. Therefore, banks do not need to worry too much on the monetary policies and should carry on orderly business of money creation to provide for the demand for the liquidity to the wider real economy.
If banks get panic on the current wave of global monetary policies of interest rates and currency wars by betting on the loud noise of the US monetary policy-tightening or normalization and global responses, possible wrong decisions taken by banks to early prepare for unknown uncertainties may cause numerous risks to banks fund management.
Arrange Industry Surveillance
Industry co-operation is vital for protecting the trust in the banking industry. In general, banks themselves cut facilities to other banks (natural system of banking) at the on-set of a panic which results in the closure of the inter-bank market and exacerbating the banking panic. Excessive competition on new products and exposures without any industry analysis and awareness calls for banking crises. No banking or regulatory experts thought that the fee-based warehouse credit lines offered to shadow banks and corporates would be one of the key drivers that brought the chronic liquidity crisis into the banking system at the on-set of the last global financial crisis.
In this regard, banking associations which normally operate to bargain with the regulators and the state on taxes and regulations at present need to get re-organized to play a lead-professional business role in discussing and focusing on the industry stability issues as they know the ground situation of risks to their businesses. In fact, Central Banks were evolved from healthy banks who became early-stage correspondent banks or bankers banks by providing clearing facilities to banks and emergency funds to temporarily illiquid banks that indirectly helped the system stability. In early banking communities, some banking businessmen got together and arranged emergency funds to illiquid banks in order to avoid the industry-wide contagion in some occasions.
The alignment of the long-developed banking eco-system covering regulation, accounting standards-setting and monitoring, credit information, payments clearing mechanism, deposit insurance, credit rating, ombudsman and bankers training to suit local banking sector stability needs is also required as an external safeguard to the monetary and banking system. The eco-system provides a pitch to take risks with some safeguards to the system. Therefore, safeguarding the eco-system without allowing any of it to get into the grip of private profit-frenzied business hands or friends in the mask of innovations and reforms is also an urgent need that requires an on-going surveillance of banking industry associations.
Various industry associations which now operate on stand-alone basis with different motives should start performing lively as expert groups on respective banking business lines within an industry umbrella body to protect industrys stability interests. There are several other areas that require the attendance of industry expert groups. This initiative will help prevent stresses and risks of emergence of customer interest groups in the event of building up of an unhealthy perception on banks. As such, the banking industry itself is the best overseer and guardian of banks to prevent banking crises in future.
The banking crisis literature after establishing state-controlled monetary systems shows that regulators and governments will appear only after the crisis hit and the damage began to banks, economy and public. The state rescue operation is a painful political campaign that brings all sorts of discriminations to banks. It is a mystery why Lehman Brothers was let to fail causing the acceleration of the last global financial crisis in 2008 while all other unregulated big investment banks and AIG who were equally responsible for the causes of the crisis were rescued in the US. The notion of the too-big-to-fail while letting small players die in the so-called leveled-playing field that governs the state rescue operations is highly undemocratic because industry catastrophes are always created by the big ones. It is not the democracy if lifelines are given to the misbehaved rich while letting the majority poor who followed such rich to die during times of disasters created by the rich.
When there are small banks operating with difficulties even after few decades in business, the state granting new banking licenses due to whatever reasons should be a concern to the banking industry because each new bank will be a new risk to the system, despite whatever their business models and technical projections are. Further, the expectation of the state rescue may be bleak in future due to already excessive sovereign debt globally which may even cause public bankruptcies during crisis times as shown in some emerging and advanced market economies in the past. Such fundamental issues must be concerned by industry associations.
Concluding remarks
In reality, money and monetary systems are produced and governed by banks although they may not think so. However, their real economic contribution is not adequately recognized by the public due to the lack of knowledge on risk-taking by banks and resulting misperceptions. The history shows that money and banking crises occur from time to time due to lapses in bank business models with inappropriate risk-taking, given the monetary role of banks and fundamental problem. It is only little that the regulators and the states can do to prevent such crises, given the structural weaknesses involved in operations of public authorities and states in bank money-dominant monetary economies. Any state rescues in the event of crises will create immense complications and difficulties to banks through new rules and regulations and to the public through new taxes and debt. Therefore, it is the duty of the banks themselves to protect them if they are to be in good health in a sustainable manner for generations. The root for such protection is the conduct of business with a greater focus on the safeguard of the customer trust in place of the sugar high profit.
Above are only few thoughts that would help bankers to be mindful of facts surrounding their sustainability when they run their businesses if they are concerned about preventing money and banking crises in future in their own interest. However, a fundamental fix for the systemic risk problem of bank-money-dominant monetary economies with the present evolution of e-moneys, private crypto-currencies and private local currencies to avoid financial crises and recessions in future will take at least this century until a new monetary system is invented.

Plans to import Rs 644,000 per chair for WPC
Governor shoots down proposal
Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara yesterday ordered the Western Provincial Council Chief Secretary to cancel the order for the importation of chairs from Spain with immediate effect.
Addressing the media at his office in Rajagiriya yesterday, the Governor charged that the procedure followed to order chairs for the Western Provincial Council Chamber is a gross violation of accepted norms and procurement procedures.
There is no evidence to say who has proposed to purchase chairs similar to that of Parliament, he added.
The Governor further said that no one can estimate the cost of a chair in Parliament because all the fixtures and fittings in the Parliamentary building have been given as a gift by the Japanese Government to Sri Lanka.
Investigations have revealed that the Rs.644,000 per chair was without the import duty and when included the tax, the price of a chair would be approximately Rs.844,000, Nanayakkara said.
The council needs only 104 chairs whereas the original plan was to import 150 chairs. Subsequently, it was reduced to 144 chairs. When I inquired from those involved as to the reason for importing more chairs, they said that there could be an increase in the number of Provincial Councillors in the future. But according to my knowledge, there will be a reduction in the number of councilors in the future and it will be 102 after the next election, the Western Province Governor said.
Following a written complaint received with regard to the decision of importing expensive chairs, from JVP Western Provincial Councilor Lakshman Nipunaarachchi, I ordered the WPC Chief Secretary to halt the order and commence an investigation into the matter. Then, the Chief Secretary voluntarily accepted the responsibility of conducting an investigation into the matter.
Then he appointed a Committee headed by Western Province Deputy Chief Secretary Sirisoma Lokuvithana to prepare a comprehensive report after conducting a full investigation, Nanayakkara said.
The Committee appointed is comprised of Director (Internal Audit) of the Western Provincial Council K.P. Sanath Prasanna, Director (Engineering) G.W.G. Perera, Director (Finance) W.L.N.I. Wijesundara and Provincial Road Development Authority- Western Province Deputy General Manager L.L.D.G. Liyanarachchi.
The Governor alleged that this four member committee has submitted an incomplete report and by submitting this report they have attempted to mislead the Governor. I will take necessary action against them within the powers vested with the Governor.
Different groups are trying to take personal advantage by making various comments. But as far as I can fathom, this was done in a great hurry by flouting all accepted procurement procedures and the law of the land. As long as I am here, I will not allow these type of things to happen in the future, the Governor said.
If I get a reasonable complaint of any misappropriation of funds, abuse of power within the Western Provincial Council, stringent action would be taken. No one can put pressure on me. No Western Provincial Council minister nor officials can presurrise me. I work in an independent manner and with a clear conscience, he added. Secretary to the Governor P. Somasiri and Advisor to the Governor Athula Perera were also present.

Health benefits of raising kids around pets: Growing up together!
An idyllic childhood home isnt complete without the obligatory pet  but pets arent just there for fun and cuddles. Having a pet around can be of real benefit to a childs early development  and it might even be an amazing parenting tool if your kid is struggling with everything from loneliness to eczema.
1. They wont need as many antibiotics
Studies show that infants growing up with pets in the house need less antibiotics to protect themselves from the outside world. This is part of a mounting pile of evidence that shows that over-sanitation actually contributes to child sickness  the key is to slowly introduce microbes and bacteria to a babys immune system, letting it mature quickly to fight more dangerous threats later on. This also helps combat antibiotic resistance common in some adults, and pathogens themselves.
2. Theyll be healthier in general
These benefits dont just translate into less antibiotics usage  families of newborn children with pets in the house show less frequent incidences of colds, sore throats, and coughs. Pets who spent more time outdoors rather than with kids generally helped produce healthier children. This is probably because an outdoorsy pet gets to drag in more foreign bodies back home.
3. Pets are a self-esteem booster
If anything can be said about pets, its that their love is unconditional. Once they create a bond with you, its all over: theyll love you to death. Being with a pet and sharing that pets love can be a great way for your kid to learn that being dependable and kind are two great things to be.
4. Pets are a great way to instill a sense of responsibility
If youre willing to entrust a pet to your child, youd be giving them the task of taking responsibility for another living being. Pets arent too great when it comes to feeding themselves  or refilling their water bowls. Even just being in charge of feeding, bathing, and walking a pet can be a great way to teach children to be responsible.
5. Pets can be a great way to teach your child about equality and justice
Living and growing up with a pet can teach kids to take care of the less fortunate and the less able. By asking children to reorganize their priorities, putting others in front of themselves, you can teach them to be socially responsible and compassionate in a true, actionable sense, without bigotry. Pets arent just playthings  they require care and respect, as do all other living beings. This is even more true with smaller pets, like rabbits and guinea pigs, who require a more guardianship than the average dog or cat.
6. Kids growing up with pets have better social skills
Taking care of a pet requires communication  animals dont speak, so body language is an important part of figuring out what your pet wants. Kids growing up with pets are more compassionate, and can intuitively pick up on emotions that fellow humans display.
7. Pets can calm their owners
People growing up and living alongside pets show markedly lower rates of stress-related diseases and sicknesses, indicating that a pet is the perfect stress-reliever.
Pets also make the best confessionals  tell them your darkest secrets, and youre pretty much guaranteed not to get told on. They also tend to be happy around you, and happiness treats sadness. Thats scientifically valid.
8. Kids with pets are more active
Pets, especially dogs, require a lot of activity. From a young age, playtime is an important part of a puppys life, with all the wrestling and running that comes with it.
And when they get older, dogs need daily walks to keep their muscles and sanity intact.
9. Pets are intuitively trained to be around kids
Domesticated animals, specifically ones bred for companionship like dogs, have evolved to naturally communicate and cooperate with humans  and we may have evolved alongside them. This leads to dogs regularly asking for assistance from humans in problem solving, and that helps develop that special human-dog bond, and teaches kids to help others. Dogs also show a natural affinity towards social hierarchy, making themselves guardians of both the adults and children in the home. With proper socialization, this can forge a perfect family pet.
10. Kids + pets = best photo opportunities
If anything, having pictures of your kids with their pets just makes looking back through all those photo albums all the more satisfying. Kids can be cute. Pets can be cute. Cute x Cute = Cute. Its basic math.

Health staff warned against granting media access
Health authorities will be compelled to take action against health staff who grant access to the media to enter restricted areas like intensive care units, mortuaries and theatres, without necessary permission, to record visuals, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
He was speaking to the media during a session on suicide reporting guidelines at the Government Information Department auditorium on Wednesday.
He said that recently a television channel showed visuals of a health worker who opened the freezer of a mortuary for the media and disrespectfully touched the corpse. Health authorities cannot allow such incidents to take place.
I served at the Accident Ward of the General Hospital from 2001 to 2009 and the media was not allowed into the ICU, the mortuary or the theatres to record anything. Earlier, the media published and broadcast pictures with blood and body parts, but now the state does not allow such sensitive material to be published or broadcast, Dr. Jasinghe said.
Sometimes the media dramatises incidents. The electronic media reports incidents such as suicides like dramas, while reading a newspaper is like reading a novel that ends in tragedy. Positive news is not news, while negative news is always treated as hot news. Some newspapers publish what only a medical student needs to read; instead, newspapers should educate people on topics such as preventing diseases, he said.
Government Information Director General Sudarshana Gunawardana said that the government highly respected media freedom and the freedom of expression, but some reporting has negative effects.

I SHUN RAJAPAKSAS family bandysm - welgama
Kalutara district MP Kumara Welgama said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not talk about fielding a member of his own family as the next Presidential hopeful.
He said family bandyism is not suitable for the country and former President Rajapaksa faced defeat at the last presidential election due to this family centred rule.
Welgama, a close ally of the former President and a cabinet minister of his government, said many ministers were disheartened as the former President placed his family above everything.
Our family belongs to everyone. One family cannot claim ownership to presidential candidacy, he said.
In an interview with the Hindu on Wednesday, Rajapaksa had hinted that a member of his family would contest the Presidential election in 2020.
He added that there were many seniors in the party outside the family circle of the former President who were suitable to run for presidency.
We have to understand that J.R Jayewardene did not willingly give presidential candidacy to his successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did not willingly nominate Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Presidential candidate, Welgama said, indicating that the Joint Opposition would not be hesitant to take a strong stand if Rajapaksa attempted to keep Presidential candidacy within his own family. We should not forget that Maithripala Sirisena left our government and contested against us because he was not given the rightful place within the administration, he said.

Indias Shastri under fire  after England series defeat
New Delhi, Thursday: India coach Ravi Shastri has come under fire for his sides humiliating 4-1 Test series loss to England -- a second consecutive away defeat for the worlds top-ranked side.
The thrashing in England, following the loss in South Africa earlier this year, piles pressure on Shastri ahead of a tour to Australia in November and next years World Cup -- as well as a massive clash with arch-rivals Pakistan next week.
Critics and former captains have rounded on the coach, particularly for his mid-series claim that his team is the best to come out of India in 15 years.
Self-belief is a wonderful quality; but being caught in the bubble of your own publicity is self-defeating, said Sambit Bal, chief editor of cricket website Cricinfo, on Twitter.
India had their moments but the scorecards say 4-1 and India werent as good as they should have been, said noted commentator Harsha Bhogle. This is two overseas disappointments in a row now.
Prior to the final Test at the Oval -- which India lost by 118 runs -- Shastri had raised eyebrows with lavish praise for his side.
If you look at the last three years, we have won nine matches overseas and three series. I cant see any other Indian team in the last 15-20 years that has had the same run in such a short time, he said.
India have won two recent series in Sri Lanka and one in the West Indies.
But his comments rankled former star players.
Sourav Ganguly, who was part of the committee that appointed Shastri last year, dismissed the coachs claims as immature, telling Indian television Shastri must improve the team.
Sunil Gavaskar pointed out that Indian teams of the 1980s had won series in England and the West Indies -- as well as a series victory in England as recently as 2007.
The best travelling teams are made by performances on the ground and not by sitting in the dressing room and talking about it, added former Test opener Virender Sehwag.
Captain Virat Kohli leapt to his coachs defence following the final Test on Tuesday.
Asked about Shastris pre-match comments, Kohli said: We have to believe we are the best side, why not
In a tetchy exchange, Kohli turned the question on a journalist, who responded I am not sure. Kohli hit back: Youre not sure. That is your opinion. Thank you.
Shastri now has to immediately lift the side for the six-nation Asia Cup starting in the United Arab Emirates on Saturday -- without the brilliant Kohli, who is being rested.
The whole country will be watching as they take on arch-rivals Pakistan on September 19, with Rohit Sharma to lead the side throughout the 50-over contest.
India then have two Tests at home to West Indies before four Tests in Australia. AFP

Despite the 1-4 series drubbing at the hands of England, the Virat Kohli led sides position as the top Test ranked team was not affected, but its image as the worlds best has taken a severe beating with its famed batting line-up brutally exposed and open for scrutiny.
England climbed one place to take the fourth spot in the latest ICC Test Rankings, soon after defeating visitors India 4-1 in the five-match series. England, with 105 points replaced New Zealand (102 points) to take the fourth spot. Meanwhile, India, after their poor run in the series, maintained their top spot with 115 points.
The home side won the first Test with a narrow 31 runs margin against India. England, later outclassed the visitors to register victory by an innings and 159 runs in the second Test. The massive victory was followed by their only loss at the Trent Bridge and a 60-run win in Southampton.
England, thus stand a point behind Australia and South Africa who share 106 points each in the Test rankings.
England will face sixth-placed Sri Lanka in their next Test series, which is slated to get underway from November 6 at the Galle International Stadium in Galle, Sri Lanka,
India on the other hand, dropped 10 points after beginning their series with 125 points.
India will host West Indies in the next Test series, with the first match scheduled to begin from October 4 at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot.

Janabalaya  jitters
Lunacy expressed by the so-called Janabala campaign of Mahinda group shows that they are still at the retrogressive political level showed in their downfall in 2015. They are unable to come out of the retrogressive parochial chauvinist framework that they have built for themselves when they had unlimited power. That process though political primitive, was with an anti-feminist, anti-rational, strong emotional impact. The downfall of Mahinda started and gathered momentum; with the impeachment of CJ, the first female Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayke in January 2013.
The impeachment involved a dramatic set of events which stripped the judiciary of almost all its independence. In 2011 tensions between the Chief Justice and the executive reached its pinnacle when Shirani ruled that the Governments desire to create a Divineguma (improving lives) required referral to the Provincial Councils for their assent. I was one of the signatories to the petition that went before CJ. At that time I was noted as an adversary of the Mahinda regime and a pro-devolution campaigner. This added to ignite a campaign vilifying the Chief Justice. They claimed that by upholding the thirteenth amendment, she was encouraging separatism, and consolidating the power of Provincial Councils; A powerful attack on fascistic politics.
Mahinda regime
All this went against the Mahinda regime threatened by any organ which dilutes its power and any part of the Constitution which can validate this dilution. On November 2012, members of the Governing United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) provided the Speaker with a resolution accusing the Chief Justice of fourteen allegations of alleged misconduct signed by 177 members of Parliament. According to some accounts, ministers affirmed the impeachment despite being deprived of a chance to actually read the allegations that were made against Shirani.
On January 13, Mahinda delivered a proclamation removing Shirani from office. Two days later, Mohan Peiris, former Attorney General and at that time, a legal advisor to the Cabinet and to the Rajapaksa family was sworn in as Chief Justice. Promoting such people to the higher courts deliberately ensured that the judiciary will be subordinated to the executive mindset. It demonstrated Mahindas desire to elect someone who would beckon to the power of the president, rather than question it.
This impeachment crisis further prolonged the trend towards unfettered and irregular exercise of executive power without any regard for due process, the judiciary and the Constitution. The independence of the judiciary was fundamentally undermined and its ability to act as a check on the executive and legislative branches was eradicated. In fact, the nature of which Parliamentary debate and voting for the impeachment motion occurred proved that like the judiciary, the legislature was also servile to the executive and ceased to act as a check on the executive.
As pundits articulate, the rules of the game were no longer separated from the game; in reality, constitutional structures were captured on Mahindas playing field. He removed the judiciarys check on his power and consolidated a racist fascistic, authoritarian regime. These events illustrated Mahindas purposeful plan to remove institutional prerequisites of a democracy which exist as a counter to executive misuses. It is clear the impeachment of the Chief Justice completed the Constitutional Coup which had begun with the 18th Amendment.
Democratic institutions
The second portion of the fascistic intervention includes Mahindas more explicit actions to sweep out democratic institutions. Although these attacks are less legalistic and procedural, the first part of the narrative very much strengthened and bolstered the force of them. A significant operation that underpinned Mahindas reign was the centralization of power through family rule.
Rajapaksa offered powerful government positions to his family members, both immediate and distant to erode the checks on his power and to ensure that he faced minimal dissent. Basil, Gotabhaya and Namal Rajapaksa are just a few of the household family figures who arrogated power during this reign. Hence, encircled by his family Rajapaksa opened opportunities for corruption, abuse of power and bribery. For instance, the judiciary and the press were intimidated to act in ways that benefit the Rajapaksa family and therefore, were forced to be servile to their power.
Although nepotism has not widely been written about in the democratic decay framework, arrogating power in this way has a damaging effect on democracy. Such personalized governance allowed Mahinda to firstly concentrate power in the hands of his family, and then monopolize and entrench his own presidential power and to use it in the way he desired, with minimal resistance and transparency. The domination of this patronage system was also a large reason why there was little opposition in Parliament to the 18th amendment. The manipulation of practice already in place, acted as the facilitating framework to allow the passing of the amendment in parliament. In reverse, manipulations of practice were then given backing by the constitutional or legal methods to safeguard their existence and vitality.
The master-plan was, therefore, all-encompassing. Hence, it is clear that single parts of Mahindas were strengthened when they were executed together as they open greater opportunities to further weaken democracy. It ensured that the appearance of democracy was seen to be upheld as different portfolios and roles existed and were fulfilled, however, in reality, they were occupied by people that were constantly bolstering and protecting Mahindas power. In this way, Mahinda could use the superficial appearance of democracy and the backing of the electorate to minimize challenges to his rule and remove important accountability mechanisms of a democratic state.
What happened in the past should be a lesson we go through again, and again. Fascism comes with shouting for democracy and peoples power, which they crush in many ways as you could see in the short history of the Mahinda regime.

Japans Osaka has no regrets over chaotic US Open final
Yokohama, Thursday: Japan's Naomi Osaka has refused to criticise Serena Williams after her historic US Open victory was overshadowed by the American's furious row with the chair umpire.
The 20-year-old melted hearts when she broke down sobbing after thrashing her idol 6-2, 6-4 to become Japan's first Grand Slam singles champion in New York last weekend.
Japanese tennis legend Kimiko Date told AFP it made her "heart ache" to see Osaka reduced to tears and unable to savour her moment of glory.
But after returning to Japan on Thursday, Osaka insisted there were no hard feelings towards Williams, who branded umpire Carlos Ramos a "thief" in an astonishing tantrum triggered by a code violation for coaching that culminated in a docked game.
"For me I don't feel sad because I wouldn't even know what I'm expected to feel," said Osaka, who has climbed from 19th to seventh in the new world rankings.
"I don't think I even thought about feeling sad because there's no experience for me to draw on in any other Grand Slam final," she added.
"I just thought I shouldn't have any regrets. Overall I felt really happy and know I accomplished a lot."
Osaka, who competes at next week's Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, also revealed her plans to break into the top five this year -- and win a shiny gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
"I think for this year my immediate goal would be to get to Singapore," said Osaka after putting herself firmly in contention to reach the season-ending WTA Finals. "I want to do well at the Pan Pacific Open and maybe year-end top five -- but I'm not putting pressure on myself. For now I'm just sort of riding the wave." "Of course I'm very excited the Olympics are going to be held in Tokyo," added Osaka, who is of Haitian-Japanese descent and was raised in the United States.
"It's every athlete's dream to play in the Olympics, so of course it would be my goal to win gold."
Date, a former world number four, has tipped Osaka to become Japan's first tennis number one.
But for now Osaka is itching to do normal stuff -- like catch up with big sister Mari, who is also a professional tennis player, go shopping and eat her favourite matcha ice cream.
"I guess I'd like to hang out with my sister -- I haven't seen her since Wimbledon," said Osaka, who has become an unlikely hero in a country still reeling after a summer of deadly typhoons and earthquakes.
"The Pan Pacific is so close and I have to be on a diet for my matches, so maybe afterwards for the ice cream." Asked how she felt about being a role model for young children, Osaka gave mixed signals.
"I've always thought Kei (Nishikori) was a super good role model and hopefully I can be that too," she said. "But don't look up to me, because I don't want that responsibility!"

Keeping mum
It is reported that JO Parliamentarians Johnston Fernando and Siripala Gamlath had not spoken even a single word in Parliament for the last three years. Neither of them had taken part in any Parliamentary debate since September 01, 2015. (In addition, out of the 283 sitting days of the Eighth Parliament, Fernando had marked his presence on 101 days and Gamlath, 70 days).
Incredible indeed, when one takes into account the loquacity of Johnston Fernando outside court houses, where he is being paraded before on a regular basis these days, when the MP speaks to the media. He was also a huge draw on TV chat shows in the past opening his mouth wide on behalf of Mahinda Rajapaksa, not to mention political platforms where his gift of the gab was very evident. Little is known of Gamlath, though, other than that he represents Polonnaruwa.
Most would venture to say that it is best that at least some MPs keep mum in the House, given the babel that is created in the August assembly on a regular basis. In any event, what passes off as Parliament speeches are nothing more than empty rhetoric. The likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Mahindananda Aluthgamage, no doubt, have more than made up for the silence of the Johnston-Gamlath duo not only with their garrulity but also other theatrics. Anyway, not much is missed by way of contribution to Parliament debate by Johnston Fernando if one were to consider the venom and vitriol he lets out in public, the kind of which ill befits the dignity and decorum, one is told, is associated with the country's supreme legislature. In fact, except for a few, most of our people's representatives hardly make any meaningful contribution to Parliamentary debate, which is the common thinking today. For a majority of them, Parliament is a place for rest and recreation topped up by a sumptuous meal at a heavily subsidised rate. When not dozing, they are at each other's throats and running away with the Mace, making a mockery of the whole Parliamentary system.
In a way, by keeping mum, the two MPs may have contributed towards reducing the din, even by a small measure- a din which had terrorized schoolchildren in the public gallery in the past. In fact it is best that other MPs too follow suit and remain silent, if Parliament is to regain its lost honour and prestige that was preserved by people's representatives of the immediate post Independence era. That was the time when Parliamentary debates were known for their intellectual content and where political giants matched their wits in the kind of parry and thrust which none of the present incumbents could ever aspire to. It was said that the Public Gallery, then, was often occupied by professionals, academics and university students lapping up the pearls of wisdom that flowed from the tongues of the NMs, Colvins and the Bandas. Not that Parliament was a dull affair then. It had its own quota of skirmishes. But never did these go beyond the established protocol and accepted norms of Parliament, according to old timers.
Be that as it may, there will be those among the voting public who will question the feasibility of maintaining the current crop of people's representatives who fail to represent their interests in Parliament. The tax payers fork out Rs. 4 million for each days sittings of the House. Are they getting value for money The constituents of the two MPs no doubt would feel let down upon hearing that they had, let alone raising their voices, on their behalf, had kept mum for a full three years in Parliament.
One recalls a similar instance where Sri Lanka's premier starlet of the silver screen who entered Parliament on the National List, during the Rajapaksa era, failing to make even a single contribution to Parliamentary debate. When she did eventually speak, it was to let out some choice billingsgate against an Opposition MP (This actress cum MP also created a faux pas by tendering her resignation from Parliament and within days taking her oaths again). Like all MPs, she was also entitled to a duty free vehicle permit and is today the recipient of a fat pension, for her trouble.
The Rajapaksa candidacy
It looks as if the Rajapaksas are set for a long innings at the wicket. Currently on a visit to India, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told The Hindu that his brother certainly would be a contender at the next Presidential Election. More bad news was to follow for those in the pohottuwa aspiring for leadership. Rajapaksa told the interviewer that his son Namal could not be a Presidential Candidate since the Government had raised the age limit for a contestant.
In other words, in addition to his brothers, there is Namal Rajapaksa waiting in the wings to take over, at maturity, when the brothers have had enough and are done with.
Kumara Welgama, who, on more than one occasion, had openly stated in public that he had all the qualifications to take over the leadership, perhaps, will not have his aspirations fulfilled in his lifetime.

LKI forum makes clear case for  FTAs
To most people who arent economics or maths wizards, the topic of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) is a bit of a hazy subject. Its logical then that all over the world, FTAs are seen as contentious, where people fear that their national interests are being compromised to other countries, without gaining a whole lot in return.
People in Sri Lanka and elsewhere worry that critical jobs are syphoned away or made obsolete by labour from foreign markets. These anxieties are common and often well-founded, but also stem from a lack of understanding  or a lack of clear explanation.
A forum discussing FTAs at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) last week, titled Whats in it for us made a refreshingly clear case for Sri Lanka to engage in FTAs, explaining the importance of international trade cooperation in the developing global marketplace.
Sri Lankas post-war economy has been dominated by the domestic economy, said Economist and Finance Ministry Advisor Deshal De Mel.
He said that for years Sri Lanka accepted foreign loans with extremely low interest rates, between zero and two percent. But after 2017, off-shore borrowing significantly increased and simultaneously, Sri Lanka was crossing over into the category of a middle-income country.
Suddenly, we are seeing our foreign debt repayment obligations increasing significantly, which has contributed to negative public perceptions of Sri Lankas foreign loans, said De Mel, who argues that the situation is a cost of development. Once you cross into middle-income country status, those kinds of concessional interest rates are no longer available.
In order to alleviate the burden of debt repayment, De Mel advocated furthering trade and investments with, and from, other countries. It is clear that Sri Lanka needs to increase its foreign earnings, he said, listing the examples of export of goods and services, foreign direct investment, tourism, and foreign remittances.
He also said that the key to Sri Lankas future economic success is to bring down tariffs in the long-term, with transparent, predictable, rules-based agreements, and to look towards the bright horizons of a dynamic Asian market. Its clear that we need to realign our strategy, he said, particularly with regard to the ASEAN region. Since forming, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) market has managed to create economic partnerships with 2.6 billion people across 16 countries.
De Mel chose to take lessons from ASEAN, rather than the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), where political divisions are major inhibitors to trade. We are still very much a couple of decades behind in that sense, he said.
ASEAN, on the other hand, grew with investment and genuine economic cooperation within the Asian region, and from outward investment from Japan, he said.
De Mel also unpacked what that kind of cooperation looks like in todays economic context. He explained that finished products are a vestige of the 80s and 90s, (building a car with all of the necessary materials in one location, for example). Today, with free trade agreements and lowered tariffs, companies contract out work to different countries that either have access to certain materials more easily, or offer labour at a lower cost. This way, companies can make a lot more money. This piece-meal production line means that many different countries are producing intermediate products that are ultimately assembled in one place to form the finished product. Most of global trade today is driven by intermediate products, said De Mel.
Sri Lanka, on the other hand, deals mostly in finished products, specifically apparel and tea. In fact, these two items make up 60 percent of all Sri Lankan exports (with about 45 percent comprising apparel and 15 percent comprising tea). For a long time, Sri Lanka had a competitive advantage in the apparel industry, because it had comparatively low labour costs. This model is not sustainable, argued De Mel: Labour costs have increased in Sri Lanka and we need to find new areas where we can compete.
Thats where FTAs come in. For Sri Lankas future, if we want to go into new products, said De Mel, its essential that we go out of this domestic structure, and into a dynamic trade-based structure.
Mangala Yapa, Managing Director of the Agency for Development of the Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry said, You cant think about a new Sri Lanka, a new economy, without thinking about FTAs.
Sri Lanka is well-placed to enter into strategic FTAs that would better its economy, he said. I dont think in this part of the world, there is any other country with this kind of locational advantage between East Asia, South Asia, Australia and the Middle East. But, what are we doing with this advantage asked Yapa, in a way that suggested that Sri Lanka could be doing more.
He said that Sri Lanka is increasingly excluded from global trading patterns and that to gain a foothold in the ASEAN economy, the country must develop a network into the East Asian and South East Asian regions.
Yapa focused on how the country could seize the geographical advantages of its major ports (both airports and sea ports), in Colombo, Hambantota, Mattala, Trincomalee, and Hingurakgoda, which are seen as strategic also to China. China and other countries are so keen. We have a huge market around us, he said.
Creating agreements with countries like India, Bangladesh and China, says Yapa, means creating investors in Sri Lanka. What would make Sri Lanka attractive, he explained, is making these ports viable, and in that way, making Sri Lanka seem like not just one, but many economic markets to explore. Thats another thing that FTAs do: they create a multifaceted network of countries which looks more appealing to investors.
Executive Director (Acting) and Chair of the Global Economy Programme at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja said that East Asia has used FTAs for its economic strategy, because they genuinely open up a country to foreign investment. This is the way the world is going, and what it means for countries outside of this region is that the cost to trade and investment in these blocs is much higher without them, and thats a big problem. This means that if Sri Lanka were not to enter into trade agreements with other Asian countries, by default, the cost of trading with those countries would be much higher. What we have to do and be smart, and what East Asia was able to do, is to have strategies that maximise the benefits and minimise the costs, he said.
Another reason why FTAs are good for the economy is that by increasing competition and also raising standards they can improve productivity, said Dr. Wignaraja.
Importantly, though, East Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, and China implemented domestic social welfare programmes before they began the process of opening up. They opened up in a very cautious manner. These countries were not passive, they did domestic reforms before. They invested in human capital, he said.
This was very much a warning from Dr. Wignaraja, who said that FTAs are not neutral in losses and gains. He outlined the potential losses: downsizing, lost jobs, cheap products that flood markets, to name a few. He said that some workers will win, but some will certainly lose, and the government plays a critical role in alleviating the threats that FTAs can pose to domestic workers.
De Mel mentioned that government programmes like Enterprise Sri Lanka and other credit schemes could be used to address the domestic impacts of FTAs. He and the other speakers seemed to believe that FTAs can play an important role in catalysing governments to implement social programmes.
What made the discussion so effective was its ability to put complex economic systems into plain English, so that the audience was left with a better understanding of the problems and promises of Free Trade Agreements. While they may spell major markets and big benefits for the Sri Lankan economy, in order for the average citizen to embrace FTAs, clear and practical arguments must be made for them.

## Title: Mesmerizing leg spin, googly bowler
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C

Mesmerizing leg spin, googly bowler
MOHAMED LAREEF IDROOS was a born match winner. How else would I describe the guy who was my friend but nemesis as well. For starters he joined a rare band of bowlers who had captured all ten wickets. That was against Prince of Wales College playing for STCML. Two hat tricks in SARA' cricket against Bloomfield and Moratuwa and being crowned 'Best All rounder 'SARA' trophy cricketer in 1965. Amazing.
As our careers unwound, we were destined to lead our two schools in 1960.Playing against him he had a match haul of 10 wickets to spin the Thomians to victory at Kotahena under Michael Tissera and the Bens under Neville Casie Chetty in 1958. That outstanding cricket writer of that era Christie Seneviratne who played for Wesley College writing in the DAILY NEWS headlined his copy  BENEDICTINES COULD NOT COPE WITH IDROOS SPIN  and the Strapline read - THOMIANS FOUND RODRIGOPULLE UNPLAYABLE. Memories are made of these.
And today's 'Sports Legend' MOHAMED LAREEF IDROOS mesmerized most schoolboy batsmen during his glittering school career.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were a plethora of leg spin/ googly bowlers who were masters of their chosen field in bowling the most difficult variety that bowling of that art required. Leg spin bowling to reiterate is the most difficult art, unlike an off spinner. Leg spin bowlers are born and not easily made. To master the variety in this art  the leg spin, googly, slider, top spinner and the floater requires many hours of sweat and toil at the nets and could be heart breaking at times.
But once these intricacies are mastered, the leg spin bowler can be a match winner. With a well concealed googly bowled with a leg break action, the spinner can make the best of batsmen look ordinary, not being able to read which way the ball will turn after pitching.
Embarrassing to the gloveman
Unless a sign is made before delivering the googly, it can make even the wicket keeper go the wrong way which could be embarrassing to the gloveman. Once a leg spinner strikes a length and on a wicket that is spin friendly, he can run through any batting line up.
And so here are but few of the spells that the IDROOS cast and I marveled at: 6 for 48 against St. Peters College and in which game he bowled the burly Lakshman Serasinghe round his legs. Then against St.Josephs College he had a match bag of 10 for 83.
To quote what the master class leg spinner IDROOS has to say in the art of specializing in leg spin bowling: Bowling leg breaks is a tough art. Then to bowl googlies, you need to work really hard and practice a lot.
Keep hitting the coin
Reminds me of the days I was practicing to bowl leg spin. My coaches from under 12 would place a coin at a particular spot on the matting and urge me to keep hitting that coin. It was frustrating and hard going but once mastered and when you get among wickets the joy and ecstasy is immense.
IDROOS after graduating from junior level played for the school by the sea from 1957 to 1960. His captains were the mercurial Michael Tissera 57 and 58. Dennis Ferdinands who was then the fastest schoolboy bowler in 59 and he captained in 1960.
His coaches were L.S.Gauder who was master-in-charge and the year he captained it was that legend F.C. de Saram who was a household name in the 1940s in England and Sri Lanka also captaining the country.
Wealth of knowledge
IDROOS, when he was captain, learnt a lot from Gauder because he had a wealth of knowledge and was a skillful master. IDROOS used to go to his place every Thursday to discuss match tactics.
With apologies for what may seem self-serving, permit this writer to go down memory lane and reminisce, in the years 1958/59 and 60 in school cricket.
IDROOS and the writer were tagged' the most successful schoolboy bowlers in this art. In fact in 1958 IDROOS and the writer were vying for the Best Bowlers prize with me leading at the half way stage. But like in horse racing parlance IDROOS pulled away and richly won the Best Bowlers award.
In the 1958 inter-school game, and in that era crowds used to fill the ground one hour before play starts at 12 noon. In the Benedictine  Thomian game of 1958 , the writer captured 6 for 45 in the first innings.
Match haul of 10 wickets
IDROOS also took 5 for 43 in the second innings against St.Benedicts at Mount Lavinia in 1957 which game STCML lost. SBC was led by that amazing all round sportsman and arguably the best Bens sportsman LOVELLY RAYEN who played six sports for his school Cricket, Football, Athletics, hockey, table tennis and basketball. That year the Bens emerged unofficial cricket champs for the first time in their history. The writer as the baby of the team (15 years) was a part of that history.
Harvest of wickets
IDROOS who captured a harvest of wickets in inter-school cricket would regret that he could not get among the wickets in the prestigious Royal-Thomian in the years 1957, 58 and 59. But this never-say-die spinner IDROOS broke the hoodoo in the 1960 game. He ran riot and took 5 for 47 and 2 for 54.
IDROOS captured two hat tricks in Sara Trophy cricket. On leaving school he played or Moors, SSC and Saracens. He was picked for Sri Lanka on the tour of India under Michael Tissera but failed to play in the unofficial Test which was a travesty of justice where the country scored a historic victory against India led by Mansur Ali Pataudi. Sri Lanka with that win served notice of its prowess in the game.
IDROOS was born in Hultsdorf and moved to Kollupitiya. His father Taufeeque was a keen cricket fan and would be present in every game his son played. On leaving school he entered University to follow medicine. He played for the University from 1961 and the UNI created history being the first side to win the Sara trophy in the 62/63 season under Josephian Carlyle Perera.
Missed by a whisker
IDROOS recalls how the UNI missed by a whisker of winning the Sara again in the 63,64 season. IDROOS once recalled those moments thus: We met Bloomfield in the final. Bloomfield was 8 wickets down and they required another 80 odd runs. I bowled to Norton Fredrick who going for a big slog miscued and Carlyle got under it. But he could not believe as the easy catch was grassed.
Then with about 15 minutes to stumps it started to rain and the umpires called off play. The match was drawn and Bloomfield won the Sara with a difference of 0.04 points. He recalls that UNI team with glee.
The UNI team- Carlyle Perera (C), Buddy Reid (vc), Lareed Idroos, Mano Ponniah, Nihal Gurusinghe, U.R.P. Gunetilleke, Harsha Samarajeewa, Nanda Senanayake, N.J.S de Mel, K. Wimalaratne, Merril Guneratne, Adiel Anghie, Cyril Ernest, Mohanlal Fernando, Kingsley Fernando and that great wicket keeper from Jaffna V.Sivanandan, cream of schoolboy cricketers of that golden era.
Played in the Gopalan Trophy
IDROOS also played in the Gopalan trophy games and toured Pakistan in 63/65. He played for the Board Presidents X1 against Pakistan at the Colombo Oval. He graduated from Medical School in 1967 and two years later left for USA in 71.
IDROOS continued playing cricket in USA and represented the country along with Cyril Ernest and Balakrishnan in the annual encounter against Canada.
After having a stint in New York he moved to California where he specialized in Nephrology and became a Nephrologist. Such classy players and leaders with sports and academia rolled into one are rare to find these days. Rarer still are gentleman of IDROOS' class.

More adult men committing suicide
More adult men commit suicide although more young females commit suicide than adult females, Consultant Psychiatrist Prof. Thilini Rajapaksa said.
In the past, more young men committed suicide. This was when Sri Lanka was the worlds second highest in suicide rates (47 percent out of 100,000), Prof. Rajapaksa said.
She was addressing a seminar at the Government Information Department Auditorium on the theme `Working together to prevent suicides', on Wednesday.
She said the suicide rate in Sri Lanka now is about 14 or 15 out of 100,000.
Mental Health Director Dr. Chithramalee de Silva said in the 1995/1996 era, about 8,500 or 9,000 Sri Lankans out of 100,000 committed suicide. However, this number has come down now. In 2017, about 50 percent of suicides were due to hanging while 25 to 30 percent of suicides were due to ingestion of poisons.

Malpractice-free driving tests
Move to scuttle  project - Commissioner
Motor Traffic Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said yesterday a conspiracy was afoot to scuttle the pilot project aimed at preventing malpractices at the driving licence practical test.
On Cabinet recommendations, the practical test process was handed over to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC). We have outsourced 75 practical tests to the Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC) and the balance 25 practical tests to the SLTB.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the project will be conducted on an experimental basis for the next six months.
Since this move has led to loss of income for certain examiners, they have got together with some driving instructors, owners of driving schools and brokers to protest against this, Chandrasiri said.
We took this measure after considering the complaints by applicants about the difficulties and malpractices they face during the practical tests. It is necessary for applicants applying for driving licenses for the first time, to appear before the relevant branch on the correct date given by the Werahera branch of the DMT to face the practical test. On the other hand, many complaints have been received that applicants have to spend a whole day at DMT branches wasting their time to face the practical test. The congestion will be reduced with this new move, he added.
There are also allegations that those who fail the tests, bribe the examiner to obtain the license. All these malpractices have resulted in undisciplined and unskilled drivers who would be prone to cause road accidents which are on the increase in the country.
He said the examiners were given the task of regulating driving schools, but they have not done their job in a satisfactory manner. We will now create a new mechanism to regulate driving schools, he added.

MR, JO are hypocrites - UNP MP
Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition (JO) are a group of hypocrites, who speak against India when they visit China and condemn China when they visit India, UNP-MP Harshana Rajakaruna said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the UNP Headquarters Sirikotha yesterday, he said.
When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka, Wimal Weerawansa called on the whole country to raise black flags.
Now I challenge him to raise black flags against Mahinda Rajapaksa upon his arrival to the country. When Mahinda is in India along with his son Namal, they are praising India and condemning China. During an interview with the Hindu Newspaper, when he was asked about his views on giving Mattala to India, he skillfully avoided the question and wanted to talk about the President and the government.
If he was straightforward, he should have directly voiced his displeasure over the Mattala Airport deal. But he did not do that as he has always held double standards. This is the type of person that the JO is trying to bring back to lead this country, Rajakaruna said.
He said the JO is trying to hide their shame for a flopped protest that they brought up this milk packet allegation to hide their shame. He said the UNP has no need to resort to such low actions. He said Basil Rajapaksa was a notable absentee at the protest organised by Namal Rajapaksa.
I have my suspicion that Basil Rajapaksa could have been behind this milk packet issue to disrupt the protest. The JO boasted that they would not go back without toppling the government and that they would continue the protest and bring the people onto the streets to chase the government and take over power. Their protest was an utter flop and they could not even last until morning, let alone topple the government.
Rajakaruna said they urge the police to investigate the milk packet allegation and reveal the true culprits. We suggest that the police look whether Basil has involved in this act.
Kurunegala District UNP-MP Thushara Indunil said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken his successor Namal Rajapaksa to India to meet Indian PM Narendra Modi to promote his son as a future leader of Sri Lanka. He had told an Indian newspaper that one of his brothers would contest the presidency as his son was still underage. We would like to know which Rajapaksa brother would contest the Presidential election. If Gotabhaya is chosen, he will join his military junta and Namal baby will not stand a chance. If he chooses Basil, it will be even worse, as be will ensure Namal never gets a chance. While some in the JO are canvassing for Chamal Rajapaksa, this will be the end of Namal as he will then ensure Shashendra Rajapaksa takes on after him and not poor Namal baby. Hence, we ask Mahinda Rajapaksa, which Rajapaksa brother would you promote as the Presidential candidate
MP Indunil said Mujibur Rahman and he had toured the streets on the day of the protest just to get a glimpse of the crowds that would attend the protest as boasted by the JO. We did not distribute milk or pick up empty milk packets. We witnessed only drunk men sprawled on the streets and others consuming alcohol in groups.
This was a pathetic protest and an utter flop. Now they are blaming us about some milk packet issue and trying to hide their shame and failure. He said that not only Basil Rajapaksa, but even Gotabhaya could have been behind this milk packet issue just to bring Namal to disrepute as he was the one who organised this deflated and pathetic protest.

MR wallows in family politics - Shan Wijayalal
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has no option other than a member of his family for the candidate at the next Presidential election, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He was responding to question by the media at his office on Wednesday.
I read an interview he had with The Hindu in his stay in India. He had stated that his brother would certainly be the contender at the next Presidential Election as his son could not contest it owing to the minimum age limit to contest a Presidential election. He does not wish for a new face outside his family which shows his ambition to keep the Presidency as an inheritance of the Rajapaksa family, the Chief Minister said.
He does not say which brother, Gotabhaya, Basil or Chamal, he said.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has already opted for one selection. The next SLFP Presidential Candidate will be President Maithripala Sirisena. He was elected an independent candidate at the previous presidential election after he became the party leader. We, the party members, solicited him to be the next presidential candidate of the party to which he responded positively.
The SLFP next Presidential contender will be President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.

Paul Collingwood to end 23-year professional career at seasons end
Former England all-rounder Paul Collingwood has announced on Thursday his retirement from all forms of cricket.
The 42-year-old will step down after Durham's final game of the County Championship series, against Middlesex on 24-27 September.
In a statement through the club, Collingwood said, "After much thought and deliberation, I have decided to announce my retirement from cricket at the end of the current season.
"I knew this day would eventually come but it hasn't made it any easier - although it's an emotional decision, I know that the time is right and I'm comfortable knowing that I have given every last ounce of energy to the sport.
"I have achieved so much with both Durham and England; far more than I ever imagined and I feel extremely privileged to have had such a long and rewarding career.
"It has been an honour to represent Durham County Cricket Club for the last 23 years and I would like to thank the staff, coaches, teammates and members for their tremendous support and for making my career so enjoyable. "I am excited about what the future holds for me and am looking forward to new challenges."
Collingwood was born in Durham and made his debut for the club in 1996. A three-time Ashes winner and the only man to captain England to a global trophy after leading them to glory in the 2010 World Twenty20, Collingwood played 68 Tests, 197 one-day internationals and 36 T20 matches.
He retired from international cricket in 2011, and won the 2013 County Championship title with Durham.
He won three club awards at the end of last season, including player of the year, and players' player of the year. Collingwood has amassed 16,891 runs and 164 wickets in 304 first-class appearances throughout his career.
He was awarded an MBE in the 2006 New Year's Honours list for his part in England 2005 Ashes victory. It sparked a long-running feud with Australia's Shane Warne, who has been questioning whether he deserved the gong ever since.
Durham County Cricket Club chairman Sir Ian Botham said: "Paul is one of the greatest all-rounders to ever grace the game of cricket and to have him playing at Durham, his home county, for all these years has been an absolute privilege.  Agencies

Middle-income houses
PMs loan proposal for Cabinet consideration
Upon the request made by Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has tabled a proposal to the Cabinet concerning loan facilities for those willing to purchase apartments in middle-income housing schemes, Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka said on Wednesday.
The Minister was speaking at a ceremony to hand over the Lake Crest Residencies housing complex in Mulleriyawa, to the public. The ceremony was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Ranawaka, speaking on the middle-income housing scheme projects, said that most of the targetted group cannot afford these apartments without obtaining loans. These people have to keep a deposit with the UDA when purchasing a house. They have to pay the balance separately for which they need to obtain a loan. However, these families cannot meet the conditions put forward by the banks when applying for a loan. So at the end of the day, they cannot purchase these apartments, he said.
I would like to request President Maithripala Sirisenas intervention in the matter. Minister Ranawaka said. There are 300,000 families without permanent housing facilities.
He also said that the government plans to create a village for artists with housing and other infrastructure facilities in Piliyandala, under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasooriya. The project will be funded by the Chinese government. Minister Ranawaka said the government targets establishing 5,000 housing units in Colombo city for those who do not have permanent houses. We have planned 10 projects, each containing 500 apartment units. We have already begun six of those projects. We are planning to start the rest by the end of this year, he said.
During this year, we will construct houses worth Rs. 48,000 million in Colombo city. The government has contributed Rs. 17,000 million and the rest is from the UDA. No other government institute has been able to make such a large investment, he said.

Multidisciplinary approach  needed to combat ragging
Rage on the hallowed ground
Getting ragged or bullied in university is something every fresher dreads. The menace keeps making a comeback into universities and with the most recent update of a suicide letter penned by Sabaragamuwa University student Amali Chathurika surfacing, the topic is back in the debate.
Amalis plight is only a drop in the ocean as many incidents go unreported. Ever since Peradeniya University student Rupa Rathnaseeli jumped from the second floor of Ramanathan Hall to escape physical ragging, was confined to a wheelchair for many years till she committed suicide in 1997, a rising number of cases related to ragging has been reported throughout the years.
Yes, people may do it for fun, but sometimes the tradition of ragging goes hazardously wrong. Many of those who have been at the receiving end, dont always dig it. While no college permits it, students consider it integral to university life, at some level or the other. Ragging today is poles apart from how it was practised many decades ago. Rather than being limited to teasing and making the new students get on stage to sing a song or act a part in a drama or film, ragging now often includes physical abuse and sexual harassment. Recognised as one of the worst forms of human rights abuse that takes socially and legally unacceptable patterns of verbal, physical, sexual and mental torture, ragging is so brutal in some cases that the victim either commits suicide or it results in death.
According to the University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Professor Mohan de Silva, ragging has caused 14 deaths so far.
1,989 students have left Sri Lankan state universities in 2016/2017. Entry to Sri Lankan state universities is extremely difficult. Out of around two lakhs, only about 115, 000 students will be eligible for university entrance. The UGC selects about 30, 000 out of the applicants. The Advanced Level results are usually announced on April 4. The UGC opens the application process on the third week of April and it will close in six weeks. The university cut-off marks are released in June or July. After a student is registered to a Sri Lankan state university he or she will never be selected again for university entrance. If you register and later leave the university, you have lost the opportunity of graduating at a state university in Sri Lanka, Prof de Silva explained.
Only a small minority pursue education abroad. The students also wait for a span to enter university and then leave after they have been enrolled there. Even if the student gets a job offer, he or she will still continue to study at the state university because the degree is quite valuable. A student also has a wide variety of subjects to choose from in the stream that he or she chooses. Students who have passed the Advanced Level examination well will have no problem facing these exams, he said adding that there is no way that the students have left the state universities for private sector universities because that demands a lot of money.
The UGC launched the Center for Gender Equity/Equality last year. Professor Uma Coomaraswamy is its director. A 24-hour hotline (0112123700) has been established so that anyone can lodge a complaint. Students can also visit www.ugc.ac.lk/rag and type their complaint and send evidence.
We have had 434 complaints during the past one and a half years. Some of them are even about physical abuse. The students are reluctant to step forward with their complaints because as soon as they do it, they are cornered in the university and assaulted, Prof de Silva said.
He says that students from low-income families who enter the universities are brainwashed by sadistic ideologies.
Three types of ragging
Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Kothalawela Defence University Senior Lecturer Dr Neil Fernando noted that ragging takes place in three ways: verbally, physically and sexually.
The seniors use obscene words and instil fear and pressurize the freshers by demeaning them verbally. Physical ragging may involve the freshers being forced to perform awkward activities which are not normally performed in the day to day life. They are made to engage in these activities in front of an audience and the viewers will laugh, jeer and enjoy the scene. This may result in psychological trauma. Students may also be forced to eat or drink things which they do not normally consume like urine. The third type of ragging involves sexual abuse. Students may be forced to strip their clothes in front of an audience and perform sexual activities. Such forms of violence and harassment have an adverse effect on a persons psychology. It may be an experience which will haunt a student throughout his or her life rather than have medium-term effects. It may even result in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which results in developing fear, anxiety, guilt, low self-esteem, recurrent dreams or recurrent memories where the victim relives the traumatic experience repeatedly. It may even increase hyperarousal, show startled responses or result in sleeping difficulties. They may avoid situations which remind them of the traumatic experience such as leaving the city or avoiding other students, he said.
He notes that those engaged in ragging too suffer from a mentality in which they derive pleasure from harming others.
Such people may come from traumatic backgrounds or have family problems, he noted.
Center for Gender Equity/Equality director Professor Uma Coomaraswamy said that they have launched posters and handouts creating awareness about ragging. An Emergency Safety App too had been introduced allowing the university vice-chancellors and marshals to track the victims.
A student can download the application for free and resister in it by using their university ID. If a student becomes a victim of ragging then all he or she has to do is click the button and a message will be delivered to the relevant parties. If the student presses the button and keeps it on hold, then everything will be recorded. You can take evidence like pictures too by using this app. All these evidence will be sent across to the authorities, she said adding that since the app can only be logged in using the students university ID, this ensures that it cannot be handled by another party.
Another measure taken by the UGC to eliminate ragging is to send letters to the parents who will be entering universities stating that ragging is a criminal offence and that if their son or daughter is found guilty of ragging then he or she can be sent for 10 years of life imprisonment. A person arrested under the Ragging Act the Magistrate cannot be grant bail as well.
Ragging is a prohibited act in Sri Lanka by Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No 20 of 1998. Therefore, ragging is a crime, and anyone who is engaged in such criminal activities in or outside of universities and other higher educational institutions could be brought before the law. Any person who commits or participates in ragging could be prosecuted before a Magistrate Court and could be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term up to two years. Apart from this, the court could order the guilty party to pay compensation to the victim. If an act of ragging involves sexual harassment or grievous hurt, the court could punish the accused with an imprisonment up to ten years, Attorney-at-Law Priyalal Sirisena said.
He noted that this law also covers any unlawful obstructions caused to fellow students in a university as well as intimidations directed towards fellow students.
It should be noted that aiding and abetting to commit such acts is also an offence. Courts have the power to order that a person who is found guilty of ragging be expelled from the relevant university or higher education institution, he added.
Eradicating ragging, a team effort
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stressed on the need to eliminate ragging from universities promptly to ensure an ideal educational environment.
We use a wrong term in describing these behaviours. Torture and sexual harassment are more apt terms to describe them. The problem has amounted to a state where universities are unable to function smoothly.
At times the seniors do not allow the freshers to sleep even because they carry out their ragging rituals around the clock. Going to the library and speaking in English are banned and at times they have been harassed sexually as well. Though ragging is normally limited to the first term it now continues in the second term as well. Any incident of this nature needs to be reported and action can be taken to bring the culprits to book, he said.
Referring to some of the past incidents which have been reported in the recent past the minister said that several undergraduates including five monks have been taken to custody for engaging in various forms of inhumane activities.
We can eradicate the ragging menace from universities if everyone works together. The staff and board of governors too were victims in the past but now they have taken matters into their hands with the launch of the awareness campaign, he said adding that laws have been implemented to give stern punishment for ragging.
The picture, however, stands out in stark contrast to what it was fifty years ago. It was good fun, left lasting impressions and was an act devoid of physical harassment then. Deaths were not reported even when the demands were not met with. One of the most common forms of ragging was a male fresher handing over a wildflower to a fresher girl on bended knees and declaring his undying love for her.
There is a general perception among people who have studied at Sri Lankan state universities in the past that ragging is pleasant and assort of culture practised to make everyone equal. Therefore they believe that ragging should be allowed to continue. However, that ragging method which they perceive as ragging is not there anymore in Sri Lanka. What exists is a dangerous form of violence and sexual abuse by a group of people who are a minority but extremely powerful both physically and vocally. They also control the student unions to some extent and are also manipulated by outside forces, Prof de Silva explained adding that mafia groups have taken over the universities today.
He notes that if the entire academic and none academic staff stands against this system then ragging will cease to exist in universities. Since the situation is not so, he notes that the staff too is being controlled by the powerful forces.
External influence
Speaking to the Daily News Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) convener Lahiru Weerasekara said that the IUSF too stands any form of violence or sexual abuse imposed on the university students.
Many point their finger at the unions regarding such deeds. Our universities still possess extreme backward activities which effects on the students. We do not engage in activities which make us unpopular among the fellow students or the public as instilling fear or torture will not win their support. Actions like passing laws, hurling false accusations and putting students in jail is not the answer to this problem, he said adding that outside forces play a key role in fueling the issue.
Ragging is good as long as it is not physical. But even then, there must be a limit. It actually depends on the person. If the person can take things lightly, then thats good. Otherwise, it should stop at something mild and harmless like singing or dancing, Dharshani, a second-year Arts student at the Colombo University said.
Prasad, another senior from Sri Jayewardenepura University feels that ragging needs to be monitored rather than banned from universities.
Ragging as such is good as long as it is harmless. It is a good way of getting to know the seniors better and vice-versa. When theres no one to monitor the limit, there is a chance that ragging might take an ugly turn, he expressed.
Umali, a student from the medical faculty of Peradeniya University says that most seniors call the juniors over to assert their superiority.
If you give in, you get undermined. If you talk back, you are stuck with a reputation for the rest of your life in university, she explained.
Sociology of ragging
Peradeniya University Sociology lecturer Professor Kalinga Tudor Silva said, In a sociological perspective ragging can be seen as some sort of an initiation process imposed by a section of senior students on the new entrants to the universities with a view to assimilating them to a so-called subculture prevailing among university students. This subculture is a reportedly egalitarian one where all the students are placed on a common platform irrespective of their background whether they are from rural or urban areas, rich or poor families or men or women. In a critical sense, this practice is intended to establish a certain herd mentality among students where they go along with decisions and practices imposed upon them by the so-called student leaders without debating or questioning them. In spite of the reported egalitarian ethos of the practice it actually creates a hierarchy among students based on their seniority and gender, with ragging often used by senior male students to make advances to so-called fresher girls sometimes referred to as a badu nava (shipload of goodies). This also prevents the formation of agency and independence among students in regard to politics, decision making, social mobilization and even selection of their potential love partners.
He notes that students should be encouraged to associate with each other, learn from each other and make connections across the ethnic, religious and social class divisions.
The practice of ragging does not seem to make the freshers more sociable at all as evident from a pattern of segregation prevailing among students by social class, ethnicity, medium of instruction in certain faculties and in various other ways, he said.
Professor Silva notes that the remedies followed so far by the university authorities such as imposing punishments on raggers, educating new students and parents and passing legislation prohibiting ragging does not seem to have worked.
There are some senior students who are referred to as anti-raggers who seem to be opposed to ragging on the grounds of principles but their number has remained small and they have not been able to influence the mainstream among senior students. While there should be some provisions to impose sanctions against ragging, personally I do not think punishments alone can effectively deal with this problem given the current situation in the university system. A broader dialogue among university teachers, parents, senior and junior students and the public at large must be initiated in order to identify effective remedies for this problem. The student counsellor schemes in the universities must be revisited and reorganised in ways that address the problems of students and our knowledge about the existing practices must be enhanced through further research and an informed discussion about possible alternatives to ragging as a means of welcoming new students to the universities. There is a need to mobilize sports, arts and culture, religious activities, voluntary community services by students as a means to facilitate and foster interaction, creativity and social commitment among students identified as the future leaders of the country, he said.

Read, read, read
Theres nothing like the smell of old books or the crack of a new ones spine. (Plus, youll never run low on battery.) And it turns out that diving into a page-turner can also offer benefits toward your health and happiness. Here are eight smart reasons to read a real book.
It increases intelligence
As Dr. Seuss once wrote, The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places youll go. Diving into a good book opens up a whole world of knowledge starting from a very young age. Childrens books expose kids to 50 percent more words than prime time TV, or even a conversation between college graduates, according to a paperfrom the University of California, Berkeley. Exposure to that new vocabulary not only leads to higher score on reading tests, but also higher scores on general tests of intelligence. Plus, stronger early reading skills may mean higher intelligence later in life.
It can boost your brain power
Not only does regular reading help make you smarter, but it can actually increase your brain power. Just like going for a jog exercises your cardiovascular system, reading regularly improves memory function by giving your brain a good work out. With age comes a decline in memory and brain function, but regular reading may help slow the process, keeping minds sharper longer, according to research published in Neurology. Frequent brain exercise was able to lower mental decline by 32 percent, reports The Huffington Post.
Reading can make you more empathetic
Getting lost in a good read can make it easier for you to relate to others. Literary fiction, specifically, has the power to help its readers understand what others are thinking by reading other peoples emotions, according to research published in Science. The impact is much more significant on those who read literary fiction as opposed to those who read nonfiction. Understanding others mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano wrote of their findings.
Flipping pages can help you understand what youre reading
When it comes to actually remembering what youre reading, youre better off going with a book than you are an e-book. The feel of paper pages under your fingertips provides your brain with some context, which can lead to a deeper understanding and better comprehension of the subject youre reading about, Wired reports. So to reap the benefits of a good read, opt for the kind with physical pages.
It may help fight Alzheimers disease
Reading puts your brain to work, and thats a very good thing. Those who who engage their brains through activities such as reading, chess, or puzzles could be 2.5 times less likely to develop Alzheimers disease than those who spend their down time on less stimulating activities. The paper suggests that exercising the brain may help because inactivity increases the risk of developing Alzheimers, inactivity is actually an early indicator of the disease, or a little of each.
Reading can help you relax
Theres a reason snuggling up with a good book (and maybe a glass of wine) after a long day sounds so appealing. Research suggests that reading can work as a serious stress-buster. One 2009 study by Sussex University researchers showed that reading may reduce stress by as much as 68 percent. It really doesnt matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a while exploring the domain of the authors imagination, cognitive neuropsychologist David Lewis told The Telegraph.
Reading before bed can help you sleep
Creating a bedtime ritual, like reading before bed, signals to your body that its time to wind down and go to sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic. Reading a real book helps you relax more than zoning out in front of a screen before bed. Screens like e-readers and tablets can actually keep you awake longer and even hurt your sleep. That applies to kids too: Fifty-four percent of children sleep near a small screen, and clock 20 fewer minutes of shut-eye on average because of it, according to researchpublished in Pediatrics. So reach for the literal page-turners before switching off the light.

Revamping the skin-crawling reputation of Revamping the skin-crawling reputation of  lizards and snakes
For anyone terrified of an albino python, an orange corn snake or a scaly, bearded iguana, Chea Raty says getting up close and personal at Phnom Penhs first reptile-themed cafe is the only remedy.
Taking off from the cat cafes already popular in the Cambodian capital, Chea Raty launched his business to revamp the skin-crawling reputation of lizards and snakes and convince haters that they are simply misunderstood.
As customers sip on their lattes and hang out with the reptiles, they will love them like I do, the 32-year-old said while stroking the scaly neck wattle of an iguana.
The walls of his cafe are lined with lit-up glass tanks containing snakes of various lengths and colours, while a bright macaw screeches in the corner.
Some visitors look hesitantly at the cages, others are bolder in their embrace of the creatures. Theres no entry fee, so visitors can order a coffee and request a sit-down with a serpentine friend from one of the tanks.
An ice tea for a young customer instantly becomes a cool object for a yellow-and-cream-coloured ball python to twist its body around. A woman giggles as an albino python creeps from her shoulder and wraps behind her head.
Nearby, a bearded dragon iguana perches on a table while a man gently pets it. Customer Y Navim was wary at first of a corn snake, an orange-coloured serpent that kills its prey through constriction. But it was soon resting on her palm as she sipped her coffee.
This cafe is quite unique, the 22-year-old said.
Ive never seen some of these reptiles before. They are beautiful and scary.
To critics who say the animals should be left alone in the wild, Chea Raty says his human-bred creatures cannot survive there. All of his cafe creatures are imported from Thailand. Business is still slow-going due to the common fears of snakes and lizards. But women, Chea Raty says, are providing an unexpected boost.
They put the pythons around their neck, take selfies, and they are happy.

Rich outsiders making fake deeds  to settle in Galle town - DM
The Fundamental Rights of many innocent people of the Galle town are violated as rich persons from outside Galle fraudulently prove their citizenship within the Galle Municipality by way of registering counterfeit deeds at the Land Registry, Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
He made the above statement at the Regional Coordinating Committee Meeting of Galle Four Gravets, held recently. Minister Vajira Abeywardana and Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara co-presided at the meeting.
The Grama Seva Niladhari of the Galle Fort has allegedly issued Certificates of Residence in respect of 74 newly settled families which is unbelievable and cannot happen. There are only 276 registered families in the Galle Fort. Latest reports reveal that 74 newcomer families have been registered at a stretch, Nanayakkara said. This development is impossible. A large majority of properties in the Galle Fort area are business places. Wealthy people substantiate their citizenship by way of preparing fake deeds spending exorbitant amounts of money thereby infringing many basic rights of the poor people of Galle who are the real citizens of the city, the Deputy Minister further stated.
It is reported that this duplicitous practice of preparing bogus deeds are mainly carried out in the China Garden, Mahamodara and Weliwatte areas. I urge the authorities to initiate a tangible investigation into this dishonest practice, he added. In response to the Deputy Ministers disclosure, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana ordered the Divisional Secretary to carry out a proper investigation into the charges raised by Nanayakkara.

Secret Royal baby traditions that Meghan Markle will have to follow
ROYAL BABY traditions are not widely known to the public, with many strange and age-old practices still existing. Despite being a modern royal, these traditions will have to be followed by Meghan Markle when she becomes pregnant.
Old and often outdated traditions are part of being a member of the Royal Family, with royal baby traditions being no exception.
They are something Meghan Markle will have to follow when, or if, she falls pregnant, being a high-ranking royal.
Despite being the symbol of a more modern Royal Family, it is no doubt the Duchess will have to follow the same traditions as Kate Middleton, Princess Diana and the Queen herself.
One thing that the Royal Family isnt allowed to do is announce the sex of their baby ahead of the birth.
It is royal tradition to keep the gender private, with Prince William and Kate Middleton even deciding to keep the sex of George and Charlotte a secret from themselves.
When it comes to the delivery room, royal births used to take place behind palace walls, but now happen at the Lindo Wing of St Marys Hospital in London.
During the birth, lots of midwives and doctors are around, with a whopping team of 18 involved in the birth of Princess Charlotte in 2015.
One person that usually wasnt involved in the birth was the father, a tradition long upheld until recent years.
Prince Philip was not present at the birth of any of his four children, but Prince Charles and Prince William bucked the trend by being in the delivery room for the birth of their kids.
Royal births also used to require a witness, with the home secretary usually present for all royal births to verify the event.
After the birth, royal babies are wrapped in special blankets, a tradition that goes back more than 100 years.
The fine woollen, knitted blankets are produced in Nottingham by G.H.Hurt & Son, who made the blankets for the Cambridge children and William himself.
One tradition that is still in place is that the Queen must be notified first, knowing all the details of the royal baby before any information goes public. Something the child of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also wont have is a surname, taking on the surname of Sussex, just like William and Kates children.
Most recent royal births include Meghan and Harrys nieces and nephews George Alexander Lois, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana and Louis Arthur Charles.
With so many royal traditions to follow, there is one American pregnancy tradition that Meghan Markle will not be able to follow now shes the Duchess of Sussex - having a baby shower. Baby showers are a way to celebrate the expected or delivered birth of a child, by showering the mother with gifts.
However, baby showers are reported to be frowned upon and not celebrated in the royal family, as they could appear to be tasteless.

Six dead in Bakersfield, California shootings
US: A man went on a shooting rampage in California on Wednesday, killing five people including his wife, before taking his own life, a police spokesman told AFP.
The shooting in Bakersfield in central California was possibly a domestic violence incident, said Lieutenant Mark King of the Kern County sheriffs office.
Police received their first call at 5:19 pm before responding to the first location, a trucking company, where the rampage began.
Three people were killed there and the shooter, armed with a large caliber hand gun, fled.
Sheriff Donny Youngblood told reporters that the suspect first shot a man at the trucking company and then killed his wife. He chased a person who had witnessed the shooting and killed that person, too.
He reportedly then fled and shot two people at a house.
Police then received a call from a woman who said she had been carjacked. Officers gave chase and the suspect pulled into a business, got out of the car and shot himself, King said.
The fatalities were three men and two women. No names were released.
This is the new normal, said Youngblood. He said the officer who confronted the suspect wore a body camera, but the footage has not been released.
It was the latest chapter of Americas epidemic of gun violence.
Americans make up only four percent of the global population but they own 40 percent of the worlds firearms, according to a recent study published by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.
Of the 857 million guns owned by civilians, 393 million are in the United States -- more than all of the firearms held by ordinary citizens in the other top 25 countries combined, according to the Small Arms Survey.
According to Gun Violence Archive, the mass shooting in Bakersfield is the third deadliest in the United States this year after a shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead and one at a school in Santa Fe, Texas, in May that left 10 people dead.

SLTDA Launches Initiative To Train 4000 Safari Operators Country-wide
Acting on its pledge to ensure better park management at wildlife parks across the country, the Sri Lankan Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has launched a fresh initiative to train 4000 Safari operators island-wide.
The first phase of the project was conducted in Minneriya last week, and a large number of Safari operators in the area took part in the training and engaged with resource people. The project is carried out in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Department and the Federation of Environmental Organizations.
Mihira Liyanaarachchi, Director, Domestic Tourism and Community Relations of the SLTDA said that the training was conducted as a nature interpretation programme and the Safari operators were given a comprehensive understanding of the link between their profession and better park management.
Safari operators must act in a manner that does not disrupt or disturb the natural movement of animals and natural eco-systems of wildlife parks. There is a seamless connection between their profession and the natural balance within wildlife parks which should be managed in a sustainable manner. It is important that the safari operators understand the crucial role they play in this whole system, Liyanaarachchi said, commenting on the purpose of the initiative.
He said the training programme would convince the safari operators that they had a larger responsibility towards protecting environment, adding that the project would soon be taken to Yala, Kumana, Kaudulla and Wilpattu wildlife parks.
Environmentalists and wildlife enthusiasts have often raised concerns that some unruly Safari operators disrupt natural movements of animals and cause irreparable damage to natural eco-systems of Sri Lankas wildlife parks which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists on a yearly basis.
The training programme is the latest initiative by the SLTDA, the regulatory body for Sri Lanka tourism, to create a healthy balance between the industry interests and sustainability of wildlife parks.

The excess soil when reconstructing Maskeliya - Nallathanni Road is being dumped into the Maussakelle reservoir reducing its water capacity.
The road is being widened near Mohini Ella and loads of excess soil is being dumped into the reservoir illegally.
The project is implemented by the Road Development Authoritys Norwood Provincial Engineering Office.
Some of the soil is directly unloaded into the reservoir while the rest on the reservoir bank is gradually washed into the tank with rainwater.
In addition, the pilgrims arriving in the area are facing difficulties when travelling through the road. The dumping of soil has a direct impact on the reduction of water in the reservoir. The reservoir provides water to Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya and Canyon solar power stations. The sediments of the reservoir had never been removed since its construction and this illegal act would initiate it.

Meethotamulla tragedy
Take culprits  to task: Minister
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to take persons responsible for the Meethotamulla tragedy to task, based on the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Meethotamulla garbage disaster.
Minister Champika Ranawaka said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry has identified the parties who are responsible for this disaster. He added that one and half years had elapsed without action being taken against culprits.
The minister was speaking at a ceremony to handover Lake Crest Residencies housing complex to the public, at Mulleriyawa, Mandawila, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
This is a heartbreaking situation for all of us. So I urge that immediate action be taken against those responsible for the tragedy and bring justice to the victims, Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka added that the Urban Development Authority (UDA) was able to provide houses for victims. He extended his gratitude to the President and Prime Minister for providing their support for the purpose.
Minister Ranawaka said the UDA was able to stabilize the Meethotamulla garbage mountain within a month and added that the assistance provided to the UDA by the Sri Lanka Army is commendable.
The persons who mounted garbage in Meethotamulla cannot even be seen now. They had destroyed this plot of land. But the UDA, together with the Army, shouldered the great task to stabilize this garbage mountain. Japanese investigators who came to monitor the garbage dump were amazed as to how we were able to stabilize it within just a month, Minister Ranawaka said.
I am sure you know who made a living out of this garbage mountain, how they did it and how they built castles for themselves. They even took the money made by this dump to other countries. Today, not a single person is available to look after the people who lost everything. It was the UDA that shouldered this responsibility, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the UDA is planning to develop the Meethotamulla garbage dump into an urban park, as a token of respect for the people who suffered from the tragedy.
Colombo district UNP MP S. M. Marikkar and Kolonnawa Development Committee Co-Chairman Prasanna Solangarachchi were also present on the occasion.
MP Marikkar requested President Maithripala Sirisena to consider providing an allowance to those who suffered from the Meethotamulla tragedy.

He said the patients had undergone the surgery and valves in their legs were used to replace the blocked valves of their hearts.
The procedure is similar to inserting a stent to the heart. All three patients are doing fine after the surgery.
The system is suitable for the elderly patients who cannot undergo surgeries. Patients are conscious during the procedure and they can go home without a long hospital stay.

The good news is the government has already initiated measures with the support of IMF and its efforts to enhance revenue by moving towards narrow fiscal deficit targets is definitely noteworthy, she said.
While noting Sri Lanka has enviable ranking in human development indexes in comparison to other countries in the region, she stressed that the country needs to leverage on its own strength, particularly on its educated and healthy labour force, and to build more business outsourcing unit in the country.
Many companies across the world are opening up back office operations or business process units in countries such as Poland .Sri Lanka in my view should be the top place to do that as country definitely offers massive opportunities in the field of research and development, she said.

Trump promises a real book on his White House
US: US President Donald Trump says that he will write a real book about his time in the White House, as he continued to seek to discredit other efforts to chronicle his chaotic tenure.
In a morning tweet, Trump levelled his latest criticism against a forthcoming book by veteran journalist Bob Woodward, calling it just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults and branding it fiction.
Woodward has said he stands by the reporting in his book, which offers a harrowing portrayal of Trumps tenure, with aides seeking to curb his worst impulses, and Trump denigrating some of those who work around him, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Dems cant stand losing. Ill write the real book! Trump said in his tweet.
During his business career, Trump wrote nearly 20 books, including The Art of the Deal. Most of the books had ghost writers. During the 2016 Republican primaries, Trump also released a book titled, Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.
In recent days, Trump has accused Woodward of making up quotes and mused about changing US libel laws in an effort to better position himself to seek retribution.
As part Trumps efforts to discredit Woodward on Monday, he wrote another tweet in which he quoted Washington Examiner reporter Katelyn Caralle as saying, You cannot take this book too seriously. Caralles Examiner biography notes that she first came to Washington as an intern for the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2016.
In other tweets Monday morning, Trump claimed that the White House, which has experienced significant staff turnover and other tumult, is a smooth running machine and touted economic figures under his leadership. - stuff.co.nz

Typhoon Mangkhut  bears down on  Philippines
THE PHILIPPINES: A super typhoon roared toward the Philippines on Thursday, prompting thousands to evacuate ahead of its heavy rains and fierce winds that are set to strike at the weekend before moving on to China.
Typhoon Mangkhut, which has already blasted through the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, is speeding across the Pacific with winds that can gust as high as 255 kilometres (160 miles) per hour.
Authorities said some 10 million people in the Philippines are in the storm's path, not including millions more in heavily-populated coastal China. Thousands began evacuating in seaside areas of the northern tip of the main Philippine island of Luzon, where the storm is expected to make landfall early Saturday. The pre-emptive evacuation is going on in our coastal municipalities, the villages that are prone to storm surge, local government spokesman Rogelio Sending told AFP.
We are going to evacuate more. Flooding, landslides and wind damage from the coming storm were top concerns as authorities prepared equipment for rescue and relief operations. Schools were shuttered and some farmers took to their fields to start early harvest of corn and rice that could be ruined by flooding.
An average of 20 typhoons and storms lash the Philippines each year, killing hundreds of people and leaving millions in near-perpetual poverty.
The country's deadliest on record is Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,350 people dead or missing across the central Philippines in November 2013.
The state weather service said Mangkhut will be the strongest typhoon so far this year, with sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour.
The typhoon is expected to boost the intensity of seasonal monsoon rains that have already caused widespread flooding in central Luzon, a mainly farming region north of capital Manila. Poor communities reliant on fishing are some of the most vulnerable to fierce typhoon winds and the storm surge that pounds the coast.
It will bring destruction. They are the ones greatly affected. Even moderate winds can topple their houses, regional civil defence official Dante Balao told AFP.
Hong Kong is also in Mangkhut's sights and preparations there were already underway, though the storm was not expected to hit until Sunday.
Social media users and radio commentators in Hong Kong said they were stocking up on food and supplies.
The Hong Kong Observatory warned residents to prepare for the storm, saying it posed a considerable threat.
The Philippines state weather service said heavy rains and strong winds are expected from Friday over the north and centre of Luzon, along with rough seas on the coasts.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it expects substantial damage on the Philippine path of Mangkhut.
Storm surges of up to seven metres (23 feet) are expected to hit coastal areas, it said, while heavy rains could trigger landslides and flash floods. The civil defence office in Manila said towns and cities on Mangkhut's path are preparing government buildings as evacuation centres, stockpiling food and other emergency rations. - AFP

Waidyaratne calls  for collaboration among disciplines
Innovative collaboration among various disciplines was imperative if the nation was to develop economically, socially and culturally, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, said yesterday.
The Defence Secretary was speaking at the inauguration of 11th International Research Conference of the Kotelawala Defence University.
It is encouraging to note that each year the number of research papers submitted for the conference is on the increase. If we are to develop our nation, we have a professional responsibility to find opportunities for innovative collaboration, he said.
Waidyaratne praised the role played by the KDU, adding that in addition to providing university education to the officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force, KDU has done a commendable job in educating deserving civilian students.
In recent times, with nine academic faculties, the Southern campus and the recently established university hospital, KDU has been at the forefront of providing excellence through education, which it may not have dreamt of at its inception, Waidyaratne said.
The Annual International Research Conference of KDU was held for the 11th consecutive year. Over 600 research papers were received out of which 350 were presented at this years conference.
The conference is organised under the theme Securing Professional Excellence through Collaboration.

Worcestershire still  in hunt against Surrey
LONDON, Wednesday: Tom Fell hit his second half-century of the game to give Worcestershire a chance of victory over champions-in-waiting Surrey at New Road.
Fells 89 was his highest score of the summer, but superb bowling by Morne Morkel saw the home side subside from 181-4 to 203 all out in 13 overs.
It left the Division One leaders with a victory target of 272.
And they were 70-0 at stumps, with Rory Burns 33 not out, having made 122 in their first-innings total of 268.
Following Somersets two-day defeat by Hampshire, Burns side only need to avoid defeat to win the title for the first time since 2002 and 19th time in all - but they would like to do so in style by clinching a ninth successive Championship win.
Yorkshire require three more wickets on the final day of the Roses match to beat rivals Lancashire, who slipped to 109-7, chasing 230 at Headingley.
The game was finely poised at 81-3, but Jack Brooks bowled Liam Livingstone before two wickets in three balls from Ben Coad swung it in the hosts favour. Josh Bohannon and Keshav Maharaj will resume needing 121 more runs to win.
Gary Ballance (83) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (63) earlier put on 148 to drag Yorkshire towards 272 all out.
Victory for Yorkshire would see them leapfrog Lancashire and move out of the relegation places.
Essex performed well with bat and ball to give them a chance of beating Nottinghamshire on the final day.
Notts captain Steven Mullaney hit his fourth half-century of the season to extend the hosts advantage. Simon Harmer took six wickets as Notts were bowled out for 337, leaving the visitors a target of 282 for victory.
After losing Nick Browne for 11 early on, Murali Vijay and Tom Westley put on a 130-run second-wicket stand to leave Essex needing 135 runs to win.
Sussexs hopes of promotion from Division Two suffered a major setback as Durham beat them by 186 runs. Chasing 321 to win, Sussex started poorly, losing Philip Salt for a duck to Chris Rushworth in the first over.
And Rushworth claimed 4-49 for match figures of 12-100 as they fell well short of their target, with Tom Haines 40 the top score in their 135 all out. Earlier, Cameron Steel reached 160 before he was caught off Haines as Durham were bowled out for 340.
The result means that Sussex must win their home game against leaders Warwickshire next week if they are to have any chance of going up this season.
Warwickshire beat Leicestershire by an innings and 104 runs, while Kent are second and 21 points ahead of Sussex after their win over Middlesex at Lords.

Worlds oldest club DJ
An 83-year-old Japanese woman has been announced by Guinness World Records as the worlds oldest professional club DJ.
Sumiko Iwamura, 83, aka DJ Sumirock, said she decided to attend a DJ school at the age of 77 and soon discovered she had a talent for it.
Iwamura, who owns and works in the kitchen of a Chinese food restaurant, has a regular DJ slot at Decabar Z in Shinjuku, but her talents have led to guest gigs at exotic locations including Paris and New Zealand.
She told Guinness World Records that DJing isnt all that different from running her restaurant.
You get feedback from your customers quickly in both cases, she said.
If youre playing tracks and they dont like it, theyll leave the floor and start drinking at the bar. If the tracks are danceable, then theyll stay on and dance their heart out. Restaurant customers are the same - if it tastes good, then they look happy, and theyll tell me that they like it. For me, its easy to work out how people are feeling in both cases, she said. UPI
