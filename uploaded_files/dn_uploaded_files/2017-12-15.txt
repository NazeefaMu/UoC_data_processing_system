Corporate governance key priority of regulators
Corporate governance has become a key priority on the agenda of capital market regulators and is considered an important factor in strengthening capital markets, said Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Thilak Karunaratne.
Implementing sound corporate governance practices that comprise clear and transparent disclosures, encourage accountability and ethical leadership create value for companies, facilitate access to capital and enhances investor confidence.
He was speaking at the CA Sri Lanka Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance 2017.
I believe that while a lot has been done in the area of corporate governance, Sri Lanka needs to ensure a responsive regulatory framework and cannot afford to fall behind. Furthermore, good market conduct is driven by good behavior and not by rules and regulations alone.
Corporate governance codes and frameworks were triggered as a result of corporate scandals that adversely affected capital markets across the globe, he recalled.
He said that it is sad to note that the current regime in the USA is trying to roll back these regulations brought in after the last financial crisis by directing a review of the Dodd-Frank Act.
He disclosed that the ASIC website indicates that Australia does not have a general corporate governance code that all companies must comply with. However, listed companies must benchmark their corporate governance practices against the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Councils Principles and Recommendations.
This means that listed companies are not obliged to adopt the ASX Principles, but are encouraged to do so. This is to create a level of flexibility for listed companies to adopt alternative practices more suited to their circumstances.
Commentating on the Sri Lankan aspect, he said that the corporate governance code was initially developed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) in 1997. Thereafter, it has been revised in 2003, 2008 and most recently in 2013.
The existing code is on a voluntary basis and could be used by any business entity. But the level of governance and degree of accountability expected from public listed companies are much higher. Therefore, the one size fits all approach on above requires re-visiting.
Based on the approach adopted by other jurisdictions, the SEC Sri Lanka has started to pursue an initiative to ensure enforceability relating to governance is enhanced and grant oversight by absorbing the voluntary governance requirements into mandatory listing rules.
He also commended Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka for their commitment towards upholding good corporate governance and business ethics.

Mahinda Rajapaksa responsible for SLFP split
Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa is responsible for splitting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Social Empowerment Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
He added that Rajapaksa together with Basil Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa crippled the talks between the SLFP and the Joint Opposition with the intention to bring his family members to power by 2025.
These three persons obstructed the path to come to a favourable settlement following talks.
Minister Dissanayake said so while addressing the media at the Ministry at Battaramulla, yesterday.
The Minister said that several rounds of formal and informal discussions, including four rounds of formal talks were held between the two parties but Rajapaksa did not come to a settlement. Therefore, he should be responsible for splitting the SLFP for narrow political gains.
Meanwhile, Basil Rajapaksa hesitated to come to a settlement considering his security while Mahinda Rajapaksa wanted to centralise power with his family by 2025, he said.
However, the Minister said the SLFP is gradually strengthening day by day. Many politicians would come forward to strengthen the SLFP to confirm a clean victory at the forthcoming Local Government elections.
He added that a considerable number of political parties had expressed their willingness to join the SLFP, aiming to create a broad alliance to face the next election.
Accordingly, several minor political parties including Thondamans and Athaullas parties will contest with the SLFP at the next election as abroad alliance.
The SLFP will contest the next LG election under the hand symbol in certain areas, while in other areas, it will contest under the Betel symbol. In the Eastern part, the symbol may change, he said.
He added that unless President Maithripala Sirisena did not form this unity government, 11 Parliamentarians currently in the JO had discussed with the UNP to form a UNP government.
Now they demanded to quit the government, he said.
According to Dissanayake, there is no doubt about the SLFPs victory at the forthcoming LG election. The SLFP will sweep the board, he said. He added that there was a huge demand for SLFP nominations to contest at the next election.
When asked whether the NFF and JO members, who joined the SLFP, have demanded anything when joining, the Minister said they joined the SLFP only with the intention of strengthening the hands of President Sirisena.

Behind the Mask
Juliet Coombe looks at why masks have long held a fascination for mankind, used both for fun and mystery but also to cover up heinous deeds and, metaphorically, to use as a disguise for more sinister intentions
Many of us first wore masks at school for a play or festival, and later in life perhaps at a masked party or ball, where, suddenly you are confronted by your voice recognition skills and awkward conversations, but masks can also allow people to open up in a way they might feel too timid to otherwise.
Casual observers
And so it is the case with the Kolam masks, originally developing from the south but later spreading all over Sri Lanka as part of dancing entertainment going back to colonial times, where one way to deal with the sometimes oppressive and strange behaviours of the colonial peoples, was to make fun of, in a subtle and nuanced way, their foibles through plays and dancing  a humorous tonic after a hard week of work on the plantation or whatever other industry might be being exploited. Often such masks would have bulging eyes, terrible stares and weird smiles that helped satirise the objects of their frustration in those days, much in the same way that Spitting Image puppets produced in Britain satirised politicians not so many years ago for precisely the same purpose  to make more bearable the frustrating behaviours of people in power with fixed and eccentric views that made no sense to the average person. It is sad however to think that this art form was designed to highlight a fundamental difference between colonial and indigenous village attitudes towards other people  the latter recognised the value of all persons and how they served the community in an equal way while the former accentuated a hierarchy clearly based on status and the value of different jobs that unfortunately seems to pervade the world today, causing large swathes of the population to feel undervalued and unappreciated.
The masks are normally upon near full-size puppets that are made to dance on strings as well as convey a sophisticated array of emotions. There might be as many as ten puppeteers in a show or drama playing traditional musical instruments, singing and giving speeches. Perhaps, the most notable of puppeteers was Gurunnanse who produced many plays and who, at the peak of his career, performed before the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Victorias son, when he visited Ceylon in the late 19th century and who gave Gurannanse a gold medal and cash prize of five hundred rupees, which was a great deal of money in those days.
Another parallel with the West and mask making can be found where Halloween is concerned. Halloween is derived both from All Saints Eve and Samhain, a Celtic tradition celebrating the end of summer, where macabre masks, skeletons and bloody effigies were hung outside houses to fend off evil spirits, presumably by letting them know that the inhabitants know about such spirits and are ready to do battle with them in like manner. Similarly, the Raksha masks, much older than the Kolam mask making tradition, resemble garish demons with bulging eyes (often with a scene depicted within them like a crystal ball), protruding carnivorous tongues hanging out like dogs tongues, snakes for hair and parrot-like creatures, gurulas, with exotic feathers protruding like horns from the sides and top of the heads  all in an amazing array of dazzling bright colours that fully arrest your attention and have you gazing in wonder at what lies beneath this ominous and threatening exterior. Sri Lanka has a very rich tradition of witchcraft, exorcism rituals, curses and dealings with demons through its Kovil ceremonies and temples festivals, to achieve both good and bad ends on behalf of supplicants and worshippers. These powers are very active and should not be underestimated by casual observers who may think they are above such things  there are many documented powerful stories that span the entire spectrum of society from regular, possessed individuals to cursed presidents during wars. Some say Sri Lanka will forever live under the curse of Kuveni, a demigoddess who married and was then abandoned by King Vijaya of India soon after the time of the Buddha.
Wonderful creations
The third type of mask made in Sri Lanka, the Sanni, is a generally a more disfigured and strange creation that is used mainly for healings and exorcism rituals. So, both mind and body are served by this mask in rituals designed to heal anything from insanity, disturbed sleep through to digestive disorders. There are 18 such masks defined for each type of illness and again they represent a battle against the bad spirits that bring about such illnesses and are used in conjunction with relevant dancing and chanting to bring about a cure, in much the same way that prayer is believed to bring healing to the sick in other cultures and religions.
The masks are made all over the island but the greatest concentration of production and skills is around Ambalangoda where they are carved out of a kind of balsa wood called kaduru, which has been smoked for a week before crafting  the wood is still not fully dry when the craftsman takes it up as it can only be carved in a slightly moist and soft state. A mallet and various sized chisels are used, starting with the largest first and going smaller as the mask increasingly resembles the finished product and needs only finer chiselling. The masks are carved according to ancient and prescriptive writings, which have been handed down through many generations and in the case of the other types of masks, the Sanni and the Raksha, many centuries ago, probably dating back to the time of the Buddha.
There are only a few families left who have the real knowledge and skills necessary to produce these wonderful creations but there is a sense that demand may rise with the new wave of tourism that has thrived since the end of the Civil War along with a renewed interest in the mysteries of Sri Lanka, a country that is both one of the most highly educated and advanced in many fields of engineering and science while also being steeped in a tradition of witchcraft considered second only to Haiti in the world.

British PM loses key Brexit vote
UK: British Prime Minister Theresa May on December 13 suffered a damaging Parliamentary defeat over Brexit, after her own MPs rebelled to demand Parliament have the final say on the divorce deal with Brussels.
Members of Mays Conservative party joined with opposition lawmakers to inflict the governments first defeat over the flagship E.U. (Withdrawal) Bill, sparking huge cheers in the House of Commons.
Ministers had sought to buy off the rebels with a last-minute promise of a parliamentary vote on the separation agreement, but their leader, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, warned: Its too late. His amendment demanding a statutory vote on the deal before Britain leaves the E.U. in March 2019 passed by 309 votes to 305.
The Brexit Ministry said it was disappointed.
We will now determine whether further changes are needed to the bill to ensure it fulfils its vital purpose, the Ministry said in a statement.
It is a blow to Ms. May on the eve of a crucial summit in Brussels, where E.U. leaders are expected to approve the terms of the interim Brexit deal agreed last week after months of tortuous negotiations.
Gina Miller, a leading pro-E.U. campaigner, reacted saying: Parliamentary sovereignty wins the day!
But Nigel Farage, a key driving force behind the Brexit campaign, said: My contempt for career politicians knows no bounds.
The EU (Withdrawal) Bill is intended to formally end Britains membership of the E.U., as well as smooth its exit by transferring thousands of pieces of European legislation onto the UK statute books. It also gives Ministers powers to amend the laws as they move across, to address any technical glitches.
But MPs objected to the fact that these so-called Henry VIII powers also extend to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement with the E.U.
Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, a hardline Brexiteer, had accused Mr. Grieve of looking for ways to derail the bill, saying his amendment would tie the governments hands in negotiations with the E.U.
But one Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, had warned: The government is presiding over a monumental task of immense importance for the future of this country.
With any such change it is imperative that parliament maintains close scrutiny and oversight of the process.
In a written statement to parliament earlier on December 13, Brexit Secretary David Davis promised that no withdrawal agreement would be implemented until a vote in both Houses of Parliament.
Parliament would then be asked to approve a further piece of legislation to implement the deal.
But Ministers wanted to preserve their special powers in the event that this law is not passed in time.
That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings, which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have, May told MPs earlier.
The defeat spells further domestic trouble ahead for Ms. May, as parliament and her party are divided about Britains future relationship with the E.U. - THE HINDU

Budget Pack for festive season
Fair Price Shops will be established countrywide with private sector participation as a strategy to control the Cost of Living targeting the forthcoming Christmas and New Year season. A Budget Pack containing eight essential consumer items including Rice, Dhal, Sugar, Sprats, B Onions, Potatoes and tinned fish will be issued to the market through these shops as a measure to ease the Cost of Living burden. This decision was taken at a discussion presided over by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Ministers Office in a press release said this measure has been taken by the government as a strategy of offering several essential consumer items of which prices have escalated in recent times, to the consumers at an affordable price in relation to cost outlay outside the price mechanism in the open market.
The decision was taken at a meeting presided by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and attended by Ministers Rishad Bathiutheen and Mangala Samaraweera and representatives of the related state institutions and the private sector.
It is also hoped to arrange at a distribution strategy for this Budget Pack to enable consumers to obtain it through the Private sector super market chain and Lak Sathosa sales centres.
The government has also decided to devise a strategy to introduce a concessionary electricity tarrif and provide some income tax relief to the Private Sector and state institutions involved in the provision of transport and marketing of these goods through this mechanism.
The release said leading super market and institutions such as Lanka Sathosa, Cargills Food City, Laugfs, Richard Pieris and Company, John Keells Ltd. and Wickramaratne (Private) Ltd have already agreed to join this programme.

The Bundala National Park with an area of 6,216 hectares was declared open in 1969.
There are also many mini salterns and lagoons within the park. Mahalevaya salterns, Koholankala salterns, Bundala salterns and Pallemalala Ebilikala oya and Kiridioya lagoon are some of them.
According to the records at the park there are forty eight species of flower plants belonging to twenty six families. Bundala is one of the most popular areas for resident and migratory birds wintering. The Bundala National Park is the refuge of the migratory birds known as flamingos.
The salterns, lagoons and the marshes accommodate more than 20,000 shore birds at any given time, the records said. The biggest attraction at the park is the elephants rather than birds.
There are eight to ten permanent residents, twenty five to thirty semi residents and about seventy to eighty migratory elephants who live in Yala, Bundala and Lunugmwehera areas.

A Call for Action to Save the Last Tuskers of Sri Lanka: An elephantine appeal!
The issues surrounding Human Elephant Co-existence (HEC) have posed a constant thorn in the side of wildlife conservation. The conflict that arises in the communities that flank the wildlife and nature reserves more often than not result in either human or elephant casualties. Such conflict could easily be avoided with the development of appropriate policies and laws to protect not merely tuskers but all elephants in Sri Lanka. Awareness programs could also be utilized to educate the citizens of the neighbouring communities on the importance of peaceful co-existence.However such programs would be rendered ineffective without concrete laws and policies to support them. Thus it is clear that for maximum efficiency and sustainable development, legal frameworks and policies need to be devised.
The General Committee of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) conducted a Press Conference titled , A Call for Action to Save the Last Tuskers of Sri Lankarecently to publicize the need for implementation of a comprehensive policy to address the Human Elephant Conflict in Sri Lanka The press briefing was helmed by a panel of esteemed environmentalists including NayanakaRanwella and Dinesh Mallikaarachchi as well as environmental lawyer, Wardani Karunaratne along with the President of the WNPS, Rukshan Jayewardene.
Rukshan Jayewardene commenced the meeting with a brief introduction to the issues pertaining to elephant conservation explaining the historical movement of elephants from Southern India to Sri Lanka. He also discussed the Human Elephant Conflict and the unwillingness of either party to give up their ground. Nayanaka Ranwella discussed the destruction of habitats where elephant populations are dense and the unfortunate accumulation of garbage near wildlife reserves that are further polluting the habitats. He described elephants as an umbrella species whose preservation ensures the conservation of other wildlife species and habitats. Dinesh Mallikaarachchiadded to these concerns by using the development of the Mattala airport project as an example of the destruction of wildlife. These concerns expressed the importance of reaching a balance between conservation and urban development.
While stressing that there is no comprehensive official policy for the conservation of elephants, the panellists discussed the process by which the 2006 Human Elephant Conflict Policy was updated in June of 2016 to be the draft National Elephant Conservation Policy. However it was brought to light that the proposals and updates made have not yet been implemented or amended. After the uproar regarding the death of the Galgamuwa tusker it was learned that the Department of Wildlife Conservation is now revisiting this draft policy.
This draft policy particularly addresses the use of strategic fencing to take place aroundecological boundaries, rather than administrative boundaries and around villages and plantations so as to offer protection to villagers. This would also allow the elephants to peacefully utilize their traditional paths of movement and minimize human interference.
Ivory is a highly coveted good and is often used to indicate status and social prominence. Environmental lawyer, Wardani Karunaratne emphasized that Blood ivory should not be held as an icon of prestige in order to discourage social attitude that considers tusks and ivory to be valuable so as to decrease involvement in poaching of tuskers.
Elephant conservation requires collective effort. Political and religious leaders should be urged to use their influence to harness the masses and encourage them to protect the elephants and tuskers as well as other forms of wildlife.
It is a social responsibility to conserve such species and to ensure that the remaining elephants and tuskers are protected and not subjected to the plight of the Galgamuwa Dala Puttuwa. Social consciousness can be harnessed via social media participation by projecting emphasis of the economic benefits to the country inclusive of the added tourism and thus cultivate an interest and social responsibility in companies as well as individuals. Encroachment of protected wildlife reserves and areas which are known to be inhabited by elephants should be prevented in order to avoid situations such as in areas like Mattala which resulted in the disappearance of a vast area of wildlife.
Stringent laws and policies need to be drafted and strictly enforced to protect tuskers and elephants in order to support conservation.
A sad story
Sri Lanka thrives on tourism and one of the main attractions to tourists from around the world is Sri Lankas wildlife and nature reserves. In spite of evidence regarding the importance of sustaining such resources, it is unfortunate that neither the government nor the majority of the population of Sri Lanka afford the necessary efforts to maintain and protect the wildlife and natural resources in Sri Lanka.
Gradually however, the need for the development of a comprehensive policy pertaining to the protection of wildlife and natural resources has come to light. The brutal murder of the famed Galgamuwa crossed tusker, whose carcass was discovered on the 29th of November, 2017 in the Kahalla-Pallekele forest reserve has resulted in quite a stir in Lankan society as a whole and not merely among the wildlife and nature enthusiasts. Crossed tuskers are incredibly uncommon and as such the tusker more commonly referred to as the GalgamuwaDalaPuttuwa should not have been victim to such a ruthless end. It is important to note that this murder cannot be attributed to issues pertaining to Human Elephant Co-existence but is a direct act of poaching. The tusker at Karuwalagaswewa near Tabbowa was a casualty of the Human Elephant conflict as he had possibly wandered into nearby fields and was shot. This contrasts the premeditated murder of the Galgamuwa tusker.
Sri Lanka is no stranger to poaching and the low 6% of tuskers that remain in Sri Lanka is not due to genetic causes but the persistent poaching and killing of these magnificent creatures that are historically venerated in Sri Lanka. Tuskers as well as elephants are hunted for their hide but tuskers are poached in excess for their valuable ivory tusks. Such was the case with the GalgamuwaDalaPuttuwa whose structurally uncommon tusks had been hacked off and the sawn tusks and some ivory trinkets (Gajamuthu) were found in the possession of two individuals who were promptly arrested. There were allegations that the crime was committed on the orders of a political figure and investigations on these grounds are currently underway.
Sadly, it is the Galgamuwa tuskers prestige that has caused such immediate response to the situation. Had it been any other lesser known tusker, it is questionable as to whether there would have been any response at all. The carcass of the Galgamuwa crossed tusker itself bore the scars of many previous gunshot wounds which provide strong evidence of the lack of concern and protection for such creatures.

CDB shines at Best Corporate  Citizen Sustainability Awards
Citizens Development Business Finance, (CDB) was rewarded by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce when it was crowned First Runner-iup in the Turnover Less Than Rs 15 Bn Category.
CDB was awarded the Best Sustainability Project for the Green Ninja Project and accorded a Merit Certificate for its Act Early for Autism Awareness Project.
CDBs unwavering commitment to best practices in sustainability has been continuously recognised at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards. The Company attained First Runner Up in the same category for two years consecutively, both this year and previously in 2016 as well, while winning the coveted top award in the Turnover Less Than Rs 15 Bn Category in 2015, when it was also named one of the Ten Best Corporate Citizens.
Deputy CEO and CFO Damith Tennakoon, these wins are a route to further strengthening CDBs unique brand of sustainability, where he urges his team to walk the talk. To be placed among the countrys topmost corporate citizens by an august entity like the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce repeatedly, surely underlines that CDBs thought process and action plan on sustainability is a business imperative.
The Green Ninja CDB Quiz Master 2017 initiative that won the Best Sustainability Project Award further highlights CDBs unrelenting focus on its sustainability fundamentals - quality of life that must be sustained and grown through green practices that assure a healthy planet, sharing knowledge, encouraging leadership and enabling growth of individuals, communities and the nation.
The Companys green commitment is well evidenced with it being the first ISO 14064-1 carbon verified financial institution in South Asia accredited by the Sri Lanka Carbon Fund, which drove it to moot a pioneering mindset, one result of which is seen in the Green Ninja initiative organised by the G Squared=Go Green Club.
Our aim was to spread the environmental message throughout our operational network, explains Tennakoon. By making each individual responsible for their actions, inbuild conservation and infuse a greener culture aligned to CDBs sustainability agenda, we gave these young men and women the power to raise their green voice.

Celebrating the Gentlemens Tradition of rugby at Kingswood
Kingswood College Kandy was the first school to play the oval shape ball and has a proud rugby history.
A product of Trinity College Kandy E.L.Blaze introduced rugby in 1893 to Kingswood. The first schools game was played in 1906 between Kingswood and Trinity which ended in a 6-all draw. Kingswood gave up the game after a few years when a player died after an attack off a kick.
There was no rugby at Kingswood in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The game was reintroduced in 1967 with an under 17 team.
Inspired by the 1968 rugby batch, Old Kingswoodians Rugby Club has come forward to organise a unique event to celebrate the Gentlemens Tradition of Rugby at Kingswood.
The event takes place on Sunday 17 December, starting 6.30 pm at the P. Sara Oval.
The organisers will felicitate the 1968 rugby team on their Golden Jubilee, all principals who served Kingswood from 1968-2017, all captains for the last 50 years and all Kingswoodians who went onto represent Sri Lanka.
The guests of honour at the occasion will be all past principals, president of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association and CEO of Sri Lanka Rugby.
It will be a grand and unique occasion bringing together young and old Kingswoodians and well-wishers with their spouses from five generations into an evening of good spirit and camaraderie.
Tickets priced at Rs.2000 per head are available with Lasitha 0777303532, Chamu 0773524174 and with Old Kingswoodians Rugby Club.

Even though CH and FC are favourites and playing this match in their home grounds at Race Course they will have a stiff resistance from the Navy side. CH performed better in their last two outings with a closely fought out 21 all draw against Police Sports club at Police Park and a comprehensive runaway victory against the formidable Air Force Sports Club by 43-31 at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana last week.
The player to watch from the CH camp undoubtedly will be their unsung hero and former St. Anthonys College play maker fly half Samuel Maduwantha.
Mean while the Navy SC savoured mixed fortunes in their last two games wining against Air Force sports club by 10 points to nil last week at Navy grounds in Welisara and losing to Kandy Sports Club by 33-19 at Nittawala. Hence a keen tussle for supremacy can be expected in todays game.

Chinese, SL leaders pledge further cooperation
Following the conclusion of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China two months ago, a high-level party official is in Sri Lanka this week to brief government representatives on its outcomes.
At the Congress, Communist Party leaders changed the partys Constitution and laid out plans for increased national and international development. Wang Yajun, the Assistant Minister of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at a public meeting at the BMICH Wednesday that he believed the new positions would be good for Sri Lanka.
Over the years I have been traveling far and wide, to countries along the belt and the road, he said, referring to Chinas One Belt One Road global development initiative.
Chinese investment into projects along its trade routes has provided a lot of benefit to the people of these countries, he said.
Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim agreed with this position.
He said the recent finalization by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to cede a majority stake of the Hambantota Port to the state-controlled China Merchants Port Holdings Company was historic, and highlighted the islands strategic location.
Through this partnership, Sri Lanka will once again play an integral role in Chinas reawakening of the historic Silk Road which saw the East and West united through trade and commerce, he said.
Minister Hashim said that the deal offered the potential for further development of an area that had been a continuing issue for Sri Lanka.
He said the two governments would also sign a lease agreement for over 1,200 acres of land near Hambantota Port to set up a state-of-the-art industrial zone, which he said could introduce several thousand jobs.
He also lauded the China Harbour Engineering Companys Colombo Port City project, which would help launch Sri Lanka forward into the 21st century through the establishment of the financial, retail, and residential centres, he said.
Chinas efforts have been to take China and its industries out to the rest of the world, he said. The success of the One Belt One Road initiative has been based on the ability of China to craft its development projects to make sure that both countries enjoy the gains.
Sri Lanka owes about $USD 8 billion to China, and government officials frequently say they must strike deals such as Hambantota to begin to pay down the debt.

What ails the Railway
For people to support and sympathise and encourage the Railway strikers, they must first learn what J F Kenedy, the then President of America had said: Dont ask what the country has done for you, ask yourself what you have done for the country.
As one who had served this once grand department for a couple of years in the early 1950s, I have seen the fast deterioration of the once acclaimed best Railway Service in South East Asia. Walk into any Railway Station, the toilets are not clean and smelly. Have you seen Station Masters on their white uniforms with their caps although they are provided with the material for uniforms or are given financial assistance This goes for other railway workers who are entitled to uniforms.
In the grand old days, all stations had beautiful flower gardens and platforms swept regularly. Then coming to the Permanent Way  track. It is a disgrace and eye-sore to see railway yards overgrown with weeds and rusting rolling stock. It was the responsibility of the Foremen Platelayers to see the track and yards are kept clean. In the days gone by, a train traveller could see wild daisies along the track, passing Nawalapitiya, but today the scene is different. Very often we hear of derailments, which are difficult for poor maintenance. Then go back to the bungalows they are provided with. They have become slums. A visit to Mt. Mary Railway housing will prove my statement. This housing complex once had tennis courts, and other recreational activities but today  it is left to be seen. One would pause to question if their own dwellings provided by the department are not maintained, can one expect these men to have a clean workplace. I believe, the workforce has trebled since the 1950s, but the standard of maintenance and output has tragically declined. All because of ad hoc recruitment and political interferences.
The present-day railway employees should be reminded of that legendary General Manager, B D Rampala, who ran the railway so efficiently, that no trains were late and the staff very conscious of their duties.
The cry for pay hikes may be justifiable but at the same time the workers should also see to the inconvenience of the travelling public and carry out their assigned duties diligently. It may be these strikes are motivated by disgruntled, bankrupt politicians who will also protest if the train fares are increased to meet the salary increases and maintenance of the rolling stock and permanent way. To wind up, the then Ceylon Government Railways [CGR] has now become Cant Go Right.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon and Hayleys Agriculture Holdings have joined forces to offer attractive discounts, competitive rentals and special schemes to customers leasing agricultural machinery marketed by the latter.
The promotion, which places emphasis on facilitating the purchase of four-wheel tractors, will run till the end of the year. Customers who take advantage of it will also be eligible for special discounts on agriculture machinery marketed by Hayleys Agriculture, such as tractors, combine harvesters, combine threshers, brush cutters and transplanters during this period.
Under the agreement between the two entities, Hayleys Agriculture will provide substantial discounts for specified agri-machinery to Commercial Bank leasing customers and also arrange local customer gatherings at selected locations islandwide. The Bank, for its part, will provide competitive monthly rentals, special leasing schemes and expedite the processing of lease agreements and other related services.
The agreement was signed by the Chief Operating Officer of Commercial Bank, S. Renganathan and two Directors of Hayleys Agriculture, Lushan Nalinda Abesekara and Siriweera Milidduwa Gamage.
Commenting on the signing of the agreement, Renganathan said: Commercial Bank has always been at the forefront of supporting small and medium size enterprises. We view this joint effort too as the extension of a helping hand to SME agri-businesses in our country.
Sri Lankas largest and most profitable private bank and the countrys most-awarded financial institution, Commercial Bank plays a significant role in the national economy. The Bank is the largest lender in Sri Lanka to SMEs, having disbursed Rs 952 billion to the sector over the past five years and channels 17.82% of the countrys export volumes and 8.36% of its import volumes.
Hayleys Agriculture has been spearheading the Agricultural sector of Sri Lanka since the 1950s.

Coming  full  circle
S. Thomas Preparatory is a school where the boys have all the right instincts. They have the desire and they are dedicated. Though the boys may not have enough experience at the moment they are guided by some of the best in the industry. Dramatic Moves features S. Thomas Preparatory, a school that is fired up and ready to show their true colours in the arena of drama.
These boys are like brothers to Trainer, Lihan Mendis, who has been working with these boys for 10 months. During those 10 months they have watched plays and had discourses. Mendis is excited in this role because no doubt he senses the great potential in these boys.
Finally drama at Preparatory is something that is done regularly. Generally what happens is there are a group of boys who come together and do drama for the senior concert. That was the form when I was an old boy at Preparatory six years ago. There was no drama circle or society as such. So this year we have decided we will get together and have more regular sessions. The latest is that there are boys who come in every week. They will move onto the regular sessions next year and they will become part of a larger society. The latest is that we are going to organize it in such a way that it becomes a society and an official extra- curricular activity, said Mendis.
The Co-Director is Sulochana Dissanayake and what she teaches the boys is using drama as a medium for reconciliation and a medium for empathy and to hone in on emotion and experience to cultivate the skills. But Mendis primarily focuses mainly performing and developing their acting skills.
These boys do not have much acting experience. I have been working here for 10 months now and I have been making this fun. We have just gone and watched plays. We are mainly focusing on the fundamentals at this stage, stated Mendis.
Next year the group hopes to take part in the YMCA competitions, Interact Drama Competition and the State Childrens Drama Festival. That is the focus next year.
In 2015 we performed an extract of the Taming of the Shrew at the YMCA competition. In that scenario it was a group of boys who came together. We have also won the best novice school in a competition. We have also taken part in Interact Drama Competition organized by Royal College.
Drama has made these boys more focused in their lives. They enjoy doing drama and even working back stage. So these are signs that they are committed to what they are doing.
In these 10 months, yes I have seen them become more resourceful. By guiding these students I have learnt patience because you are working under time constraints. These boys are like my brothers, pointed out Mendis.
Co-Director, Sulochana Dissanayake said that the power of expression is inculcated in these students giving them the ability to properly and confidently articulate their ideas and concepts.
Drama is invaluable in developing communication skills in students which is vital for success in any chosen field. In theatre and in life, there are no one man shows - even solo performances are supported by a myriad of individuals who work tirelessly as a team to deliver what we see on stage. So learning to work together, express an idea dynamically and see something through to completion- all of this is invaluable in growing up to be a human with empathy and kindness. So in my eyes, drama is of equal importance as Maths and Science for children to grow in to healthy adults, said Dissanayake.
More humorous
Dramatist Vinuka Rajapaksa has seen Singhabahu, Naribana and My Fair Lady. He also dreams of performing Simba in Lion King. Lion King! Who can forget the comedy and tragedy of the tale! Mufasas death at the hands of Scar and when Simba finally becomes his fathers son by regaining his rightful throne! It is a story of love, friendship and betrayal.
I think I liked My Fair Lady the most and I had a better understanding of it. My Fair Lady was more humorous than Singhabahu but I think Naribana was more humorous. I have also played the role of Baloo the bear in the Jungle Book. I was very young at that time. And I was too young to be nervous. Overall the play was okay. I remember I had lot of fun because all the main characters were my best friends. I would really like to play the character of Simba in the Lion King!, said Rajapaksa
Rajapaksa pointed out that sometimes you have to change your personality and that helps you in the long run. He feels himself when he acts. He pointed out that he likes musicals.
A different personality
Dramatist Janith Dassanayake said that the Sinhala play Kavuda Weeraya really made him interested. It explores the life of a hero. That was amazing he says. It was a bit of a dark play.
Even though there is a difference between films and stage plays, I would really like to play the role of the joker in Batman actually! I would definitely like to play the character of Macbeth because of its dark themes. Definitely drama has given me a sense freedom because I can express myself.
One of my favourite actors is Johnny Depp. He has played so many characters and every character has a different personality. My favourite character is Captain Jack Sparrow! He is so interesting, that has helped me when I take up roles for stage plays because Jack Sparrow basically improvises and does not really plan at the beginning. Johnny Depp is such a good actor. He can portray any emotion, explained Dassanayake.
Favourite play
From what dramatist Dunith Gunasekerasaid drama is a sacred thing when it comes to drama at S. Thomas Preparatory. Everything is kept confidential in the group. What is said within the group is not revealed to anyone out of the group. He also pointed out that his favourite play is the Taming of the Shrew where incidentally he performed. He felt the irony and the jokes and puns really improved the quality of the play. Gunasekera definitely rates the character of Romeo has his favourite Shakespearean character.
Through drama sessions you get to express yourselves. All the pressure that you may have built up is just released. We call ourselves a circle of respect. When someone is talking the rest are quiet and everything that is said within the circle is kept within the circle. It is a great place to find yourself, said Gunasekera.
He pointed out that drama helps you to realize who you truly are and no one can take that away from you that experience.
An interesting character
Interestingly enough dramatist Sandadev Liyanagesfavourite play is a Sinhala one. It was held by the University of Visual Performing Arts.
It was very political and I did not really understand some parts but I enjoyed it. I watched Hamlet on youtube but then the quality was not that good. So that is the only Shakespearean play I have watched so far. I have acted only in one play in the senior concert. In that I played the role of a boy who was interested in this girl. That was an interesting character. I also watched My Fair Lady at the Lionel Wendt. That was also very nice. You certainly did not feel the time passing! The best part I liked was the singing. Jerome did the play well I think. The lady who played Eliza did it really well. The story line was really great. Rag was another play I enjoyed which was an intake on the whole university experience, said Liyanage.
Liyange pointed out that drama is one of the most favourite things he does in school. He mentioned that drama has helped him to open up to others.
Improvisation
Dramatist Umar Rasheed, also said that he is a great fan of My Fair Lady, because of the vocal talents of the actors. That he says was really amazing.
Also I liked the play because of the improvisation. I once played the role of a boy who was not very confident. He dreamt of being confident and growing up to becoming a person admired by everyone. And that really connected with me. The name of the play was Reflections and the boy was Aneek. It was a school production, sad Rasheed.
Rasheed said that after Pusswedilla, My First Lady was the best play he ever watched.
To portray a bond between two characters, in real life we need to bond. We should be good friends with a mutual understanding between both of us. When something goes wrong we should improvise. First I need to understand my role, and through practice and with the help of my trainer I can get into the shoes of the character. Pusswedilla play focuses on the politics of the country in a very humorous manner. It also shows what problems our country has had in the previous regime and it opens our eyes to what is happening in the country, said Rasheed.
Makes life easier
Dramatist Eransha Fernando said that he is a great fan of Rag the musical. It touches on themes relevant to societies.
I have good memories of acting in school concerts. My recent role is one that is romantic and one that is really interesting. I was a love expert and advised people on love relationships. I like to play hilarious characters where I can amuse the audience, comedies. Drama is my escape and my passion and I am really good at it because I can make people laugh. Drama makes life easier, said Fernando.

CR-Police, a close game on the card
The hapless CR & FC outfit will have a strong challenge in overcoming the fast improving Police Sports Club in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match at CR & FC Grounds in Longden Place, Colombo today. Match will commence at 4.00pm.
This years CR side is going through a miserable season where they have lost their last four matches in a row after a long time losing out to CH and FC 12-19, Army SC 20-24, Kandy SC 12-24 and Havelock SC by 30-35 last week at Longden Place. CR & FC under the coaching of former Sri Lanka national fifteen-a-side coach Fijian Fereti Verabula displayed a superb running rugby through their three quarter line against Havies in their last game.

East and South Asia worlds most dynamic regions: UN report
An upturn in the global economy now growing by about 3% paves the way to reorient policy towards longer-term issues such as addressing climate change, tackling existing inequalities and removing institutional obstacles to development, according to the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2018 Report, launched yesterday.
According to the report, in 2017, world economic growth has reached 3% the highest growth since 2011 as crisis-related fragilities and the adverse effects of other recent shocks subside. The improvement is widespread, with roughly two-thirds of countries worldwide experiencing stronger growth in 2017 than in the previous year.
Global growth is expected to remain steady at 3.0% in 2018 and 2019.
Against this backdrop, East and South Asia will remain the worlds most dynamic and fastest-growing regions.
In 2017, regional GDP expanded by 6%, outpacing the rest of the world. Supported by growth in China, robust private consumption, higher exports and accommodative macroeconomic policies, the economy is projected to remain relatively steady at 5.8% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019.
In 2017, China grew at a faster pace of 6.8%, marking its first acceleration in annual growth in six years.
Looking ahead, growth is expected to remain solid, supported by robust domestic demand and accommodative fiscal measures. The pace of growth, however, will moderate gradually to 6.5% in 2018 and 6.3% in 2019, in light of ongoing economic rebalancing efforts.
The East Asian economy is projected to expand at a robust pace of 5.7% in 2018 and 5.6 per cent in 2019, following growth of 5.9% in 2017. Private consumption will remain the key driver of growth, supported by modest inflationary pressures, low interest rates and healthy labour market conditions. Public investment is also expected to remain strong as governments embark on large infrastructure projects. While the strong export growth seen in 2017 is expected to temper, favourable external demand conditions will continue to provide support to the regional outlook.
In South Asia, the economic outlook remains steady and favourable, driven by robust private consumption and sound macroeconomic policies.
The positive outlook will contribute to further gradual progress in labour market indicators and a reduction in poverty rates. Monetary policy stances are moderately accommodative, while fiscal policies maintain a strong emphasis on infrastructure investment. Regional GDP growth is expected to strengthen to 6.5% in 2018 and 7 per cent in 2019, after posting an estimated 6.3% in 2017.
Regional inflation is expected to remain stable and at relatively low levels.
Despite a slowdown observed in early 2017, the outlook for India remains positive, underpinned by strong private consumption, robust public investments and structural reforms. GDP growth is projected to accelerate from 6.7% in 2017 to 7.2% in 2018 and 7.4% in 2019.
Despite the improved short-term outlook, the global economy continues to face risksincluding changes in trade policy, a sudden deterioration in global financial conditions and rising geopolitical tensions.
For East and South Asia, potential renewed stress in global financial markets could result in a sharp tightening of liquidity conditions in the region. In East Asia, risks to financial stability are exacerbated by high corporate debt in several countries, including China. Given the high trade openness of the East Asian economies, an escalation in trade protectionism measures would also adversely affect growth prospects.
In South Asia, the reform agenda might also experience some setbacks, while political instabilities could dampen investment prospects.

Enough is enough
Hot on the heels of the railway trade unions calling off their strike, rival trade unions who did not participate in the work stoppage has now threatened to down their tools, over some salary anomaly. Not only that, Ceylon Electricity Board trade unions, too, have commenced a stayagraha, opposite the CEB head office, also, over salary issues, with the threat of a full blown strike looming. Not to be outdone, postal unions, too, are poised to go on strike, aggrieved by allegedly being left behind in the salary scales, following the upping of the wages of the railway employees, who struck work. And true to form, the GMOA is flexing its muscles over Cabinet approval granted to minimum standards for medical education, saying it should first have the sanction of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), with the threatening tone of the doctors, unmistakable, for yet another work stoppage. Meanwhile, according to newspaper reports, petroleum trade unions, too, are sounding warnings to the government, regarding the handing over of the Trincomalee oil tanks to India, leaving no doubt as to where things are heading.
It appears that the trade unions are increasingly becoming emboldened to strike, at their whim, leaving the government at their mercy. Soon after the conclusion of the railway strike, one of the union leaders boldly claimed that they brought the government to its knees api aanduwa danagessuwa. The government has only itself to blame, for this state of affairs. It is increasingly becoming apparent that the government is placed on the back foot, so to speak, where strikes and trade union demands are concerned. Recent experience have shown that the government, though talking tough, at the outset, will surrender in the end, giving into trade union demands, making it look meek and impotent in the face of continuing TU action.
As the railway strike was getting prolonged, the government declared the railways as an Essential Service, and, threatened the strikers to return to work, on pain of dismissal. The same devise was applied in connection with the petroleum and the doctors strikes, too, to no avail. The President, signing the Essential Services gazette, in the end, amounted to nothing, with no worker dismissed, while the trade unions were granted their demands. The strikers have now got used to this. They know the threat of dismissal will not be carried out and they can afford to cock a snook at the government and get away with it.
It is time that the Yahapalanaya government took matters to hand. It cannot allow a bunch of unruly trade union activists to hold the public to ransom. It should act firmly and decisively, to give effect to its Essential Services decrees. It cannot allow the country to be stampeded by strikes. It goes without saying what work stoppages, on a regular basis, would do to the economy. Strikes are the last thing a government, dependent on foreign investments, need, at this stage.
Many blame JRJ for throwing out the July 80 strikers from employment. But, had he not dealt firmly with the trade unions, the fledgling open economy would not have taken off. There would have been no Free Trade Zones or foreign investments. Through his action he sent a clear message to would be investors that his government meant business. This also put paid to the spate of strikes that were the order of the day, as at present.
Besides, the government could not be unaware that the current rash of strikes is politically motivated. What is the need for a locomotive driver, whose take home pay is Rs. 225,000 a month, to go on strike and risk losing everything There is, no doubt, a political force fanning the current wave of strikes. The tone and tenor of the trade union leaders who give interviews to television is clearly indicative of this. With local government elections one month away, it cannot be coincidental that all the above mentioned trade unions have decided to strike together, so to speak, to cripple the government and make it look vulnerable in the eyes of the public. Besides, not a single member of the Joint Opposition spoke against the callous action of the railway strikers, in the midst of the GCE O/L exam. Not even Bandula Gunawardena, a former Minister of Education, and, a tuition master to boot. On the contrary Dinesh Gunawardena, one-time Transport Minister, took the side of the trade unions and heaped blame on the government.
The government, even at this late stage, should consider fallback options during strikes. At the time of the petroleum strike, it was proposed to appoint a Task Force, of sorts, headed by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, to get essential services running, during times of crisis. But this too appears to have been placed on the back burner - another reason for the trade unions to get emboldened, and, call the governments bluff.
Time is running out for the government. It can no longer go on hesitating and allow itself to be painted into a corner by politically motivate trade unions. It can do so only at great cost to itself.

## Title: Exam phobia in schoolchildren

Exam phobia in schoolchildren
A large number of schoolchildren undergo exam related fears. Sometimes these fears are overwhelming. It can cause low performance and failure in exams. As a matter of fact, most of the children who are shattered by exam phobia have a good IQ and positive motivation. They show favourable performances in the classroom. But when they go to the exam these students become highly stressed, have fear and they are unable to face the exam with confidence.
Students with exam phobia feel extremely fearful and unsure. Following the increased fear they are unable to grasp the theoretical material and find it difficult to remember. Exam phobia is a form of anxiety condition which is common among schoolchildren. On the verge of the exam, the fear increases and some manifest psychosomatic ailments such as abdominal pains, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, tremors, etc, which have no apparent medical basis. Some students with exam phobia manifest following anxiety related features during the exam period.
* Unable to relax* Dizzy or lightheaded* Heart pounding or racing* Unsteadiness* Feelings of choking* Hands trembling* Fear of losing control* Difficulty breathing or chest pain* Indigestion or discomfort in the stomach* Feeling faintish* Feelings of unreality or disorientation* Amnesia or difficulty in rememberingstudied material
Self revealed story by Miss H
When I was doing my O/L exam I had an unexplainable fear and anxiety. I was not a mediocre of course. I worked very hard at school and at home. I could understand the study material when the teacher was explaining. My teachers and parents thought that I was a bright student who would perform well on the exam. But one month before the exam I had headaches and loose motions. My memory was fading. I could not memorize the material that I had learned. I was extremely afraid of facing the exam. At nights I could not sleep. I was weeping and thinking of giving a medical certificate without doing the exam.
Master L and his fear
Two days before my A/L Chemistry paper I was confused. I could not recall the stuff that I had studied for the exam. I was frightened and helpless. The chemistry formulas were roaming my mind. It was an unpleasant intrusion. I thought my life was over. Two years hard work and all the hopes my parents had about me would go for nothing if I had failed the exam. I was blank, totally blank. I did not know what to do.
How Miss K fought her fear
Miss K was a bright student who had lots of hopes for the A/L exam. Her parents and the school teachers were so sure of her that she would enter the university at the first attempt. This premature hope for her became a big burden for her. Sometimes she had irrational feelings about her destiny. She often asked herself what my parents and the teachers would say if I get a lower grade on the exam. This very feeling gave her fear and anxiety. Miss K had low appetite, suffered from headaches and experienced many sleepless nights. Sometimes she was unable to recall the studied material and write correct answers to the past papers. Eventually, her fear was liquidated via counselling and psychotherapy. Imagery techniques helped her to simulate the artificial examination room atmosphere and build more and more confidence. Relaxation therapies reduced her outpouring anxiety. Miss K was able to pass the exam with excellent marks and today she is a Medical student.
Treatment of exam phobia
Counselling and psychotherapy are indicated in treating exam phobia. Counsellors who work with children and adolescents who suffer from exam phobia may be required to use effective counselling strategies to help them. These interventions may be required to allow the students to achieve a greater academic autonomous functioning ability and face the exam with confidence. Empathetic listing to the student would ease his difficulties and create a growth promoting atmosphere. The client will begin to trust his abilities and challenge the fright.
In psychotherapy, it is necessary to establish a positive and functioning relationship with the therapist. The therapist should help the client to become consciously aware and able to express their anxiety and fear about exam and performance situations. The therapist should direct the client to fight his fear. Hence the student gets more confidence to face the exam. Simulating exam atmosphere in therapeutic sessions the fears and stresses can be reduced gradually. Implementation of positive self-talk to reduce or eliminate the anxiety is vital. Instead of negative coping skills (avoidance of the exam, expressing self-directed anger, blaming others) healthy coping skills must be taught. While working with the student the therapist must increase clients participation in educational activities, combating fear and building confidence. Appropriate relaxation and diversion activities would decrease anxiety levels.
Therefore relaxation techniques (especially breathing techniques) are indicated in exam phobia. To enhance the therapeutic purpose parents/guardians and teachers support should be taken.
Some therapists perform Hypnotherapy to reduce the fear. Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness and heightened responsiveness to suggestions. During the hypnotic sessions, positive suggestions are given to build confidence and illuminate the exam fear. The modern research indicates that EMDR or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing are one of the effective modes of psychotherapy that can treat phobias successfully. These therapies should be performed by qualified and trained professionals.
Role of medication
Some children who suffer from exam phobia go into depression. Depression can cause negative self-image, low motivation, difficulty in concentrating and remembering things that would affect the learning process. Therefore depression must be managed effectively. Sometimes depression and anxiety go hand in hand and students find difficult to cope. If the anxiety level is high and difficult to control anti-anxiolytic or antidepressants are prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner. These medications combined with psychological interventions accelerate the recovery process.
Exam phobia is a self-damaging factor which negatively affects the students and their performances. The student is unable to give is maximum productivity and the end result would be critical. Usually, exam phobia is a slowly developing factor and sometimes early signs of physical and mental fatigue, irritability; difficulty in concentrating and negative self-talk can be detected by the teachers and parents. School counsellors can do a lot to help the students with exam phobia. Counselling and building confidence, educational therapy help the student to gather more strength and accomplish the exam.

France Millas train crash: Children killed as bus cut in two

A train and a school bus have collided near Perpignan in southern France, leaving at least four children dead and many other people injured.
Twenty people were injured and 11 of them were in a critical condition, after the crash on a level crossing between Millas and Saint-Fliu-d'Amont.
The bus had picked up pupils, aged between 13 and 17, from a nearby secondary school before it was hit.
Pictures from the scene showed the bus split in two by the force of the crash.
Train operator SNCF said witnesses had reported seeing the barriers at the level crossing down at the time of the collision, although that was not confirmed.
The bus, which had left the Christian Bourquin College in Millas, was on the crossing when it was hit by the train, which was travelling from Perpignan at around 80km/h (50mph). Visibility was described as good.
A witness who was on the train told local news website l'Indpendant that "it was a very violent crash - it seemed as if the train would derail".Some 30 people were on the regional train at the time.
Investigators are waiting to interview the woman driver of the bus who was slightly injured in the crash. Both drivers escaped serious injury.
Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie regional council, said the level crossing appeared to be in very good condition and had been upgraded recently. "The level crossing was very visible", she said. SNCF said it involved an automatic barrier with standard signals and was not considered particularly dangerous.
But the grandmother of an injured 11-year-old girl who had been on the bus told a very different story.
The girl had told her that the barrier had not come down but had remained raised. "The red lights that normally flash did not come on," she said. "The (bus) driver went through and stopped half way, and that's where the train crashed into it."
Rail operator SNCF has modernised level crossings across France in recent years, following numerous accidents, the BBC's Chris Bockman reports from Toulouse.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited the scene, said the task of identifying the victims was proving extremely difficult.
"The priority at this stage is to give precise information to the families who are living through a period of anguish that we must make as short as possible", he said.
Around 70 emergency workers and four helicopters were deployed as part of the rescue effort.
Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne called the crash a "terrible accident" and Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer was due to visit a counselling centre set up at the Christian Bourquin College on Friday.
A statement from the education minister's office said he would visit "to support students, families, teachers and the entire educational community".
In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron offered his condolences: "All my thoughts for the victims of this terrible accident involving a school bus, as well as their families. The state is fully mobilised to help them."

According to GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge, the GMOA strongly supports the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in opposing the minimum standards.

The SLMC should commence an immediate discussion with the relevant parties which contributed towards formulating the original minimum standards of medical education and not the declared standards by the government, he said.

Harry and Meghans wedding will be very different from William and Kates
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to have the wedding of the year this coming spring, but dont expect their royal affair to be a copy of Prince William and Duchess Kates 2011 ceremony. Heres what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.
On November 28, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.
St. Georges Chapel contains the tombs of 10 royals, including Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour. At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half, Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.
Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Pauls Cathedral in 1981, Harrys wedding wont be the first time a recent royal has married at St. Georges. According to NBC News, Harrys uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.
The space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbeys whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and theyre determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kates pomp and circumstance.
It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom, their spokesman told journalists. The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved. -harpersbazaar.com

HATHURU  will he put Crickets Humpty Dumpty together again
With former Sri Lankan opening batsman and medium pace bowler CHANDIKA HATHURUSINGHA readying to take over as the Head Coach of the Sri Lanka Cricket team, it is time to go down memory lane and etch his efforts during his playing days for school, club and country and his amazing success as a coach.
HATHURUSINGHA was first spotted as cricketer of promise with talent to represent the country was at Veluwana College. He had the natural abilities of an opening batsman who could face the new ball and then as a right arm medium pace bowler get the ball to wobble about when the shine was still there after the new ball bowlers had made use of it.
As his career began to blossom he chose right and joined Ananda College, the college that has given champion cricketers to the national grid in recent times.
HATHURUSINGHA, playing initially for the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, continued to blossom, making runs as a technically correct right hand opening batsman and then getting wickets when the ball was tossed to him.
Credit goes to S. Skandakumar a former Royal College all-rounder and stalwart at the Tamil Union who showed special interest in him. Skanda took him under his wing and showed him how to blend into big time cricket, he also had a bat at Moors Sports Club.
Etched in memory
What the writer remembers and which is still etched in memory was the great opening stand of 76 he put up partnered by Roshan Mahanama when Sri Lanka were given a victory target of something like 164 by Australian Captain Allan Border in a Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground at Maitland Place in 1992.
During that period I was writing a daily column at the end of each days play and on the penultimate day, I headlined my column in the DAILY NEWS thus  A match is not won or lost, till the final ball is bowled. I said so because with not a lot of more run to get for a historic victory it was evident that complacency had set in, in the Sri Lankan camp.
That opening partnership was the rock on which the following batsmen should have built their victory chase. Mahanama and HATHURUSINGHA faced the pace blitz from McDermott and Mike Whitney and the tantalizing off spin from Greg Mathews and biting leg spin from Shane Warne.
Sensational collapse
But from 76 for one, we collapsed sensationally to lose nine wickets for 88 and give the Aussies a 16-run win which win could be best described as a victory from the jaws of defeat for the Aussies. Warne bagged three for no score in eight balls and from the moment of that spell, it spelt doom for batsmen all over the world with Warne finally ending with 700 Test scalps.
HATHURUSINGHA according to those who matter seems to be the cure for the virulent dengue like, life threatening mosquito plaguing the game with loses more the rule rather than the exception. He will have crickets Mount Everest to conquer. Whether he could succeed where other coaches have failed miserably is the question.
After his playing days were over, he embarked on a coaching stint and showed good potential of turning out into being one of the best with credentials to being the national coach. Hopes of him staying in our cricket scene did not materialize for reasons some of it of his own making that need not be gone into in this column. Suffice to say it was a personal loss on his side as well as for Sri Lanka.
Sought pastures new
HATHURUSINGHA then sought pastures new and his first appointment as coach of the United Arab Emirates on a one year contract. Once he quit the UAE he was made coach of the Sri Lanka A team and was later named senior assistant coach to Australian Trevor Bayliss who was head coach of the Sri Lanka team. Bayliss is now coach of England.
He followed coaching course in Australia and with the country not wanting him he obtained permanent residency in Australia. That was the stroke for him to be named assistant coach of New South Wales and after coach Anthony Stuart was sacked by NSW he took over as acting coach. He later became the coach of Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash in Australian cricket which is similar to the Indian Premier League.
But he enjoyed his best years as a coach after taking over as Head Coach of the Bangladesh team in 2014. From being a mediocre team, he made Bangladesh a force to be reckoned with in international cricket with his great cricketing skills as a coach.
Bdesh enjoy best years
During his tenure with Bangladesh the country enjoyed its best years beating several other teams, most outstanding being the Test victory against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. He produced some fine cricketers who could hold their own against the best in world cricket. To mention just two they were Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan.
He also steered Bangladesh to victories over India, Pakistan, South Africa, Zimbabwe and England many a time. So it will be seen that he has proved his credentials and in signing him on Sri Lanka Cricket will be hoping that they have signed the oracle man.
But then a disastrous tour of South Africa by Bangladesh saw the cracks appearing and unable to face the criticism of some of the ungrateful cricketers who went public, HATHURUSINGHA said enough is enough and threw in the towel. That some of the Bangladesh cricketers lacked gratitude is inexplicable.
Sri Lankas head coach
Sri Lanka Cricket headed by Thilanga Sumathipala was quick to poach him and he was slated to take over as head coach of the game here after the tour of India.
It would be interesting to watch whether HATURUSINGHA will be the panacea for the cricketing ills here and whether he would be the miracle man who can resurrect the game from the swamp that it is now in, and get the game on a wicket on which they could score and regain their former glory. Only time will tell. But it will require an abundance of patience on the part of the SLC and cricket fans to give him time to put  Humpty Dumpty together again.
His achievements and track record as a coach and strategist makes him the Legends that Sri Lanka Cricket will now leverage.
HATHURUSINGHA played for Sri Lanka from 1991 to 1999. Test debut vs New Zealand in 1991. Last Test March 4, 1999 vs Pakistan. ODI debut January 10, 1992 vs Pakistan. Last ODI March 19 1999 vs Pakistan.

## Title: How Churchill fared as Finance Minister

How Churchill fared as Finance Minister
There are two ways to acquire the niceties of life. The first is to produce them; the second is to plunder them. When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time, a legal system that authorizes plunder and a moral code that glorifies it - Paul Valery
Very few of todays readers are aware that Winston Churchill was one time the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1924-29), a position comparable to our Finance Minister. At the time, Great Britain was perhaps the largest economy in the world, the centre of a global empire on which it was claimed the sun never set. Much of international trading and financial transactions were London based then.
This proximity to power, trade and money of course did not mean that the Chancellor of the British Exchequer automatically became a wealthy person. One of the striking features of the British Empire was its public service (broadly inclusive of its legislature and the judiciary), both in Britain as well as its far flung colonies, which, by and large retained its integrity and luster; a system that later provided the model for the now independent colonies.
Having left the Conservative party to join the Liberals in 1904, Churchill rejoined the Conservatives in 1924 now under the leadership of Stanley Baldwin commenting wryly anyone can rat, but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat! Baldwin made him Chancellor of the Exchequer. Churchill was not cut-out for the humdrum of State finance. It needed an epic, the far more dramatic setting of a World War to bring out the inherent genius of the man in full measure.
As to the minutiae of high finance, he pretended no mastery. When the suggestion was made to return to the Gold Standard at the pre-war parity (WW1 1914-18), Churchill gave ear to a wide range of opinions for and against, once even arranging an all-night discussion between the two sides to thrash out the pros and cons. Many government officials were for the Gold Standard while there was strong opposition from important quarters, including the economist John Maynard Keynes.
Although the 1925 decision to return to the Gold Standard was initially popular, it soon proved to be an unwise move, resulting in huge loses to the industries and the larger economy, with adverse global consequences. Churchill regretted the decision as one of the biggest mistakes of his career.
Public office and private interests
There was very little mixing of public office and private interests. All his life, Churchill had to work hard to keep his home fires burning; mainly writing, an occupation which later earned the redoubtable Englishman a Nobel Prize in literature. The famed Churchillian taste for all things good, the richness of his diningtable was legendry, ensured a home fire that burnt fast and furious.
A typical dinner at Chartwell, his country home is described thus:
Dinner, the days main event is scheduled to be served at 8.30. He may reach the drawing room at 8.45.
It is lunch (partaken lavishly early afternoon) on a far grander scale, with more guests, of greater distinction, silvery buckets of iced champagne, Churchill presiding in his grandest manner, and several courses. Among the foods likeliest to be served are clear soup, oysters, caviar, Gruyere cheese, pate de foiegras, trout, shoulder of lamb, lobster, dressed crab, petite marmite, scampi, Dover sole, chocolate clairsand, of course, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Clemmie (Clementine, his wife), who knows his preferences, has briefed the cook on what is to be on the menu.
If he has been in London recently, different versions of his latest witticisms have been repeated in the clubs of Pall Mall and St. Jamess, in drawing rooms of the West End and the city counting rooms. Asked now to confirm them, he nods as he gropes for a match or the stem of his wineglass, pausing occasionally to correct a verb or alter syntax. He tells of how crossing Parliament Square, he ran into Lord Londonderry, his cousin and frequent adversary. Londonderry hoping to drive home a point had asked him Have you read my latest book Winston chortles his reply No, I only read for pleasure or profit.
It is difficult to keep up with a host who can set such apace. Nevertheless, the dinner is not a one-man show; guests have been invited for luster, not servility.
The talk was by no means confined to politics; it ranged over history, art and literature; it toyed with philosophical themes; it visited the past and explored the future. Sometimes the conversation was a ding-dong battle of wits and words between say, Winston and Duff Cooper, the verbal pyrotechnics waxed hot and fierce, usually dissolving into gales of laughter. Frequently he would recite Horatius, and this was very popular with the children.
All his guests meet his conversational standards: the man who cannot say what he has to say in good English cannot have very much to say that is worth listening to!
After the ladies have left, men gather around him for port, brandy and cigars, he will sit around till 10 p.m., or later, talking of great political issues of the past, battlefields of his youth, strategic innovations of the American Civil War (1861-65)-Churchill can reenact any battle in that war, from Bull Run to Five Forks, citing the troops engaged on either side, identifying the commanders, describing the passage of arms, the aftermath.
It is 11 p.m.; Churchill sees his overnight guests to their rooms and as they retire, begins his working day. Only after entering his employ will Bill Deakin discover to his astonishment, that Churchill lacks a large private income, that he lives like a pasha, yet must support his extravagant life with his pen. The Churchill children are also unaware that, the family literally lived from book to book and from one article to the next. Clementine who knows, prays that each manuscript will sell. Luckily, they all do, the editors and publishers, both in Britain and America, pay him the highest rates. His output is prodigious. The Last Lion  William Manchester
This was a man, who before becoming Prime Minister in 1940, was not only once a Chancellor of the British Exchequer, but also at various times, Home Secretary, First Lord of the Admiralty (1911-15), Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, in addition to several other high appointments in the government and the armed forces. In 1915, after resigning from the Cabinet, Churchill volunteered; going to the Western Front to face the fearsome German barrages as a middle order military officer.
Gentlemanly conduct
For us in this country, with vastly different experiences and expectations of holders of public office or even what is considered manly or gentlemanly conduct for that matter; it is difficult to comprehend either a person or a career such as of Churchill. A Sri Lankan Cabinet Minister resigning in order to go to the trenches to do battle for King and country is unthinkable in our context. His physical attributes and even the mental make-up will only make a Cabinet Minister a burden to the fighting men.
On the other hand, if dressed in immaculate white; in bearing, spuriously humble; in mentality, sly; in skills, mediocre; in attitude, vulgar; and protected by a large posse of soldiers, we might say with awe, behold a man!
In such a culture, cunning is taken for intelligence, commonness equated with affability, a petulant effeminacy seen as toughness, sentimentality interpreted as empathy and irresponsibility hailed as decisiveness. With this way of looking at things, it is no surprise that a thug is seen as a hero, a financial sharper as an economic wizard and nepotism as dutiful conduct!
Only a few years after serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill was struggling to keep the wolf away from the door. Sometime in 1936/7 he received an unwelcome letter from the Editor of Evening Standard terminating his long term contract for divergence of policy, including the then prevailing appeasement of Nazi Germany. In 1938, the blow fell when recession hit the Wall Street, where Winston had laid his reserve. Stock prices plummeted so swiftly, and so deeply, that his Broker told him that his American investments had been wiped out and that in fact, it was worse, he owed the brokerage firm 18,000 Pounds.
It appeared Churchill had no choice, his beloved home Chartwell and its 80 acres will have to be sold. He would have to quit parliament to make money as a writer, lecturer, and/or businessman. He discussed with Clementine plans for economizing; told Sarah (daughter) I will give her  200 towards expenses, fuel for Chartwell to be delivered in five ton batches of  11, the wine has been very strictly controlled and little drunk and finally he wrote on a note of triumph I am not taking Inches (valet) with me abroad!
Nazi menace
Clemmie knew that the little saved by leaving his valet behind would shrink to insignificance beside his Riviera expenses. Experience has taught her that budgets did not work with the Churchill family, the reason, although he would never have acknowledged it- he was the family spendthrift.
Ruin was only averted by the intervention of a few devoted and well-heeled friends and admirers, who made financial arrangements that enabled Churchill to commit himself fully to the cause of challenging the Nazi menace while they managed his portfolio. It was only a financial reprieve, a loan, and not a gift; Churchill was to repay in time with the money his books brought him.
The public offices that Churchill held during his life, in Sri Lanka are considered finger licking good prospects for earning commissions and kick-backs. High Office is an opportunity, not to take your valet abroad at your expense, but for the whole family to see this big wide world at public expense. The holders of high positions in Sri Lanka end up, not only much richer for the effort, but leave behind institutions they touched; sullied, diminished or demoralized.
Churchill was an Englishman, of a time and of a history. He gave his best to his country, its institutions and its cause. This is something we cannot say of many of our leaders. That is the tragedy of our times, and perhaps, even climes.

How to Raise a Creative Child Step One: Back Off
In adulthood, many prodigies become experts in their fields and leaders in their organizations. Yet only a fraction of gifted children eventually become revolutionary adult creators, laments the psychologist Ellen Winner. Those who do must make a painful transition to an adult who ultimately remakes a domain.
Most prodigies never make that leap. They apply their extraordinary abilities by shining in their jobs without making waves. They become doctors who heal their patients without fighting to fix the broken medical system or lawyers who defend clients on unfair charges but do not try to transform the laws themselves.
So what does it take to raise a creative child One study compared the families of children who were rated among the most creative 5 percent in their school system with those who were not unusually creative. The parents of ordinary children had an average of six rules, like specific schedules for homework and bedtime. Parents of highly creative children had an average of fewer than one rule. Creativity may be hard to nurture, but its easy to thwart. By limiting rules, parents encouraged their children to think for themselves. They tended to place emphasis on moral values, rather than on specific rules, the Harvard psychologist Teresa Amabile reports.
Even then, though, parents didnt shove their values down their childrens throats. When psychologists compared Americas most creative architects with a group of highly skilled but unoriginal peers, there was something unique about the parents of the creative architects: Emphasis was placed on the development of ones own ethical code.

Kankesanthurai to become a commercial regional port
The once dilapidated Port of Kankesanthurai is to be developed into a commercial regional port by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
The port located 15km from Jaffna, was built by the Ceylon Cement Corporation to transport raw materials such as clinker and gypsum to the KKS cement factory.
At present, however, the breakwater and the two available piers are in a dilapidated condition and urgent rehabilitation work is needed for the breakwater and the jetties to operate the port, pointed out Shipping and Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe in his Cabinet paper submitted to Cabinet this week.
In addition, the port is small with a depth of 6m and can only serve vessels less than 2,500 DWT but once developed, it could have the potential to become a regional port to serve the North, North Central Province and up to Anuradhapura, according to the government.
Furthermore, its relative closeness to India opens it up to become a valuable connection to international shipping.
The port is currently run by the Sri Lanka Navy occupying a part of the pier with the SLPA using the remaining sections. Commercial operations have been limited to consumable and bagged cement imports with no export recorded.
In 2011, a MoU was signed between the GOSL and the Indian government for the rehabilitation of the port. The grant component of the rehabilitation has been completed and the work under the loan component such as the rehabilitation of the existing breakwater, construction of one new jetty and rehabilitation of the existing jetty is to be implemented with an estimated value of USD 45 million to the project, the Cabinet paper further stated.
Once these developments are made, the port will be able to accommodate vessels up to 8000DWT.
Minister Samarasinghe thus proposed that 50 acres belonging to the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation be handed over to the Port to develop it further for commercial purposes. Warehouses, administrative buildings, customs and security ports are to be established through this process.
The SLPA, he noted, had made initial plans to develop the port for cargo operations pending further development under the Indian credit line in future.
They plan to establish warehouses for the covered storage facility and open storage facility for the port users for efficient and effective port operation.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will also be involved in the project to create viable industries in the area to help improve commerce moving in and out of the port.

Largest polythene foil manufacturing plant opens in Bundalama, Chilaw
One of Sri Lankas largest polythene foil manufacturing plants, Polygen Poly Recycle Pvt. Ltd will open in Bundalama Chilaw today. The company has invested over Rs. 150 million for this project built on a 6 acre land.
Chairman of the company, Vijitha Warnakula said that they have being involved in the manufacture of polythene foil for both the agri and construction industry for the past 15 years.
However with the demands increasing we have now decided to construct a new factory and also diversified to the manufacture of Agri Pipes used for watering purposes of the Agricultural sector.

Warnakula said that they purchase used polythene waste from all over Sri Lanka and then bail them in their colleting yard in Wattala. Subsequently they are transported to our new factory where the waste would be converted to black polythene foils used to make garbage bags and under cover to lay concrete. This polythene is also used in Agri plant nurseries.
The Chairman said that they currently use around 100 tons of polythene waste per month and produce around 70 tons of foil for the local market. Now we will be able to increase our production to 200 tons per month and we also have raw material to support our operations.
He said that he was disappointed about the decision by the government to ban SDB polyphone bags as they were in a position to recycle them.
He also disclosed that over 50% of used polythene is made to perish to the ground and the government must come out with factories similar to him to put this waste in to practical use.
Warnakula said that they will reinvest a further Rs 40 million to build a separate factory in the same premises to manufacture polythene agri water pipes.
These two projects will offer over 100 jobs for the youth in the area.

Malans maiden Test ton lifts England in Perth
PERTH: A maiden Test century by Dawid Malan helped England fight back to 305 for four at stumps in the opening day of the vital third Ashes clash in Perth on Thursday.
After Joe Root won the toss and elected to bat, Malans unbeaten 110 helped the tourists to breathe life back into their Ashes defence by countering hostile bowling on a bouncy WACA Ground wicket hosting an Ashes Test for the last time.
Already down 2-0 in the five-match series, the visitors were wavering at 131 for four against some fiery pace bowling, but Malan steadied the innings with an unbroken 174-run stand for the fifth wicket alongside Jonny Bairstow (75 not out), Englands highest partnership of the series.
England overcame the controversial dismissal of opener Mark Stoneman for 56 on a third-umpire decision, and their cause was helped by some generosity from the Australian fielders, who dropped three catches and missed a run out.
Malan was one of the chief beneficiaries as the 30-year-old notched his first century in his eighth Test, and Englands first hundred of the series.
He would have been run out for 32 if David Warner had managed a direct hit, and was dropped by Cameron Bancroft in the slips on 92.
He steadied his nerves to notch up his century with a powerful pull shot off Josh Hazlewood, having faced 159 balls in 221 minutes at the crease, hitting 13 fours and one six.
Malan came to the crease with England under pressure against short-pitched bowling from Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, and survived early on by chancing his arm against the rising ball.
He lived dangerously at first, but having survived the onslaught showed plenty of resolve as he settled into his innings and teamed up with Bairstow to build a crucial partnership. It was just what England needed after Australias pace trio came out breathing fire after the lunch break.
They terrorised the English with aggressive bowling that was often more than 90 miles per hour, with Stoneman dropped twice on 52 and struck a fierce blow on the helmet while on the same score.
Stoneman survived all that, only to be contentiously given out caught behind off his glove to Starc by third umpire Aleem Dar for 56.
Stoneman fended at a sharply rising delivery from Starc and wicketkeeper Tim Paine pulled off a brilliant one-handed take, but on-field umpire Marais Erasmus turned down the Australian appeal.
Australia called for a review and Dar took little time overturning the original decision, although there did not appear to be any conclusive evidence to support the reversal.
The decision clearly upset the England camp, with Root and fielding coach Paul Collingwood coming out of the dressing rooms to voice their concern as Stoneman trudged off.
Earlier in the session, Root was caught down the leg side from the bowling of Cummins for 20.
After Root decided not to send the home side in to bat again -- as he had done in Adelaide in the second Test which England lost by 120 runs -- Alastair Cooks form woes continued.
The former skipper was trapped leg before wicket by Starc for just seven, on his landmark 150th Test appearance.
Cook did not review the decision, and the scorer of more than 11,000 Test runs has just 69 in the series at 13.80.

Missing link in local elections
Most of you would have read in the primary classes the story of the peasant who climbed a Kitul tree in a neighbouring garden to steal a zip of toddy. When caught in the act the peasant pleaded with the owner of the tree that he climbed the tree to cut some grass to feed his hungry cattle. The angry neighbour retorted, Where do you find grass on Kitul trees That is why I climbing down, was the clever guys answer.
We were reminded of this story during the last Presidential elections when one candidate pleaded ignorance when his supporters distributed utility goods with his photo/calendar to voters in violation of election law. His meek explanation was that he cannot be responsible for what his supporters do in his name. Later, when he felt more confident of support from the hoi polloi he said it was no violation of election law and the distribution of goodies was a legitimate act.
Now that the local government elections are round the corner one would not be surprised to hear similar Yanne koheda, malle pol (Where are you going Coconuts are in the bag!) type of stories in the ensuing period. (Incidentally, coconuts will be replaced by something else as they are too dear now)
It is the first time we have a full-fledged Elections Commission with enhanced powers to conduct the polls. Moreover, elections to almost all local government bodies are held in one day island-wide and results released at close of polls locally. This is a huge exercise demanding much skill and dexterity. The mandatory provision to include twenty-five percent women representation in the local bodies is also another complication. It has already placed the political parties which are almost 100 percent male-dominated conservative patriarchal entities despite their democratic pretensions in a quandary.
On the other hand such a mandatory provision became necessary in view of the utter backwardness of democracy in the country. Afro-Asian countries which were considered far away from universal franchise and democratic practices than Sri Lanka which boasts of being the first to obtain universal franchise have empowered women more. It must also be remembered that the degree of womens empowerment is an index of a countrys development and democracy.
Women empowerment
In view of the strong global trend towards women empowerment there is no open opposition to the move. Yet there are grumblings heard from certain academic and clerical quarters as to whether such an exercise should be taken in a hurry. They are of the same ilk as the so-called anti-imperialist and anti-colonial crusaders who prefer the provisions of the colonial Constitution or Western style autocratic Constitution to a new democratic one.
The political parties and various civil society organisations, especially those espousing the cause of communal and ethno-religious fundamentalist views have already decided to consider the forthcoming local government polls as a referendum on the popularity of the Government or as a referendum on the proposed new Constitution.
It is the same old story of betrayal of the nation, division of the country, persecution of the war heroes and the Maha Sangha, the fate of the countrys Messiah who saved the nation, international conspiracies to make Sri Lanka a vassal state that would fill the air waves, newspaper columns and the social media during the election campaign.
If at all any subject is not discussed or superficially touched during the campaign, it would be issues of local governance and development. Parties would like to test their own popularity on national policies and few candidates would possess any tangible proposals for local development. Local governance and development would be the missing link in the whole campaign.
Political party sympathies
The candidates themselves would be chosen by the party high commands as usual despite the introduction of the Ward system and the independent groups will have an uphill task in view of high deposit fees and large numbers of candidates required for enlarged councils. Voting itself would tend to follow the political party sympathies instead of a shift of emphasis on the right candidate.
It would not be surprising to see attempts by money-bags to intimidate the voters by mass display of cut-outs, posters etc. at public places and distribute utility goods to bribe them. Signs are already visible in the streets.
The Elections Commission has decided to enforce the law strictly. How far it will succeed or whether it will have sufficient strength and resources necessary for success is still a moot point. Already a Minister has reportedly told his party supporters not to be afraid and assault back in case of a clash as the Government and the police are now with them.
Whatever the defects, whatever the hiccups the new election system is worth experimenting. Its greatest advantage is the abandonment of the notorious preferential (manape) system and the granting of bonus seats to the party with the highest number of votes. The latter practice reduced proportional representation to a farce. Glitches have to be eliminated through practice and revision. What is more important is the development of the mass consciousness of the voters, especially their understanding of their civic responsibilities as citizens.

Moodys affirms long-term  ratings of 3 banks
Moodys Investors Service has affirmed the long-term ratings of three banks, Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank Ltd and Sampath Bank PLC in Sri Lanka, B1 negative.
The rating actions follow the affirmation of Sri Lankas B1 sovereign rating.
The baseline credit assessments (BCAs) and Adjusted BCAs of the three banks were affirmed at b1. The counter party risk assessments (CRAs) of the three banks were affirmed at Ba3 (cr)/NP (cr).
The outlook on the ratings of the three banks, where applicable, are maintained at negative.
Operating conditions for Sri Lankas banks have weakened because of the high loan growth over the last two years, driven by a loosening of underwriting standards. As a result, Moodys has changed Sri Lankas Macro Profile to Weak + from Moderate -, and considered the new Macro Profile in the affirmation of the three Sri Lankan banks.
The affirmation of the three banks ratings and the maintained negative outlooks follow Moodys affirmation of Sri Lankas B1 sovereign rating with a negative outlook on December 12, 2017.
The ratings and outlooks of banks typically follow the ratings and outlooks of their respective governments if the banks ratings are positioned at the same level as the sovereign rating, which is the case for Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank Ltd and Sampath Bank PLC.
Typically, such linkages between the sovereign credit profile and the credit metrics of the domestic banks are driven by the banks large investments in sovereign bonds, as well as by common drivers of the underlying operating conditions, Moodys say.
The key factor driving the negative outlook on Sri Lankas sovereign rating is Moodys view that persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks continue to pressure Sri Lankas credit profile.
Specifically, measures to build reserves and smooth the profile of external payments may be insufficient to stem imminent government liquidity and balance of payments pressures starting in 2019, when large international debt repayments come due and Sri Lankas three-year International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Meanwhile Moodys has also changed the Macro Profile for Sri Lanka to Weak + from Moderate -, reflecting Moodys view that operating conditions have weakened for Sri Lankan banks. In particular, Moodys has adjusted downwards the credit conditions score by one notch to reflect rapid credit growth in Sri Lanka over the last three years to end June 2017, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%.
Because Sri Lanka is an underpenetrated banking market, strong credit growth in itself is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, the current episode of strong credit growth has come against a backdrop of moderating economic growth.
The lowering of Sri Lankas Macro Profile to Weak + from Moderate - has no impact on the BCAs of the three Sri Lankan banks.

NCE welcomes two-thirds vote on Budget 2018
National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) President Ramal Jasinghe said that the Chamber is happy that the Budget 2018 was passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament as it gives the private sector a sense of direction.
The private sector wants a favourable and consistent policy, he said.
The Chamber was also happy that the state has been listening to its views, Jasinghe said. The NCE is part of the core team that is in the process of outlining the National Export Strategy (NES) and is consistently represented at all levels of discussions on free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the government is currently undertaking with India, China, Singapore and Thailand.
Jasinghe said that what Sri Lanka needed was a concerted effort by the state, academics, professionals and the private sector to chart a national marketing strategy that would enable the island to take advantage of global trade opportunities.
In this context, he commended the current effort of the Export Development Board to bring all parties together to formulate a national branding strategy for Sri Lanka. Marketing dons of the Universities of Kelaniya and Sri Jayewardenapura, professional associations like the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing and the private sector represented by such bodies as the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the NCE are part of this effort, he said.
Jasinghe said that for the Sri Lankan economy to grow, all such efforts should finally converge on Vision 2025 and beyond.

Only few traders comply with govt.s order to sell coconuts at Rs. 75 per nut
Only a single trader in the Sigiriya town was complying to the controlled price of coconuts imposed by the government which was Rs. 75 per nut, but all the other traders in the Sigiriya town are selling a coconut at prices ranging between Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 each.
This was revealed in a survey conducted in Sigiriya town recently. Traders at the Dambulla Sathipola when questioned about this situation, said that eventhough they were willing to comply with the governments order, coconut estate owners had failed to reduce the whole sale price of coconuts supplied to them.
Although 25 to 30 wholesale coconut traders normally frequent the Dambulla Sathipola, only three traders were seen in recent times. There is also a scarcity of retail coconut traders in the Dambulla town.
Vegetable traders who used to sell coconuts as a side business, said the Consumer Affairs Authority was filing legal action against retail traders selling coconuts above the price of Rs. 75 each, but the wholesale suppliers who do not fall In line by reducing the wholesale price, had been exempted from any legal action.

Peoples mandate sought to strengthen LG authorities - Mangala
The United National Party (UNP) is seeking the peoples mandate to back the Local Government authorities with the governments strength, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
The Minister made these comments to the media after handing over nomination lists to the Pasgoda, Malimbada and Hakmana Pradeshiya Sabhas and the Weligama Urban Council at the Matara District Secretariat last morning.
Prior to handing over nominations, Minister Samaraweera accompanied by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and Member of Parliament Buddika Pathirana paid homage to the sacred Matara Bodhiya.
It was just over two years ago that the three of us submitted our nominations seeking the peoples mandate to form a government. On being elected to power we brought change by establishing democracy and bringing development to the nation.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka reiterated what Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that all measures would be taken to conduct a peaceful election.
We took development to the villages but if we are given the mandate to govern the local authorities, we would be able to speed up the development process,Minister Ratnayaka said.
Minister Ratnayaka said the United National Party would be fully committed to ensuring a free and fair election.
He added that no one should forget the situation in the country before January 8, 2015.
We have now ushered in a new political culture. That is why are coming forward to protect the rights of the voters and ensure a free and fair election election, Minister Ratnayaka said.
He said that the government is in the process of strengthening the countrys economy and rebuilding the nation.
We need the Local Government bodies to work in line with our national agenda. That is the intention which we launch our election campaign, the Minister added. He said people in the Matara disrict gave strength and momentum for the formation of the national unity government.
We need to move forward with the same vigour and strength, at this election, the Minister added.
Some have now forgotten the track record of the defeated political elements. They have also forgotten how their cronies made money through government contracts. We request them not to forget the past. Also, we invite them to join hands with us, and embark on this victorious journey, Ratnayaka said.

The Anuradhapura Police Crimes Division has launched investigations to arrest a group of culprits involved in torching several vehicles including a brand new car parked at the residence of a florist in Nirawiya and causing damage to the tune of nearly Rs. 7 million allegedly, to settle a score regarding a mistress.
Police said investigations revealed that a car valued at nearly Rs. 3.5 million, a three wheeler valued at nearly Rs. 700,000 and four motorcycles owned by P. A. Gunadasa (64) of Watavandana Road, Nirawiya, had been thoroughly burnt by the fire which had spread to a room in his house too, destroying several household equipment. The incident had occurred around 2 am on December 4, while the culprits involved had escaped. There is suspicious that a dispute between the florist concerned and his mistress had led to arson.
The victim has said in his complaint that a loud noise in the wee hours of December 14, had awakened him and when he looked out saw a three wheeler parked in the garage on fire.
He quickly went out and tried to pull out the three wheeler from the garage but his attempts proved futile. The fire bad spread to the other vehicles and the adjoining room where his daughter and her infant were sleeping. Although a burning rafter had fallen on to the bed they were sleeping on. They had managed to escape unscathed.
Thereafter, neighbours rushed to the scene and tried to douse the fire before it engulfed the whole house. The Anuradhapura Municipal Five Brigade which was summoned, had helped to put out the fire.
Police said the Florist had five children by his legal wife and the mistress.
There had been a complaint earlier, at the Police station regarding a family dispute. During investigations held into this complaint, the mistresss party had made a veiled threat to set the florists house on fire.

Poverty-free Sri Lanka by 2030
Poverty is hunger, loneliness, nowhere to go when the day is over, deprivation, discrimination, abuse and illiteracy. As to my own conviction, poverty is more than an income related issue. From the human development perspective, it is the denial of choices and opportunities for living a tolerable life, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the National Conference on Social Work for Sustainable Development organized by the National Institute for Social Development (NISD) on Wednesday at the BMICH.
He said in achieving a poverty-free empowered Sri Lanka, the National Institute of Social Development has a huge role to play. Therefore, this conference deliberates on poverty reduction strategies through social work interventions.
Though our headcount poverty index has declined to a level of 4.6 percent in 2016, poverty is still a major social issue which hinders human development. Therefore, eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is a challenge and a necessary requirement for sustainable development, he said.
In the contemporary world billions of people in many countries are facing extreme poverty. Eradicating extreme poverty through sustainable development is one of the major goals in Sri Lanka, he added.
He said: Our efforts to eradicate poverty through the Samurdhi Programme have shown good results. However, extreme poverty is a major problem the country is encountered with.
The poor comprise disabled and elderly people, chronically sick, substance abusers and abounded children.
The government is mindful of those people and a number of activities have been implemented through government agencies and non-governmental institutions to achieve the vision of the government for a poverty-free Sri Lanka by 2030.
In the journey, the effort which the NISD has made is creating an academic forum through the National Conference is commendable. I believe that this conference will be a success and will generate new ideas in creating a poverty-free Sri Lanka.
I hope NISD will organize many more timely and appropriate conferences and other suitable events in future as well, the minister said.

PPP projects for Port City infrastructure services
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development this week received Cabinet approval to enter into Public - Private Partnership (PPP) projects for the provision of infrastructure services to the Colombo Port City.
The first such project would be the Marine Drive extension to connect to the Port Citys proposed elevated highway.
On July 11, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka asked for Cabinet approval to have PPP projects for underground Marine Drive extension to connect Elevated Port Access Road, a 350MW power generation plant using LNG, a District Cooling Plant, sewerage/wastewater treatment plant and city airport on a sea sand fill in Colombo.
The Cabinet directed his proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management for further proposals and they, in turn, recommended that a joint venture would be more suitable for the above projects and the viability of the above projects be looked into by a three-member committee comprising Secretary, Finance and Mass Media, Secretary, Megapolis and Western Development and a representative of the Attorney Generals Department.
The government is bound to provide certain infrastructure to the Port City according to the tripartite agreement signed between the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Urban Development Authority and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd on August 12, 2016.
The agreement stipulates that the government through the RDA will make efforts to provide a new Kelani Bridge and Port Access Elevated Highway connecting the existing Colombo-Katunayake Expressway to the project, an extension of Marine Drive to connect to the Port Access Elevated Highway and Connection of Baladaksha Mawatha to Galle Road.
It has the flexibility to decide whether it would be done under a PPP or any other structure.
The three-member committee pointed out that the projects listed above, except for the marine drive extension, needed a critical mass of end users at the Colombo Port City for them to be viable and thus approval at present has only been given to the Marine Drive extension.
The Marine Drive extension, they viewed, would also benefit the Colombo city, as a link between the Airport Highway and Marine Drive, increase the width of the Galle Face Green without disturbing heritage buildings and could provide an underground road connection to the Shangri La Hotel area.
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development thus invited the CHEC to undertake a feasibility study on the project but given the high costs, the company had asked that they sign a PPP agreement to ensure that the government will evaluate and negotiate the PPP on an exclusive basis.
Thus, it was decided that a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee be appointed to discuss the PPP for the project.

Rice imports allowed upto next April
The Cabinet Subcommittee on Economic Management headed by the Prime has decided to import 100,000 metric tonnes of rice monthly until the next Sinhala and Tamil New year.
This is in a bid to lower rice prices of rice to a level which is affordable to the consumer during the festive season.

The Government has also decided to grant permission to any private organisation to import rice to make ample stocks available in the market during the festive season.
The validity period of special tax of 25 cents imposed on a kilo of imported rice has been extended till March 31, 2018.
Arrangements have also been made to supply essential commodities including dhal, canned fish, big onions, potatoes, sugar and sprats to the local market.The importers of such essential commodities to the country have given an undertaking to the government that these consumer items will be made available in any part of the country at imported prices.
The government is to grant relief to the importers who will have to bear additional costs including import duty and storage costs.
The government has also granted permission to coconut industrialists to import coconut and tax on import of coconut meat has also been lifted to meet the higher demand for coconut in the open market.

A rich cultural heritage
The Martial Arts have been a source of great fascination to people since ancient times. The main reason is probably because it is a form of self- empowerment. The ability to defend oneself against an external enemy is no doubt valuable. Throughout the ages youth around the world have watched actors such as Bruce Lee and David Carradine exhibit their fighting skills on television adding to its appeal.
The Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu Show is currently being held from December 12- 17. What is special about the event is that the performance is actually by Shaolin Monks.
This show is organized by the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China, Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Cooperation, Sri Lanka China Friendship Association, Sri Lanka China Society and Sri Lanka China Journalist forum.
This event becomes special to all of the associations and the institutions working towards the growing and stable bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and China as the two countries are Celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka, as well as the 65th Anniversary of the Signing of the Rice and Rubber pact, said President, Association for Sri Lanka and China Social and Cultural Corporation, Indrananda Abeysekera.
Abeysekera pointed out that the visit by the performers will further establish the friendship between the peoples of both countries, especially in a time where One Belt One Road Initiative is promoted by China. Today China and Sri Lanka is at a new starting point of strategic cooperative partnership, where Sri Lanka is becoming a significant trade and cultural partner in the new maritime silk route.
Director, Cultural Division, Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China, Liu Dong, said the event was one of great pride for both nations because both countries have their own forms of martial arts. He spoke of the rich cultural exchange that this event creates.
These events are an ideal opportunity to further strengthen our relations. So we have organized this cultural show in Sri Lanka for many reasons. One being that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist Country and Shaolin Kung-Fu has a connection with Buddhism. Sri Lanka also has a martial arts tradition and culture so we hope this will be learning opportunity for all involved. This is an important event as it marks 60 years of bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and China and it marks the 65th anniversary of the Signing of the Sri Lankan China Rice Rubber pact, said Dong.
Dong added that these events had a big impact on Sri Lanka and China cultural relations.
We have one purpose and that is to continue and consolidate our relationship. Both China and Sri Lanka have splendid traditions and we have much to share with each other, added Dong.
President, Sri Lanka China Society, Amaradasa Gunawardana reiterated what Liu Dong said when he spoke of the importance that both countries attach to each other.
The Diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and China have prospered for 60 years. However actual relations between the two cultures dates back hundreds of years. On September 21, 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China. It is common knowledge amongst the people of Sri Lanka, what our relations have been and what they are now, said Gunawardana.

Mohamed Nilam, who was following the Sri Lankan cricket team on the India tour along with two others, was informed of his fathers medical condition during the third Test in Delhi. Nilam, who had to immediately go back for his fathers surgery, did not have sufficient funds to book a new ticket.
India captain Virat Kohli and Rohit were informed of his situation by Sudhir Gautam, the superfan of Sachin Tendulkar. Rohit immediately stepped in to sort out Nilams return ticket.
Rohit called me to the team hotel and gave me the (Rs 20,000 approx) ticket. The surgery went well. I was disturbed when I heard about my fathers health, Rohit has a big heart and he immediately arranged for my return ticket. He is a gem of a person, Nilam told Mid-Day.
Thats not all. Rohit even offered financial help for the surgery, but Nilam refused it. Virat too got in touch with the Lankan to ask him whether he needed any help.
When Virat bhai came to know about my fathers health, he too messaged me and asked if I needed any help. I congratulated Virat bhai on his wedding. I feel blessed and lucky to get so much love from Indian cricketers. They have always been very helpful in arranging match tickets whenever we come to watch them, Nilam added. On Wednesday, Rohit led from the front with a historic third ODI double ton (208*) to power India to a series-leveling 141-run win over Sri Lanka at the Punjab Cricket Association I.S. Bindra Stadium.
Coming into the match, the Mumbai batsman was the only cricketer to have hit two double tons. Rohits knock was the highest by an Indian captain against Sri Lanka.

Setback for Pohottuwa
Nomination lists of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) known as Pohottuwa were rejected for several Local Government authorities yesterday.
The SLPPs lists for Weligama Urban Council, Maharagama Urban Council, Badulla Pradeshiya Sabha, Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha, Panadura Urban Council and Agalawatte Pradeshiya Sabha were rejected.
Nominations for 93 local bodies closed at noon yesterday.Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya speaking to the Daily News said the list for the Weligama Urban Council was rejected as it was handed over by an unauthorised person and the Maharagama Urban Council did not have the stipulated number of female candidates on the list.
Deshapriya explained that a nomination list has to always be presented by an authorized person; the party secretary, a candidate or a previously authorized person. He added that in the Maharagama ward, there needed to be four female representatives but the list only had three names.
A government official explained that according to election laws, the party had to nominate an authorized person to handover the nomination list by 8 December, 8.30am.
In the Badulla Pradeshiya Sabha, a government official explained that the SLPP list had a candidate who had simply signed his name but not written it in full. In Mahiyangana, they have not mentioned whether the candidates on the list were male or female.
When it came to Panadura and Agalawatte, the Party Secretarys signature had not been properly certified.
Apart from the SLPP, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as well as the Ilangai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) too had their nomination lists rejected in the Ampara District.
The SLFPs list was rejected in the Dehiyatakandiya and Padiyathalawa Pradeshiya Sabhas while the ITAKs lists in Alayadivembu and Samanthurai were rejected.
According to the Election Commission sources, the SLFP and ITAK lists were rejected since they were handed over by persons not authorised to do so. The parties had also missed the deadline to nominate a person to hand over the list.
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) too had bad luck in Samanthurai with their list being rejected. According to government officials, the list had not been signed by the Party Secretary.
The UNP in the meantime had the candidate for the Gondennawa Ward in the Nawalapitiya Urban Council rejected for not fulfilling conditions set on the nomination paper, said the Returning Officer, H.M.P. Hitisekara at the Kandy District Secretariat.
The parties whose lists were rejected yesterday will not be able to contest for the respective local bodies at the election next year.
The date for the election will be set once nominations for the remaining 203 local bodies have been called for. According to the Elections Commission, nominations are to be called for these bodies from December 18-21. They will close at noon on December 21. The nomination of the authorized agent has to be made on December 15 before 8.30am.
There are 336 local bodies in total which have been dissolved. Of that number, 203 have petitions against them and had nominations delayed. Of the remaining 133, 40 had typos in the gazette calling for elections and thus the gazette had to be reissued. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils earlier this month stated that the amended gazette for the 40 local bodies was being prepared and would be ready soon.
SLPP to take legal action
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will go before court over the rejection of nomination papers for several Local Government institutions in the Kalutara, Colombo and Matara districts on Monday, said Matara district Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma.
Alahapperuma when asked about their future course of action following the rejection of several of its nomination lists said that this type of minor incidents have taken place throughout history.
The Parliamentarian said that several nomination lists of the Sri Lanka Podu jana Peramuna have been rejected citing technical reasons which are very trivial. Alahapperuma added that his party has fulfilled all basic requirements to be accepted by the election officials.
He said that the candidates fielded by his party have already declared their assets. We will go before court seeking a Writ Order.

## Title: SLCPI calls for proactive approach for treating CVD in Sri Lanka

SLCPI calls for proactive approach for treating CVD in Sri Lanka
Given the rising global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases - which is responsible for one-third of deaths worldwide and a staggering 40% of deaths in Sri Lanka  The Sri Lanka Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industries (SLCPI) called for urgent proactive stakeholder engagement to increase awareness on preventative care for CVD.
A broad disease category that encompasses coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease, current World Health Organization (WHO) estimates project CVS prevalence and mortality rates to double to 80% by 2020, with developing nations  particularly in the South Asian region - having to face the brunt of this rising epidemic.
In that context, SLCPI Chairman Shyam Sathasivam called for urgent proactive measures to be implemented with a view to increasing awareness of CVD risk factors and treatment, together with a concerted, systematic approach to combatting the disease.
The breadth of underlying factors that contribute to CVD points to the need for decisive, long-term, multi-sectoral initiatives to combat this rising epidemic. A cornerstone of such a strategy must necessarily include the promotion of healthy diet and lifestyle choices. As a nation, we must work to help our citizens to understand the clear relationship CVD and an unhealthy diet, tobacco use and a sedentary lifestyle.
"Similarly, we must place an equal emphasis on active collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors in order to refine our healthcare delivery mechanisms in a manner that ultimately provides improved outcomes for patients, and prevents the spread of this deadly non-communicable disease.
According to Sathasivam, the investment of capital, time and resources towards such proactive measures would be clearly felt in the economic performance of the nation given the complex interrelationship between economic development and the cost of disease on the productive capacity of a workforce, and the economy at large.
CVD can affect the entire economy of a developing nation. Disability, early mortality, and direct health expenditures can divert resources from savings, investment, and other productive uses, affecting economic well-being at the household level and growth potential at the national level.
Such challenges are keenly felt, even in developed economies with the American economy projected to have 100% of its federal budget having to be allocated towards healthcare by the year 2040, if rates of disease continue to increase at their current rates.
Factors which contribute to CVD can be categorized into different sectors - behavioral factors (diet and physical activity), biological factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI), health systems factors (access to better screening, diagnosis, and quality of medication), psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, acute and chronic and lack of social support) and inter-sectoral factors (tobacco control policies).
These factors provide the basis for a strong strategy to be implemented and coordinated across different sectors, which integrates health promotion, prevention, and disease management as part of a long-term, comprehensive approach. Such approach would be ideal to promote the concept cardiovascular health among Sri Lankans by employing a number of intervention policies that would accommodate distinctions according to context and background, Sathasivam said.
In that regard, he reiterated that in addition to efforts to popularize cardiovascular health in the country, the most important factor in fighting CVDs is to take a proactive stance against them. Relevant policies and programs to change the factors that contribute to CVD would be designed to work through population-wide approaches, through interventions within health systems and through community-based programmes with components in schools, worksites, and other community settings, in a proactive manner.
For individuals already at high risk or with existing disease, a proper proactive approach would combine education, support, and incentives to both address behavioural risk factors and improve adherence to clinical interventions. Participation in this approach extends beyond clinical providers and public health approaches including public media outlets, community leaders, and related sectors, especially food and agriculture policy, transportation and urban planning, and private-sector entities such as the pharmaceutical industry. All these players are potential partners both in assessing needs and capacity and in developing and implementing solutions.
Developing countries like ours will want to focus efforts on goals that promise to be economically feasible and have the highest possibility of intervention success. Priorities are different from a country to country but we can achieve significant progress in reducing cardiovascular diseases in a short term by implementing a set of prioritized tasks such as reduction of salt in the food supply and in consumption and improved delivery of clinical prevention using pharmaceutical involvements in high-risk patients, Sathasivam said.
Another key step in addressing CVD is to strengthen health systems to deliver high-quality, responsive care for the prevention and management of CVD. Improving health care delivery includes provider-level strategies, financing, integration of care, workforce development, and access to essential medical products.
The local pharmaceutical industry understands the importance of providing our people with quality medication and state-of-the-art facilities to better screen and treat cardiovascular diseases to ensure a far healthier population and the SLCPI is fully committed to working with the Ministry of Health to reach this achievable goal, said Sathasivam.
He said that the devising of a viable pricing mechanism for imported medicines could greatly assist the healthcare industry combating the detrimental effects of CVDs, by making top-quality medication available in Sri Lanka as well, and uplifting its risk mitigation capabilities.
While improving the quality of health services is vital to reduce the impact of cardiovascular diseases on Sri Lankas development, individuals too need to focus on improved lifestyles. Regular medical checkups and proper medication are necessary to ensure early detection and prevention, coupled with more active routines and improved diet.
In that regard, Sathasivam reiterated the SLCPIs firm belief that in the battle against these diseases, a stronger health system supported by increased funding, more stringent regulations and increased collaboration of the Ministry of Health and associated medical bodies will be an absolute necessity.

S&P upgrades DFCC Banks  rating outlook to Stable
S&P Global Ratings has revised its credit rating outlook for DFCC Bank from negative to stable, while affirming B long-term and B short-term issuer credit ratings on the bank. In its assessment of DFCCs business position, the Bank is projected to maintain its satisfactory market position and business stability over the next 12-18 months.
The stable rating reflects the rating agencys confidence in the financial institutions ability to navigate operating conditions in Sri Lanka and maintain its financial profile in the coming months. At the same time, it has affirmed its B long-term and B short-term issuer credit ratings on DFCC Bank while affirming its senior unsecured debt ratings on the bank.
Further, the rating agency noted that an improvement in the banks risk position balances a decline in the banks risk-adjusted capital under its new updated methodology. It anticipates banks loan growth to be 14%-18% while profitability is likely to remain stable, with healthy net interest margins and fee income balancing credit costs.
DFCCs credit costs are expected to increase somewhat in the next 12-18 months due to sluggishness in economy in the past 18 months and elevated interest rates.
However, S&P expects losses to remain well within its normalized loss expectations. The banks loan growth has been lower than the industry average and the proportion of granular retail assets has increased in the past few years.
Commenting on the latest rating, Lakshman Silva  CEO, DFCC Bank, said, We are pleased that S&P has recognised that DFCC Banks fundamentals keep improving with the deposit base increasing, loan to deposit ratio moving in the right direction and NP ratio within industry average.
The upward revision of the rating outlook fully justifies the decision of the Board taken last year to sacrifice short term profitability in exchange for long term stability.

Tapping  Sri Lankas  Adventure Tourism potential
The National Geographic Traveller Cool List 2018 released earlier this month, declared Sri Lanka in the number one spot to offer A better all-round travel experience. This experience touches on wildlife to cultural tourism, but one of the most untapped sectors in the country is Adventure Tourism.
This niche market whilst being practised on a small scale throughout the island has the potential to develop into a very lucrative industry, given the right policies and infrastructure.
If the available natural resources are properly exploited, Sri Lanka could become the hot spot for Adventure Tourism in South Asia, reveal adventure tourism operators.
Even though not branded as an Adventure Tourism destination, the majority of tourists arriving in Sri Lanka consciously or unconsciously engage in one form of Adventure Tourism or the other.
Tourists enjoy jungle and river safaris, scuba diving, snorkelling, water skiing, surfing, kite surfing, mountain cycling, mountaineering, rock climbing, white water rafting, canoeing or wind surfing and all of these outdoor leisure activities available in Sri Lanka come under the Adventure Tourism Sector.
Requirements in promotingAdventure Tourism
According to the International Adventure Tourism Development Index, countries which maintain the essential requirements such as ( a.) Sustainable Development Policy, (b) Safety and Security, (c) Tourism Infrastructure, (d) Natural Resources, (e) Cultural Resources, (f) Adventure Activity Resources, (g) Entrepreneurship, (h) Humanitarian and (i) Health, qualify as sought after Adventure Tourist Destinations in the world.
In addition, those who plan to be engaged in an Adventure Tourism venture should
possess thorough experience and specialist knowledge on the specific type of Adventure Tourism Industry.
Bungee Jumping - Dangerousform of Adventure Tourism
David Kirke and Chris Baker founded the Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University, England and introduced modern day Bungee Jumping and the first jump was done on April 1st, 1979 from Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, England which was followed by numerous other Bungee Jumping events.
Since 1990, Adventure Sports have been institutionalized and gradually Adventure Sports enter the sphere of Tourism Industry catering to the requirements of Adventure Sports enthusiasts visiting other parts of the globe seeking outdoor leisure activities.
As a direct consequence of globalization, every country depends on the hospitality trade for income generation and has to pay greater attention in adjusting to the ever changing needs and trends of the modern day tourists.
The decisive environmental factors relevant to the Adventure Tourism Sector are weather and terrain of a country. In addition, the Adventure Tourism sector depends on the condition of wind, snow and water which are considered as environmental variables of uncontrollable nature.
Thusal Gunawardena the owner of Sunshine Water Sports Centre, Aluthgama started his carrier as an enthusiast in Adventure Tourism at the age of 17 amidst numerous hardships.
As a direct result of dedication, enthusiasm and hard work he became an expert in the sphere of water sports in Sri Lanka recognized both nationally and internationally.
Thusal was ranked among the Top 10 at the World Windsurfing Championship of 1992 and won the 8th place out of 92 contestants when he took part in the 2009-2010 International Stand-up Paddling Competition, held in Hamburg, Germany.
He also won a Silver Medal at the South Asian Beach Games held at Hambantota recently. He trained hundreds of foreigners and locals in water sports and some of his employees having been trained thus, have migrated for better employment in the Middle East.
Global market forAdventure Tourism
We live in a globalized world and compete in the world market with limited resources and the consumers of our products today, whether it is a product in the Tourism Industry or any other trade, are demanding and focused, said Gunawardena as he stressed on the necessity to change according to the growth and novel trends in the global Adventure Tourism market.
He added that all those who were involved in every aspect of the Tourism Industry should have to change with the times and be creative in the ways they offered education on Adventure Sports found in Sri Lanka.
The present day traveller is keen on adventure and interested in exploring weird and wonderful places and opportunities should be made available for such tourists visiting Sri Lanka, he said.
He further explained that the untouched corners of the natural world were getting smaller and smaller and the situation in Sri Lanka was turning from bad to worse on a daily basis.
Relevant authorities should take note of this situation and take action to protect such environmentally sensitive areas, if the Adventure Tourism Sector is to be developed, said Gunawardena.
Water Sports gear
Costs also play an important role in deciding the viability of the sector. According to Gunawardena, the price of a Jet ski (Water Scooter) is around Rs. 2.2 million and he hired five Jet skis. The exorbitant prices of equipment affect the expansion of water sports and he further asked that steps be taken to reduce the import taxes for the equipment required for water sports and other items necessary for the Adventure Tourism Industry .
No Adventure withouta pristine environment
Sri Lanka is considered a paradise for water sports and surfing can be done throughout the year, either in Arugam Bay in the Eastern Coast or at Hikkaduwa and Mirissa on the South Western Coast.
R. K. Somada de Silva, Director of International Diving Centre (Pvt.) Ltd. , Hikkaduwa is one of the most senior divers in Sri Lanka having more than 30 years experience in the field. He had undergone training in numerous International diving Institutions such as PADI (Asia Pacific ), UDI, CMAS (Germany) and Pro Dive (U.K.)
He is also an environmentalist and for many years was directly involved in replanting corals on the sea bed of the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary. In 1998, corals bleached due to the El Nino effect and in recognition of his dedication to the conservation of the marine environment he was felicitated with a Certificate of Recognition by a German Travel Association . (Deutscher Reise Verband).
De Silva provides practical and theoretical lessons on diving at the International Diving Centre located near the Under Water Marine Sanctuary ( Coral Gardens).
He said it would not be an exaggeration to say that the Tourist Industry of Sri Lanka originated at Hikkaduwa on the Southern Coast mainly due to the existence of Coral Gardens which were full of rare species of multi coloured corals and coral fish.
For more than a century, Coral Gardens had enticed foreign holiday makers to Sri Lanka.
Hikkaduwa gradually became a sought after beach destination by internationally renowned marine biologists, naturalists, conservators and scientists, for its breathtaking beauty and scientific importance. De Silva said that some foreigners compared the Under Water Marine Sanctuary to a live marine biology laboratory.
When it came to Adventure Tourism, De Silva said the availability of the abundance of ship wrecks on the sea stretch from Akurala to Galle could be considered as a treasure trove to promote Wreck Diving - an aspect of Adventure Tourism.
De Silva said that in addition to ship wrecks there were several under water rocks identified as popular diving sites. But illegal methods of fishing using dynamite and other explosives however, have become a threat to promoting diving, he further said.
The Chairman of the Ocean University, Professor Ranjith Senaratne addressing a media conference held at the Ocean University in Tangalle recently, observed that the unique natural beauty and serene atmosphere on the ocean bed around Sri Lanka could be exploited in a sustainable manner to promote Adventure Tourism.
He pointed out that tourists around the world took a keen interest in enjoying underwater safaris and they spent hours under water in glass cabins watching the beautiful fish.
On land, people tour sanctuaries or wildlife parks, but in the ocean bed much more diversity could be seen when compared to the terrestrial environment.
Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara, the Head of the Department of Oceanography and Marine Geology, University of Ruhuna however, first stressed on the need to protect Coral Reefs in the sea off the South, including Coral Gardens at Hikkaduwa. He said there was great potential in the ocean around Sri Lanka in promoting Adventure Tourism.
SNUBA - A mixture of Scuba and Snorkelling
Mongoose Adventures, one of the leading adventure sports companies in Sri Lanka
has its centres in Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee, Kalpitiya, Bentota and Habarana and has already
started its operations in promoting Adventure Tourism. For the first time in Sri Lanka, Mongoose Adventures has introduced Snuba a novel method of diving known as the tamer cousin of scuba and distant relative of snorkelling - a mixture of both types of diving.
Snuba is an easy and safe way to explore the diverse marine life around the seas of Sri Lanka for those who want to go beyond snorkelling. Snuba facilitates exploring the underwater world at deeper depths than snorkelling, even if you do not possess prior diving certification, Ishani Ranasinghe of Mongoose Adventures revealed.
In snuba most of the equipment used in scuba diving is used but the compressed
air tank is made to float on the surface rather than on the diver s back. Snuba diving has already been introduced at Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee and Mirissa, Nishan Silva, Managing Director of Mongoose said.
Nilaveli Beach and Pigeon Island in Trincomalee are ideal locations for Snuba where
there is amazingly rich and colourful marine life, he added.
He further explained that since its introduction 20 years ago, over 5 million people across the globe have successfully completed Snuba diving with no reports of serious injuries.
Kite surfing
Michael Walter an expert on Kite Surfing has trained several Sri Lankans on Kite Surfing as an Adventure Sport. Dilsiri Welikala happened to be one of his first trainees and now he conducts training classes on Kite Surfing to both foreign and local enthusiasts.
Kalpitiya and the North West Coast of Sri Lanka up to Jaffna have been identified as windy locations in Asia. Welikala said Kiters from many parts reached Kalpitiya since 2006 but due publicity was not given. Now Kalpitiya is on the kitesurfing map. Even though Kitesurfing is an extreme sport, for learners, lessons could be conducted on the flat, shallow waters in the lagoon, he added.
There are many Kite Surfing points at Kalpitiya and Kite Surfing could be promoted as a form of Adventure Tourism at Kalpitiya because the wind blows at an average speed of 18 - 20 knots, 24 hours a day, throughout the week, from May to September, according to Walter.
The opportunities and places to explore are plenty but one thing all those involved in the Adventure Tourism sector agree is that they do not receive much cooperation from government authorities to promote these sectors or to develop it.

Teacher trainees to get modified syllabuses
Kurunegla District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told Daily News on December 14 in Kuliyapitiya that his Ministry is now exploring the possibility of modifying the present syllabuses which are now almost outdated, to replace them with new ones for National Colleges of Education countrywide, for the teacher trainees who undergo three-year residential teacher training diplomas.
This plan of modifying the syllabuses is to update the teacher-training programmes for future teachers of government schools, to cater to the educational needs of the future student population and to meet the international standards and current job market requirements.
Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that he has already taken steps by now to increase the food allowances paid to these residential teacher trainees of these national colleges of education from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 5,000. He also said that he has taken steps to offer about 20 new cabs (vehicles) to national colleges of education to solve the existing transport problems of these institutes.

Two interested companies pull out of BIA hotel project
With two international companies pulling out of a proposal to build two Airport Hotels at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Cabinet this week granted approval once again to call for Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the project.
In February 2016, the Board of Directors of Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (AASL) Limited proposed that two Airport Hotels be built to cater to growing passenger demand.
They proposed that AASL land be given to an interested company on a 40 year lease. On May 10, 2016 Cabinet granted approval for the proposal and in October of that year RFPs were published.
Two companies showed interest and applied for the project, they were ECM Libra Financial Group Berhad, Malaysia for the block of land known as 21A and TP Real Estate Holdings Ptd. Ltd, Singapore showed interest in the adjoining block of land, 21B.
The Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) approved the proposals of these two companies in March 2017 and asked that they be awarded the contracts.
Strangely however, the Cabinet paper on the subject informed Cabinet this week that the two international companies have decided to withdraw from the project and forfeit their bond on it.
This has created the need to call for RFPs once again and this time it was suggested that one be made a four star hotel whilst the other a two star- to cater to a wide range of customers.
The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva in his Cabinet paper has also noted that, The proposed airport hotel have a minimum 2 star category and have a minimum of minimum 100 rooms at the commencement with expansion capability with the following: Business Centre/Conference and Convention Facilities, Sports/ Recreation Facility and Outdoor Restaurant/Shopping Arcade and Banking Facilities, etcincluded as options.

UN Volunteers in Sri Lanka celebrate International Volunteer Day 2017
On the 24 and 25 November, the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) in Sri Lanka, celebrated International Volunteer Day 2017 under the theme Volunteers Act First. Here. Everywhere, recognizing volunteers as first responders in times of crises.
The main event took place on the 25th of November, with a tree planting initiative, which saw nearly 5,000 trees planted in ten tanks. Together with UNDP, the UNV and the Government with the support of students from the Wayamba University, V-force volunteers and the local communities totaling to about 600 volunteers, planted Kumbuk (Terminalia Arjuna), Karanda (Pongamia Pinnata) and Mee (Madhuca Longifolia) on the riparian buffers of this cascade of tanks in Galgamuwa.
The tree planting initiative was preceded by an awareness workshop on community disaster response. Being one of the many awareness workshops conducted by the UNV Sri Lanka this year, this particular session held on the 24th of November, was on the disaster profile of the Kurunegala District. The workshop also discussed the role of volunteers in disaster preparedness and response through climate change adaptation.
This initiative comes as part of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded Climate Change Adaptation Project (CCAP), an initiative implemented by the UNDP to restore 10 ancient tanks of Sri Lanka. Kurunegala has been facing drought conditions in the recent past, causing serious effects to the farming community in the region. Hence, the trees planted would not only renovate the Molewa Tank cascade, but would also bring back the natural ecosystem, while being drivers for climate change resilience.
Addressing the gathering Ms. Sureka Perera, Programme Analyst of UNDP Sri Lanka, stated that the UNDP is pleased to support this initiative through the CCAP to support the farming community in the area. We are confident that through the 10 tanks rehabilitated under this Project, coupled with the 5,000 trees planted, we would be able to conserve every drop of water and preserve ecosystems around the tanks.
Ms. Sharmalee Jayasinghe, Programme Associate of UNV Sri Lanka, echoed these sentiments and emphasized the need for continued voluntary commitment and ownership from all present in their shared goals, to achieve sustainable progress.
This initiative is a starting point to encourage more volunteers around Sri Lanka to combat climate change induced crisis with the spirit of volunteerism at their core.

US Federal Reserve raises interest rates again
The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.25%, the third rate rise in 2017.
The US central bank said the move, which was widely expected, underscores solid gains in the US economy. Officials also boosted their economic forecasts, projecting 2.5% growth in GDP in 2017 and 2018, due in part to planned tax cuts.
The Fed said it anticipates three further increases in rates next year, unchanged from its previous forecast. The decision to raise interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing, takes the Fed farther away from the ultra-low rates it put in place during the financial crisis to boost economic activity.
The Fed is targeting a range of 1.25% to 1.5% for its benchmark rate. But a majority of officials said they expect interest rates above 2% will be appropriate next year.

Walt Disney buys Murdoch's Fox for $52bn

Walt Disney has agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business for $52.4bn (39bn), in a deal both companies said position them to compete in the rapidly changing media industry.
The purchase includes Fox's film and television studios, as well as its 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky.
Fox will form a news-focused company with its remaining assets.
The move is a sharp shift for 86-year-old Fox owner Rupert Murdoch after more than half a century of media expansion.
Murdoch turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world's largest news and film empires.
He said the break-up makes sense amid new threats from online advertising and competitors who are streaming entertainment into homes via the internet.
Fox shareholders, who include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the larger Disney.
"With today's announcement, we launch the next great leg of our journey," Rupert Murdoch said on Thursday in a call for investors.
He added later: "Are we retreating Absolutely not."
What is Disney buying
Disney will scoop up Fox's movie and television studios, regional sports network and international holdings, among other investments.
The move adds to Disney's back catalogue high-grossing films such as the original Star Wars movies, the Marvel superhero pictures, Avatar and Deadpool, as well as TV hits such as Modern Family and The Simpsons.
It expands Disney's offerings with the FX and National Geographic cable channels, and Fox's regional sports network in the US.
The purchase also extends Disney's global reach, adding media company Star India and Fox's interests in Sky plc and Tata Sky to its portfolio.
Disney will also get majority control of the video streaming service Hulu, which is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner.
Disney will assume $13.7bn in Fox debt as part of the stock deal, taking the total value of the transaction to more than $66bn.
Why does Disney want them
Disney already owns a vast array of news, film and leisure companies. But the media landscape is changing as technology companies like Amazon and Netflix attract customers to new ways of viewing.
Disney is investing heavily in online streaming platforms, as a way to counter a downturn in its pay-TV business and threats from these new rivals.
The firm believes this deal will give it the scale to compete, and expects to wring "at least" $2bn in cost-savings out of the new company to boot.
David Yelland, former editor of the Murdoch owned Sun newspaper in the UK, told the BBC the transaction puts Disney in pole position to compete with California's tech giants.
"In ten years time there'll be two Chinese giants and four US giants and [of the current entertainment companies] the only one that'll survive will be Disney."
What is Fox keeping
Fox is creating a smaller firm focused on news and major live sports events in the US.
It will hold onto its flagship Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network.
Lachlan Murdoch said: "While the merged business is about scale, the new Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand."
There has been speculation the deal opens the opportunity to reunite Fox with the news businesses which were spun-off in 2013 following a scandal over phone tapping in the UK.
That prompted the creation of a separate news publishing group, News Corp., which owns the Times and the Sun newspapers and remains controlled by the Murdochs.
Rupert Murdoch said the firm hasn't looked at that possibility and any move along those lines is "way ahead" in the future.
As part of the deal Fox shareholders will receive Disney stock, representing about 25% of the enlarged company.

War heros orthopaedic shoes robbed at temple
A pair of orthopaedic shoes belonging to a disabled war hero has been robbed when he visited the Horana Raja Maha Viharaya to pay homage to the Bodhi, recently.
The war hero, named Piyal Jayasinghe, a resident of the Dombagoda War Hero Village, earns a living by driving a three wheeler transporting schoolchildren.
He said he was disabled during the Mullaitivu battle after stepping on a Johnny mine. After retiring from service, he had to wear orthopaedic shoes to overcome his disability.
However, he had bought a three wheeler to earn a living by transporting schoolchildren. When he visited the Horana town, he had made a trip over to the Horana Raja Maha Viharaya to pay homage to the Bodhi there. He had removed his shoes at the entrance and gone into the bodhi premises to pay homage. After returning to board the vehicle, he had found that his shoes are missing.
He is disheartened to think that unscrupulous people did not spare even a disabled war hero in their mad rush to make a fast buck.
