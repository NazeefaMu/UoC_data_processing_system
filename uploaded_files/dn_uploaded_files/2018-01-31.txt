Anuradhapura tank reservations in grip of encroachers
Encroachment on reservations around irrigation tanks in the Anuradhapura District is an ongoing problem. The public say grama niladaries, farmer organizations, divisional secretaries and irrigation authorities are not taking any action in this regard.
Encroachment continues due to the lack of demarcation of tank reservation boundaries and delay in prosecuting the offenders and demolishing unauthorized buildings.
According to information submitted by the Irrigation Department to Anuradhapura government agent and the district agriculture committee, there are around 50 encroachers on the reservation belonging to Nuwarawewa reservoir which is the main drinking water distribution source for Anuradhapura city and suburbs. It is learnt that only three encroachers have been ejected under judicial orders during the last year.
Padaviya tank, which is among the main reservoirs in Anuradhapura District, has a capacity of 85,000 acre feet. According to Irrigation Department sources, the number of encroachers here is 136. At Rajanganaya reservoir site, 19 persons have encroached the reservation that comes under the tank located in Kokmaduwa and Kalaoya areas. In addition, there are a large number of persons who are unlawfully engaging in cultivation on the reservations in Rajanganaya, Thambuttegama, Giribawa and Galgamuwa DS divisions, ignoring the notices to evacuate by Rajanganaya officials.
With regard to Mahakanadarawa tank reservation, there are around 75 encroachers who have been cultivating the reserved landscape causing damage to the irrigational systems of the reservoir. In Huruluwewa tank reservation, encroachers numbering around 84 are engaged in occupying and cultivating land ignoring evacuation notices.
The Anuradhapura District agriculture committee has received complaints that the reservations of Nachchaduwa, Abayawewa and Tissawewa tanks too are gradually being encroached upon.
State officials and farmer organizations have requested the government agent and DAC that in order to avoid delay in prosecuting encroachers, district irrigation authorities be vested with power to taken action against encroachers, instead of the Irrigation Department in Colombo.

Four-year programme to strengthen governance
Australia provides AUD 31 M to Sri Lanka
Australia and Sri Lanka signed a Subsidiary Arrangement for grant assistance to work together on strengthening governance in Sri Lanka through a four-year programme valued at up to AUD31 million (LKR3,850 million).
The Governance for Growth Programme aims to support Sri Lankas efforts to increase economic growth and spread the benefits of that growth to reduce poverty and inequality in the country. The programme will support activities that improve the policy formation and delivery capabilities of government at national, provincial and local levels to bring about inclusive economic growth.
Some of the activities under the programme include a partnership with the World Bank to support the Sri Lankan Governments implementation of national economic reforms, and work with the Asia Foundation to strengthen public sector service delivery at the subnational level, including for women and people with disabilities.
The programme will also provide opportunities for research collaboration and building of institutional linkages to support the quality of Sri Lankas economic decision-making and public service delivery, for example, by funding a national State of the Cities report to support urban planning and development decision-making. The Ministry of Finance and Mass Media will act as the Sri Lankan counterpart of the Governance for Growth programme overall, with a key role in contributing to strategic management of the programme.
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson said, Australia places great importance on these types of arrangements, which sit under our broader Development Cooperation MOU, as a means of ensuring our programmes are aligned fully with Sri Lankas national objectives and reflect a shared vision for development.
Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, signed the Arrangement on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and High Commissioner Hutchesson signed on behalf of the Government of Australia at the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media on January 30.

Call for radical change of LGs
Local Government (LG) institutions in the country should undergo radical changes to convert them to efficient, effective and productive units aiming to cater to the needs of the people, Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya said.
He said unlike Sri Lanka, well-organised productive LG institutions are seen in most developed countries.
He was addressing a public discussion held under the theme Purawesi Sabhawa at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre yesterday.
The gathering raised questions to five candidates, who are to contest for Mayorship of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at the forthcoming LG polls representing five political parties of the mainstream.
Speaking on the CMC, Prof. Wijesooriya said the Colombo city should be converted to a developed city with a vision and an action plan. When reaching this goal, attention should be drawn on many other sectors including health, education, hygiene, environmental and so on. Besides, it is important to wipe out drug menace, he said.
He said it is reported that the CMC has become more corrupt as stakeholders have to bribe to get things done. Moreover, issues related to health, education and hygiene etc. should be addressed. Then persons, who are elected to the CMC, should pay attention to these issues and convert the CMC to a people-friendly institute.
It is important to address the issue of street children and drug menace, while increasing the living standard of the Colombo people.
When asked whether the Mayoral candidates have productive solutions for garbage management, which has become a huge burden, all candidates said they have a proper mechanism relating to garbage management. The candidates claimed they and their political party have good solutions for issues relating to health, education, infrastructure, garbage management and more.

Colombo will be cleanest city within next five years: Champika
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka vowed to transform Colombo into the cleanest city with no flooding within the next five years.
Participating in the commencement of construction of the Sebastian Northern Canal rain water pumping station and annicut yesterday, he said the Colombo city would submerge with drainage and rain water. He said people have made the Kelaniya River their toilet instead of using it for economic progress.
The Minister said that in the past much was spoken about beautifying Colombo and the managing garbage, planting trees and flowers. We take great pains to keep our homes clean and beautiful.
Yet, most of us pay less attention to keep our toilets and kitchens clean. We do the same for the the Colombo city. No matter how many beautiful buildings are built, Colombos toilets and kitchens are still pathetic, he said.
The Minister noted that a major issue is floods. Even developed cities in Europe face the same issue. He said the main reason for flooding is the obstruction of canals and water drainage being hampered due to haphazard building constructions and man-made problems. In addition, other environmental factors are there beyond our control. He said Colombos underground pipeline network is around 150 years old and so is the drainage system,
"If these were not secured, we would have to face a major catastrophe. Our pipeline network is around 960 km. Of the water that enters this network, around 40 percent is wasted due to dilapidated condition of the pipelines. The lack of maintenance and improper management have made the drainage and rain water lines identical. This has put the Beira Lake area in jeopardy.
"If we are to maintain the drainage system properly, we must launch a systematic drainage system and find a proper way to discharge the rain water. Simply growing trees and beautifying the city will not suffice, Minister Ranawaka said.

Speaking at the event Minister Faiszer Musthapha stated that this was a step towards eliminating corruption and malpractices within Local Authorities. He mentioned that while ministers exercise their executive authority through the Secretary of the Ministry and while the President exercises his authority through his Secretary, it is finally the Chairman or the Mayor of the Local Government Authority that has to directly carry out this authority and therefore, the Political Authority has to limit itself to Policy decisions. The Minister believes that after the new political authority is elected to office, proper decisions would be taken without giving into bureaucracy.
The Minster commended Harin Fernando and the ICTA for their role in project.

EC requests postponing of TU activities for smooth electoral process
The Election Commission (EC) has requested that all trade unions (TUs) to put off trade union activities until February 15, to ensure that the election is carried out without disruption.
Issuing a statement to the media, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said a breakdown in services attached to the electoral process would negatively affect the peoples franchise.
Government officials who are directly involved in election activities such as government officers, principals, teachers, professionals, Government Printers, postal services, railway services, electricity providers, water board, petroleum, banking services, health services, telephone services, SLTB and other public transport services are required to carry out a successful election, he further said and added that it was also important that other services in the private and public sectors be carried out without any interruption. The Election Commission accepted that the trade unions, in these services, had the legal right to protest to win their demands from the government or any authority, but pointed out that the right of the citizenry to choose its leaders through a free and fair election, was a fundamental aspect of democracy. Hence, they requested the assistance of all parties to ensure that the electoral process functions smoothly.

eLocal Government Solution launched
The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka together with Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry ceremoniously unveiled the eLocal Government Solution (eLG) on January 29.
The system is expected to get onboard 30 local authorities at the time of unveiling and will progress towards including all 341 local authorities in the future.
Heralded as a progressive move towards the promotion of digital nativity in the government through the facilitation of digital access to public services, the solution aims to assist the public in setting their assessment taxes, obtaining certificates (business and trade related) and permits (construction and other) as a first step. The highly scalable solution is further expected to introduce other avenues of public service access to citizens introducing unmatched convenience and efficiency to the largely archaic present mechanisms.
The launch of the eLocal Government Solution was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) with the participation of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando and ICTA Chairperson Chithranganie Mubarak and other officials representing those institutions.
We have always shown great interest in the development of this solution to establish an environment that is more citizen-friendly, hassle-free and transparent for citizens when dealing with Pradeshiya Sabhas, Urban and Municipal Councils. Naturally, these benefits must be achieved by enhancing the processes in place and introducing aspects such as cashless transactions.
The eLG solution and the intervention of ICTA and the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry are both timely and opportune in this regard, stated Minister Faizer Mustapha.
The Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry takes it upon itself to be vigilant with regards to opportunities that present itself for the creation of a fully-fledged digital economy in line with the governments initiative in this direction. The partnership with the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry is a prime example of this digital readiness of our Ministry.
We are optimistic regarding the ability of this project and other similar projects to overcome technological barriers and transform the citizen experience for all Sri Lankans, said Minister Harin Fernando.
Similar deployment of digital platforms is common in the commercial landscape of the modern world and as of recent years has been ubiquitous in the region and in Sri Lanka with many industries yielding to the enhanced user convenience and experience of digitization.
Governments of the developed world too have long since recognized the importance of leveraging digital technologies to ease the experience of their citizens.
It is in this context that ICTA and the local authorities are pursuing solutions such as the eLG solution to keep pace with the global progression towards a digitized reality dubbed the new normal.
The initiative is a timely one at a time when the countrys digital adoption is growing rapidly.
Our responsibility as the premier institution for Information and Communication Technology in the country has been to ensure that access to digital services and infrastructure is made available to the masses and not restricted to the urban areas and demographics.
We remain committed to our vision of bringing solutions like this to the grassroots levels of society and the local governments is the best place to start in our view.
We are confident the new solution will not only enhance the user experience but also spearhead the digital revolution taking place in Sri Lanka currently, said ICTA Chairperson Chithranganie Mubarak.
ICTA is the apex ICT institution of the government and has been mandated to take all necessary measures to implement the government's policy and action plan in relation to ICT by the Information and Communication Technology Act No.27 of 2003. The ICTA is a wholly owned institution by the government overseen by the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry.

Investigations reveal
Funds spent for Rajapaksa memorial not indicated in annual reports
Investigations have revealed that the funds spent for the construction of the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial and Museum by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLRDC) was not indicated in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 annual reports of the Rajapaksa Memorial, Educational, Cultural and Social Services Foundation as current liabilities.
This was revealed in the evidence of the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Deputy General Manager (Finance) J.A. Pushpakumara, based on the advice of the Attorney General on whether the funds spent on the construction of the D.A.Rajapaksa Memorial and Museum was indicated in the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation annual reports of 2013, 2014 and 2015.
The reason that the funds spent were not indicated in the records was that according to the Board Paper No. HSD-3714 submitted by the then Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Chairman Harshan de Silva, to the Board of Directors dated February 21, 2014, the Board of Directors had agreed to recover the funds spent on the construction of the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial and Museum through staging of musical shows and other events, it was revealed.
Hence, based on that decision, no specific person or organisation was named for the recovery of the funds spent, and according to the annual reports of 2014 and 2015 of the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation it is indicated as sales expenditure and not indicated as a sum owed to the company, Pushpakumaras statement revealed.
It was also revealed that the said Board Paper had been approved by the then Board of Directors of the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and its former Chairman Liyana Arachchige Prasad Harshan de Silva, Gamaethiralalage Badra Undulawathie Kamaladasa, Sudammika Kevinda Attigala, Saman Kumara Abraham Galapatti and Murukku Devage Mahinda Saliya.
Meanwhile, at the time the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation was under the Urban Development Authority and prior to implementation of decisions taken by the director board, it was required to obtain the approval of the Defence Secretary. Accordingly, as per the order of Circular No. MOD/SEC/PA/01/[115], a concise report of the decision taken by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation board of directors of board paper no. HSD-3714, was handed over to the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
His signature on the said document is proof that he had seen the concise report and had deliberately granted approval knowing very well that it was a construction based on his familys private needs.
However, although it was determined to recover the monies spent on the D.A. Rajapaksa memorial by staging fund raising events, there was no proper plan or mechanism for the recovery of these funds.
On August 04, 2015 subsequent to a request made by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation General Manager Mallika Senadgeera, a part payment of Rs. 25 million was paid, it was revealed. But by that time the FCID had already commenced investigations and initiated legal action.
It was also revealed that the Rajapaksa Memorial, Educational, Cultural and Social Services Foundation which was established under Parliament Act No.23 of 1998 with the intention of carrying out social service activities.
Its Chairman was MP Chamal Rajapaksa, Deputy Chairmen former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and D.E.W. Gunasekara, Secretary Uthpalawarna Wijesinghe, Treasurer Lalith Chandradasa and other members were Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and several others. Although it was investigated as to whether the Rajapakse Memorial, Educational, Cultural and Social Services Foundation had entered into an agreement with the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, no information was found regarding such an agreement.
Meanwhile, although it is required that this foundation carries out an audit annually, no such audit was carried out. Therefore, the FCID has also commenced an investigation on how the Rajapaksa Memorial, Educational, Cultural and Social Services Foundation had earned money.

Glee actor Mark Salling, 35, found dead

US actor Mark Salling, known for his role in the TV series Glee, has been found dead near his Los Angeles home, his lawyer confirmed.
US media reports suggest he may have taken his own life.
The 35-year-old was expected to get between four and seven years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing child sex abuse images. His sentencing was due on 7 March.
Salling played footballer Noah "Puck" Puckerman on Glee from 2009 to 2015.
He entered into a plea deal last October, avoiding a lengthier prison sentence of up to 20 years.
He was arrested in 2015 after a tip-off that he was in possession of images of children being sexually abused.
Investigators ultimately found tens of thousands of abuse images on his laptop and hard drive.
Photographs in US media suggest the former television star's body was found in woodland near to where he lived in Sunland, Los Angeles.
Salling's lawyer, Michael J Proctor, said in a statement: "I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning. Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgement.
"He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected."
His former co-stars have reacted to the news of his death.
Matthew Morrison, who played singing teacher Mr Shuester in the show, posted a photograph of the pair alongside actor Cory Monteith, who died in 2013 died from an overdose, with two angel motifs.
Actor Jane Lynch told celebrity news website TMZ that his death was "sad and very tragic", and said she would remember him his early days on the show.

Government failed to abolish PTA: HRW
The Sri Lankan government has failed to fulfill its pledge to abolish the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report released on Monday.
For decades, the PTA has been used to arbitrarily detain suspects for months and often years without charge or trial, facilitating torture, and other abuse, it claimed.
The Sri Lankan government has been all talk and no action on repealing the reviled PTA, said Brad Adams, Asia Director. Replacing this draconian counterterrorism law with one that meets international standards should be an urgent priority if the government is serious about protecting human rights.
The 46-page report, Locked Up Without Evidence: Abuses under Sri Lankas Prevention of Terrorism Act, documents previous and ongoing abuses committed under the PTA, including torture and sexual abuse, forced confessions, and systematic denials of due process.
Drawing on interviews with former detainees, family members, and lawyers working on PTA cases, Human Rights Watch says it found that the PTA is a significant contributing factor toward the persistence of torture in Sri Lanka. The 17 accounts documented in the report represent only a tiny fraction of PTA cases overall. But they underscore the laws draconian nature and abusive implementation.
The PTA was enacted in 1979 to counter separatist insurgencies, notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the law was widely used to detain hundreds of people during the countrys 26-year-long war. Yet while other emergency regulations have lapsed since the conflict ended in May 2009, the PTA remains in effect, the report said.
The Sri Lankan government arrested at least 11 people under the PTA in 2016 for alleged terrorist activities. The PTA permits arrests without warrant for unspecified unlawful activities, and permits detention for up to 18 months without producing the suspect before a court.
Human Rights Watch said it has received several reports of people detained for a decade or more without access to legal recourse, who were subsequently acquitted or released without charge, yet received no compensation, reparations, or apologies from the government.

Met. Dept. warns of heavy rains in Central, North Central Eastern and Uva provinces
The Meteorology Department has predicted heavy showers up to 150mm today (31) in the Central, North Central, Eastern and Uva provinces.
This will be a good sign for areas affected by drought, said Meteorology Department, Director Forecaster, Anusha Warnasooriya, addressing a media briefing at the Ministry of Disaster Management yesterday.
The Disaster Management Centre issuing a warning yesterday, advised public living close to reservoirs to be vigilant, especially surrounding Rantambe, as the possibility of opening the spill gates was high given the increasing intensity of rain.
Warnasooriya explained that the rains were a result of a low level atmospheric disturbance near the island leading to areas such as Kuruduoya and Kandaketiya receiving rains above average.
On Monday, over 100mm of rain was reported from these areas in the Central Province, added Warnasooriya.
The Department had also forecasted rains over 150mm to fall in areas such as Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Ampara and areas in the Central (Nuwara Eliya and Matale) and Uva Provinces.
Areas in Sabaragamuwa, Hambantota, Southern and Western Provinces may experience rain in the evenings, she further said.
By February 1 to 2, there would be a temporary cease of rains, but would continue after February 3 or 4, said Warnasooriya.
The Director Forecaster also noted that there was a risk of flash floods occurring in many parts of the dry areas depending on the intensity of rain.
The National Building and Research Organization (NBRO), Landslide Units, Senior Geologist, Dr Gamini Jayatissa addressing the media said the areas such as Hambantota, Nuwara Eliya, Matale and Badulla were at risk of experiencing landslides as they would receive rains over 100mm.
He said they had fixed 100 automated rain gauges in these high risk areas to measure the intensity of the rain and would issue warnings accordingly. People living in these areas have been asked to be vigilant of possible landslides during the next few days.

MR incapable of developing villages: Minister Gamage
Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is currently seeking a mandate for the SLPP to rebuild villages, people should ask him what he had done for the village sector during his 10-year tenure of office, when he comes seeking their votes, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
Addressing a series of UNP local government election rallies at Mahaoya in Ampara, Minister Gamage said during the Rajapaksa regime, edifices such as an airport, harbour, and an international conference hall had been built in Hambantota with an eye on commissions, which had turned to be white elephants increasing the countrys debt burden. As such, Rajapaksa would be incapable of developing villages, even if he was entrusted with power again.
He said the oppression caused during the Rajapaksa regime by attacks on Chilaw fishermen and Rathupaswala residents who held peaceful demonstrations, seeking solutions to their urgent problems, were fresh in peoples minds.
The Yahapalana government had already rendered a great service towards the development of villages, even without any power in the local government institutions. The people, therefore, should return power to the UNP at the local government institutions to ensure better service to the rural sector, the minister said.

NF, 13 other political parties support President
The National Front (NF), along with another 13 political parties, decided to support President Maithripala Sirisena after leaving the former President's camp, NF Leader Ranjith Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Centre of Society and Religion (CSR) in Colombo, yesterday, he said they decided to support the President's national agenda due to several reasons.
"Other countries that gain independence alongside Sri Lanka had progressed and achieved developed status. But after 70 years of independence, Sri Lanka is still struggling to achieve development. Sri Lanka never had a national agenda; we never had unity among us. But now, President Maithripala Sirisena has given Sri Lanka a national agenda. He is a selfless leader who does not have ulterior motives. He has decades of experiences in politics; some development projects given to the country by him such as Moragahakanda will offer many benefits to the people for another several thousands of years. This Good Governance government did a lot for the country. It increased public servants' salaries by Rs. 10,000 and also reduced the prices of gas and fuel. Therefore, this golden opportunity should not be wasted," he said.
The previous President, during his regime, thought only about himself and his family. He never paid attention towards the welfare of the people. State-sponsored terrorism was present during his time and a lot of journalists and others disappeared. He a left Rs. 9,000-billion debt for us to pay. Rajapaksa should retire now without making trouble for current leaders. He sold priceless lands to foreign countries, he said.
All who rally around the former President only aim to snatch more money. We left him because he did not want to get rid of Basil Rajapaksa, he added.

One family with no political aim for the nation, vision for the future of the country, or policy is trying to establish a party and form a government once again, but the people will not let this happen this time around, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing an election meeting held at the Davindra Mendis Sports Stadium in Katunayake.
"On January 8 2015, the government at the time was rejected because of corruption, fraud, and nepotism, said the President adding that there was no room for nepotism and authoritarianism to be established once again in the country.
He recalled that whilst the government had a Cabinet, from late 2013 onwards, every Wednesday, the Rajapaksa family would come together to decide government policy, economy, management and appointments for senior government posts.
The President also stressed that he would ensure that no persons from this government or the previous would be allowed to escape the law when it came to illegal issuance of bonds which had been taking place since 2008.

North Korea to parade dozens of long-range missiles before Winter Olympics

North Korea is planning to show off dozens of long-range missiles at a February 8 parade, the day before the Winter Olympics is set to begin in South Korea, two diplomatic sources with deep knowledge of North Korea's intentions told CNN Wednesday.
Thedisplayof "hundreds" of missiles and rockets would be an attempt "to scare the hell out of the Americans," one of the sources said.
The parade is expected to include dozens of intercontinental-range Hwasong-15 missiles, which the North Koreanstest-fired for the first time in late November,the sources said.
They also didn't rule out a missile test "in the near future" to send a strong message to American forces currently deployed in the region.
The news comes after US President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union speech, during which he criticized the Kim Jong Un regime's human rights abuses and "reckless pursuit" of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that could soon threaten the US homeland.
In his address, Trumphighlighted personal storiesof victims of the Kim regime, inviting as guests North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho and the parents of Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after returning from North Korea where he spent 17 months in captivity.
Winter Olympics woes
The inter-Korean talks which led to the North's decisionto participate in the Winter OIympics had been hailed as a breakthrough that could ease escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, the process has not been smooth.
On Monday, North Korea said it canceled a joint cultural performance that was to be held in advance of the Olympics in response to unflattering coverage by South Korean media.
According to a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry, the North Koreans pulled out because "South Korean media continue to insult North Korea's genuine measures regarding the PyeongChang Olympics and take issues with its domestic festival."
The sources that spoke to CNN said that other planned events could be canceled.
Cracks
Chad O'Carroll, managing director of the Korea Risk Group in Seoul, said the planned military parade could undermine Washington's support of dialogue between the two Koreas.
"The ongoing US support for inter-Korean rapprochement already appears to be showing cracks and will likely be seriously tested in the event of a major DPRK ICBM parade on the eve of the Olympics," he said.
Foreign media will be banned from covering the upcoming military parade, the sources said.
This is a dramatic change from last year, when many global news organizations were invited to cover amilitary parade in Aprilthat sawPyongyang unveil new long-range missiles.
A diplomatic source said this was due to the sensitivity of the weapons that will be on display, and to avoid questions about the deploy ability of the missiles. By banning foreign press, North Korea controls all of the imagery the world sees.
North Korean state media in recent days has been increasing its anti-US rhetoric, warning of grave consequences if postponed joint military exercises resume after the Olympics.
Policy divisions
Earlier Tuesday, sources told CNN that theTrump administration had decided not to nominate Victor Cha,its widely rumored selection as US ambassador to South Korea, apparently because of a difference over Korea policy, specifically over its consideration of a pre-emptive strike.
Cha, a widely respected former academic and former Bush administration official, said in a Washington Post op-ed Monday that the answer to the "real and unprecedented threats" North Korea presents is not, "as some Trump administration officials have suggested, a preventive military strike."
Instead, Cha laid out what he called "a forceful military option available that can address the threat without escalating into a war that would likely kill tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Americans."

Accordingly, as Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva further suggested, vehicles who have failed to obtain revenue license for the past five years will be considered condemned.
However, the Cabinet agreed to retain documents of vehicles which are subjected to legal proceedings.
Furthermore the Minister pointed out that construction of a new building to store documents is underway but the maximum number of documents which could be contained in it is only 3.5 million.
Minister de Silva cited that the increase of vehicle imports to Sri Lanka is the reason for the over piling of vehicle documents.

Oppositions claim of 4,000 acres a lie - Minister
The Opposition claim that 4,000 acres of land has been acquired by the government for the proposed technological city in Homgama is a downright lie aimed to drive fear into the minds of people and mislead them, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said there are no plans whatsoever to acquire land belonging to the people in the area for the proposed development project.
Addressing a janahamuwa at Weralupagoda, Homagama, Minister Ranawaka said the 92-acre Mahalenwatta has been acquired to build a technological city. It will have a nano technology institute, a green university and NDT Faculty. Further, the Universities of Colombo, Sri Jayewardenapura and Moratuwa will each have a faculty here.
He said this government has not acquired any land belonging to the people. Steps were underway to make compensation payment to owners of lands acquired by the previsions regime. He said an access road had to be built to Mahena Estate from Hoamagama. Building of this road would commence this year.
Minister Ranawaka said that the university would brighten the region and boost economic activity. When students came to live here, there would be a big demand for food, lodging and other services.
The people residing in surrounding areas would be able to earn an extra income.
The Minister said in addition to these lands, 800 arces had been acquired from Millewa estate. Four other large estates to be taken over had been identified and discussion were on with their owners to buy 246 acres to facilitate extension to the technological city. He had also advised divisional secretaries to contact him whenever problems relating to land had arisen.
He cautioned people not to be deceived by false propaganda spread by opponents. The government on its part would never oppress the innocent masses. Everything regarding the proposed technological city would be done in consultation with the people in the area.

A total of 1,807 leprosy patients had been detected from Sri Lanka last year. Out of this, 754 or 42 percent of patients are from the Western Province, Anti-Leprosy Campaign Director Dr. Palitha Karunaperuma said.

In 2016, a total of 1,973 leprosy patients were detected from Sri Lanka and in 2015 a total of 2,098 leprosy patients were detected.
The highest number of leprosy patients which was 243, were detected last year from the Colombo district. Child cases were high in districts such as Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara. Patients are reported from the 25 districts in the country.
Around 2,000 new leprosy patients are being detected every year for the past decade.
Nearly 31 percent of new patients were diagnosed late, more than six months after the appearance of symptoms indicating the lack of awareness among the public, he said.
There are no leprosy patients in hospitals in Sri Lanka now and leprosy was eliminated from the country in 1995.
There are a few completely cured patients still in hospitals as hospital authorities are unable to contact their families or guardians, he added.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe arrived at this decision after considering the views of Party Leaders and the Election Commission.
The Prime Minister has officially made a request to convene a special sitting of Parliament on February 6 from the Speaker as per the Standing Orders.
The Party Leaders Meeting convened by the Speaker ended inconclusively in Parliament yesterday as they could not reach an agreement as to whether the debate be held prior or after the elections.
The Speaker had then informed them that a final decision would be taken after speaking to the Prime Minister.
During the meeting, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya had proposed the Party Leaders to conduct the debate on February 5 and 6.
Deshapriya had pointed out that the Parliamentary debate if conducted on February 8 would be unfair to the parties not representing Parliament.
The Election Commission has also handed over a letter with their suggestions and concerns to the Party Leaders.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath told the Daily News that the JVP and the Joint Opposition requested the debate be taken before February 8 to avoid any disturbance to the silence period before the elections.
However, the party seniors representing the UNP were adamant that the debate could not be facilitated earlier than February 8.
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, who took part in the Party Leaders Meeting representing the SLFP, told the journalists at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday that the SLFP stand by the position taken by President Maithripala Sirisena that the debate should take place prior to the elections.
He said two days are necessary for the debate as many Parliamentarians are looking forward to take the floor and voice their concerns.
We hope to conduct this debate without violating the election laws. The President, when he requested to take up the debate prior to the Elections, was taking the peoples side, he added.
The minister said the SLFP was of the view that the request by Deshapriya was fair and reasonable. He said the TNA was also in favour of taking up the debate prior to the elections.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Mahinda Samarasinghe, MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Ravi Karunanayake, Vijitha Herath and M.A.Sumanthiran took part in the Party Leaders Meeting.

President attempting to mislead people from voting for SLPP:GL
The President is trying to intimidate and mislead the people and is also trying to stop people from voting for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), said Chairman of the SLPP, Prof G.L. Peiris yesterday.
He said so while addressing a media briefing held by the Joint Opposition (JO), Economic Investigation Unit at the Vajirashramaya Temple in Punchi Borella.
The President is trying to mislead the people by saying that he would not release funds to develop local governments controlled by the SLPP. This is not his personal fund. This money is collected through taxation of all Sri Lankans, while the Treasury releases these monies for the benefit of the people. We have a justice system in this country, the Joint Opposition will not allow the rights of the people to be thus violated, he further said.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena also addressing the media said the countrys people were ready to vote en masse for the SLPP to prevent former President Mahinda Rajapaksas civic rights being revoked.
If Prabhakaran who fought a war for 30 years was unable to kill Mahinda Rajapaksa and since they could not harm him physically, the next best thing to remove him was to remove his civic rights, he added.
The MP who attacked the government on various fronts, also touched on the bond issue and said that though the government would wish to say that there was illegal issue of bonds since Mahinda Rajapaksas time and presently due to the bond issue, Sri Lankas bond in the international market was known as black bonds.
The government will feel the real impact of this after the election. When the government needs to issue bonds to raise funds and when they find that there were no takers for their bonds and they were no longer able to carry on. Then they would have no option but to impose heavy taxes on every consumer item. By the end of this local government election, the people would have to face a future heavy with taxes, Gunawardena said.

President Sirisena will never sweep PRECIFAC Report under carpet: Minister Samarasinghe
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna supporters are not extending their support to President Maithripala Sirisena as he would never sweep the PRECIFAC Report under the rug, said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
Minister Samarasinghe was referring to a speech delivered by President Sirisena at a rally held in Ratnapura recently, where he said that he was ready to form a SLFP government if all 96 SLFP members stood with him as one party.
Samarasinghe made this observation at a media brief held at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
While pointing out that several MPs supporting the SLPP had their names in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) Report, Minister Samarasinghe expressed his confidence that President Sirisena would never go easy on corrupt politicians whether he received their support or not. He observed that not all SLPP supporters are corrupt politicians, but only several of them.
SLFP MPs supporting the SLPP are trying to dodge President Sirisenas invitation by saying that it is only a sweetener for the election, but in truth, they are not supporting President because he would never cut any slack for MPs involved in corruption, Minister Samarasinghe pointed out.
President Sirisena would never fix deals with corrupt politicians to win them over, Minister Samarasinghe further said.
He also pointed out that President Sirisena had practically proven that he would take action against corrupt politicians, disregarding their political affiliations.
If you look at the case of the Uva Province Chief Minister, President Sirisena made sure that a proper investigation be conducted on the matter. The President also appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate into the Treasury bond issue to make sure justice was meted out, Minister Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe requested grass root level politicians to get together and strive for a United Peoples Freedom Alliance Government, even though some politicians prefer otherwise.
Questioned on matters raised on former President Mahinda Rajapaksas civic rights, Minister Samarasinghe said the PRECIFAC Report included a recommendation to strip off the civic rights of public representatives if they were to serve a jail period more than six months. Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that the former President has not yet been found guilty on any such matter. He also said that legal advice had been sought out from the Attorney Generals Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption on the matter of Rs.115 million loss suffered by the State-owned Television Station ITN for telecasting the then President Mahinda Rajapaksas advertisements, which had not been paid for.

Water Board employees stage strike demanding wage hike
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Employees Union staged a token strike yesterday from 9.00 am to 1.00 pm at the Golumadama junction in Ratmalana, based on several demands including a wage hike.
Speaking to the Daily News, Union Convener Engineer Upali Ratnayake said the workers had no other option but to take such action, as the authorities had failed to listen to their grievances and provide an acceptable solution.
During the past, we made every effort to resolve the issues without staging a strike that would invariably affect the general public. However, the relevant minister did not even intervene and try to resolve this issue. Hence, we had no other choice but to resort to this course of action. However, taking into consideration the inconvenience caused to the public, we have decided to continue all emergency services, he said.
He noted that they had no option but to engage in the strike, despite the appeal made by the elections commissioner to refrain from staging any protests during the election period. Had the responsible authorities intervened and resolved our issues, or even tried to provide some relief, we would not have taken this action, Ratnayake added.
He urged the relevant authorities and the minister to stop their high-handed approach and look into the issues faced by the NWSDB employees and take appropriate measures to resolve their issues.
He added that a meeting was scheduled to take place last evening around 6.00 with the Ministry Secretary, expressing hope that it would prove fruitful.
However, Ratnayake warned that if a favourable response is not received from the authorities, the NWSDB employees and the unions would launch an island-wide strike on February 2.
Meanwhile, the Daily News spoke to City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary Wasantha Hapuarachchi, who said the workers are demanding a 25-percent pay hike, which the National Water Supply and Drainage Board are not in a position to grant. However, he said that he would make all efforts to discuss the issue with the unions and come to a satisfactory settlement.

Will cater to 6.2 mn people who gave a mandate to the Yahapalana Govt. - Kabir
UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim, issuing a press statement yesterday, reiterated that those in the ruling coalition must cater to the aspirations of 6.2 million people who had given a mandate to the Yahapalana Government in 2015.
He pointed out that it was a betrayal to turn your back on the mandate given by the people to the Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and empower the aspirations of defeated political elements.
He noted that the peoples mandate was to restore the supremacy of law by putting an end to the authoritarian rule which prevailed under the Rajapaksa regime.
He said taking steps for national reconciliation was another task the people entrusted on this Government as the country had been plagued with racial and religious extremism.
Rebuilding the economy was another key aspiration of the people, he said.
The Yahapalana Government even amidst various challenges has been able to take many progressive steps in the last three years to realise the aspirations of the people. The passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is one such giant step. The basic steps to formulate a new Constitution have also been taken. To empower the democratic governance, we have guaranteed the independence and freedom of judiciary, he recalled.
He pointed out anti-government elements, who do not wish to see political stability under the Yahapalana Government, attempt to topple it and bring back the old authoritarian rule.
Old weapons such as racism, religious disharmony, western conspiracies and secret projects of NGOs etc are being used for the purpose. They must realise that such attempts are futile. The path for development of village and town is now open. We have laid the foundation to realize the vision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for a strong Sri Lanka. We need your support to finish the remaining work and you can do so by empowering the UNP more and more, Minister Hashim added.
