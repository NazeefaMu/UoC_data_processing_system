Key institutions stripped off from Cultural Affairs Ministry
The Cultural Affairs Ministry has been stripped of key institutions that have direct links to culture and arts, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
The MP pointing out that the Sri Lanka Arts Council, Central Cultural Fund, Department of Archaeology, Tower Hall Foundation and Galle Heritage Foundation had been removed from the Cultural Affairs Ministry.
He noted these institutions that had a direct link to culture and arts, should be brought under one umbrella. He also questioned the rationale behind putting together the Immigration and Emigration Department, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry, under the purview one ministry. Setting up Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry is like mixing cement, papaya and Fanta to produce a salad. All the important organs of the Cultural Affairs Ministry have been stripped off and distributed among other ministries, he said.
MP Dissanayake was moving an Adjournment Motion on problems prevailing in the field of culture and arts. A group of about 25 prominent artists were present at the Public Gallery when the MP was moving the motion. However, the number of MPs who remained in the Chamber at that time was less than 15.
The MP reminding the pre-election promises of the Government said the Agreement signed between the Common Candidate and Civil Society Organizations mentioned that the field of arts and culture would be revitalized and would be made a focal point in the development. You not only promised to recognize its national role, but also to increase the allocations made to the sector by the annual budget he commented.
MP Dissanayake urged for State intervention to revive the field of culture and arts. Do not undermine the importance of this field. It is essential for the spiritual development of a society. Today all artistic forms, including film and drama, have faced serious problems. There is no proper theatre in Colombo to show a drama. Lumbini, Elphinstone and John de Silva theatres are under renovation. I propose to the Government to make a special allocation in the next budget to construct good quality theatres in outstation areas, he said.
The MP also proposed to categorize tele dramas and introduce a standard rate to them. This is a request from the the artists themselves. Then they would not have to go behind television channels and politicians. There is no regulating board for teledramas and such an organ is a necessity, he said.

Budget has allocated Rs. 11,000 Mn for arts and culture: Minister Nawinna
Aesthetic entertainment is not the only benefit of promoting culture and art, while it could also be used to change the socio - economic environment of the country, said Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Nawinna.
He said the Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry had already paid attention to promote the income generating side of culture and arts.
He made these observations by replying to a speech during the debate on the Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
No body could say the government has not done anything for the development of Culture and Art. But we accept the governments contribution for the development of Art and Culture which is not sufficient to address all issues prevailing in the industry. the Minister said.
He said the budget had allocated Rs. 11,000 million for this purpose for the year 2016. The Ministry has taken measures to establish regional art councils in 300 divisional secretariats and also to establish district art councils in all 25 districts.
The Minister said measures have also been taken to promote our culture via 185 cultural centres situated in all parts of the country.
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry also hold national ceremonies to appreciate the creations of the artistes.
COPE to present final report on investigations to House on Oct. 13
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), concluded its investigations pertaining to the Central Bank Treasury Bonds controversy yesterday.
COPE sources said the members of the Committee were divided at the end investigations on various issues. They said there might be two reports on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigations due to divided opinions.
The COPE is to present its final report on investigations to Parliament on October 13. COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti yesterday, instructed to send the report to print. The COPE had summoned incumbent Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday, when it met at the Parliamentary Complex presided by its Chairman, Sunil Handunnetti.
According to COPE sources, Coomaraswamy had been in session only for about 10 minutes. When he was taken, only UNP member Dr Harsha de Silva asked a couple of questions. He was permitted to leave as others had no questions, sources said.
There had been disagreement between the UNP members and the rest of the members over questioning the Governor. UNP MP Ajith P Pereras proposal was to obtain responses from Coomaraswamy under oath. The others opposed to it, stating there was no need for compelling a person of Coomaraswamys calibre to do so as, he was well aware of his responsibilities and what he would tell. The UNP MPs backed the proposal of their colleague. However, the proposal was dropped at the end, as the majority opposed it sources explained.
Sources said the differences of opinion may lead to the UNP MPs to compile a separate report on the investigations. There are provisions to present an alternative report if not agreeable with the committees final report. Then the public would have to decide which version would be more accurate, sources said.
Social changes would protect culture and art: Media Deputy Minister

He made this observation by joining the Adjournment Motion debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said that it was necessary to have a proper plan to protect Art and Culture. The government could not interfere with internal matters of the Arts industry. But government was in the process of taking various policy decisions with regard to the development of the Arts and Cultural Industry.
The Deputy Minister also said the creation of an anti art factor had become the main reason for the crisis situation currently prevailing in the Art industry. Television channels have become the representatives of anti art by completely forgetting to fulfill their responsibility as the main caretaker of art.
We hope to gather all these television channels on a common platform with the intention of preparing common standards to all of them. We are also planning to form a Democratic Mass Media Regulatory Commission, said the Deputy Minister.
