Darrell Hair, cricket umpire who called Murali for chucking, guilty of stealing from employer

Former Test cricket umpire Darrell Hair has been handed an 18-month good behaviour bond by an Australian court after pleading guilty to charges of embezzling and stealing money from a liquor store where he worked, local media reported on Tuesday.
The 65-year-old, who famously no-balled Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing in a 1995 Test, avoided a conviction after paying back the A$9,005.75 ($7,034.39) and writing letters of apology to his employers.
Hair, who stood in 78 Tests from 1992 to 2008, said in a written submission to Orange Local Court that he had been struggling with gambling addiction, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
As well as the Muralitharan row, Hair was one of the umpires who sanctioned Pakistan for ball tampering in the fourth test against England at the Oval in 2006, leading to the tourists refusing to play and the match being awarded to the hosts.
Hair was removed from the Test panel in the wake of the incident but restored two years later after dropping a racial discrimination suit against the International Cricket Council.

Dottin ton, Matthews four lead Windis series sweep
Deandra Dottins second T20I century - the most by an womens cricketer in the format - and a four-for from allrounder Hayley Matthews helped West Indies women complete a 3-0 series sweep over Sri Lanka women, with a 31-run victory in the third T20I in Antigua on Sunday.
En route to her 67-ball 112 - the same score as her maiden hundred in 2010 - Dottin clobbered nine fours and five sixes, taking 18 runs off Chamari Atapattu in the 16th over.
Following an early wicket, Dottin and opener Matthews added 121 runs for the second wicket, with Matthews contributing a 40-ball 34. Having taken West Indies past 150, Dottin fell with two balls left in the innings, but West Indies lost wickets off both those deliveries and closed their innings at 159 for 6.
Sri Lankas pursuit was wobbly as Matthews struck twice in the fourth over to dismiss Yasoda Mendis and Chamari Atapattu with the score on 14. With the side tottering at 42 for 3 in the ninth over, Shashikala Siriwardene and wicketkeeper-batsman Rebeca Vandort steadied the innings with a partnership of 84 runs.
The duo struck identical scores of 50 each, before Matthews dealt another double-strike in the 20th over to consign the opposition to their sixth straight defeat on the tour.
Offspin accounted for all five Sri Lanka wickets, with Matthews taking 4 for 18 and Stafanie Taylor taking one wicket. Shakera Selman, who had suffered an injury while fielding in the second T20I on Saturday, did not play this game and was replaced by Shamilia Connell.
Dottin finished the series with a tally of 154 runs from the three games and was adjudged Player of the Match and the Series.
Windies Women 159/6 in 20 overs (D Dottin 112, H Matthews 34, A Kanchana 2/24, S Weerakkody 1/21).
Sri Lanka Women 128/5 in 20 overs (Rebecca Vandort 50, Shashikala Siriwardene 50, H Matthews 4/18, S Taylor 1/22)

Encroaching on reservations in Anuradhapura continues
The encroachment of reservations belonging to the major tanks in the Anuradhapura district continues, while law-enforcing authorities such as Divisional Secretaries, Wildlife, Forest Conservation and Irrigation officials carry out prevention measures. It was reported that similar to the large-scale encroachment of reservations of the Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa and Abaya Wewa tanks situated close to Anuradhapura, the reservations of Mahakanadarawa and Rajangana too, are becoming a prey to encroachers. Referring to the environmental pollution and water contamination taking place at the Mahakanadarawa tank, Farmer Organizations Chairman R. M. R. Rajapaksha told the Daily News that a large-scale illegal timber racket was recently found within the tank reservation along the banks of Kanadara Oya. He said that there was information that crown land grants and land permits have been given to lands located within the reservation landscape.
The dumping of garbage in a land situated close to the reservoir is polluting the tanks water and the environmental around it, Rajapaksha added. He said that a particular type of weed called Hambu is invading the tank in addition to lotus, which has seemingly been introduced purposely to the tank, thus threatening itswellbeing. Rajapaksha said that encroachers were encouraged by the construction of a circuit bungalow belonging to a government department within the tank reservation.
In the meantime, Rajangana Integrated Farmer Organization Chairman Nihal Wanniarachchi said that the evacuation process commenced some two years back against the encroachers is now at a standstill and the tank is now contracting and on the verge of destruction.
The unwarranted cultivation in the tank bed is in progress again. Under the cover of disposing sediment, there is unlawful sand-digging continuing within the tank reservation, Wanniarachchi added. We have complained to the Anuradhapura government agent that the proposal to use the Rajangana tank as the water source for a water supply scheme shall be discouraged.

Exciting audience  engagement at TEDxColombo
TEDx is an independently organized TED event that brings people together to enhance connections, community and conversations around ideas worth spreading.
Beyond Boundaries Global, a Sri Lankan company specialized in team experience design, was commissioned to make TEDxColombo 2017 more interactive and to this end, an event was organized at Nelum Pokuna Theatre recently, attracting nearly 1,200 participants. Together with the organizers, Beyond Boundaries designed a TEDx Mystery called Missing Traveler. The participants found instructions for this in their giveaway bag and rushed to look for mysterious tasks and collect perplexing evidence across the venue.
Our challenge was to come up with an engaging game that allows for a huge number of people to try it out yet, it has to be hard enough so that only a small percentage of participants emerge victorious, says Tomi Astikainen the lead designer from Beyond Boundaries.
In the end only 14 teams figured out the entire mystery but hundreds of people took part in it  before, during and right after the talks. Winner of the TEDx Mystery Hudha Ibham rejoices: I am really excited to experience this.... surprised to know we have this kind of adventure in Sri Lanka.
Beyond Boundaries awarded the winner a free holiday in Ahaspokuna  the first ever Bush Walk Camp in Sri Lanka.
Some of the speakers at the event called for developing a curious mind, Chief Experience Officer Anuruddha Bandara adds, and this is what our mystery games are all about. They challenge people to activate dormant parts of the brain and challenges the team to work together in ways that closely resemble successful teamwork at the office.
The TEDx goers were very interested in the latest team building innovation from Beyond Boundaries  an intense real-life mystery game that truly pushes your boundaries. This is called The Mystery Bar and can be attended, by appointment only, at a unique property in Colombo 7. Groups of up to 20 people can attend simultaneously and the price is fixed at Rs 40,000 for just for fun games and at Rs 65,000 for more serious company training and team building.
Anuruddha further stated, Mystery team bonding is ideal if you wish to test your peoples ability to navigate uncertainty, to meet deadlines, to come up with creative solutions, to communicate and work closely as a team. This could be used for assessment and recruitment purposes as well. Further details can be accessed at www.mystery.lk

Facebook clarifies News Feed experiment for online publishers

Facebook is trialling the News Feed change in six countries including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala and Cambodia.
Yesterday, The Guardianreported that a new system being trialled by Facebook in selected countries saw nearly every non-promoted post shifted over to a secondary feed, with the main News Feed then consisting of ads and posts from users Facebook friends.
According to the report, this change has meant user engagement with Facebook pages has dropped in a major way, from 60-80pc. Slovakian sources toldThe Guardianthat the drop in organic reach being experienced by pages was dramatic.
Facebook-dependent publishers could suffer
A cross-section of the most popular Facebook pages in Slovakia saw two-thirds to three-quarters of their reach disappear according to CrowdTangle  an analytics service owned by Facebook.
Larger sites that use a number of different sources to leverage traffic were less affected by the changes, but smaller sites and those that depend largely on social traffic could suffer under the new rules.
The changes dont affect paid promotions on the News Feed, only native content posted by pages is weeded out.
News Feed chief offers explanation
Adam Mosseri, head of News Feed at Facebook yesterday wrote that the company, currently has no plans to roll this test out further. He said that the above-mentioned test was implemented to examine if users want two separate spaces  one for family and friends and another called Explore with posts from pages.
Mosseri also added that there are no current plans to charge pages on Facebook to pay for all aspects of distribution in either the classic News Feed or Explore feed. Unfortunately, some have mistakenly made that interpretation  but that was not our intention.
This Explore Feed is different than the one that was recentlyrolled outto the majority of Facebook users. The more common Explore Feed is a complementary feed of content based on the interests of the user from pages they have not yet liked on the site.
Mosseri concluded by saying: As with all tests we run, we may learn new things that lead to additional tests in the coming months so we can better understand what works best for people and publishers.
Although Facebook downplayed the significance of the tests impact on the traffic for certain pages, it is still important to note just how much power the social network has in terms of online publishing.
From the recent clamour from publishers to pivot to video, to this recent test, it shows that the company can drastically alter traffic patterns for online content providers.
The test could be running for months, meaning those sites that lost their reach could be in quite a quandary.

The Supreme Court today re-fixed for argument, the fundamental rights petition filed by former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Justice Eva Wanasundara fixed petition for argument on January 23.
In his petition, Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksha had sought Courts intervention to prevent an imminent arrest of him over several purported investigations.
On May 13, 2015 the Supreme Court issued an interim order staying the arrest of former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights petition filed by him.
However, on June 8, 2015 the Supreme Court clarified that the interim order staying the arrest of former defense secretary would only apply for four incidents including floating armoury incident, allegations of corruptions and irregularity in the purchase of MiG 27 in year 2006, Purported share manipulation at Lanka Hospitals Limited and Mihin Lanka deal and his arrest cannot be made by three respondents including the IGP, CID Director and DIG of the FCID.
However, the Supreme Court observed that this interim order would not apply for any other investigative authorities who have not been named as the respondents.
Through this petition, Rajapaksa sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent an imminent arrest of him over pending or on the conclusion of several purported investigations by the Criminal Investigations Department, Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruptions and the Frauds and Corruption Investigation Division (FCID) allegedly set up by an order which is ultra vires.
In his petition, Gotabaya Rajapaksa had cited 45 persons including the ministers of cabinet, police chief Pujith Jayasundara and Attorney General as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Gamini Dissanayake, a moving charisma
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the great American poet of the nineteenth century wrote thus about great men: The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, but they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night. A scarce few of Sri Lankan leaders, past or present, would deserve mention in the category of great souls that Longfellow describes. Gamini Dissanayake has certainly reserved his dwelling in that rarest of the rare sacred chalets.
His twenty-third death anniversary falls on October 24. It is most difficult to be objective when writing about personalities in contemporaneous times, especially when one has a personal relationship with the person in question. I, for one, do not even pretend to be objective, yet would attempt to pen down some vivid memories that I cherish, with utmost care for the accuracy of facts and also express judgments at the same time.
My judgments may be biased, yet the facts and incidents do bear utmost accuracy and precision. Gamini Dissanayakes place in post-independent Sri Lankas political history is unique in that he was one leader who would unquestionably be classified with the top echelon of leaders albeit he never reached that summit of power either as Prime Minister or President. In fact, his pinnacle was as Leader of the Opposition. When he stood up to speak in the well of the House of Parliament as its Leader of the Opposition, it was always a full house and not a single political friend or foe dared disturb him.
I met Gamini Dissanayake for the first time in 1970. It was a memorable year for the United National Party (UNP). Against a no-contest pact amongst the SLFP, LSSP and CP, the UNP suffered a most humiliating electoral debacle, which in terms of statistics, was worse than that it agonized over in 1956. The two Bandaranaikes, husband and wife, Solomon West Ridgeway Dias and Sirima respectively, made sure that the UNP was reduced to electoral shreds. However, there was one newcomer from the UNP. When the Titans fell, a new entrant into politics, to withstand the storm, in the hill country of Nuwara Eliya in itself was a small miracle. Gamini Dissanayake whose campaign was most unconventionally and fearlessly managed by another young novice into this character-defining enterprise called politics, Gaminis brother-in-law Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, defeated an experienced political hand William Fernando of the SLFP.
JR supporter
When I met Gamini in the latter part of 1970 he was already in the category called unseated parliamentarians. Resulting from an election petition judgment, Gamini was unseated from the seat and now awaiting his appeal. At the time I was the President of the newly formed student front of the UNP. As the founder-President of the Eksath Samajawadi Shishya Peramuna (United Egalitarian Student Front), I was invited to speak at a seminar organised by the Trade Union attached to the State Engineering Corporation. However, this invite was not greeted by the majority of our Front at the time as the main Party had been divided between the Dudley group and J R Jayewardene clique.
Most of the Student Front was of the Dudley group while only Harsha Abeywardene as Central Committee Member (who later became the Chairman of the Party in the 80s and killed by the JVP) and myself advocated for the non-firing of JRJ from the Party. Those who were in the majority made an abortive attempt to keep me from accepting the invitation as they knew it was Gamini Dissanayake who was classified as a JR supporter. I insisted that I attend the seminar and deliver a speech on behalf of the Student Front.
When I arrived at the meeting, it was well underway and sat next to this youthful ex-parliamentarian who happened to preside over the proceedings. When my turn came I spoke for about twenty minutes and the moment I sat down Gamini Dissanayake had a small chat and wrote down his telephone number and address on a piece of paper and asked me to come and see him, sooner the better. So began a shared-journey of twenty-five long years. A voyage of discovery, for me more than for him, this association was of great value to me.
While on this journey together, I happened to work for him as a loyal subordinate, erstwhile friend, and a political partner who saw things through the same prism and arrived at the same conclusions, more often than not. When the 1977 elections came upon us, we were ready. JR as leader of the Party unleashed a fine-tuned machine, a political force that had no precedent and knew no match worthy of mention in any of the following years.
The whole country was waiting for the Election Day. The rout that the JR-UNP caused to the SLFP and its satellite alliance was total and worse than those of the UNP of 56 and 70. Gamini placed me in charge of the Nuwara Eliya/Maskeliya campaign. At the tender age of 26, I, having learnt the ABC of electioneering from the great maestro Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, managed to produce the biggest majority for a winning UNP candidate for Gamini Dissanayake.
In 1977 Gamini was only 35 years. We came down to Colombo two days after the election and I stayed with my close friend Harsha. I received a call from Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria the day after and he told me that Ga, as Gamini was fondly called in his family circles, wanted me to come to the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways the following day as he was to assume duties as Minister.
The Ministry was housed in the old Treasury building, in the same room the old DS used to galvanize the whole country towards massive land settlement and irrigation schemes in the 1930s as Minister of Agriculture in the State Council. For a couple of weeks, I used to go to the Ministry every day and occupy one of the rooms leading to that of the Minister.
One day at about 11 in the morning I saw a man clad in native national costume dashing towards Gaminis room without checking with any of us who were charged with the responsibility of keeping Gamini informed ahead of time. I asked Athukorale, the KKS (peon) who was more or less the gatekeeper of the Ministers room, to ask the man to come and see me before he saw the Minister. A man clad in the local national dress, a man of middle age, but looking very dignified yet humble, told me that he was the MP for Passara. I immediately offered my apologies and accompanied him to the Minister and came back to my desk. In about ten minutes Gamini came into my room with Passara MP.
Leader, guru and friend
He looked at me and said to the MP: Manthri thuma, me thamai mage Pudgalika Lekam... Hon. MP, this is my Private Secretary. Gamini introduced me to the MP as his Private Secretary.
Thats how I came to know that Gamini had made me his Private Secretary, without even letting me know in advance. Such was the mans nature, one of candid spontaneity and aura of sincerity. After the MP left, Gamini summoned me to his room and gave a pep talk of ten minutes and told me thus: Palitha, hereafter I want you to be my alter-ego and went on to elaborate what exactly the term meant and the expectations that he had for me. His mission was specific and defined, his vision, all-encompassing, global and infinite. He was my leader, my guru, and my dear friend, a bundle of charisma on feet.
Allow me to narrate another story: When the Mahaweli Programme was well underway; an Australian delegation paid a call on Gamini in the early eighties. By this time, funding for Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala and Maduru Oya had been finalized. Yet we needed funds for the downstream development work and Gamini asked if the Australian Government could help. They left without any confirmation of funds. Maine-Wilson, the Australian High Commissioner too was in the discussions. Soon after this meeting, Gamini had a prearranged press briefing on some other subject. Following day all news media carried the news item that Australia was ready to fund the Mahaweli downstream development programme.
The news was totally false and the very next day Australian High Commission summoned a news conference and issued a vehement contradiction. Gamin knew that he was in a very embarrassing situation. Gamini summoned me to his office and told me as follows: Palitha, go to High Commissioners residence. Dont tell him youre coming. Make an unannounced call on him and explain to him that at no time did he, the Minister, tell the press as was printed in the newspapers and it was a mere exaggeration by mischievous journalists and offer my personal apologies to him and his government if they were hurt.
I made the call on the High Commissioners residence. When I entered his house I saw him coming down the stairway, with a very angry countenance and he made no attempt to conceal it either. I did so as Gamini asked me to and I saw a visible thawing of the grim air that surrounded the great Maine-Wilson. When I said that I would take my leave, he asked me to join him in his car and asked to ask my driver to follow. While in the car, Maine-Wilson told me something that would never leave my mind. Palitha, I like Gamini a lot, because you know why He is the best human being in the entire Cabinet. Should I say anymore
Socrates, in his infinitely wise mind, said: Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people. Gamini never had time to discuss people or events with me. He always discussed ideas with me. In countless trips we trekked across the length and breadth of the country, where a novel human drama was unfolding, embracing fellow Sri Lankans as his brothers and sisters, empathizing with their innocent lives and adding value to them with each minute he spent with them, Gamini Dissanayake left a legacy of a dramatic vision of optimism, selfless service of man and a unique sense of dignified politics, that the country misses so sadly today.
Gamini, we miss you.

Gayle denies exposing himself to masseuse
SYDNEY: Star West Indian cricketer Chris Gayle has denied exposing his genitals to a massage therapist, claiming an Australian media group set out to destroy him in a defamation action Monday.
The lurid accusations were made by Fairfax Media newspapers The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times in a series of stories in January last year.
They claimed the all-rounder exposed himself to a female masseuse in a dressing room at the 2015 World Cup in Sydney and indecently propositioned her.
On the opening day of his defamation action, Gayle's barrister told the NSW Supreme Court the allegations were quite foul and quite wrong.
They intended to blacken his name. They want to destroy him, Bruce McClintock said, the Sydney Morning Herald reported from the courtroom.
The newspaper cited Gayle as telling the court it never happened.
It's the most hurtful thing I've actually come across in my entire life, he said.
This is one case I have to fight. I want to clear my name. Fairfax said it was defending the articles on the basis the allegations were substantially true and in the public interest.
Their publication followed an uproar after Gayle attempted to flirt with an Australian presenter on live TV, asking her out for a drink and telling her: Don't blush, baby. The hearing is scheduled to run for 10 days. -AFP

Hamilton wins U.S. GP but made to wait for title
AUSTIN, Texas - Mercedes won the Formula One constructors title for the fourth year in a row on Sunday but Lewis Hamilton was made to wait despite cruising to a U.S. Grand Prix victory at one of his favourite circuits.
Hamilton, presented with the winners trophy by former U.S. president Bill Clinton, now looks sure to finish off the job and become Britains first four times world champion in Mexico next weekend.
The Mercedes drivers fifth victory in six years at Austins Circuit of the Americas extended his lead over Ferraris Sebastian Vettel, who finished second, to 66 points.
There are a maximum of 75 points still to be won from the three races remaining.
I love this track, I think this track is now my favourite to be honest, said Hamilton, interviewed by Usain Bolt on the podium and joining the Olympic sprint champions signature victory pose.
A big congratulations to the team. They work so hard back at the factory and here.
The victory was the 62nd of Hamiltons career and his ninth of the season.
Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen took third, despite finishing fourth at the flag, after Red Bulls Max Verstappen -- who had passed the Finn with a great overtaking move -- was hit with a five second post-race penalty that dropped him to fourth.
It is an appalling decision. They have robbed all of the fans here, raged Red Bull principal Christian Horner as Verstappen left the pre-podium room.
It was a great grand prix and they have screwed it up.
Hamilton had started on pole position, waved away for the formation lap by Bolt after an extended pre-race presentation reflecting the sports new U.S. ownership and desire to jazz things up.
Celebrity boxing title fight announcer Michael Buffer gave his long and resonant call of Lets get ready to rumble, after announcing the drivers to the crowd one by one, and the battle was on.
But it was Vettel who struck the first blow from second place on the grid, beating Hamilton into the first corner as the Briton moved across and squeezed him as tight as he could without making contact.
Six laps later and Hamilton was back in front and this time he stayed there.
At the start it was looking good, we got past Lewis, but we had to realise we couldnt go at his pace, said Vettel.  Agencies

Inquiry into if Malaka Silva violated court orders to enter a nightclub

The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court today issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) to carry out an investigation over an allegation that Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had violated a court order by entering nightclubs.
At a previous occasion, the court had issued an order preventing Malaka Silva from entering nightclubs as a bail condition regarding an assault case.
Counsel who appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party complained Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya that they have received information that Malaka Silva had entered nightclubs contrary to a court order.
Accordingly, the case involving an incident where Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had allegedly assaulted on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo was today fixed for Mach 6 by Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident had informed Court that they have sought Attorney Generals advice regarding two counter cases.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsmans complaint, police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently out on bail.
However, the lawyers appeared on behalf of Malaka Silva alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by Scotsman and even had a scratch on Malakas nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect. The magisterial inquiry into two counter cases were fixed for March 6.

Irving fined for NBA fan spat
New York: Kyrie Irving is off to a rocky start with the Boston Celtics after the league slapped the point guard with a $25,000 fine on Sunday for verbally abusing a Philadelphia 76ers fan.The exchange took place at halftime of the Celtics 102-92 win on Friday over the 76ers when a fan made a reference to Irving's former teammate LeBron James as the teams were heading to the locker rooms at the Wells Fargo Center arena. "Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving has been fined $25,000 for using inappropriate language when responding to a fan," league vice president Kiki VanDeWeghe said in a statement.
The Celtics aquired Irving in an offseason move after he demanded a trade from the NBA finals runner-up Cleveland Cavaliers. It is the second time in as many days the NBA has fined one of its players for an incident with a fan. On Saturday VanDeWeghe announced that DeMarcus Cousins had been fined $25,000 after the New Orleans Pelican player got into a heated exchange with a female fan during a game in Memphis. AFP

Its left to selectors to decide whether I remain captain - Tharanga
Monday: As captain of the one-day side Upul Tharanga said that he would take the blame for Sri Lanka 5-0 loss to Pakistan in the five-match ODI series that concluded at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium yesterday with Sri Lanka losing the fifth match by nine wickets.
It was Sri Lankas 12th straight loss in ODIs and at the end of the series the team had more questions than answers on how to end the dismal run that is having an overall effect on the players as a group.
From the South African series, as a team we are not settled. During the Indian series we failed to capitalize. As captain, I would like to take the blame for the defeat. All players need to take the blame, said Tharanga at the post-match press conference.
We have to score as a team. We can fail as batsmen two or three matches, but not all five games. For a team when the batters are not performing it is tough. I take the blame for the losses. The batsmen need to take a fair share of the blame as well.
We couldnt pass 200-run mark on three occasions this series. Same mistakes were repeated. Even here we had four wickets down in the first three overs and there was no coming back from thereon. The batting has been a worry in recent times and it was the same on this occasion. In the last 15 to 18 months we have struggled with our batting and that has been the main reason why we have come up with below par performances.
We had lots of discussions. We have analysed what has to be done. What we have failed to do is to deliver in the middle. In this series, from the top seven batters only two batters have passed the 75-run mark and you not going to win matches by doing that, he said.
Tharanga said that it is left to the selectors to decide whether they should continue with him as the captain of the one-day team when asked whether he would quit the captaincy.
Its the responsibility of the selectors and Sri Lanka Cricket. I dont want to leave the team and go. SLC will decide who will take the team forward.
Tharanga is one of the few players who have pulled out from travelling to Lahore to play Pakistan in the third T20I. He has been replaced by Thisara Perera as captain for the three-match series starting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
It was an individual decision. We chatted to 40 to 45 players and we didnt force the players to go either way. Once SLC informed us that we are playing in Lahore, we made a request to change the venue. SLC told us that they are going ahead with the game. We had a chat and we decided to give the freedom to the players to decide individually. It is the choice of the players, said Tharanga.
Personally why I opted not to go was in 2009 I was in the team although I wasnt present in Lahore that day. Just before that I was part of the ODI side that went to Lahore. After that 14 or 15 days later the shooting happened. Back of my mind the incident is there and thats why I thought not to go. But if theres an opportunity to tour in the future, I will consider. SLC chatted to us on the issue but no pressure was put on us. They understood the mental status of the players. There was no pressure whatsoever, he said.
Pakistan cricketers celebrate the victory by walking around the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.

Lawmakers as lawbreakers
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is lamenting the arrest of Opposition politicians who lead protests against the government. Speaking to journalists outside the Tangalle prison, after visiting those held in custody following the recent demonstration in Hambantota, the former President said that no other government, before, had thrown parliamentarians behind bars as the present Yahapalanaya administration. He noted that not even JR or Premadasa did so, even though he (Rajapaksa), together with Vasudeva Nanaykkara, led pada yatras, organsied human chains and even went to internationals forums to complain about tyre pyres and human rights violations. He said anyone has a right to demonstrate against the government but this regime has trampled on that right.
Earlier Joint Opposition parliament group leader Dinesh Gunawardena too complained to the Speaker in parliament that the MPs who led demonstrations were being arrested by the government and urging the Chair to take serious note about the matter. He too praised the hands off approach by JRJ and Premadasa. Both, Rajapaksa and Gunawardena, are obviously trying to hide the horrendous record of the former regime in the treatment of the Opposition. MR may have not thrown Opposition politicians behind bars for leading demos. He did not need to. Opposition protests were broken up even before they got started. Implied in the statement of Rajapaksa, when he claimed that anyone has a right to demonstrate against the government, is that everything was hunky dory under his rule. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Both, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Dinesh Gunawardena, appears to have been struck by a bout of selective amnesia when they imply that the UNP went about their business of protests without any fuss. Has it slipped their memory as to how a group of UNP MPs who went on a fact finding mission to Hambantota were pelted with stones, the Hambantota Mayor, no less, leading the attack. Are MR and Dinesh G. unaware how the vehicles of Rosy Senanayake and Chandrani Bandara were smashed up while they were participating in an ant-government demo in Punchi Borella, with MP Harsha De Silva running for dear life Where were Messrs Mahinda Rajapaksa and Dinesh Gunawardena when a Minister from the Kalutara district, known for his uncouth language, instigated a mob to hurl insults and abuse, at the deposed lady Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, in the vicinity of the latters official residence Were MR and Dinesh not aware of the attack on the vehicle of then Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, when the latter visited Balapitiya to address a public meeting, the attacker being none other than Sajin Vas Gunawardena, who punched our Ambassador to the Court of St. James, in London. Was Mahinda Rajapaksa not in the country when a mob led by Duminda Silva blocked the passage of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, on the road to parliament
These are but small samples of what obtained under Rajapaksa rule, when the democratic opposition was given no space to engage in legitimate political work and was harassed and intimidated at every turn. One need not go to the extent of throwing ones political enemies behind bars, to subdue them. Intimidating and placing road blocks to the Opposition by the deployment of violence to break up protests and anti-government agitations is equally a potent weapon. It would have the effect of taming the countrys political opposition permanently, although, to the credit of the UNP, the more intrepid members of the party refused to be intimidated. Besides, arrests made in Hambantota, of JO parliamentarians were for defying a court order. Namal Rajapaksa, being a lawyer, should, we believe, have known the consequences of turning the back on a court order. Lawmakers cannot be lawbreakers.
Mahinda Rajapaksa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara may not have been harassed by JRJ and Premadasa for leading anti-government protests. But both were very much members of the government which inflicted much misery on JRJ and Premadasa when they were in the Opposition. Government sponsored goons were deployed to break up many a demonstration led by the duo. Have MR and Dinesh G. forgotten how the Satyagraha led by JRJ to Attanagalla was attacked by mobs, unleashed by the government, following which Sirima Bandaranaike famously stated that the people of Attanagalle had all the right to drive away strangers to their territory, which gave birth to the equally famous Attanagalle doctrine coinage.
Both, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara were also very much on the scene when mobs went on the rampage and smashed the vehicles transporting JRJ and Premadasa to address a UNP meeting prior to the Ratnapura by-election. Old timers may still recall the mayhem unleashed during the Dedigama by-election, held in the aftermath of the death of Dudley Senanayake, where both MR and Vasu were in the thick of the government campaign and were among those who directed the violence. Hence, bringing JRJ and Premadasa to the picture is purely an eye wash.

Marquez vows patience as title looms
Phillip Island: Marc Marquez has vowed not to be rash as he enters the final two races of the MotoGP season with a sizeable lead over title rival Andrea Dovizioso. The world champion Honda rider widened his gap over Dovizioso to 33 points with a hard-fought victory at the Australian MotoGP on Sunday. The Spaniard now heads to Malaysia for next weekend's penultimate race of the season knowing that the world title is his to lose. Only Dovizioso can overhaul him, but the Italian Ducati racer didn't do himself any favours by finishing 13th at Phillip Island.
Dovizioso, who had revived his title hopes by beating Marquez in Japan a week earlier, won in steamy Malaysia last season. With a maximum of 50 points up for grabs in the last two races, Marquez can shut the door with another emphatic performance at Sepang. But he is wary of getting too far ahead of himself as the season builds to a climax. "The victory makes me happy with that 33-point advantage," he said after Sunday's win. "Okay, it's a big advantage but now is the time to understand our options, where we can fight to take points but not be too aggressive. He said his lead in the title hunt was "big, but not enough".

She will be accompanied by the First Secretary of the Embassy, Chotika Attapimon. The Ambassador will speak on the current business trend, trade potential, and opportunities for export/import, investment, and other services available for Sri Lankans in Indonesia. The participants will get an opportunity to interact with the Ambassador and other officials of the embassy and get information on trade matters.
With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy, and generally pro-investment policies, Thailand is highly dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for about two-thirds of GDP.
The agricultural sector, comprised mostly of small-scale farmers, contributes 10% of GDP but employs about one-third of the labor force. Thailand faces labor shortages, and has attracted an estimated 2-4 million migrant workers from neighboring countries.
Thai and Sri Lankan businessmen can trade and invest on areas of agriculture and processed food, gems and jewellery, electronics, automotive parts, rubber, tourism including hotel management and alternative energy.

Constitutional reform
Minority participation for the first time: Kiriella
Since the co-operation of the minority communities have been received for the Constitutional reform process for the first time in the countrys history, the governments objective is to bring in a new Constitution which will enable people of all communities to think as Sri Lankans, Higher Education and highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the minority communities were not involved when late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and late President J.R.Jayewardene introduced two new Constitutions. Since 70 percent of the population were Sinhala Buddhists and the balance 30 percent constituted minority communities, such Constitutions could not promote unity and harmony.
Addressing a meeting in Kandy, Kiriella said the country was driven towards a cruel war because the Constitution had been framed without taking the ideas and views of the minorities into consideration. Today, a golden opportunity had dawned to introduce a new Constitution which would not give rise to communal disunity, the Minister said.
He said what countries such as Singapore and Malaysia did after gaining independence was to frame a new Constitution in consultation and the agreement of minority communities. It was due to this reason that they were achieving rapid progress without any crisis situations, Minister Kiriella said.

NCE decries adverse effects of street protests on export business
The frequent occurrence of street protests and demonstrations orchestrated by diverse groups most often with political backing (perhaps to disrupt the work of the Government), is seen to have a telling adverse effect on the conduct of export business, the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) said in a statement yesterday.
Exporters have highlighted disruption of the operations of their export businesses due to this reason. Compounding the most often congested traffic flows of the city and other centers of commerce, street demonstrations with scant respect for the rights of the public, leave alone the freedom to conduct legitimate economic activities, are seen to be carried out with impunity, mostly during peak hours, in some instances even defying court orders.
Member exporters have brought to the notice of the Chamber that conduct of their export business is hampered due to logistical bottlenecks related to transport of goods and other services, causing delays, resulting in increased transaction costs, adding to the incompetitiveness of Sri Lankan exports in the international marketplace. In fact, some exporters have been forced to consider shifting their operations closer to the Colombo Port to overcome this recurring problem.
Although pious intentions were announced by the Government to demarcate designated locations in the city to stage demonstrations and protests, the Chamber is concerned that nothing seems to be happening, which is a sad reflection on the effectiveness of so called good governance.
The Chamber is strongly of the view that it is high time, the responsible state authorities intervene, to overcome the damage caused to the economy, through not only the adverse effects on existing export businesses, but also by discouraging the entry of foreign investors to Sri Lanka and other entrepreneurs to the field of exports, in the background of the ambitious economic and export targets of the government to resuscitate the economy of the country.

Negombo lagoon gets facelift
Measures have been taken to allocate funds from the Port City project to develop Negombo lagoon since the pollution around the lagoon has badly affected the livelihoods of fishing community of the area, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry Sources said.
Following a request made by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Rs. 50 million will be allocated from the Port City project for this purpose.
This was revealed at the progress review meeting held recently at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry with regard to the Livelihood Development Programme conducted by the Ministry with the intention of uplifting living standards of people depending on the fishing industry in the lagoon for their living.
Dumping waste substances into the lagoon has reduced the quality of ocean environment near the lagoon and that leads to unhealthy conditions for all marine organisms. As a result the fish stocks around the lagoon have also reduced, Ministry sources said.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has also allocated Rs. 500 million for the Livelihood Development Programme.

New regulations at Yala ensure sustainability: SLTDA
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), supporting the decision taken by authorities to limit the number of vehicles entering Yala National Park, said the regulations were needed to ensure sustainability, discipline and conservation.
A senior spokesperson from the SLTDA said the new regulation was needed to protect Yala National Park.
Overcrowding was a serious issue at Yala and it posed a serious threat to the flora and fauna. There were times when traffic jams were reported in the park as a result of a large number of safari jeeps freely entering the venue, he said.
Pointing out that the new regulation will help tourism, as it is aimed at conserving the park, the spokesperson added that the generations to come will have the opportunity to experience the beauty of Yala. Giving safari jeeps unhindered access to the park will spoil the experience for everyone. The SLTDA strongly supports the new regulation in the name of sustainability and conservation, he said. The Secretary to the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry R. M. D. B. Meegasmulla said 600 jeeps have been registered and the maximum number of vehicles entering the park is limited to 300 per day.
The 600 jeeps will have access to the park every other day, he said. Wildlife authorities have suggested three sessions per day with 100 jeeps each. Safari jeep owners at Yala National Park, meanwhile, launched a protest yesterday, opposing the decision taken by the authorities.

No official notification  of 3-wheeler import ban in SL yet: Bajaj Auto
Sri Lankas budget is due next week and usually before that these kinds of reports come, said S Ravikumar, President of Business Development and Assurance, Bajaj Auto.
Bajaj Auto stock is under pressure on back of reports that suggest Sri Lanka will restrict import of 3-wheeler taxis and the company is one of the primary exporters of that segment.
Discussing the impact of this on sales and overall exports, S Ravikumar, President of Business Development and Assurance, Bajaj Auto said they are yet waiting for official notification on the import ban in Sri Lanka for 3-wheelers and in touch with their distributors over there.
He said Sri Lankas budget is due next week and usually before that these kind of reports come.
In the current year, between domestic and international, the company is looking at sale of 6 lakh three-wheelers, said Ravikumar, adding that so the numbers are quite good.
Moreover, the total dependence on Sri Lanka with regards to 3-wheeler exports is 6 percent of overall number.
However, currently he says the demand for exports have risen in the current year and demand is outstripping production. The production is running at about over 100 percent installed capacity and will continue for next few months even if Sri Lanka news is true, says Ravikumar. So, see not impact on demand for the company and impact on earnings contribution of the company, he adds.
Moreover, with de-risking strategy in mind the company has come out with a Qute model which has all the benefits of three wheelers and is low risk and has low emission.
With regards to festive sales, he says they in par with the guidance of 25 percent sales for the season. Saw good traction for Platina and CT100, and Pulsar is also doing great, he says. (www.moneycontrol.com)

Old newsrooms
Time was when every newspaper had its own stable of colourful characters who enlivened and adorned the atmosphere of newsrooms with professional panache and outrageous antics. As one who has had a merry run in a varied and unrestrained journalistic career, both here and in overseas journals, I have encountered my share of the most improbable personalities who ever put pen to paper.
But for sheer audacity, ebullience and charm none could have matched the irreverent cluster of newspapermen who strode the expansive corridors of Lake House with a haughty vivacity. But that was in the mid-sixties and late seventies, a phase in the profession which many regard as the Golden Age of Sri Lankan journalism.
Warm and witty memories of the great journalists of the place and period will obviously be etched in the minds of those surviving naughty knights of the press. The old daily Observer (now defunct) and Sunday Observer then were peopled by a bunch of wiseacres and buffoons, many of who became immortalized in the annals of newspaper folklore.
Actually, there was never a dull moment in the newsrooms even after everyone stretched themselves out on chairs and desks after beating stressful deadlines. Following a short rest during post-deadline calm many would be pacing the corridors looking to let off steam. The place was always playful and wildly alive. Everyone was a willing foil in this madcap menagerie which was bursting with energy fun and passion that was allowed free rein.
Yet, we the wordsmiths who forged out the best for our readers, were often called upon to perform delicate surgery on badly written copy and sheer butchery on the more horrendous contributions. It goes without saying that we the surgeons of the written word minded every other persons language but our own.
Some of the best, most colourful expletives had been fashioned by bored and frustrated journos of the time. Yes, we were quite a breed apart. And we conjured up the more exotic abuse while prowling the stone (pre-production line) to exorcise those beastly little printers devils. By this time one was assailed by myopic eye strain and it often became difficult to spot the most obvious faux pas even when the font was staring you in the face in all its immense 60 point glory.
Newsrooms as we knew them then were loud places where journalists yelled across the floor, where phones rang incessantly, where reporters ran up and down the corridors and the roar of raucous laughter shook the building to its very foundations. And when the crush of deadline came, the staff swarmed around, expletives were unleashed like cannonades and pandemonium reigned as the clock ticked down to zero hour.
Their denizens were swaggering with certitude, yet sometimes endearingly insecure, cynical but inextinguishably idealistic. Many were loud, cocky and rowdy. The newsroom radiated energy at a near sexual level. Typewriters clattered, teletype machines buzzed and phones rang incessantly. Reporters hectored sources over heavy, old-fashioned Bakelite dialling phones with hopelessly twisted cords. News editors and desk heads yelled. Liquor bottles leaked from desk drawers as cigarette butts smouldered in ash trays.
Everything happened at a hectic pace. The editorial was a study in personalities. It was full of diverse faces, old faces and young but all exuding character. All around were both enemies and friends. Usually we worked together for the common end. No one came into journalism or a newsroom in those days unless they had enough of an ego to fend for themselves and to fight battles. Shrinking violets in this game got trod upon.
They say its the adrenaline that kept it all going. Every day, this place called a newsroom brought together the thrill of the hunt and a race against time. And the language dear reader, was atrocious, to say it was outrageously smutty would be an understatement.
There was a lot of badinage thrown around and juvenile japery appeared to be the order of the day, every day. We had quite a few sharpshooters notorious for shooting rubber bands at their colleagues. Crumpled paper balls and paper clips were used as handy missiles. Ashtrays and heavy lead paper-weights came in handy when tempers got out of control. Murder and mayhem were frequently in the air and expletive-filled newsroom scuffles and fisticuffs were everyday occurrences.
Yet, no newsroom possessed such a stable of cuss-lords who were all unrivalled in their range of obscene curses and oaths in an environment peopled by a bunch of versatile opponents in the art of filthy vituperation
Ah, the good old days! At any given moment there arose an everyday battle of diatribes combined with the thrust and parry of sabre-tongued quips and repartee. The flash and ring of wordplay flew like sparks from fencing foils and nothing was held sacred. The invective bordered on criminal defamation as parental antecedents were vilified in the most shocking way imaginable. Pranksters letting off steam and the duelling of witty repartee were the order of the day.
But a story about an actual duel with deadly weapons actually became a reality when the animosity between a duo of veterans continued to resurface at the Press Club. One was nicknamed the Duke and the other Gompa G. That was when a newspaper editor arranged for a knife-fight between two adversaries to settle a long-standing score. The opponents were positioned at the opposite ends of the bar and were armed with razor-sharp steak knives.
Who could ever forget the brash, blustering Duke a hard-bitten newsman who used to prowl the newsrooms terrorising everyone who dared cross his path. He was obnoxious, crude, profane, irreverent and blasphemous. Gompa G on the other hand was an eccentric who frequently flipped his lid when provoked.
As the Press Club regulars and their guests looked on in amusement perceiving a feigned drama, the adversaries glared at each other with murderous concentration.
At the editors signal the Duke advanced gingerly on his quarry grinning like an idiot imagining it was only a simulated cameo. That was until the drink-crazed Gompa came charging at him with a murderous roar, clearly intent on homicidal mayhem. The Duke losing his nerve dropped his weapon and uttered the most fearful screech and fell to his knees quivering with self pity.
Whatever their faults and virtues, old-style newsrooms possessed a character of both old world charm and derring-do. Along with the intensity came a rumpus-room collegiality backed up by hard work, all-professional skill and barely disguised altruism. It was a place of noise and laughter and laxity. To use the most basic words, it was all riotous fun.

O'Sullivan beats Wilson 9-2
Ronnie O'Sullivan produced a world-class performance to beat fellow Englishman Kyren Wilson 9-2 and win the English Open in Barnsley. Five-time world champion O'Sullivan led 6-2 after the first session and was relentless after the break, wrapping up a clinical victory with a break of 131. The 41-year-old made four 100-plus breaks in the final to clinch his 29th ranking title. "You don't play that well unless you feel you have to," he told Eurosport. "That was as good as I could play amongst the balls. I made some really good breaks, the most important one was at 6-2.
O'Sullivan was awarded the Steve Davis trophy and also surpassed the six-time world champion's tally of 28 ranking titles. The Rocket enjoyed an eventful week in Barnsley after he was given special permission to play in trainers due to an ankle injury. His third-round match against Mark Davis was then interrupted by a spectator who evaded security and took his final shot. But he put all that behind him to produce his best snooker against 25-year-old Wilson, who was competing in his second final of the season following defeat by Ding Junhui at the World Open. BBC

Pan Asia Bank expands green lending facility from Global Climate Partnership Fund
Pan Asia Bank and the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) have closed a new US$ 13 million facility agreement. This funding which comes in the form of a seven year senior unsecured loan brings the total funding arrangement between the two parties to US$ 33 million, which will be utilized to promote green lending initiatives in Sri Lanka. GCPF has been a partner of Pan Asia Bank in its efforts on mitigating climate change since 2013.
GCPF is an investment fund that provides financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across frontier and emerging economies and is set up as a public-private partnership. The German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, KfW, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and IFC are among the investors of GCPF.
With GCPF as a partner, Pan Asia Bank has played a pioneering role in introducing green lending initiatives to Sri Lanka. Green lending is a sector of immense importance that supports the growth in Sri Lanka in a socially responsible manner.
Under the agreement with GCPF, Pan Asia Bank will also continue to benefit from a comprehensive Technical Assistance programme, which will enable the bank to strengthen its green lending portfolio of economically viable and climate friendly projects.
One of the key initiatives under the Technical Assistance programme is the introduction of a Social and Environmental Management System in the bank, which is in the deployment stage. This initiative makes Pan Asia Bank one of the few banks in Sri Lanka complying with such high standards in responsible lending.
Pan Asia Bank is confident that this funding will create a perfect opportunity to generate long term sustainable economic benefits to uplift the living standards of people by creating cost-efficient energy solutions for businesses and employment, while also preserving our environment. In addition to contributing towards limiting global warming, this initiative will also result in creating strategic economic benefits to the country as development of renewable energy sources reduce Sri Lankas dependency on imported oil. In line with the government push for renewable energy Pan Asia Bank is committed towards the success of such projects such as 'Suriya Bala Sangramaya' as one of the pioneers of introducing solar loans to Sri Lanka.
Commenting on this opportunity, Pan Asia Bank Director/CEO Nimal Tillekeratne highlighted that the GCPF facility seamlessly fits with the business strategy of Pan Asia Bank. The fact that this loan was offered as a seven year senior unsecured loan is a strong indicator of the confidence and trust GCPF has in Sri Lanka and especially in Pan Asia Bank and its growth prospects.
Speaking on behalf of the Global Climate Partnership Fund, Chairperson of the Board Claudia Arce said: We are pleased to continue our very successful partnership with Pan Asia Bank in Sri Lanka. Pan Asia Bank has been acting as a catalyst in encouraging the transition of Sri Lanka to a greener economy  which is exactly what the Global Climate Partnership Fund aims to achieve through its funding activities.

The salary issues raised by the Railway Trade Unions would be resolved within the next two weeks, Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.
Ministry Spokesperson Vajira Abeysinghe said the Committee headed by the President would make a final decision and it would be conveyed to them through the Secretary to the President.
The Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) and the Ceylon Railway Guards Union (CRGU) last week decided to launch an indefinite strike if their demands for a salary increase was not met. The strike was called off after a meeting held with the Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
Ceylon Railway Employees General Union head S.P Vithanage said the workers of the Train Controllers Union, Railway Engine Drivers Union, Railway Station Masters Union and the Railway Guards Union were given a Rs. 2,500 increment through the 3/2016 circular to their basic salary, Rs. 16,650, and now they were demanding a Rs. 350 increment.
A Committee of seven officers including the President, the Prime minister, the Secretary of the President, the Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Union officers were assigned to resolve the issue.

Regal Ronaldo tipped for Best FIFA award
LONDON: Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning exploits with Real Madrid make him the strong favourite to win the 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player Award at Monday's ceremony in London.
The Portuguese superstar, who won last year's inaugural award, fired Madrid to glory in La Liga and scored 12 goals as they won the Champions League for the third time in four seasons.
He is nominated alongside his eternal rival Lionel Messi and Messi's former Barcelona team-mate Neymar, now of Paris Saint-Germain.
In the end, Ronaldo is ahead of the others, Roma icon Francesco Totti told the FIFA website ahead of the ceremony at the London Palladium.
He had an amazing season and also accomplished all of his goals with the most prestigious of teams. Should Ronaldo prevail, it will pave the way for him to match Messi's record of five Ballons d'Or when France Football magazine announce the winner of that award early next year.
Ronaldo, 32, won the inaugural Best FIFA Men's Player Award last year after a six-year merger between the FIFA honour and the Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo previously won the FIFA World Player of the Year award, the precursor to the Best FIFA award, in 2008.
Messi, 30, scored 54 goals last season as Barcelona won the Copa del Rey.
The Argentina great has made a superb start to the current campaign, scoring 15 goals for Barcelona and earning his country a place at next year's World Cup with a magical hat-trick against Ecuador.
We all know who is the best player in the world, says Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde.
The truth is, the handing out of a trophy isn't something that worries me too much. Brazil star Neymar, 25, won the Copa del Rey with Barcelona last season before joining PSG in a blockbuster 222 million euros ($262 million) deal that obliterated the world transfer record.
The voting for the award, equally weighted between national team captains, national team coaches, media and fans, closed last month.
Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane is expected to be named Best FIFA Men's Coach after becoming the first man to mastermind a successful defence of the European Cup in the Champions League era.
The former France playmaker is up against Chelsea's Antonio Conte and Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri.
To be sincere, if they give me it, I'll take it with pleasure, Zidane said.
But if the question is, 'Am I the best coach in the world' No, and I'm sure of it. Veteran Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is shortlisted for the Best FIFA Goalkeeper prize alongside Ronaldo's Madrid team-mate Keylor Navas and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer. The shortlist for the Best FIFA Women's Player award comprises Venezuela's Deyna Castellanos, American star Carli Lloyd and Dutchwoman Lieke Martens.
The winner of the Puskas Award for the best goal of 2017 will also be announced.
The favourites are Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud's 'scorpion kick' volley against Crystal Palace and South African goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke's remarkable overhead bicycle kick for Baroka against Orlando Pirates.

Kazuo Ishiguro is Nobel laureate in literature for 2017
Rising from the abyss beneath
On that evening The Remains of the Day was screened before a spectacle of local university undergraduates. The typical enthusiasm was absent. The audience was visibly tired, with signs of boredom evident in every nook and corner. Some were dozing off, while another portion was yawning. Most of them were anxiously waiting for the credits to appear.
This may come in as outrageous tidings for any fan of The Remains of the Day  the film as well as the novel. But the young undergraduates have their fair share of defence. The life and times of Stevens, a British butler, have a little relevance to the Sri Lankan audience. The passages of the novel demand patient and paused reading. The same patience is required when watching the movie as the scenes are shot with heavy attention paid to the minute details of the butlers life.
Interestingly, however, this account of a British butler has been authored by an Asian domiciled in Britain. Although he moved to Britain at the age of five, Kazuo Ishiguro claims he has the Japanese influence thanks to being brought up in a Japanese-speaking family background. Ishiguros Remains became a celebrated work worldwide. It went on to bag the Booker prize in 1989. Awards and accolades gradually became a familiar phenomenon for Ishiguro, whose pinnacle is being the recipient of the Nobel Literature laureate for 2017.
For a moment Ishiguro wondered whether it was simply another example of fake news something certainly trending in the todays information machinery. Ishiguro who claims himself to be taken completely by surprise has been recognised by the Swedish Academy for having uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world.
According to Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for literature is generally based on an overall assessment. Its a lifes work that is rewarded more than individual books. Novelists have received the most prizes. The reason may be that it is the most practised literary genre, Englund adds.
Alfred Bernhard Nobel of the dynamite controversy (rather than fame) placed his signature on the last will on November 27, 1895. Like his invention, Nobels will too stirred a hornets nest. The philanthropist has left a lions share of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. His family was not in favour of this idea. Nobels nominees refused to carry out what is requested in the will. But then in 1901, the Nobel Prize was to be set up at last.
In February all the received nominations, usually a bit over 200, are reviewed. They are then processed by the Nobel Committee. The work is supported by the Academys own employees, but also outside experts are hired for translations, statements and the like.
First, we make a list of over 20 names. From this, we eventually make a short list of five names. The shortlist is discussed and approved by the Academy in its entirety in May. Then the members have the summer to learn about the five authors on the shortlist. When the Academy then meet again in mid-September, it is always the Nobel Prize that is the top priority. We usually have agreed to a decision in early October, Englund elaborates the procedure.
As he was sitting at the kitchen table at his home in Golders Green getting ready for the brunch, Ishiguro was interrupted by a phone call from his agent who broke the news.
Born in Nagasaki, Ishiguro moved to Britain because his father, an oceanographer, was assigned to undertake research. The parents did not imagine that they would live in the country for so long, hence opted to speak Japanese at home lest Ishiguro would lose touch with his roots.
It was the Japanese-born British authors turn to be surprised with his competitors being Margaret Atwood, Ngugi Wa Thiongo and Haruki Murakami.
Part of me feels like an imposter and part of me feels bad that Ive got this before other living writers, Ishiguro confessed, Haruki Murakami, Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Cormac McCarthy, all of them immediately came into my head and I just thought wow, this is a bit of a cheek for me to have been given this before them.
Salman Rushdie was one of the first fellow authors to forward his congratulatory message. Many congratulations to my old friend Ish, Rushdies message read, whose work Ive loved and admired ever since I first read A Pale View of Hills.
This is a very weird time in the world, weve sort of lost faith in our political system, weve lost faith in our leaders, were not quite sure of our values, and I just hope that my winning the Nobel prize contributes something that engenders goodwill and peace. It reminds us of how international the world is, and we all have to contribute things from our different corners of the world, Ishiguro told the Press following the Nobel announcement.
According to The Guardians John Mullan, Ishiguros fiction revels in literary allusion and generic playfulness while stylistically austere or self-limiting.
Often he takes a well-known fictional subgenre and transforms it. With Never Let Me Go it is dystopian science fiction. In When We Were Orphans he expected his readers to recognise the conventions of the detective story. In The Unconsoled he rewrote the Kafkaesque fable. Sometimes, because he is distorting the rules of a fictional genre, his works at first provoke some resentment. The Unconsoled, a wonderfully unsettling and melancholy narrative, exasperated some critics, but now has begun to win them over. His most recent work, The Buried Giant, perplexed many with its rewriting of the rules of fantasy fiction. It follows some of the regulations of the strange genre (it even has a dragon) in order to explore the powers of human forgetfulness, Mullan elaborates the versatility of Ishiguro.
In an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, he said Ive always said throughout my career that although Ive grown up in this country and Im educated in this country, that a large part of my way of looking at the world, my artistic approach, is Japanese, because I was brought up by Japanese parents, speaking in Japanese and I have always looked at the world through my parents eyes.
Ishiguro is often compared to Salman Rushdie, most probably because of the rich wordplay involved in his works. The rich wordplay is very much evident in The Remains of the Day and An Artist of the Floating World more than any other work. As Ashok Ferrey observed in this column a few weeks ago, Rushdie is more than verbose. He plays with words. The same could be said on Ishiguro. Blessed with a precise and rich choice of words, Ishiguro paints an intricate picture of whatever the theme he undertakes. Born in the same region (Japan and India), later migrated to the same country (Britain), both Rushdie and Ishiguro have their hereditary roots to sharpen their narrative styles to reach a wide platform.

Ryan Jayalath released under strict bail condition
Medical Faculty Students Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested for damaging public property by forcibly entering the Health Ministry during an anti-SAITM protest was yesterday ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa made the order considering a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging Maligakanda Magistrates Court decision that he should not be granted bail.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a Rs. 500,000 personal bail and his parents were accepted as the signatories to the bond. Jayalath was released on bail considering his future educational activities as an exceptional circumstance.
The High Court Judge warned that the bail could be cancelled and accused would be remanded until the conclusion of the trial if he violated the bail conditions or engaged in any other offence.
The High Court Judge issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division Director that the activities of the suspect be monitored to ascertain whether he would comply with the court order.
No one has power to take laws into their hands. All should respect to the countrys law. The bail can be cancelled even with a photograph to prove that he violates court order.
This Court will monitor the suspects future activities, the High Court Judge said.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the suspect is having seven pending court cases in the Magistrates Court. The revision application cannot be maintained due to several shortcomings because it has failed to demonstrate the facts challenging the Magistrates order.
Defence counsel Gamini Alwis appearing on behalf of the suspect moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over two months.
My client had entered the Ruhuna University in 2010 to follow a MBBS science degree. Now he is expecting to participate in internship training. the Defence Counsel said.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General and Counsel Gamini Alwis for the suspect-petitioner.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena opened a 242-bed epilepsy hospital, which is fully funded by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), in Colombo, today.
The Rs.100 million ($26.7 million), 10-story hospital consists of a surgical theater, an intensive care unit, a high-dependency unit, 242-bed male and female wards, and an auditorium for capacity building for the countrys medical staff.
The SFD recently financed an additional Rs.48 million to buy all necessary equipment including a CT scanner, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, physical therapy devices and medical furniture.
A four-member SFD delegation has left to Colombo to take part in the event, which will also be attended by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The Saudi team comprises Fawzi Al-Saud, director general of operations; Abdulla Al-Shedokhi, adviser; Bandar Al-Otaibi, engineer from the technical department; and Meshal Al-Najashi, loan researcher at the legal department.
Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim told Arab News that SFD's support helped fulfill a long-standing need of the island nation.
He recalled that the fund has been supporting Sri Lankan projects for more than three decades.
We were able to complete major projects such as the Kinniya bridge with its assistance, he added.

## Title: Service element of public service
## Supertitle:

Service element of public service
The Finance Minister will present the countrys budget to Parliament in a few weeks. In his presentation, amongst others, there will be a detailed statement of the projected Revenue and Expenditure.
The common citizen, by going through these figures, will come to know the vast amount of money we plan to spend on public sector salaries and pensions of retirees. He is well within his right to ask: are we getting back equal return by way of service
Previous reports indicate that out of our National Income 40% is set aside for salaries of public servants and pensioners.
What do Sri Lankans want from their public services Only a few! Most importantly, they want their expectations met. And they want the staff they deal with to be competent and to keep their promises, they want to be treated courteously and fairly and have their individual circumstances taken into account. They also want the service to be good value for tax rupees spent.
Since these factors combined to account for 75% of Sri Lankans satisfaction with public services, it is in these areas that services must look for improvement.
The single most important driver of satisfaction with public services is that services meet expectations. People are more likely to say that a service meets their expectations when staff: (1) listen to them, understand their circumstances and treat them as valued citizens, (2) know about the services their organisation offers and can help, (3) communicate in a clear and simple way, (4) treat them with respect, (5) customer focused-friendly, polite and approachable, (6) follow through or do what they say they will do.
Competent staff
There is considerable overlap between meeting citizen expectations and what it means to have competent staff. Competent staff: (1) know about the services their organisation offers and can help the citizen, or direct them to someone who can help, (2) listen to and understand their citizens circumstances, (3) citizen focused-friendly, polite and approachable, (4) can communicate in a clear and simple manner.
Technically, a promise is any undertaking or commitment made by a staff member or organisation. Keeping promises involves staff who do what they say they will do. To do so, there should be systematic procedures and standards (particularly for response times) so that staff know what is expected of them and the public are aware of the standards they can expect to receive.
Treating people fairly
The current belief among citizens is that most public servants do not treat people fairly. Treating people fairly involves: (1) staff who treat all citizens with respect, (2) are non-judgmental and have a reasonable degree of flexibility, (3) explain the reasons for decisions in a reasonable manner, (this is particularly important if it is not possible to meet a citizens expectations).
Being flexible puts a human face on public services and leaves a strong positive impression. People feel that their circumstances are taken into account when: (1) staff are able to exercise some flexibility, particularly in relation to scheduling appointments etc. (2) senior and more experienced staff with the authority to exercise discretion are available when individual circumstances need to be taken into consideration, (3) staff are professional at all times.
Priorities
As we can see from the above experiences, in order to improve the standards of service, the public service leaders must set the priorities right. And, what are these priorities
First, there should be dedicated and competent staff who can clearly explain processes and inform people of their entitlements. Secondly, the service itself needs a transparent and open request and complaints process and to ensure citizens know about it. Complaints and requests need to be investigated promptly and citizens kept fully informed of the process and when they can expect a response.
Thirdly, public service leaders should set and monitor service standards so that staff know what is expected of them and the public are aware of the standards they can expect to receive. Fourthly, when individual circumstances have to be taken into account, the services need to enable staff to exercise some flexibility and discretion around processes. This is flexibility in how people are dealt with, which may not necessarily affect the outcome of their dealings with the service. Above all, Sri Lankan common citizens have to feel they have been listened to and not treated like a number.
Solution
It is obvious now that public sector leaders in our country have a big role to play to put things right. However, our experience shows that while the challenges may be consistent or increasing, the ways in which they are being confronted, and the results that are being achieved, leave lot to be desired. Historically, our public sector has been seen as a passive vehicle for executing social policy mandated by legislation.
That status quo needs to be changed. With the introduction of the liberalized economy, the people in this country have got accustomed to enhanced service delivery from the private sector. Now the citizens view the public sector as another provider of servicesservices for which they pay heavy taxes.
To address this, the public-sector bosses must wake up from their slumber and find ways of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its service element.
The solution lies in developing citizen-centric models that draw inspiration from the relative success with which the private sector has addressed this situation, and that put the citizen at the heart of service design and service delivery. While the public sector does not choose its citizens, the fact that it is required to service them and their diverse requirements is another factor driving the need for new service delivery models.
Empowerment
In the private sector, when suppliers are not responsive to consumer needs and demands they will be vulnerable to sanctions from consumers. However, this responsiveness to consumer needs breaks down in the case of public services, since there are typically no user fees for these services and governments finance these services out of general revenues. So, there is little incentive for providers to improve the quality of services they offer.
This is where empowerment comes in. Empowered citizens and communities can hold the state and service providers accountable for the delivery of basic quality services.
Empowerment can be realized through many means. One is rights-based entitlements, in which the state offers citizens the right to information as well as the right to specific social services and basic necessities (such as food, employment, health, and basic education). In most developed countries these are legally-enforceable rights (often enshrined in their national constitutions), and it therefore becomes a binding obligation of the state to ensure that right to eligible citizens.
Participatory performance monitoring is another empowering mechanism by which citizens and communities monitor and evaluate the implementation and performance of public services, often according to indicators they themselves have selected, and then demand better performance from service providers. Some of the more commonly-used instruments for participatory performance monitoring are citizen report cards, score cards, and social audits. Citizen report cards enable service users to provide their perceptions and views of service delivery performance, outcomes and relevance.
However, while empowering citizens and communities can certainly increase the pressure on governments and public service providers to be more accountable and transparent, it is unlikely to be sufficient in bringing about improved delivery. For services to improve, the state apparatus  including local governments, the government bureaucracy and public service providers  has to change the way it does its business and become more citizen friendly. That is indeed the gist of the matter.

SLT join hands with Infotel-2017 as principal sponsor
Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lankas premier telecommunication solutions provider has joined with as a principal sponsor with Infotel 2017, in supporting the vision of transforming Sri Lanka towards a trillion-dollar economy through digitization by 2042.
With the 25th anniversary of Infotel also marked by this years Infotel, SLT has made plans to open up a number of initiatives that will garner interest and will become centerpieces of this years Infotel. Organized by the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS), INFOTEL is South Asia's oldest and most prestigious Information and Communication Technology (ICT) exposition.
This year's event is scheduled to be held from November 1 to 5, 2017 at the BMICH in Colombo, under the theme Towards a Digital Economy.
Ajantha Seneviratne, Group Chief Marketing Officer SLT said, SLT has always supported the Sri Lankan ICT industry through various initiatives and with Infotel we have continued to work together to uplift the ICT industry of Sri Lanka for over 13 years. And with the theme of this year, the sector based approach and the vision towards using digitization to transform Sri Lankas economy, we felt that this was a vision that we also shared and felt we must support.
Infotel has been the premiere ICT event in Sri Lanka for over 2 decades and this year will mark its 25th anniversary. It has allowed many Sri Lankan ICT companies an opportunity to showcase their many offerings and talent as well as enabled the general public to gain an insight to how the ICT industry is rapidly transforming the way we live. Especially with the school children and other students being one of the largest groups of attendees each year, we feel Infotel is fulfilling a role that could not be overlooked, he said.
In many ways, digitization is becoming the primary way in which our economy will advance. Thus, we think this years theme is an opportune one. Each of the sectors that have been allocated has immense potential to disrupt the way through digitization how traditionally these industries operated in the past. We at SLT too have recognized this and have taken many initiatives to support this growing requirement as well as use the opportunities that were on offer, he said.
First off SLT has built what we call NBN, or National Backbone Network which is the primary infrastructure on which all telecommunication networks and many key institutions operate. We have also taken steps to expand our infrastructure through fiber optic networks domestically connecting all the cities and major institutions both government and private.
Also, in anticipation of a strong demand for internet use we have increased our connectivity option to suit the demands of the next 25 years as well as attained access to newest SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system adding to multiple global connectivity options of SEA-MEWE 3, 4, Bharath-Lanka and SLT-Dhiraagu cable systems. National Backbone network is the platform in which Sri Lankan digital economy can rely on as even today many financial institutions use the network to communicate with their branches as well as each other, he said.

The Southern Province Professional Journalists Union (SPPJU) took steps to update its membership on what the interim report contains.
It is important that we as journalists are knowledgeable to some extent on what the interim report released by the steering committee actually contains before publishing opinions rendered by persons who have not even read the whole document. With so many journalists competing to be the first to submit the news to their respective institutions, they hardly check the accuracy of what has been said, SPPJU President Rahul Samantha Hettiarachchi said, explaining the need of the forum.
At the end of the half day discussion, it was the view of Southern Journalists that;
If there is any reform to the constitution that needs to be approved by the people at a national referendum, the people should be allowed to vote for or against each proposal separately.
The Sinhala term Ekiya Rajjya should be used in Tamil and English as well, for at present, there is much debate if the correct word is being used in the English and Tamil translations.

Usman Khan Shinwari (5/34) rips out batting for 103
Sri Lanka suffers third 5-0 ODI whitewash for year
Monday: Sri Lankas shambolic batting in the five-match one-day international series was laid to rest at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium yesterday when they were rolled over for a mere 103 runs to lose the fifth and final ODI to Pakistan by nine wickets and with it suffer their third 5-0 whitewash of the series for the year.
Sri Lanka earlier lost by 5-0 margins to South Africa and India. It was Sri Lankas 12th straight one-day defeat for the year while for Pakistan the Champions Trophy champs it was their ninth consecutive win.
The saddest part was that the contest if it can be called that was all over before the dinner break  that is normally taken at the end of the first side batting. In Sri Lankas case their entire innings lasted just 26.2 overs and Pakistan came back to commence their run chase because there was plenty of time for the dinner break.
In the event Pakistan knocked the required runs off in a matter of 20.2 overs with nearly 30 overs to spare making 105 for one with Imam-ul-Haq scoring an unbeaten 45 and Fakhar Zaman 48.
It was a fine come back by Pakistan after being whitewashed 2-0 in the Test series by Sri Lanka.
The Lankan batting yesterday was destroyed by left-arm seamer Usman Khan Shinwari who finished with a handsome bag of 5 wickets for 34 runs playing in only his second ODI to take the Man of the Match award.
Having made his mark in the fourth ODI at Sharjah with a wicket in his first over Usman repeated that success again with two wickets in his opening over sending back newcomer Sadeera Samarawickrama for his second duck in his first two innings in ODI cricket (to join Sri Lankans Susil Fernando and Champaka Ramamayake) and the big wicket of Dinesh Chandimal for a first ball duck.
Shinwari was all over Sri Lanka in his opening spell adding the wickets of Upul Tharanga (8), Niroshan Dickwella (0) and Milinda Siriwardana (6) taking five wickets in 21 balls before he was rested.
Sri Lanka by then were limping at 20-5, and there seemed to be no end to their misery as Hasan Ali the current no. 1 bowler in ODI rankings got into the act with the wicket of Lahiru Thirimanne the last of the recognised batsmen for 19.
By the end of the first power play (10 overs) Sri Lanka were five down for 39 with Shinwari tearing through the wobbly Lankan batting line up with some high quality left arm seam bowling that had the batsmen in sixes and sevens and unable to counter what had hit them.
It was however not the worst power play for Sri Lanka for they were 23/6 (10) against South Africa at Paarl in 2012 when Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe ran through a much stronger line up than the current one comprising Tharanga, Dilshan, Sangakkara, Chandimal and Mahela Jayawardene.
There was not much resistance on this occasion from the tail and despite a cameo knock of 25 off 29 balls from Thisara Perera the innings quickly folded up with Hasan Ali and Shadab Khan wrapping up the tail with much ado.
Hasan Ali with 14 wickets in the series at an average of 11.28 beat Babar Azam (303 run, avg. 101) to the Man of the Series award.
The two teams will now meet in a three-match T20 international series starting on Thursday at Abu Dhabi.

An US team with the architects in Sri Lanka, experts and suppliers from over 20 countries across the globe joined to make ensure the high standards of PH is adhered to.
Most PH materials were not available in Sri Lanka and therefore had to be imported from Germany, India, Lebanon, Turkey and USA. Star is confident that this building will receive the Passive House Institute accreditation.
Established in 1908, Komar is an industry leader in the design, marketing, sourcing and distribution of Sleepwear, Intimates, Kids and Layering brands and is working with a network of factories in 12 different countries, a sourcing office in Hong Kong and distribution centers in the US and Europe, Komar continues to search for business opportunities worldwide.

The strong arm  of peace..!
China, has warned world leaders and politicians against meeting the Dalai Lama, saying it would be perceived as a major offence!
I smiled as I read this headline; Id seen the Dalai Lama many years ago; a man whos very personality exuded such peace and tranquility, one came away feeling blessed and sanctified. Id not seen any Tibetan army around him, no soldiers with machine guns, not seen any sign of bullet proof vest on him; everything around him was about calm and quiet, and then I had watched videos of the Chinese army; marching in brutal formation to scare the living daylights of the viewer. Faces impassive, trying to feign harshness, cruelty and glazed warlike look, jaws jutting in defiance, mouths curled in surly grimace. Ready to take down any foe who stood in their way.
Yet, scared of the strong arm of peace. The world has seen such muscle in many: Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Jesus, and others who changed the world not with guns but with a smile. Not killing bullets, but tender words. Not temper and angry rhetoric but gentle, soothing utterance. And always, yes always, its the strong arm of peace thats won in the end!
The men of war, do come back victorious, but are soon sent packing home. Churchill won the war, but four months later, lost an election. So, with others across the world.
We all, Im sure know Aesops fable about the wind and the sun:
The wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and the Sun said: I see a way to decide our dispute.
Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger You begin.
So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveler. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveler wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair.
Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveler, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on and took it off!
You see my friend, said the sun to the angry wind, Gentleness works!
Today I see Mr Windy Trump berating the rest of the world with his missile and machine gun, rousing a rabid Korean pup from his idle barking and building rifts and walls with the Islamic world. The same with China, as its soldiers glare and blow hate on countries that dont follow its thinking.
Somewhere behind a cloud the sun shines, patient and waiting, hoping to envelop an edgy, oppressed world with peace and harmony!
I remember the Dalai Lama, and will watch as China crumbles finally, under the strong arm of peace..!

The Institute of Supply and Materials Management produces world class professionals in purchasing and supply chain management as per demand.
This year the ISMM has increased the number of courses conducted in supply chain management to 26, the highest being the Graduate Diploma in Purchasing and Supply Chain Management which goes on for three years, GDPSM with dissertation contains 120 credits and it is designed equivalent to special degree offered by a recognized university in Sri Lanka functioning under the UGC. In addition ISMM will be increasing the number of workshops, consultancies, seminars etc. for the members and students to update their knowledge in supply chain management. ISMM is also strengthening their marketing strategies, in addition to the education. The quality of the ISMM products will also be developed and enhanced.
The four biggest organizations in the world, Google, Apple, Emerson and Face book is more concerned about supply chain management, said Nalin Silva President of ISMM. During the last three years where the highest temperature was reported in the world, supply chain management has taken measures to convert heat waste to solar power which has made a huge contribution to the globe.
However climate change - heat and water will certainly affect to the supply chain and the predicament of some companies due to extreme weather conditions is well known.
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. Therefore this year the ISMM increased the number of courses conducting in supply chain management.

The global economic trends through sustainable development taking place has changed for better with the involvement of the role of supply chain management since the new era of the 21st century. The largest retailer Alibaba does not have any retail shop in the world. The largest media provider, Facebook does not have any contact. Now companies do not hire people instead they outsource and therefore it is our responsible to develop and take supply chain and materials management to the next level in Sri Lanka and across the globe, Silva urged.

I feel happy. I feel great winning the first match in the first tournament coming in as number one, she told reporters after the match.
Its a nice thing that I can be number one at the end of the year but it is not the most important thing in this moment for me. I just want to win the matches that Im playing here. AFP

UN Rapporteur pleased with Lankas progress
UN Special Rapporteur Pablo de Greiff said that Sri Lanka had unprecedented levels of international support because of its willingness to engage on issues of human rights.
My five visits to the country manifest the openness and willingness on the part of the government to engage in constructive dialogue, he said.
The UN Special Rapporteur was speaking at the United Nations compound in Colombo yesterday,
In his comments, he commended the Sri Lankan governments transparency, while saying more could be done in regards to transitional justice.
De Greiff, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, was finishing a 14-day fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka.
He credited the government for establishing the Office of Missing Persons, which began soliciting member applications this week, and for the work of its Consultations Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms.
Yet, his assessment of the state of transitional justice in Sri Lanka was not entirely positive. The process is nowhere close to where it should have been more than two years later, he said.
The report of the Consultations Task Force, which, among other things, recommended the return of military-occupied land and a special court to prosecute alleged war crimes, should have been better received, he added.
De Greiff said he believed mechanisms of transitional justice, like credible investigations and memorializing the dead, would benefit all communities.
But he feared the term was being politically manipulated to appear as a threat to the majority community, he said.
He said victims in all communities, from those who suffered in the JVP uprisings in the 1970s to those who lost family members to terrorist attacks to those who were killed and injured in the final months of the war, could unite under a transitional justice agenda.
The aim should be to reform institutions so that the violations do not happen again, and help to lay the foundations for increased trust, he said.
De Greiff met with victims and their families in Aluthgama, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Matara, Mullaitivu, Puttalam and Trincomalee.
He also met with high-level public officials including the President, Prime Minister and the commanders of the Armed Forces.

The move follows a warning fromJapanthat the threat posed by Kim Jong-uns rogue state is critical and imminent.

Therefore, we have to take calibrated and different responses to meet with that level of threat.
General Mattis and Onodera were joined by South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo at a meeting of defence chiefs in the Philippines.
Song said: North Koreas provocative behaviour is becoming worse and worse.
General Mattis said the continued tests from Pyongyang threaten regional and global security.
The countries committed to steeping up joint air drills at the talks.
A joint statement said: The three ministers lauded collective efforts to expand information sharing on North Koreas nuclear and missile threats and enhance response capabilities, including the execution of multiple combined flight training missions with US bomber aircraft.
They reaffirmed that the three nations are committed to enhancing defence cooperation and to maintaining a rules-based order.
Accordingly, the ministers pledged to take necessary steps to bolster their ability to improve information sharing and strengthen responses to North Koreanthreats.

WEERAWANSAS CASE: FCID seeks AGs advice
The FCID has sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding two suspects, including National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government.
When the case came up before Colombo Fort Magistrate Ms Lanka Jayaratne, the Court was informed that the FCID was yet to receive the Attorney Generals advice regarding the two suspects. The FCID has sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding future legal action against the two suspects Wimal Weerawansa and Samantha Lokuhennadige under reference number CRS/14/17.
They are currently out on bail. Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for January 29 and the prosecution was directed to report on the progress of the inquiry on next hearing date.
The FCID, conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had allegedly given his written and verbal approval to commit these offences which was punishable under the Public Property Act and the Penal Code, while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions.
However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID told Court. The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had allegedly given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a Breport in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs.91 million to the state.

Xi Jinping 'most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong'

China's ruling Communist Party has voted to enshrine Xi Jinping's name and ideology in its constitution, elevating him to the level of founder Mao Zedong.
The unanimous vote to incorporate "Xi Jinping Thought" happened at the end of the Communist Party congress, China's most important political meeting.
Xi has steadily increased his grip on power since becoming leader in 2012.
This move means that any challenge to Xi will now be seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.
More than 2,000 delegates gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of the People for the final approval process to enshrine "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era" into the Communist Party constitution of China.
At the end of the process, delegates were asked if they had any objections, to which they responded with loud cries of "none", reported journalists at the scene.
Previous Chinese Communist Party leaders have had their ideologies incorporated into theparty's constitutionor thinking, but none, besides founder Mao Zedong, have had their philosophy described as "thought", which is at the top of the ideological hierarchy.
Only Mao and Deng Xiaoping have had their names attached to their ideologies - and Deng's name was only added to the constitution after his death.
Why is this important
But schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will now have to join 90 million Communist Party members in studying "Xi Jinping Thought" on the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The expression "new era" is the party's way of saying this is the third chapter of modern China.
If the first was Chairman Mao uniting a country devastated by civil war, and the second was getting rich under Deng Xiaoping, this new era is about even more unity and wealth at the same time as making China disciplined at home and strong abroad.
Enshrining all of this under Xi Jinping's name in the party constitution means rivals cannot now challenge China's strongman without threatening Communist Party rule.
What is 'Xi Jinping Thought'
At first glance, "Xi Jinping Thought" may seem like vague rhetoric, but it describes the communist ideals Xi has continuously espoused throughout his rule.
Its 14 main principles emphasise the Communist Party's role in governing every aspect of the country, and also include:
A call for "complete and deep reform" and "new developing ideas"
A promise of "harmonious living between man and nature" - this is a call for improved environmental conservation, and could refer to the stated aim to have the bulk of China's energy needs supplied by renewables
An emphasis on "absolute authority of the party over the people's army" - which comes amidwhat analysts callthe largest turnover of senior military officials in modern Chinese history
An emphasis on the importance of "'one country two systems" and reunification with the motherland - a clear reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan
What else has been happening
More than 2,000 delegates have spent the week-long congress confirming picks for provincial party chiefs, governors and heads of some state-owned enterprises.
On Tuesday, they finalised the make-up of top bodies such as the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
What happens next
On Wednesday, the new Central Committee will decide who gets to be in the higher-level Politburo.
Though delegates get some say, in reality the elections are guided by the party's top leadership where at each stage voters pick from pre-selected candidates.
Also on Wednesday, the party will reveal the new members of its pinnacle body, the Politburo Standing Committee. Xi is widely expected to remain as party leader, while prominent Xi ally and anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan has stepped down and will not be in the next formation of the committee.
Those in the Standing Committee will be especially scrutinised. Analysts say its make-up may give signs of how long Xi plans to stay on at the top of the party - he is expected to remain at the helm until at least 2022 - or any possible successors.
Xi's term ruling China has been marked by significant development, a push for modernisation and increasing assertiveness on the world stage.
However, it has also seen growing authoritarianism, censorship and a crackdown on human rights.

Denying allegations by the committee appointed by Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister which claimed that a tusker valued at Rs. 260 million had been imported from Myanmar in a fraudulent manner for Dalada Maligawa in 2007, Nilanga Dela said no transaction had occurred and all documents related to the tuskers are available at the Buddha Sasana Ministry, Department of Buddhist Affairs and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Myanmar.
The two tuskers, Kaimanshu and Motaka were donated by Myanmar to Dalada Maligawa in 2007 and they were given new names - Myanmar Raja and Buruma Raja. A Sri Lankan shipping company had sponsored the transportation of these tuskers. However, the Maligawa had to spend nearly Rs. 1 million for two mahouts, vet surgeons and a delegation from Myanmar who visited Sri Lanka along with the tuskers,the Diyawadana Nilame said.

Nine years since the end of the war, many promises and false starts, Meena, a 56 year old grandmother, is still waiting for a solid roof, four proper walls and a cement floor to replace the zinc sheets of the makeshift shelter that she and her extended family had occupied since 2011. That was the year in which, the government gave her back the land, where a four room, 2,000 square foot gallant house once stood, in a village close to Killinochchi.
My late husbands father built that house. Our children were born there, Meena told a visitor last week, while waiting to hear of a new, innovative, mud and cement brick house that may eventually be given by World Vision and Habitat for Humanity, two non-governmental organisations, who plan to deliver 750 homes to families like Meenas, scattered around the Killinochchi district.
According to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, which is tasked with re-housing families who have lost their homes during the war, more than 70,000 families are still waiting for a solid roof to shelter them, nine years after the war ended.
The people have been waiting for a long time. Most of them lost their homes long before the war ended, but despite the government promising that houses will be built, there hasn't been much progress, a former government official, who preferred anonymity, told Daily News.
Houses not viable
It is in this backdrop that Sunday Observer wrote last week that a request for proposal (RFP) issued by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation for 50,000 houses for war displaced families in the North and the East is causing concern to community groups and technical experts who are questioning the viability of the project.
war displaced and homeless, waiting for new homes
This request for proposal is the second avatar of a controversial plan by the government to provide these much needed housing to the war displaced. In the first attempt, made in 2015 by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, and Hindu Religious Affairs, the government sought to build 65,000 low cost housing units. However, that plan and the tender was scuttled when community groups and technical experts raised issues about the winning bid, a flat-packed Chinese built light steel and aluminium structure, marketed under the Protea brand name of Arcelor Mittal, a steel and mining giant headquartered out of Luxembourg, a European tax-haven.
Arcelor Mittal first priced one house at approximately Rs. 2.25 million rupees, but later adjusted the pricing to approximately Rs. 1.5 million by deleting a package of furniture and electrical goods. Community groups and others were quick to point out that similar flat packed units can be sourced directly from China for less than US$3,000 or approximately Rs 450,000 at the prevailing exchange rate at that time.
A report compiled by engineers Prof. Priyan Dias, Prof. Rangika Halwatura, and Architect Varuna de Silva of the University of Katubedda was to state that when compared to the block wall houses, the steel houses suffer from several key drawbacks including inadequate foundations, insufficient roof support, risk of steel corrosion despite the coatings provided, poor ventilation, poor or non-existent capacity for extension or repair, much shorter lifespan, unlikely to create a sense of ownership, very unlikely to foster the local economy and generate employment.
They suggested that the way forward is to construct block wall houses, while finding ways to overcome any disadvantages they may have, for example, finding new sources of natural resources; alternative technologies to reduce natural resource usage; arranging financing.
Following this report and extensive lobbying by community groups and legal challenges mounted by the Tamil National Alliance, the government sought to partially cancel the tender and re-bid for 50,000 houses.
The new RFP, according to sources, is based on the recommendations made in the technical report made by the Katubedda University team, but has gone beyond the remit of low-cost housing by specifying material and accessories that will push the basic cost beyond Rs 1.9 million, twice the cost of a housing unit that community groups proposed to the government, based on community labour participation and funding by a consortium of local banks.
Re-tender brings in new issues
Prof. Rangika Halwatura, a member of the team that compiled the technical report, told Daily News last week that although the governments decision to move from the previous tender is commendable, the current tender specifications too raise concerns.

They have specified the construction material as well as the plan that is something that I was taken back with. When you restrict the scope and specify the material and plans, the fact of innovation will not come into the picture.
According to Prof. Halwatura, the best option would have been to give a minimum standard but not into every minute detailing.
He further pointed out concerns over environmental pollution that can be caused by excessive Calicut tiles and brick production to cater to a larger demand and the soil excavation it requires will draw in an imbalance.
Timber is the most sustainable material in the world for construction. However, our timber manufacturers are not in the habit of replanting. So specifying timber as a construction material while knowing there are many other innovative and cost effective alternatives is a disaster, Prof. Halwatura said.
He further suggested that if arrangements can be made to make the specification open, then people could suggest the options and the technical evaluation team can go through all these innovative ideas and select the best. This is about the sustainability of the project and final achievement as a country.
The tender has attempted to mitigate some of the issues that arose from the previous tender by breaking the bid down to 100 packages of 500 houses each, to make it possible for a smaller scale contractor to take part in the bid. However, it then imposes bid conditions that only large-scale contractors can match  a 400 million annual construction turnover for the past five-years, totalling Rs. Two Billion per 500 house package and a Rs. three million bid bond per package. Successful bidders must also provide 100 percent financing with a term sheet to be provided by a bank or financing institute with interest on a soft loan basis and extended repayment periods. Preferably, the repayment period shall be not less than fifteen (15) years including the grace period. The grace period shall be not less than two (02) years. Preference will be given to extended grace period repayment period and interest rate from a national perspective, the RFP states.
Only a handful of local construction firms will be able to satisfy these conditions, even for a single package of 500 houses each. If you bid for more than a single package, for example, two packages for one thousand houses, your bid condition of 400 million annual construction turnover becomes 800 million and the five-year total becomes four billion rupees. There are no more than five local contractors who can satisfy these conditions if its more than two packages, an industry source told Daily News.
Maintaining Quality
Dr. (Eng.) S. S. Sivakumar, head of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna, told Daily News that while the foremost point to bear in mind is immediate need of the people, in spite of that the urgency the quality must be maintained as well.
We have problems in getting material and labour in the Northern region. These were some of the main factors that led to the proposal to build pre-fabricated houses. If the finances are immediately available, the houses can be constructed within a budget of Rs. 1 million or 1.2 million. For about 500  550 square feet with two rooms, kitchen, and an outside bathroom. If the finances are not available, the contractor has to come with a finance package that will cause accumulation of compound interest, which in turn will increase the cost to about Rs. 1.8  1.9 million per house, Dr. Sivakumar said.
He echoed Prof. Halwatura stating that another aspect that should be revisited in the current RFP is the requirement of sand and clay blocks, Calicut tiles and timber frames. Supplies for such a vast quantity of timber, Calicut roof tiles and river sand for the construction of fifty thousand houses is not that easy, Dr. Sivakumar said.
Another requirement is that the walls should be constructed to a thickness of 9 inches when a wall with a thickness of 4 to 4.5 inches would be sufficient. These are factors that should be re considered and will affect in reducing the building cost, according to Dr. Sivakumar.
Getting good quality Calicut tiles in such a vast quantity is an impossible task. It is therefore better to go for aluminium roofing with steel frame. Window and door frames too can be done using aluminium and not timber, which is a better option. Oxidised aluminium can be used in these weather conditions. We can also opt for UPC doors and windows.
When the Daily News contacted the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, he was of the opinion that the bidders will have to comply with some requirements, but mostly are broader specifications.
Very broad specifications are given and employers and bidders are given the opportunity to bid accordingly, but within the said parameters of five hundred square foot area two bedroom houses. You cannot have flexibility in that because one cannot have three bedrooms and another two. Those generally set parameters are already in place, and other than that we have not been very rigid as such. But it has to be within a model which accommodates good socially acceptable models, the Secretary said.
Dr. Sivakumar and Prof. Halwatura, both professionals in the engineering field are of a different opinion about the hard coding of the specifications in the RFP. Their opinions belie Sivagnanasothys statement that the RFP is not rigid.

Australian batting coach Graeme Hick to pit wits against England in Ashes
SYDNEY - Former England batsman Graeme Hick and bowling coach Troy Cooley will pit their wits against the tourists when they mentor a Cricket Australia XI in a four-day Ashes tour match in Townsville next month.
Hick played 65 tests for England around the turn of the century and is currently Australias batting coach, while Cooley was Englands bowling coach in the lead-up to their 2005 Ashes breakthrough triumph before returning home.
The tour match, which will take place in the tropical Queensland city from Nov. 15-18, is one of three England will play before and during the Ashes series.
Former Australia pace bowler Ryan Harris will coach the CA XI in the first four-day match under lights at the Adelaide Oval from Nov. 8-11, while John Davison will lead the locals in the third in Perth from Dec. 9-10.
Former test opener Chris Rogers will assist both Harris and Davison, who is Australias national spin-bowling coach.
These matches will see Australias talented young players testing themselves against a world-class opponent in England, surrounded by coaches who have worked at the national level, said CAs Pat Howard.

Bandula Warnapura the pioneer in Test cricket fires a salvo
With all the turmoil going around in the cricketing circles nowadays, I had the opportunity to interview Bandula Warnapura., I found Bandulamalli as a down to earth, placid guy who knew his subject inside out. He also allowed me a peep at the vagaries of cricket which has caused turbulence not only with the cricket fans but also with the man on the street. In next to no time I expect the housewives to join the band wagon in finding a solution that has caused untold misery to the lovers of cricket.
Bandula was not only the first Test cricket captain but he had the privilege of facing the first ball and scoring the first run in that inaugural Test Match against England in 1982 at the P Sara Oval. He is an old boy of Nalanda College Colombo. Bandula captained Nalanda College Colombo first XI cricket team in 1971. He has worked as an ICC match referee and an umpire, and is also a certified cricketing coach. He has served as the coach for the Sri Lanka national cricket team, before he was appointed Director of Coaching in 1994. He became Director of Operations of Sri Lanka Cricket in 2001.He functioned in that post for eight years before he resigned in 2008.
In 1966 Nalanda College did not have a cricket captain as such. Nelson Mendis arrived at the scene during this period and became the the Master in Charge of cricket. He was accommodated in the hostel. To his surprise Mendis found out at 2.30 pm the boys have not started practice proper but instead they were fooling around. Mendis summoned Bandula since he was vying for the captaincy spot. To Bandulas surprise Nelson Mendis did not offer the captaincy to him first up, instead he wanted one day to check Bandulas credentials.
The following day, Nelson Mendis turned up sharp at 2.30 pm at the grounds, smartly attired and as usual not a hair out of place, to his utter dismay, he found the ground empty. Bandula recalls that the first thing he did was to call up a meeting with him and his co cricketers. Then he looked up at Bandula and questioned him as to who the appointed captain was Bandula said he was, but Nelson Mendis replied with a firm no, because he wanted to check Bandulas records, Bandula states that he came down to earth immediately, he also noted that Mendis had a deep voice. However, the very next day Bandula was made the captain and after that Mendis as the master in charge and the coach got on well with the captain.
Bandula recalls that Vaas Gunewardene (a nippy medium pacer who gave me a thumping whack on my ribs during the 1966 big match whilst battling my way to a well grafted half a century at the P Sara Oval), was the coach before Nelson Mendis took over. Bandula stated that Mendis took charge of the under 12 to under 16 cricketers and never interfered with their natural talents. Bandula also had a special word for his Guru late Mr Gerry Gooneratne, who attended practices from 4.30 to 5.30 and by and large was a silent observer who corrected the finer points of his charges in a meticulous way. Bandula also points out that those who came under the wing of Gerry Gooneratne had to speak to him in English because Gerry hardly understood Sinhala; this was in a way beneficial to them so that they could be fairly fluent in the Queens English.
Reverting back to Nelson Mendis, Bandula adds that Mendis attended practices from 2.30 to 6.00 pm, and what really took place was that Mendis fed the basics to the charges, for Gerry Gooneratne to give the final touches. This combination of two brilliant coaches produced many outstanding Nalandian cricketers of international repute, Including Bandula Waranapura, Lalith Kaluperuma, Asanka Gurusinha, Kumar Dharmasena and the list goes on.
Bandula was also keen to point out that there was another set of coaches, namely Gerry Gooneratne and one Kandaswamy, Bandula regrets that he cannot recollect Mr Kandaswamys first name. This combination produced another batch of illustrious cricketers starting with Stanley Jayasinghe, Carl and Valentine Obeysekera (twins), Ashley de Silva, Chandrasiri Weerasinghe (highly underrated), Sarath Silva, Amarasiri Gunasena et al Gerry Gooneratne was the common factor in producing all these fantastic cricketers with a lot of flair, unlike the copy book brigade which was also in the limelight in that era.
Bandula also recollects one Mr Romiel who was prominent as a cricket coach before Nelson Mendis came into the picture. During those days it was common for the coaches to spend their personal money on their charges, such was the commitment and the dedication they had for their posts, nowadays most of the coaching kades which has sprouted all over Colombo are just keen on lining their pockets laments Bandula.
When inquired about the present sad state of affairs, Bandula was of the view that the batting order should be fixed without shuffling the order like a pack of cards, interestingly he mentions about strike rates which should be as follows;
FORMATS STRIKE RATES
TESTS 60 to 70 runs
ODIS 70 to 85 runs
T20 100 and above
Bandula mentions that this is common sense and not rocket science so people should stick to the basics.
Another interesting point of his is that when a replacement is made to an injured player, the player who gets the opportunity for the replacement should make the best use of it, most of the time what happened was that after one opportunity he has been discarded to the sin bin or he himself commits suicide by going crash bang from the word go and gets out and the rot sets in. Bandula suggests that there should be only 10 or 12 teams in the top league where as of now there are 24 teams and it dilutes the player quality. He is also quick to point out that some of the players are benefitted by playing in certain clubs.
Bandula went on to state that the Sports Law should also be changed, he says that the selectors are appointed by the Sports Minister, and the team which is selected by selectors goes for the Ministerial approval, this set up is like a wheel within a wheel. He stated that this system should be done away with as soon as possible.
Interestingly Bandula was invited to be the Chairman of Selectors not so long ago but he refused due to the existing Sports Law. Bandula mentions that if everyone is given a free hand, e.g. top to bottom to work towards the development of the game he is willing to join hands and further states that the Pallekele Stadium was developed under his leadership when he was working as the Director of Operations at no extra allowance or fee.
He was given a free hand by the then chairman and a close associate of his and the cost was less than 50% of the other stadiums built.
This is food for thought!

BMW headquarters searched by EU investigators
BMW has confirmed its head office was searched this week by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among five German carmakers.
EU investigators are looking into allegations that BMW, Daimler, VW, Audi and Porsche colluded to limit their spending on emissions technology.
BMW said EU staff had inspected its Munich offices, adding that it was assisting the regulators in their work.
Also on Friday, Daimler said it had filed an application for leniency.
The firm, which owns Mercedes-Benz, also has no current plans to set aside funds for possible fines, according to chief financial officer Bodo Uebber.
EU and German regulators are looking at allegations that the companies collaborated for decades on many aspects of development and production, disadvantaging customers and suppliers.
BMW said it wanted to make clear the distinction between potential violations of EU antitrust law, and the illegal manipulation of exhaust emissions, which it denies.
In July, Volkswagen defended its record after allegations that it teamed up with other German car giants to breach EU cartel rules.
VW said it was normal for manufacturers to exchange technical information to speed up innovation. (BBC)

Austin: Retired sprint king Usain Bolt has vowed to pursue his dream of playing professional football but admits he will not "embarrass" himself if his goal is out of reach. The Jamaican track and field superstar, who retired from athletics after August's World Championships, has long spoken of trying his hand at soccer and has been invited to train with Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund.
Bolt, the 100m and 200m world record holder and eight-time Olympic champion, insists he is serious about his football dream despite scepticism that at, 31, his advanced age will count against him. "It's a personal goal, I don't care what people really think about it," Bolt told reporters on the sidelines of the Formula One Grand Prix in Austin on Sunday. "I am not going to lie to myself, if I feel I can't do it, I am going to say 'Forget this'. I am not going to embarrass myself.

The Foreigner
Chan vs Bond
He is mostly known as the martial arts maestro because of the recent projects he did but Jackie Chan has proven his mettle in the investigative thriller movies in many timeless movies like Dragon Blade and the Rush Hour series.
Now after a considerable span the seasoned actor jumps back into action movies with The Foreigner. Directed by Bond director Martin Campbell, the film sees Chan take on a character which has similar traits to the legendary James Bond.
Chan takes on the role of a man seeking vengeance for the death of his daughter in a bloody London bombing. His equal is a grizzled former 007 himself, Pierce Brosnan as former IRA member and Irish Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy. Brosnan attempts to politick his way around the aftermath of the bombing, which is claimed by a rogue IRA cell.
The Foreigner is adapted from Stephen Leathers novel The Chinaman. This is evident in the manner in which Chans character is addressed as the Chinaman throughout the story though his actual name is Quan Ngoc Minh.
A drawback in the movie is that the creators seem to have decided to take Chan and scatter a few antagonist roles around him. There is plenty of action but little depth or variety. The cat and mouse game which is found in many films of this nature is seen here as well. Though it keeps the viewers engaged, it can be a bore at times.
Chan stands out in his role as the brooding yet simple and serious. The sober nature of his character is what sets him apart from the comic action characters he has taken up so far in many projects. He is a father who is morning the loss of his beloved child and this sets him in a new light in the audiences eyes. Hence slapstick comedy is not a part of this project. The film is too dark for any comic scenes.
One of the most powerful moments in the film is when police officers visit Minh. As question him about who he would like to call his reply tugs the viewers heartstrings. The fact that he has no one else in his family is reflected by his blank expression which signals his loss of hopes and emotion. such emotions are raw and compliment the characters.
Brosnan too does well as the baddie. His character is also modified to cater to the present setup.
Campbells Bond influence is present in The Foreigner. The director who rebooted movies like Golden Eye and Casino Royale manages to pull it all off with some smart thinking and directing skills. However it lacks aspirations to really stand out as a masterpiece. The Foreigner may not exactly be a winner but it is no loser either.

Changing face of Provincial Councils
The idea of Provincial Councils (PCs) is not a phenomenon new to Sri Lanka. Provincial councils were the outcome of Transfer of power to politically elected bodies under the concept of Devolution. It is an autonomous body deriving its power from the constitution and it is not subordinate to the central government or to parliament or inferior in status to them.
Provincial level is responsible for translating the national policies into provincial development plans. Established in February 1988 under the Provincial Councils Act No 42 of 1987 as a requirement to the 13th Amendment to the constitution it was a political move. Powers not given explicitly to the provincial councils are reserved to the centre governor.
Provincial councils were declared to be colossal waste of funds and created another bureaucratic layer adding more public expenditure, each provincial council had over 100 staff grade officers and over 500 clerical and technical staff, allegations of irregularities, fraud, misappropriation of funds.
Provincial development in Sri Lanka
Some of the large reservoirs over 25 acres come under the central government and small reservoirs come under the provincial councils have been neglected due to managerial problems and lack of funds. Directions enumerating the access to the heritage sites are invisible.
There are no directions shown to the public, researchers who come for frequent visits to heritage sites in Uva province. Some of the name boards have faded away and road network has destroyed. Minor work such as maintaining name boards in order to facilitate foreigners and local guests to visit heritage sites has been neglected.
In such a way provincial governance is not close to the hearts of the people in Sri Lanka.
Those institutions are operating with less beneficial to the public. It is my belief that once an individual or an organisation starts to think about its impact on society, it will almost automatically begin to improve processes to help others.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We cannot depend on the provincial councils or local governance always rather we need out of box thinking in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
It is the most holistic way for companies or organisations to look at their social (and environmental) impact. But what a lot of companies think when they hear CSR, is that they can give back to society only once they have become very successful/profitable. However, CSR goes beyond that.
CSR is something that can be attained even as an organisation is growing.
It can start very close to home by addressing the employees of the organisation and then expanding their stakeholder circle to include second and third degree levels of influence.
Eventually the organisation will be run in a way that positively impacts all stakeholders and thus ticks all the CSR boxes.
The Citizen Report Card (CRC) initiative in Banglore (1993) is an excellent simple yet powerful tool to provide public agencies with systematic feedback from users of public services such as transport, health services, sewage disposal. By collecting feedback on the quality and adequacy of public services from actual users, CRC provides a rigorous basis and a proactive agenda for communities, civil society organisations and/or local governments to engage in a dialogue with service providers to improve the delivery of public services. This kind of a mechanism is essential in Sri Lanka to enhance the quality and adequacy of public service especially in case of provincial councils.
Focus on provincial development
Very little revenue is raised directly by provincial councils and heavily depends on the grant given by the central government. A platform need to be created in compilation of thought pieces from local and regional contributors from public, private and academic sectors, intended to contribute a voice that focuses on regional development. All depend on its people, their attitude towards a change in future development landscape. We need to share the respective wisdom of our local expertise on the challenges in leadership in provincial councils and local governance in order to develop for the betterment of the citizens.
Challenges always exist and require constant re-examination. At present there is a decline in volunteerism and charity giving, as a result of social volatility and economic uncertainties. In such a circumstances serving to the public is a challenge.
Creating social impact
At present everyone is talking about creating social impact. All the development activities need a significant, positive change that addresses a pressing social challenge. Many of the development programmes in Sri Lanka was not people oriented and hence continuation of such programmes are questionable. Since, ground realities were not emanated from people, outcome of the projects cannot be reached. There cannot be good governance in such a circumstances. Processes and institutions need to produce results that meet the needs of society while making the best use of resources at their disposal.
Last, but not finally, they should provide ethical service. This means that whatever provincial councils and local governance provide, they should be able to justify as useful in the sense of helping public to move towards their appropriate goals. There should be cost transparency to the public and a fair distribution of revenue. Further, as responsible citizens in Sri Lanka the most appropriate way is to be the best version of ourselves to everyone. This applies not only to individuals, but to all blocks and levels of society.

Chase stars as Windies dominate Zimbabwe
Bulawayo: Roston Chase and Kraigg Brathwaite led the way with the bat as the West Indies strengthened their grip on the first Test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club on Monday.
After Brathwaite made 86 at the top of the innings, Chase scored an unbeaten 91 to take the West Indies to 369 for eight at stumps on the third day.
The tourists now hold an overall lead of 429, meaning Zimbabwe will face a world-record chase in the fourth innings.
The two batsmen took very different approaches to their innings, with Brathwaites patience paying off in the morning session as the West Indies added just 67 runs for the loss of Kyle Hope for 43.
With the heat and general frustration taking its toll on the Zimbabwean bowlers, Chase was able to cash in later in the day.
I thought Kraigg played a really good innings, said Chase. He wore down the bowlers for the other batsmen so that when we got out there they werent as fresh, which didnt allow them to be as consistent as they wanted to be.
Zimbabwe did enjoy a brief period of success in the hour before tea, when the West Indies fell from 174 for two to 244 for six.
Brathwaites innings was ended when he was trapped lbw by off-spinner Sikandar Raza, before Kyle Jarvis used the second new ball to dismiss Shai Hope for 44.
Left-arm spinner Sean Williams also enjoyed success with the harder ball, as he had Jermaine Blackwood stumped and Shane Dowrich caught at slip.
However, captain Jason Holder counter-attacked with a run-a-ball 24, and Chase continued to score briskly.
My plan was to be aggressive towards the bowlers, to get the field changed around a bit and get some of the catchers from nearby away from the bat, to make it easier for me to play my natural game, said Chase.
When Holder was dismissed by Graeme Cremer shortly after tea, Zimbabwes hot day in the field looked to be nearing an end, before Devendra Bishoo hit a feisty 44 in an 82-run stand for the eighth wicket with Chase.
The partnership was terminated on the stroke of stumps when Cremer had Bishoo caught on the boundary to record his seventh wicket of the match, but Zimbabwe still face a long battle to save the game.
Everyone knows its going to be tough, but you cant go out there and be negative and hand the game over, said fast bowler Jarvis, who is playing his first Test since April 2013.
If they bat for another session, we have to bat out five sessions. I think the best case is that we could get a draw out of this game. AFP

Chinese PPPs making  steady progress - Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that public-private partnerships (PPPs) in China (A1 stable) continues to grow in number and investment value, with more projects advancing to the implementation stage this year.
Support from the central government has resulted in positive regulatory developments in Chinas Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework, thereby enhancing the financing options available to PPP developers and investors, says Osbert Tang, a Moodys Vice President and Senior Analyst.
And, regulations that increase transparency and improve investor protections are positive for the ongoing development of the PPP sector, adds Tang. Moodys explains that the improved regulatory transparency of longer-term financing provides greater clarity to private sector investors.
Moreover, the increased availability of longer term financing will likely increase the attractiveness of Chinas PPP projects to the private sector, because it will allow investors to better match the long-term cash flow from such projects.

CIM SL hosts Talking Point programme on brand relevance
The Chartered Institute of Marketing Sri Lanka concluded its third Talking Point programme under the thought provoking topic Is Branding Losing its Relevance
The keynote speaker was Imal Fonseka, Group CEO, Fairway Holdings while the panel consisted of Makshoodh Meerasaibu, Marketing Director, Home Care, Foods and Water, Unilever Sri Lanka, Shalin Balasuriya, Co-Founder, luxury ayurveda brand Spa Ceylon, and Tharanga Gunasekera, Head of Marketing and Communications, HSBC Sri Lanka, who moderated the discussions.
Attending the programme were a host of senior managers and executives keen to know how to manage and influence the personality and character of their brands for the local market.
Cautioning the audience, Fonseka said, Our approach in marketing and branding is no longer what it was. You have to re-look at what you are doing. Look at brand objectives, as a brand person, take the leadership and start seeing the future. As marketers you have what nobody else has - you represent the customer and understand the customer best. Igniting the passion is what it is all about - drive the change, create the change.
Stressing on key enablers, he noted supply chain, innovation, differentiation are vital to influence customer experience. As brand people enhance your scope and influence within the enterprise and that way your role will be more relevant in the future.
Urging participants on the importance of sustainability and differentiation, he said, Your sustainability and success will be based on your ability to create disruption in your business model. Anyone anywhere can create a brand and succeed overnight but you need to be ahead of the curve, understand the curve and find a space to be really connected with your consumers, find ways to make it more relevant to the market.
Tharanga Gunasekera said, With todays consumers becoming web-savvy, the consumer is now more empowered. The brand is seen as a promise, relationship and an experience.
Commenting from a FMCG perspective, Makshoodh Meerasaibu said the fundamental eight principles of branding are very relevant. However, the consumer is evolving and is constantly seeking to change. He advised the audience to constantly be cautious about how to keep pace with the ever-changing demands and to know whether branding is going to communicate or is branding becoming facilitators or enablers of conversation.
Shalin Balasuriya said, Attention spans and brand lifespans are getting shorter. We need to be continuously giving our consumers new experiences, tweaking their interest and that is what we do.
Balasuriya opined that branding relevance relies on transformational innovation. We keep learning from our consumers and the brand lives in the mind of the consumer. You need to engage with the customer and start connecting with peoples lifestyles so that you are relevant to your consumers, he said.
The programme concluded with a vibrant and lively question and answer session between panelists and the audience.

Bouquet for Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat
Recently I visited Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat for an official matter. No sooner I entered the secretariat complex/premises, a security guard showed me a place to park the vehicle. Then we went into the main building, where a large waiting/sitting/visiting area with comfortable seats was nicely set.
At the reception, the officer on duty offered his service to assist me and then correctly gave me directions to the District Secretarys (formally GA - Government Agent) office. The officer at the reception told me the acting DS (from Kandy) had just left. Upon my enquiry that whom should I meet next, he directed me showing another office room to meet the next in command.
At that place the officer (Head Quarter - AGA I guessed) welcomed us, offered seats and - after quickly finishing her work at hand - listened to us attentively. She took spot action taking photocopies of my documents and took my contacts to inform me the progress.
As not only satisfied clients may be possibly delighted or perhaps astonished ones we came back to the car park, where we were discussing this fantastic experience. I saw this lady officer going out. During the friendly chat we came to know she was a product of Peradeniya University. The University of Peradeniya is a leading university in Sri Lanka. The University of Peradeniya is where I started to believe myself. It is the place where I consider myself so proud and unique. The place actually became a turning point in Sri Lankas history of academic education. All these happened within half an hour! This is a pleasant experience in a government office!
I propose all other district secretariats to benchmark the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat in providing a first class service to the public!

Committee bares alleged corruption in elephant trading
The Committee to report on the allegations of corruption in issuing of licenses for elephants reported that Wildlife Conservation Department officials had allegedly engaged in corrupt transactions with businessmen in trading elephants between 2011 and 2014.
The Committee report had been handed over to the authorities on May 25, 2016 and reportedly no steps had been taken in that connection.
According to the report of the one-man Committee of retired Supreme Court Justice Nimal Edward Dissanayake, during the said period, Wildlife Conservation Department officials had allegedly maintained more than 100 fake files stating that the elephants had had died. The report also stated that details of them had been erased and other details entered together with new photographs of other elephants pasted to make forged documents. There were around 50 such files.
According to the report there were some forged documents without any details and the suspects should be dealt according to the law and indictments filed before the High Court.
The report also has that an elephant had been imported for the Dalada Maligawa from Myanmar in 2007 and a sum of Rs.261 million had been allegedly misappropriated by a person who was involved in the transaction.
The Committee also found that the actual value of this elephant was only around Rs.10 to Rs.15 million in the open market. It also recommended that the culprits be brought to book after conducting an investigation.
The one-man Committee was appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers under instructions of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera in 2015 to report on the allegations of corruption in the registration and issuing of licences for elephants and permits under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).
