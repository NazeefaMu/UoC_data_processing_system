Govt. strongly considering resumption of ferry service
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga today said the government is strongly considering the possibility of resuming the ferry service between Rameshwaram and Thalaimannar.
He was addressing the World Tourism Day official celebration at the University of Jaffna recently.
The Minister said the government was keen to proceed with the plan as it would strongly benefit the Northern Province, including its tourism sector.
The Minister said Palaly Airport which operated as a military airport for a long time had been opened up for civilian transport.
The domestic airport, he said, would drastically increase the number of tourists visiting Jaffna as they would be able to fly to Palaly from the Bandaranaike International Airport. The Tourism Minister said the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) would soon open up a sub-office in Jaffna to expedite the industrys growth in the province.
He requested the Tamil diaspora to return to the country and invest in the tourism industry in the North.
Whenever I meet members of the Tamil diaspora when I go overseas, I request them to come back. That way, they will help themselves and their community. Tourism offers a great opportunity to the Northern Province, he said.
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran urged the tourism authorities to tap into the full tourism potential of the North by resolving bottlenecks in fund allocation, industry expertise, and planning. The Chief Minister said his province had many places that could be developed into provincial tourism hubs through the right strategies and fund allocation.
We need more tourism experts in our province to realise its full potential, the Chief Minister said, adding that he had presented several comprehensive plans to the government on tourism development in the Northern Province.
Wigneswaran, highlighting the importance of the tourism industry for better revenue generation, said the scenic islands in Jaffna and other beaches in the province could be developed into major tourist attractions, similar to those in the Eastern Province.
He said that although a strip between Palaithivu and Pallikuda had been earmarked for a ferry service that would benefit the tourism industry, the process had come to a halt due to Navy occupation in the area.
The Chief Minister attributed the industrys slow growth to external factors such as anomalies in fund allocation and the absence of inclusive planning.
We have no reservations about working with the government or tourism bodies of the central government as long as our regional rights are not violated, Wigneswaran said.
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Chairman Kavan Ratnataka promised to fast track measures to develop tourism in the province in a holistic and sustainable manner.
Tourism, I am sure, will be the number one or number two sector in Jaffna. But the industry in the province should grow in a manner that preserves the authenticity of the tourism experience it offers. You, in Jaffna, should remain who you are. At the same time, the growth of the industry should be sustainable, he said.

Batticaloa Campus refutes allegations:
Institute enables all to pursue higher education
The Batticaloa Campus institute has been established in Welikanda to enable students throughout the country including those in the Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces to pursue higher education.
The campus, registered with the BoI as a private Higher Education Institution, will function under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and the UGC.
However, various parties and individuals are engaged in an organised campaign to mislead the public by making false and malicious statements to the media about the Batticaloa Campus institute, the Media Director of the Batticaloa Campus said in a statement issued on September 26.
The allegations made by these persons to the effect that this university is a religious university teaching Sharia Law and it is the largest mosque in South Asia, is completely false and baseless, the statement said.
The university has provided opportunities to pursue all courses recommended by the Ministry of Higher Education and nothing else.
As a private university, the Batticaloa Campus has provided opportunities for children of people belonging to all communities with economic constraints to pursue higher education at minimum cost. When it is opened during the first quarter of next year, it will give the answer to all false accusations made against it.
The statement added that Sinhala and Tamil contractors were engaged in the construction of the campus project. But one contractor had completed work valued at only Rs. 650 million when he had been paid Rs. 950 million. This contractor had left some unserviceable machinery and equipment at the construction site without removing them. This had been reported to the CID in a special complaint. The campus had not forcibly withheld any of this machinery as alleged. Chairman of the Campus State Minister M. L. A. M. Hisbullah, his son and other officers of the institution have given evidence at the investigation held into this matter which has also been reported to the Valachchenai Court. Court had not issued any enjoining order against State Minister Hisbullah or his son or issued warrants on them as alleged in certain distorted news reports.
The statement added that the management of the Batticaloa Campus would institute legal action against parties trying to mislead the public by issuing false and malicious statements to the media.

Worlds first ice skating dog
Meet the incredible ice-skating dog - a lovable Labrador which spends its days at the rink after being saved from euthanasia.
Benny, five, has been learning to skate for a year after his owner, former coach Cheryl Del Sangro, 56, took him along to a practice on a whim.
During that first foray on the ice last winter, adorable Benny scooted around on the ice after his owner, gleefully - and skillfully - picking up pucks.
It inspired Cheryl - who had rescued the pup from death row at a shelter when he was just a few months old - to take him under her wing as her newest student .
The animal lover has since taken Benny training once every two weeks at the Las Vegas Ice Center, teaching him an array of tricks including turns, crossovers and bunny hops.
She even made Benny a special pair of ice boots by attaching blades to doggy shoes, which he wears on his front paws while using his back paws for grip.
Incredible videos show the talented pup whizzing masterfully around the ice - and one clip has even racked up 30,000 views on Facebook .
Cheryl, of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, said, From day one, I couldn't believe how anyone could not want this dog. He was absolutely perfect. We had this bond from the first day. He's the happiest dog, and he loves learning new tricks. Now, you can't keep him off the ice. He just keeps getting better and better. You can't help but smile when you see it.
She added, Weve looked into it and we cant find any other dogs that can skate.
Cheryl has been skating since shes four and was a semi-professional in her twenties, but opted for a career in coaching which she pursued for 20 years.
She later gave up the career to run a restaurant with her husband Flory, 68, and daughter Brittany, 35. But last year, Flory began attending physio sessions following hip surgery at a clinic close to the Las Vegas Ice Center.
Cheryl decided to pop into the rink for a spin and instantly fell back in love.
Shortly afterwards, she decided to take Benny onto the ice with her at the suggestion of a pal - and quickly realized he was a natural.
She said, Last winter I started skating a little bit just for myself to stay in shape.
Benny has been learning to skate for over a year.
A friend of mine said we should make a video of Benny, getting some shots of him on the ice and I said, OK, let's do it. He followed me around and was running after me on the ice. Maybe because it's so hot here in Nevada, he enjoyed being out there in the cold. He was rolling around on his back and everything. He enjoyed it so much. Our daughter, Brittany, I taught her to skate when she was 17 months old. I thought, well, if I could get little 17 month old to skate, why couldn't I get him to skate We took some dog boots and old blades and we glued them together. I had him on a leash first in the rink and I helped him along with his feet. He knows how to turn now, and do crossovers, and he can do little bunny hops with his front feet. He's getting more powerful and soon were going to have to get the skates professionally put together.
Though the accomplished pup has only been on ice for a few short months, coach Cheryl has big plans in store.
She plans to teach him a routine, get him spinning to music and hopes to secure him a part performing for the Vegas Golden Knights NHL teams as on-ice entertainment.
She said, Our mission is to get a little bit more ice time. Next, I want to teach him a routine, maybe to do a spin with some music. Every time anybody sees him skate, they just laugh. It's so unbelievable. I had somebody offer me money to buy him a couple times since, but I would never, ever sell him. I don't care how much they offered me, theres no way would I ever give him up! I love all of my dogs, but I have a special connection with Benny. I can't even imagine how close he came to being put to sleep. I know everybody says that about their dogs, but he's such a special, different kind of dog. I wish I could've had him since the day he was born.

Government authorities had recently said that existing economic development and peace in the country will largely benefit Sri Lanka to target over 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals by 2020. Sri Lanka is currently reaping fruitful results from Tourism due to the arrival of large number of tourists, and Sri Lanka Tourism has planned to develop the sector by helping local and foreign investors to construct more and more hotels in every part of the country. Nearly over over 2.5 million foreign tourists arrived in the county last year and during the past few months of this year over 2.3 million tourists have arrived so far according statistics.
Tourism is a major industry that contributes to the economic and social development of Sri Lanka by way of foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, income creation and generation of government revenue. Tourist traffic to the country soared from 1968 onwards until the eruption of ethnic conflict in 1983. Arrival plunged sharply due to the ethnic conflict from that year but arrival increased sharply with the improvement of the security situation in the early 1990s. Since 2009 with the end of War against Terrorism, Sri Lanka is now emerging to reap the benefits of a thriving Tourism Industry.
From breathtaking coastlines, rivers, waterfalls, manmade tanks and a lakes and other wetlands, Sri Lanka is could be positioned as a most popular tourism destinations for even water sports. In the modern context Sri Lankas present development drive that includes mega structures such as Ports, Airports, fly-overs, highways, mega star class hotels, leisure centres and cultural centres, performing arts theatres and medium and Up market city centres including shopping malls had also boosted countrys tourism with local travelers as well as foreign travelers increasing their sightseeing around the mega structure sites or nearby cities. On the other hands sandy golden beaches such as Negombo, Mount Lavinia,Kalutara, Beruwela, Bentota, Pasikudah and Kalkudah, Unawatuna, Mirissa, Weligama, Polhena, Dickwella, Hikkaduwa, Koggala, Tangalle, Trincomalee, Nilaveli, Batticaloa,Arugam Bay, Casuarina Beach, Kilaaly Beach, Vankalai, and even Kalpitiya are major tourism attraction zones. Those areas have contributed vastly to the economic development of the country and to the boom of countrys tourism industry. In fact the present government had considered the Tourism as a major sector to drive Sri Lankas economic growth whilst the several new leisure projects are in the pipeline across Sri Lankas coastline. Many of them are 5-star properties and countrys tourism authorities are also mulling to promote Sri Lanka as a preferred holiday destination for emerging middle class in two of the worlds largest economies  India and China.
Way forward
As the most widely celebrated global day for tourism, it symbolizes a unique opportunity to raise awareness of tourisms future direction, and how tourism could be made an effective product using modern tools such as digital marketing for destination marketing. On the other hand it is vital that tourism industry improves with Innovation and Digital Transformation in the years to come.
Country is yet to reap its benefits from the Tourism industries growth potential and be a part of Asian growth story that is happening for the next 100 years of worlds timeline. Sri Lankas tourist arrivals rose 4.9% in August 2018 compared to the same period last year, according to the data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). The month recorded 200,359 tourists arriving in the country compared to the 190,928 arrived in August 2017. As at 31st August, 1,582,835 tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. It is a 12.5% growth over last year when 1,406,854 tourists had visited the country during the same period of the last year. Asia and Pacific continued to be the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 47% of the total traffic received in August 2018. Europe accounted for 41% of the total traffic, Middle East 6%, America 5% and Africa 0.5%. India, China, United Kingdom, France and Germany remains Sri Lankas top five international tourist generating markets whilst over 2.1 million tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in 2017 contributing US $ 3.9 billion of earnings to the government revenues.
Sri Lanka is on course to develop into a major tourist destination. Analysts also note that in the long term, with the entrance of more international brands and maturing of the tourism industry, Sri Lanka is set to change from a budget destination to a more exotic one offering a variety of experiences to a diverse segment of travelers. Meanwhile government of Sri Lanka has recently informed that it is looking at revenue from tourism in the excess of US $ 5.9 billion for 2018 end and US $ 6.5 billion for 2019 end and a target of US $ 7 billion for 2020. The Tourism sector has been given priority by the Government to push growth and also to earn foreign exchange.
It is significant to note that Sri Lanka Tourism has recently announced that it is carrying out multi-platform promotional campaigns whilst a digital campaign had also been announced focusing on key international markets including Europe, Middle East, China, India, APAC and the USA. From May 2017 to April 2018, over 30 social media travel influencers have visited Sri Lanka, resulting in an overall social media reach of 65 million and a total engagement of 12.5 million on social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube and face book. Several TV documentaries about Sri Lanka have been also aired on leading TV channels including Channel 9 (Australia), WDR (Germany), 3SAT (France), CCTV (China) and ARTE (France/Germany) in 2017,describing about the countrys beautiful tea estates, beaches, culture and exotic wildlife.
In addition to earned publicity advertising and branding, paid print media publications which featured the Sri Lanka include Food and Travel Magazine, Escapism magazine UK, Abenteuer und Reisen and Reise Germany, Voyagers and Grand Reportages of France, and the Gulf newspaper, UAE. Report highlight that in 2017 via the visiting travel writers and TV program. a viewership of 75million (both TV and magazine) have featured Sri Lanka in the recent past, reaching target audiences in key markets such as UK, France, Germany, China, and India which are important markets for Sri Lanka in terms of tourist arrivals and investments.
Therefore it is noteworthy that Sri Lankas government has taken preliminary efforts to brand Sri Lanka on the digital landscape in parallel to this years World Tourism Day 2018 theme. We are looking forward these efforts will uplift the industry and make Sri Lankas Tourism as competitive product in the modern times.

ADB provides US$300 mn for elevated highway
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a $300 million loan to help in the construction of about 5.3 kilometers (km) of elevated toll highway with related facilities between the New Kelani Bridge (NKB) and Galle Face in central Colombo in Sri Lanka. The new highway is expected to ease traffic congestion, improve connectivity, and facilitate trade logistics in the country.
Improved connectivity and infrastructure development are essential if Sri Lanka is to reach its potential as a trade and logistics hub in South Asia, said ADB Senior Transport Specialist for South Asia Kanzo Nakai. The new highway will help provide a direct link to the city center and the port from the ColomboKatunayake Expressway through the NKB, improving connectivity and contributing to growth.
In 2016, the port of Colombo handled about 1.3 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of gateway container cargo, which could double to 2.5 million TEUs in 2030 as Sri Lanka continues to grow. The port, however, is only serviced by a four-lane, ground-level access road passing through its main gate, which intersects with Baseline Road, one of the busiest trunk roads in Colombo. This leads to serious traffic congestion in the city and holds back trade and mobility.
The 5.3-km elevated toll highway to be built as part of the South Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Port Access Elevated Highway Project will include related road facilities including an advanced electronic toll collection (ETC) system, which will eventually be installed on the entire expressway network. The project will also upgrade 1.4 km of the ground-level port access road from four to six lanes, while a maritime facilitation center will be constructed to provide better services to port users and relocate and gather the administrative and operational functions of the port, many of which will be affected by the construction of the elevated highway.
The project also contributes to regional connectivity and trade, in line with SASECs goals.
Additionally, ADB will provide a $500,000 technical assistance for the Expressway Operations Improvement component of the project, which will strengthen the operational capacity of the expressway regarding its toll rate policy and the ETC system. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, financed by the Government of Japan, will also provide a $1.25 million grant to support trade logistics facilitation for customs modernization.
The total cost of the project is $360.2 million, with the Government of Sri Lanka contributing $60.2 million. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2025.

Beach Cleaning Campaign
Avani Bentota Resort, owned by Serendib Leisure Management Limited  leisure arm of Hemas Holdings PLC, recently concluded a beach cleaning programme as part of their ongoing CSR project by removing scattered debris from over 350 meters of the Bentota coastlines.
This is a routine practice by the resort in order to maintain the pristine conditions of the beautiful beach stretch that Bentota is gifted with. The resort has always been a strong advocate for adopting green practices and environmental sustainability where preserving nature and preventing pollution is a highlighted topic of discussion. One of the pressing issues that the world is facing currently is environmental pollution which is occurring in a large and unprecedented scale across the globe. Approximately over 50 staff members gathered at the beach front in order to participate in the beach cleaning programme.
Vast amounts of garbage especially plastic find its way into the worlds oceans every year and it is causing significant threat to marine life and sea birds. Avani Bentota Resort managed to collect through this exercise approximately 300kgs of debris which equalled to six truckloads of plastic, glass and other waste materials.
It brings us great honour to have the ability to contribute and be part of a team that is making a difference to help our environment. We hope to have more volunteers onboard the next time to cover a larger area of the beach, said General Manager, Urs Platz.
Avani Bentota Resort with the intention of contributing to a cleaner and greener environment continuously looks into other methods of giving back to the community; for example last month the staff undertook a project of planting coconut trees in the hotel gardens. Planting trees undoubtedly produce clean air, reduce carbon, and provide shelter to birds and other wildlife.
Avani Bentota Resort is located on the best beach strip along Sri Lankas western coastline, a mere 90 minutes from Colombo. Designed by world-renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa who took inspiration from an 18th-century Dutch village, the property has a contemporary feel and offers a tropical island beachside haven. Facilities include 75 tastefully designed rooms and suites, three bars, two restaurants, two swimming pools, gym and Avani Spa.

Canine Affection
Its easy for humans to show affection for their dogs. A belly rub, treat, or snuggle session on the couch says I love you to our pets. But do you ever wonder how your dog shows you they care
Thankfully, dogs do communicate clearly, as long as you know what to look for. From nose to tail, dogs use their bodies to convey how they feel. Read on to learn the ways that dogs show affection.
Nosing
Does your dog ever come up and nudge you with their nose This can be a sign of affection, a way for your dog to say Hey, I like you! Of course, nose-nudging is also a way for dogs to seek attention, or to let you know youre in their way. Youll know your dog is expressing affection if the nose-nudge is accompanied by a soulful stare, or leads to more full-body contact.
Eye Contact
Eye contact is an intimate act. For many dogs, its a display of trust and affection. If your dog maintains eye contact with you on the reg, theyre showing a high degree of attachment. When your dog looks at you, their brain releases oxytocin, which is the same hormone that helps new mothers bond with their babies. Your brain does the same thing.
Note: affectionate eye contact is different from threatening eye contact. We dont recommend having a stare-down with an unknown or nervous dog. Instead, look for opportunities to make and hold eye contact with your dog throughout the day. Think of it as building trust over time.
Sighing
Does your dog ever stretch out next to you and let out a long, happy sigh Soft vocalizations like sighs and low groans are signs of contentment in dogs.
If your dog snuggles up and sighs, it means they feel safe and comfortable by your side.
Licking
Kissing is a universal sign of affection, even among dogs! Big, sloppy dog tongues can be a little gross depending on the situation. But by licking you, your dog is saying I like you sooo much!
Licking can also be a way to signal lower social status. When your dog licks you, she may be letting you know that she respects your authority (and that she loves you, of course).
Jumping
Now, heres a sign of affection you may not want to encourage. For many people, jumping is an undesirable dog habit. But it may help to reframe it as a loving act of enthusiasm. If your dog gets extra-bouncy around you, theyre showing you how much they care.
Dogs are drawn to human faces, and jumping can be a way to get closer. Think of it this way: by jumping up, your dog can get a closer look at your eyes, or reach you for a welcoming lick. Jumping can be a frustrating habit, but the next time your dog jumps up, remember that theyre just trying to show you they care.
Leaning
This is my personal favorite sign of affection from my dogs: the lean. When your dog comes up to you and leans their full weight against your legs, theyre showing you they trust you implicitly. For many dogs, the lean is like a full-body hug.
Of course, some leans also signify anxiety or control. The affectionate lean is relaxed and calm. Your dog may show other signs of relaxation, like a slightly open mouth, soft eyes, and a gently wagging tail.
Rolling
Nothing says I like you like a dog rolling onto their back and asking for belly rubs. Much like the lean, the roll-over shows a high degree of trust and relaxation. When your dog flops over and wags their tail, theyre telling you they like youand trust youa lot.

Catnap
Cats love a good snooze, so much so that theres even a kind of sleep named just for them: the catnap. They also love a cuddle, so if you think about it, what better way to help out some shelter cats than to join them for a good snooze
75-year-old Terry Lauerman knows this, and he regularly heads down to his local shelter for catnaps. Staff at Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said that he came in brandishing a brush one day, and asked if he could groom the cats. He just walked in and started brushing, founder of the shelter Elizabeth Feldhausen told HuffPost.
So eventually we told him he was an official volunteer and had him fill out our volunteer form.
Terry visits the shelter daily, staying for around 3 hours a time. He brushes the cats before dozing off for a nap with them, before waking up and repeating the process. The experience is a mutually beneficial one, and has had far reaching effects for the shelter. After they decided to dedicate a Facebook post to Terry and his adorable volunteer work, it quickly went viral. The resulting publicity has seen donations flooding in, providing funds for the shelter to continue their important work for a long time to come.
Our donations have increased! Elizabeth told Bored Panda. Normally, wed make between $3,000 to $4,000 per month. This week, we have reached $30,000! This is amazing because we do rely solely on donation! The proceeds will likely go to adding additional quarantine rooms, so that we can save more cats more quickly, vet bills, and re-insulating the building so that we are more energy efficient this winter. Well have more than enough for all of those things, so some will go to savings and be our rainy day fund.

China-SL project to end CKDu launched
The construction of a state-of-the-art water testing laboratory will begin tomorrow at the Peradeniya University premises as a China-Sri Lanka joint project to finding a scientific solution to the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu).
The USD 20-million project is carried out with a Chinese grant of Rs. 1,950 million and a Rs. 880 million contribution from the Sri Lankan Government.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said the China Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology would be the largest drinking water testing laboratory in South Asia.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department, yesterday.
The University of Peradeniya, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry are partners of the project, which includes a 5,000 square metre building with advanced technology. The project is expected to be completed by May 2020.
The minister said the project grant was a result of President Maithripala Sirisenas visit to China in 2015.
The minister said the water testing laboratory together with the fully-fledged Nephrology Hospital in Polonnaruwa, being built with another Chinese grant, would help to deliver the Presidents pre-election pledge to fight CKDu.
Chinese Academy of Sciences Vice President Hou Jianguo said this project is the first China-aided project in the field of science and technology in Sri Lanka.
The project construction was undertaken by China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (CTCE).
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister said the Cabinet decided to set up a separate authority to protect the countrys water resources.
At present, water bodies come under various institutions such as the Forest Conservation Department, Wildlife Department, Mahaweli Development Authority, Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
As the responsibilities are shared, the task has become difficult.
The new authority will act as the central body to protect the water resources, said the minister. Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake, Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka Commercial Counselor Yang Zuoyuan and CTCE Board Chairman Zhang Hechuan were also present.

Citizens' Mail
An open letter to Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe: Make universities worthy academies
It is deeply regretted that as has been done by all Governments, your prestigious Government too has failed to take any action so far against the cruel, inhuman, incredibly beastly acts of sadism in the Universities, and even in some other institutions and schools too, in the guise of ragging.
In addition it is a violation of Human Rights, for a person to live in peace.
You are probably aware that this unspeakably shameful inhuman, undemocratic thing has pushed some students to commit suicide and some to leave the Universities. It need not be emphasized that sadism, as given in any textbook on psychiatry, is an abnormal mental disease suffered by some children as well as adults.
It is this small percentage which persuades and forces others to join them in such inhuman acts. Therefore, we plead most earnestly that legislation should be introduced without further delay to punish these villains who are a shame to our country and humanity too, by abrogating the studentships of those responsible for organising torture by imprisoning them for more than one year and placing them under psychiatric treatment or simply in compassion, calling their parents and handing them over to their parents for treatment indicated above and notifying all other Universities not to accept them etc.

Creating legal connectivity
The National Law Students Conference 2018 has a glorious vision - Grooming the next generation of legal practitioners and Academics by empowering the law students of the millennial.
The NLSC, a two day conference will take place on this Saturday and Sunday uniting all law students enrolled at institutes providing tertiary legal education across the country. The event will accommodate approximately 275 law students, the theme being  Identifying the Legal Practitioner and the Legal Academic of the Millennial.
Daily News visited the Law College and met the members of the committee behind this extremely timely and most commendable initiative.
We are holding this conference (NLSC) for second time this year, the first one was organized in 2016. We have realized that there is an absence of a platform where law students studying at different institutions can come together and simply network with one another and engage in an experience that is intellectually stimulating and meet their colleagues who will enter the profession with them. We notice there is an absence of such a platform and the Law Student population is a little fragmented, said Co- Chair Chiranthi Senanayake.
She pointed out, that in order to meet that gap they wanted to organize the NLSC this year.
With legal education reforms coming into place, this is ideal where there is a wonderful opportunity where internal and external students of Law College meet one another at the same venue having the same conference experience. The first day is happening at Sri Lanka Law College and the second day is at Waters Edge. We are trying to engage in a journey. The experiences and challenges of the Law Student is very different from a law student who studied law a century ago. Perhaps the environment has changed and the problems you need to deal with are very different. For example you have to deal with things related to the internet or if the entire court system should be mechanized. So the topics discussed in this conference are very timely, explained Senanayake.
Head of Content Management, Fahama Abdul Lathiff, pointed out that on September 29 there will be ten panel discussions.
The main panel discussion talks about law and morality and whether a balance can be achieved and how it translates into practical examples such as death penalty. We also have eight breakout sessions where it cover areas such as IL litigation. There are topics that address abortion and adoption laws, or whether the virtual world needs to be policed, how much law enforcement there needs to be online. There are also topics which deal with whether the profession is biased towards a particular gender. We also talk about environmental law and environmental protection. On the second day we have one intellectual discussion. It is called back to the drawing board, and it addresses whether the legal profession has to be reformed. We want the entire system of law to be an effective one, said Lathiff.
The 275 delegates and the break- out sessions will be happening in parallel, and the delegates from institutions all over the county will choose whatever the session they are passionate about.
Head of PR, Umayangi Wijayasuriya, said this conference is timely and important because there are so many law students all over the county.
When you think of law we tend to think only about the law students in Colombo and Law College. But here we are inviting law students from all tertiary institutes, so even people studying law on their own, or at private institutions or at Law College, can come together and meet their colleagues. To qualify as a lawyer you need to sit your Attorneys exams. But until people come to that stage they do not know what Law College is about. How the field and process is like. For example some people have not even seen Law College. So we want to give them a taste of what it is like here in Law College. We want to expose them to the legal world. So people will be meeting and talking to each other, who will eventually be their future colleagues. They will be together for the rest of their lives. But here we are giving them a chance to meet each other early. So once they get into the profession it will be nothing new. They will not just be thrown into the deep end. They also get the chance to meet professionals and experts not only in Law but in other fields connected to law. So they will acquire a whole wealth of knowledge through this conference, said Wijayasuriya.
She also emphasized that everything discussed at the conference, proposals and reforms will result in an outcome document which will be formulated by the delegates themselves and then will be given to the Parliament, Chief Justice, Attorney General and so many other institutions.
We believe Law students have a great intellectual capacity and they are well aware of their surroundings and they have good ideas and we have the potential to take our country into the future and up to a certain standard, pointed out Wijayasuriya.

Cyber Security to play major role in strategy at Nations Trust Bank
Information and cyber security are critical for businesses today, especially those that rely heavily on digital infrastructure such as Nations Trust Bank, with its comprehensive digital banking services. This need for cyber security awareness and readiness drove the senior management of Nations Trust Bank to go a step further and engage in a Game of Threats, a proprietary cyber security strategy training programme for business leaders, provided by the international giant, PWC (Price Waterhouse Coopers).
Speaking about the cyber security training, Nishan Mendis Executive Director Consulting Technology at PWC Sri Lanka said, Game of Threats is a digital game that is designed to simulate the speed and complexity of an actual cyber breach. This is the first time that a bank or financial institution in Sri Lanka has taken such a comprehensive measure to ensure readiness to meet any cyber security threat, at such a high level.Our solution integrates elements of gamification and game theory to provide an interactive experience where client teams play both offense and defence. The game environment creates a realistic experience where both sides are required to make quick, high impact decisions with minimal information.
Information security is a key focus area for Nations Trust Bank. The organization is ISO 27001 certified and maintains world class standards in terms of information security, conducting security audits multiple times each year. The Bank also allocates vast resources annually to upgrade systems and to work with companies of global repute such as PWC to ensure the strength and integrity of its information and data systems.
Nisala Kodippili  Chief Information Officer at Nations Trust Bank elaborated further saying, We rely heavily on digital banking; in fact over 50% of retail traffic now comes in via our digital channels. Therefore, cyber security is extremely important to us. Over the last few decades, cyber security has moved from being something only technical teams deal with to something that is also dealt with at the boardroom level."
This is the third time we are conducting cyber security trainings at the senior management level but this is the first time we have used simulations and gamification. Normally, we conduct classroom sessions as part of our cyber security training protocol but classroom sessions can never provide real world like experience and when it comes to the serious cyber security issues that we can face at any time, its essential that the Senior Management has hands on real-world training."
Thats why we decided to engage the services of PWC to use their proprietary Game of Threats cyber security training solution for business leaders. Game of Threats is a turn based digital game that lets players understand cyber security risks and strategies through real-time simulations."

Elitism propagates international security threat
Human indignity is at its best in the all too favourite and clichd pet expression of self-propagating, egoistic, bloated elitists: everything is under control and, oh, he worked under me, instead of with me. If all is under control and there is always someone to work under, their acceptance of the existence of someone down below is inevitable and a foregone conclusion and as long as there is a crowd there under control, the threat to national and international security will continue to breed vehemently and vigorously. If the Sinhala majority owes a public apology to the Tamils for their successive discriminatory legislative enactments, the architects and upholders of contemporary systemic existence owe a similar apology to humanity for delivering an unjust world order that has given rise to social tension, unrest, chaos and whatnot which threatens global security. Moreover, the rich and powerful frame social policies not leaving room for participation from the bottom.
Moving away from what should be participatory/ shared and running into the element of control in a one way, linear, top-down flow in governance, the security forces were founded to endorse and consolidate whatever injustice that came from the governing hierarchy. Whats more, these defending forces are told to uphold the status quo denying them the right to even self-expression. The right to dissent, to strike and engage in trade union action does not come within the purview of these defence agencies though discrimination is rampant. Those that have the right connections get to the top while the rest suffer in silent indignity. Unable to stomach these blatantly unjust governing tactics, they have even made sacrificial lamb of some state heads.
Those state heads that have involuntarily terminated their lives at the hands of security forces are Indira Gandhi and Egypts Anwar Sadat. They are two glaring examples where the governing irregularities were challenged by the respective armies in their own countries following Indira Gandhis bombing of the Mecca of Sikh worship, the Amritsar temple, and the much-hated camp David summit Sadat was signatory to. Paying a heavy price was also Rajiv Gandhi and in his case, it was not an army reprisal but orchestrated by the Tiger terrorists for his attempt into an elitist collaborative effort with JR Jayewardene in endorsing unfair legislative enactments to keep everything under control that gave rise to the Tiger rebels discontent. Whatever the moral base may be, killings, whether state or terrorist, do not justify the resentment but certainly are the cause for resentment.
Global security
Hegemony, power, control, inequality, along with an educational system that dulls the intellect and widespread elitism, have today given rise to much social disruption resulting in numerous social issues that threaten global security. My question on these lines of thought at the recently held seminar on Security in an era of Global Disruptions though assured of being taken up provided time permitted was for good reasons dumped for the huge presence of elitists were comprehensive whole in the audience at the BMICH. Insecurity in an era of global disruptions may have been the sociologists banner but as it was organised by the Sri Lanka Army they for reasons understandable and otherwise termed it Security in an era of global disruptions.
Disruptions were seen by Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam as a fact of life. But the question is how disruptions became a fact of life. But need it to be really so It is this writers view that what is described as disruptions being a fact of life came into play only when death was imposed on the shared philosophy and replaced with hegemony, power, control and elitism  my kick-off point. Until and unless elitism is replaced with simplicity and control with sharing in all fields of human activity, disruptions will continue to plague the world. He also said it was an era of humans. Agreeably so, but certainly not an era of human beings as a result of systemic unjust. What have we made of humans in the absence of human beings Those that challenge the system are termed terrorists, insurgents and lunatics. In a family, the challenging child is termed obstinate while school authorities see them as violent. Conformists being socially favourable, government servants are a star breed into such servility.
This itself is to license the unjust world order and government servants simply say yes sir, yes sir and keep filling their bags. Come retiring years following their frills and fancies of sinful immorality, they pronounce feigning sorrow: What to do I was in the office then and I could not speak. Speaking out against an immoral rule is a forerunner to being shown the door. Complying seems to be the chosen path for personal gain. Asking these government servants not of the former civil service to rise to a higher order is akin to finding gems in a cesspit. Britains Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, a celebrated, star-studded and colourful Britisher in the British Foreign Service even gave up his job to oppose the irregularities of his government. Against this backdrop, a call to equality and the common good by Kariyawasam is not even a distant dream. The greater the numbers of Robin Cooks breeding, the lesser the chances of national and international global disruptions.
Kariyawasam also calls for critical thinking, not even a remote possibility with an education system that dulls the intellect and now relegated into a non-existent state. As the ever vibrant Indian scholar and thinker Swami Parthasarathy believes, todays education only upholds conformity. All follow a certain trend. Conformists have replaced scholars and thinkers. Regretting modern education as the knowledge that builds out of externalities, Swami bemoans that only a few have caught his point on the need for an education system that is based on kindling the intellect for which he believes critical thinking is a must. But then, the unjust world order needs yes men to keep the system afloat, creating social stratification, inequality, divisiveness. Emotional governance has come to stay devoid of rationality.
Come to think of it. Swami Parthasarathy was right. His expressions conform to the highest levels of morality. We no longer see the like of Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Lincoln for they developed their intellect to such dizzy heights where they took the system to task. Those that made world history were not dishonourable conformists but men of honour, upright and noble in a character who very boldly criticised the wrong. Preferring his bare bodied state to be in Buckingham Palace instead of opting for what appeals to the mediocre as sartorial elegance, Gandhi refused to shift from his convictions and when the BBC asked him why, he said, I do not want to adorn myself with artificiality. Gandhis reference to artificiality included indeed in a more broader sense his dislike towards a system far removed from what is natural. Global disruptions, then, are inevitable in a set up of artificiality.
Sinhala political elitists
As a result, international security becomes increasingly fragile. Hegemony, power, control are elements that breed artificiality giving rise to socio /political/economic inequality, stratification, hierarchical structures, gender, environmental exploitation that have endangered mankinds survival. Global security threats are on the rise. National and international social, economic, political, religious and bureaucratic elites are, to say the least beggars on horseback with their ostentatious living suffer from an inferiority complex compelling them into power and control  a state far removed from natural law. Moving away from what is natural into artificiality invariably gives rise to a global security threat.
Deviating from his military duties of control and moving towards intellectual fine-tuning is Northern Commander Major General Dharshana Hettiarachchi. Accepting publicly to the northern populace on retrospective political blunders which he saw as being the right thing to do, this innovative Northern Commander Major General Dharshana Hettiarachchi apparently is weaning himself away from the bane of elitist arrogance in accepting to the Jaffna residents retrospective misgivings, yet he has miles to go for that trek is hard without political participation. No political leader has so far apologized nor accepted despite the many politically motivated legislative blunders on the Tamils.
Hettiarachchis small but meaningful step forward could augur well for the future if collaborated with Sinhala political elitists.
However, an apology will decide the countrys leadership at the next elections for its great distaste towards the jaathiya aagama or jingoistic cry coming off the hoi polloi.

In view of the National Day of Republic of Korea:
An exemplary nation
The war between South Korea and North Korea from 1950 to 1953 happened after the World War II. This war destroyed millions of lives. After this conflict, both countries did not take long to resurrect. The Republic of Korea became famous as South Korea. Over 25 years, South Korean Capital, Seoul, progressed towards development. I was fortunate enough to see with my own eyes the speedy progress of South Korea while I was engaged in postgraduate research attached to Seoul National University and Dongguk University.
The Republic of Korea has become a developed country today. It took them only 25 years to acquire the technical development aggregated by the Great Britain for 100 years. They competed with the technically advanced countries and are now the leaders in production of electronic and computer accessories. The foreign exchange revenue has gone up, strengthening the economy.
Industrial development
The industrial development began with small industries. The garment and textile industry have now expanded into the steel, petrochemical, heavy machinery, and rigs for oil exploration.
The country has acquired a significant progress. It had also gained the honour of being the leading producers of ships and motor vehicles in cities such as Ulsan, Pohang and Seoul. A prominent status has been granted by Japan and the United States. Hyundai, KIA and Ssangyong have become the leaders in the world motor vehicle market going beyond the contemporary production capacities. They have gained a remarkable access to the refrigerator, TV and mobile phone market, a coveted position earlier held by Japan, the United States and other European countries.
Now their trademark Samsung & Gold Star have been entered to the list of world consumers The research centres of the leading companies have been established not only in South Korea but also in other countries like China and India. The researchers explore nanotechnology, communication technology and animation.
Olympic Games
Now the Republic of Korea claims ownership for many modern inventions in the world. The Republic hosted the 1988 Olympic Games. In many fields of sports, they have excelled. They became world champion in fields such as boxing, football, volleyball, rugby, golf and basketball. They also lead in music, art, dance and architecture. Korea that competes with the leading countries in the world in the fields has surprised the world K- POP music and songs. They were also included in a delegation that went to Pyongyang. They have also equated great fame in Sri Lanka, Japan, China, and China. The world spectator must have been surprised by the famous songs of Kangnam genre.
Andri Kim has earned repute in the world fashion market. Seoul has been named as one of the fashion centres of the world. The electronic train and underground train are a treasure to the Korean people.
The state-level relationship between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea is very strong. Over 25,000 Sri Lankan youth are employed in South Korea, drawing handsome salaries. Therefore the relationship between our two countries is beneficial to all of us. The relation between South and North Korea improved strongly since recently. President Moon Jay in of South Korea and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un have initiated friendly relations in Pyongyang. It was agreed to stop nuclear missile research and lead a joint Korean team for 2032 summer Olympic Games. It was also proposed to avoid using nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula and to make the Young Byon Nuclear Plant defunct.
The wish of the world is that they maintain peace between these two countries. It will also contribute to the build-up of peace in the whole world. The Republic of Korea has provided fine practical solutions to the economic department. It continues to provide an example for the whole third world. It is commendable how South Korea despite the shortage of natural resources built up their economy based on human resources and knowledge.

Fashioning a revolution: Are we what we wear
There are many ways to see a country and Juliet Coombe talks to first class honours degree fashion student and lecturer, Prabod Dharshana Munasinghe, who is getting married this week after travelling around the UK researching what the environmental thinking is behind Englands fashion industry.
I am handed a Jack Daniels bottle on meeting Prabod's wife Danindi and on closer inspection I notice it is full of small rocks and it has been turned into an uber cool lamp shade recyling everything including the plug. Danindi may not make crochet bikinis to protect the ocean from further environmental pollution like her husband Prabod or use fruit to make leather, but she does in her own quiet way find clever ways to slow down the enormous landfill with her stunning re-use designs.
Prabod now a lecturer at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka, is an extraordinary innovator in developing textiles, including an amazing colour range that uses natural herbs to help with skin conditions like dermatitis and boost skin health. Prabod travels from attending major events like Fashion Week in Central London and around the UK this year to unravel the threads we wear to see just how healthy, sustainable and ethical our clothes really are and the choices we make. The question we have to ask, of course, is do we care that jackets are being made using child labour in Bangladesh as price is so often the deciding factor or that kids sports accidents could so easily be avoided by not buying cheap rip offs or copies of ethical thought through brands
This line of questioning and his outstanding research work on the subject has resulted in him joining forces with the University of Surrey, Guildford to research and set up an environmentally sustainable tracking system for fashion designers all over the world. This way, the whole story about garments and their history will be exposed and we can think before we buy our next coat or pair of socks, which might, like Paddington 2 did in the film, turning all our clothes pink, because the dye is not fixed or worse cause us to be ill.
Like learning about the history of a country and the rationale behind indigenous cultural customs, it is equally important not to buy anything we wear without understanding the wider environmental implications of our choices, and the much more serious issues if we choose to ignore them out of apathy or design for designs sake. Prabod explains, People talk about doctors killing people by accident and yet with fashion everything in the western world is lost in the aesthetics and price of the piece. This is serious as, if you do not consider how they are produced and controls are not put in place, cheap unsafe dyes can be used in your childrens clothing, which if they suck the loose ends, like all young kids do, could possibly poison them or cause long term health issues including asthma. In sports clothing, cheap copies have weak stitching or stretch if the material threads dont come from Spandex, so, when kids fall over or have their garments pulled in contact sports they are exposed to dirty gravel and injuries that could so easily be avoided by using and buying the right material.
Prabod counts himself lucky to research sustainable fashion initiatives in everything from the West End in London to the oldest market in London dating from 1170 when Henry II was on the throne, and one of the busiest shopping precincts in the UK, which has ranges from the super cheap like Primark to the uber expensive with some showing it matters by saying they are conserving water in their tags like GAP.
H&M prides itself in using organic chemical-free cotton, but they may use more water in production, so we should carefully balance our decision-making. Exploring everything from childrens clothing shops to a place where clothing pattern designs have been used to wallpaper the toilets of Woodys caf, where we had our meeting, one can see the power of designers up cycling over discarding stuff, as it gives the place a vintage style that feels both unique and good for the conscience.
Prabods vision is to develop a responsible global fashion industry where we understand why a t-shirt is 2 in one shop and 100 in another and why we should buy skin-friendly material only that boosts our health with natural herbs rather than harms it with dyes that leak onto our bodies for example with jeans, which often cause skin diseases.
Also, he feels strongly that clothes should be used to boost childrens confidence. Consider the power of these performance influencers in sportswear for kids and the feel-good factor if kids know their clothes are not contributing to slave labour or pure water being wasted when designers could make other decisions by being held accountable for their choices when creating an outfit.
So many different things need to be researched such as the impact of not wearing correct bras, which cause back pain in many women over 40 in Asian countries and the strong suspicion that some fabrics have contributed to the rise in breast cancer So many questions need to be asked and properly researched instead of just blandly blaming air pollution.
Looking closer as a traveller at the souvenirs we buy, like the local t-shirt for tourists, is key, as so often, to increase profits, they are sourced using low standard products in badly paid countries, infamous for unethical production methods. Cheap products usually have very sad stories behind them  often they have been made using cruel child labour; women working into the night in terrible conditions; or unethical practices in the workplace such as using poisonous dyes, which cause skin issues. These are not issues any of us can or should ignore.
Although not scientifically proven and needing proper research, diseases such as skin cancer could be caused by chemicals containing heavy metals or Blue 6, which can come off onto the skin. Prabod, as a result of these issues, has set up Knowhowexpert.com  an open forum with a group of experts. He was impressed by shops like White Stuff that design each garment in the chain to fit with the culture of the local area and consider both where the product comes from and the customer served, leading to a very different kind of shopping experience. Each shop has a space for kids to play in while their parents look round, and an area for you to think and ask questions with free tea and coffee so you can consider what you are buying and talk to the staff about how products are made. All of which helps us value a piece more e.g. knowing about the weavers in Sri Lanka, who have incredible historic skills passed down through the generations, which allow them to create beautiful shawls or handmade lace decorations that get added to a top or a pair of trousers - flourishes that turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. Like the highly successful Lush brand that shows the maker on every bottle, Prabod wants this to happen to every piece of clothing so we can see how it was created, the environmental cost of production, design decisions that take this into account, and us asking the questions before we buy, so that products can be traced from start to finish and we can all be responsible models of our fashion attire.
It will be interesting to discover what their wedding clothes are made from and what they will turn them into after the event. Whatever it is, I am sure being trend setters there will be many followers of their ground breaking work.

Google celebrates 20th anniversary with a video doodle
Search engine giant Google celebrated its 20th birthday on Thursday with a special video doodle featuring popular searches all over the world throughout the last two decades of its existence.
The video features popular search queries like Y2K, Pluto losing its status as a planet, the Royal Wedding, 2012 on the Mayan calendar, how to pronounce gif and how to make avocado toast.
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in September 1998, as part of a PhD project. Page and Brin met at Stanford University in 1995. By 1996, they had built a search engine, initially called BackRub, that used links to determine the importance of individual web pages.
Twenty (ish) years ago, two Stanford Ph.D. students launched a new search engine with a bold mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful. Though much has changed in the intervening years, Google is still dedicated to building products for everyone, a post on the official Google Doodle blog said.
Google Search is now available in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries.

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said that the Good Governance Government strove to uplift the living standards of the underprivileged, and added that the previous regime had never carried out such a task. He was addressing the inauguration of the D.S. Senanayake model village set up at Wediwewa in Sooriyawewa. The village was opened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The minister said that the government aimed to create racial as well as religious reconciliation, in order to create an environment safe for all Sri Lankans.
The Joint Opposition was preoccupied with accusing the government of selling state lands and dividing the country, but the present regime was committed to protect the countrys integrity and the unity among its citizens.
Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, who also participated in the event, said that Minister Sajith Premadasa should be hailed for organising the erection of model villages.

A rollicking 76 of 38 balls from opener Shahzar Hassan, and No. 3 batsman Arsalan Farzands 56 off 41 balls, propelled Karachi University to a mammoth 204 for 5 from their 20 overs, which proved 62 runs too many for local team Business Management School (BMS). The pair struck 11 sixes and 10 fours between and put on a partnership of 71 for the second wicket. Karachis bowlers were then excellent in the second innings, as left- arm spinner and captain Muhammad Asad claimed another three-wicket haul - his second in two games.
BMS opener Hashan Dumindu made a valiant 76 off 55 balls, but had little support from his teammates.The team slumped to 142 for 9 from their 20 overs.
Karachi University 204 for 5 in 20 overs (Shahzar Hassan 76, Arsalan Farzand 56, Supesha Jayathilake 2 for 34, Madushan Ravichandrakumar 1/21)

ULAB win by 26 runs
Mahbubur Rahman, the left-arm wristspinner, from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), tore through the Herriot-Watt University middle order, as ULAB claimed a 26-run victory in their final match of the tournament. ULAB had earlier made what seemed to be a modest total of 129 for 8, with Herriot-Watt off spinner Ram Narayan claiming 4 for 14 from his four overs.
Herriot-Watt had made a decent start to the chase, moving to 55 for 2 in the 10th over, before Mahbubur trussed up their middle order in the space of a few overs. ULAB took four wickets for seven runs, to leave Herriot-Watt in trouble at 66 for 2, before they eventually slipped to 103 all out in the 17th over.
ULAB 129 for 8 in 20 overs (Anjum Ahmed 25, Shabab Jamil 25, Ram Narayan 4/14, Rahul Bhatia 3/19)

Majority of rich Chinese look to invest overseas
Top reasons include childrens education, asset portfolio diversification, wealth preservation and appreciation, survey finds
When the United States stock market opens every week, Jessica Liu checks on her portfolio. With an investment of $10,000 in the overseas stock market, she also owns real estate worth $5 million in Canada, where her son is studying, which costs $150,000 a year.
Liu is a typical example of Chinas high net worth individuals - people with a net wealth of over $1 million - investing overseas.
In 2017, there were 1.97 million high net worth individuals on the Chinese mainland. Their combined investment assets totaled 65 trillion yuan ($9.5 trillion), according to a report released by Minsheng Wealth, the National Institution for Finance and Development and Bon Corp at the end of last year.
A report released by Credit-Ease Wealth Management and Beijing-based market researcher HCR in April showed that up to 74.2 percent of the mainlands high net worth individuals are considering investing or have already invested overseas, among which 24.8 percent have already completed the process.
Among them, 21.8 percent are involved in the manufacturing industry, while 19.3 percent work in the financial sector. Others work in trade, the internet, real estate, architecture, healthcare as well as the media.
Most have higher education backgrounds, with 82.7 per-cent of them having a bachelors degree or above.
When conducting overseas investment, most of them buy financial products or real estate, and many choose to study, live or emigrate overseas.
Tian Jie, a financial analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said that compared with domestic investment, investing overseas provides a broader range of choices.
Investment channels in China are limited, while investing in overseas countries enables global asset allocation, Tian said.
There are more investment targets overseas with higher quality, such as stocks and bonds. In addition, related laws and regulations are sounder and there are more diversified ways to invest, he said.
Investors have a wide variety of financial products from which to choose, including stocks, futures, cash, gold, petroleum and real estate, Tian said. Explaining why most investors looking overseas choose to purchase financial products, he said it is the major investment method in most countries.
The threshold is also low. Even small deals are under secured legal protection. Investors can rest assured, he said.
According to the results from CreditEase and HCRs survey, Chinese investors buy financial products from more than one domestic wealth management company or private bank.
Investing overseas can disperse risks, and the complete financial systems and excellent services in popular investment regions are also more conducive to the preservation and appreciation of assets, said Zhang Yue, senior vice-president of CreditEase.
The survey found that 37.2 percent of high net worth individuals have already completed or are in the process of global asset allocation. Another 37.1 percent are considering taking that step.
When asked about their reasons for investing overseas, the top three answers are childrens education, risk dispersion via portfolio diversification, and wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors favored countries are the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.
Teresa Dong, a 35-year-old Beijing resident, plans to purchase a property in Singapore.
Apart from providing a home for my parents after their retirement, the major reason why my husband and I plan to buy a house in Singapore is that we want to offer our children a place to live when they study abroad, said Dong. Also, I can have a temporary residence permit to oversee my childrens education. When the children finish their education, the house can serve as a long-term investment.
She said the real estate market in Singapore offers higher cost performance. The quality of the buildings are better, and the communities are more livable, offering free swimming pools, gyms and barbecue facilities.
For foreigners, a two-bedroom apartment costs only about 5 million yuan. We can let it out at about 20,000 yuan per month, which is higher than the rent in China, Dong said.
As promising as the market is, investing overseas also involves challenges.
Due to the high degree of liberalization of overseas investment, the market tolerance for some non-standardized products is also high. Consumers are recommended to choose standard markets and authorized financial institutions, said Tian from Analysys.
Overseas real estate policies and regulations are very different from those in China. We must understand the local systems in detail to avoid risks, he said.
The report also found that up to 30 percent of the high net worth individuals have either started the immigration process or have already moved overseas, and more than 20 percent are considering moving overseas.
Nowadays more and more high-net-worth people have realized that getting an overseas residence permit is a guarantee for their wealth and future, and it is beneficial for their asset allocation, tax planning, wealth inheritance and education for children, said Jenny Zhan, president of Good Hope, a subsidiary of Credit-Ease that specializes in investment immigration.
The United States ranks No 1 among their desired immigration destinations, representing nearly half of the interviewees choices, the report showed. Australia and Canada ranked No 2 and No 3, respectively, followed by Singapore and New Zealand.

Massive mug cake mosaic
A Guinness World Record was set in Saudi Arabia when 19,600 Betty Crocker mug cakes were arranged into a mosaic covering 1,205.5 square feet.
A Guinness adjudicator was on hand when Betty Crocker, in collaboration with grocery chain Panda Retail, unveiled the mug cake mosaic at the Al Andalus Mall in Jeddah to celebrate Saudi Arabia's 88th National Day. Organizers said it took 30 bakers about 8 hours to bake all of the mug cakes for the mosaic and they were decorated using 1,900 tubs of Betty Crocker frosting. The end result was a mosaic image of a giant mug cake, with the Betty Crocker logo in Arabic.
The mug cakes were served to mall customers, with leftovers being donated to the nonprofit Saudi Food Bank. UPI

MEDIA FREEDOM HAS BEEN RESTORED - PM
It is evident media freedom has been restored. I am the most abused person in the media today. As the French saying goes, I will defend till my last drop of blood is shed, your right to abuse me, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Addressing the 20th Anniversary of the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo yesterday, the PM said lives were sacrificed to ensure media freedom.
In the end, it was the political parties and the civil society that got to the streets to fight media freedom, the Premier said.
He noted that Lasantha Wickrematunge, Prageeth Ekneligoda, several journalists from the Udayan newspaper and many others sacrificed their lives to protect media freedom.
When I was questioned about the progress of the investigations, I said that one of the police officers who was inquiring asked me how they can inquire when the media is abusing and making them the villains, he said.
He further said that if any evidence was required, he was certainly ready to provide them.
The Prime Minister said media freedom was achieved due to the struggles of the public and that can only be taken away by the media itself.
Parliament and the judiciary should work together in bringing laws on Contempt of Court. I do not think its impossible.The Oversight Committee on Judiciary would certainly look into it, but it requires extensive consultation with the judiciary, he said.
Speaking about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Prime Minister said the matter has come to Parliament.
He further said it was not abolished by Parliament but was suspended by the Supreme Court and added that only one part of ICCPR is being questioned on the basis, which has no facts.
Therefore if we all get-together we can restore the ICCPR fully. The final decision on the ICCPR lies with the government of Sri Lanka. In my view, the government should be asked to explain to Parliament why it does not agree, he said.

Metropolitan Group celebrates 60 years with commemorative stamp
The Metropolitan Group celebrates 60 years of bringing advanced technology and services to workplaces across Sri Lanka with the issue of a commemorative stamp showcasing the corporate head office signifying the growth and the values that had been the pillars of Metropolitans growth : Trust and Excellence.
This commemorative stamp was issued in recognition of the companies achievements over the past 60 years by the Post Master General Ranjith Ariyarathne.
This stamp could not have been more timely and it represents the values and confidence that customers, partners have attributed to Metropolitan which are Trust and Excellence, said J. J. Ambani.
Metropolitan commenced its business in 1958 by the late J. S. Ambani, with its primary focus on Office Machines and Supplies. To date, it remains a closely controlled entity.
Many reputed companies in Sri Lanka including blue chips were in the same business. However, with due focus and the realizations of its potential enabled Metropolitan to establish its dominant position in this space within a relatively short period of time.
With the advancement of electronics in this field and more over the liberalization that took place in 1977, Metropolitan adapted to the changes and challenges and maintained its dominant position inter alia in the field of Office and Banking Machines, Telecommunications and IT products and solutions.
One of the key factors that could be attributed to Metropolitans success is its partnership with the very best of international organizations in their respective fields. For example, Canon Inc. Japan, Johnson Controls, USA, Ericsson AB of Sweden, Acer Inc., ROC.
The Group also specialize in public private partnerships in technology projects and have also been entrusted with the production for smart card driving license for the Department of Motor Traffic for the past 10 years which can be regarded as one of the best public/private sector partnerships in the country, and been printing the national budget for almost 10 years.

Monster -in-law
A wedding day is a once in a lifetime occasion and as such the bride and groom should be the centre of attention all day.
To ensure this is the case, there are various unspoken rules guest should follow.
We all know the drill by now - don't wear white/ivory/cream to the wedding , don't ramble or talk about past relationships during your best man speech and definitely don't get too drunk at the reception. But it seems one wedding guest has no clue when it comes to traditional etiquette - and it's causing real problems for the bride-to-be.
To make matters worse, that guest is the mother of the groom. The bride in question shared her story on Reddit under the username lswo26 and asked people if she was being unreasonable over the situation.
She wrote, "My MIL just bought a dress to wear at my wedding. She did ask me beforehand what type of dress I think she should wear. I specifically told her to find something that is navy blue, dark green or grey and something conservative."
But the dress her mother-in-law purchased was anything but "conservative".
"It is gold with gold embellishments and gold threading. The whole dress is sparkly. When she showed it to me I was absolutely shocked and I wasn't very happy with her choice of dress. My dress in comparison is very simple with a little lace and some satin," she continued.
If that weren't bad enough, the woman is also planning an outfit change during her son's big day and has purchased a second dress which is green, off the shoulder and covered in sequins.
The bride added, "Can you believe this woman! I honestly cant brain any of this as shes an extremely simple woman who doesnt even put effort to dress up on normal days. I did tell her in the most diplomatic way possible that her dress is not suitable for the function. She grabbed the dress out of my hands, stuffed it in the cupboard and gave me the silent treatment. I don't want to be mean as she might be going through a middle-age crisis and has high blood pressure. Unsure of how to proceed she turned to her husband-to-be for help, but he merely claimed "all dresses looked the same to him".
So she asked the good people of the internet what they thought of the situation. Unsurprisingly, they were completely shocked by the mother-in-law's behaviour.
One person commented, "You are not rocking the boat. She is rocking the boat. You're not overreacting at all- that is a literal wedding dress right there. She asked you what you wanted and went and did the exact opposite."
Another said, "Not overreacting at all. That's a wedding dress or a super fancy prom dress."
Many people suggested "accidentally" spilling red wine all over the dress and some even offered to do it for her.
"Time for a bottle of red wine in a large cup wielded by a good friend with lots of spine," posted a third. "Id be tempted to walk up to her at the reception and tell her everyone was talking about her poor taste in clothing and ask if she ran her dress choices by anyone. Because how embarrassing for her. I just thought she should know."
A fourth added, "You aren't being mean by pointing out that her dress was ridiculously unsuited to the event for someone in her role. It doesn't matter that she has high blood pressure. It doesn't matter that she thought she looked nice in a sleeveless dress twenty years ago. She isn't having a crisis, she's throwing a tantrum and giving you the silent treatment over a wildly inappropriate dress for your wedding. No way should that nonsense be tolerated or excused. She's middle-aged, which means she's had more than enough time to grow up. It's okay for you to set and enforce boundaries with her."

Meanwhile Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe speaking at the event said emerging technologies today are likely to reshape all steps of business activities and the government as well as policymakers need to understand this situation and take immediate actions to develop both ICT sector and start up culture in Sri Lanka.
Today computers are impacting our day to day lives in a bigger way and will continually disrupt every industry you can think of. And many jobs that we have today will not exist in another 10 years time and we need to be aware of whats coming in the future, he said. He said Sri Lanka needs to recognize these emerging trends and take necessary steps to stay relevant in the market place. According to him, the worlds most valuable resource is no longer oil, but technology and data.

MR CANNOT BE SLFP CHAIRMAN - Court
A lawsuit filed by two political activists seeking an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court.
The Colombo Civil Appellate High Court two-judge-Bench comprising Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke and D.N. Samarakoon decided to affirm the Colombo District Courts judgment without a hearing into the matter.
On September 29, 2017, the Colombo District Court dismissed this lawsuit which sought an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
However,the two plaintiffs had filed an appeal in the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court challenging Colombo District Courts decision to dismiss the lawsuit.
Former Colombo District Judge Sujeewa Nissanka had upheld the preliminary objections raised by defendants and decided to dismiss the lawsuit in limine.
This lawsuit had been filed by two Plaintiffs former Boralesgamuwa Urban Council Chairman K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
The SLFP General Secretary through his counsel had raised preliminary objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
In his preliminary objections, the SLFP General Secretary stated that plaintiffs are indirectly challenging the acts of the current President of the Republic done in his capacity as chairman of the SLFP.
It is common ground that the chairman of SLFP is the President of the Republic. In terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic has immunity from suit except in an action filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution, SLFP General Secretary added.
The defendants further submitted that the District Court has no jurisdiction to file action against the Elections Commissioner.
The second defendant Anura Priyadarshana Yapa has resigned from his position as the General Secretary of SLFP and cannot be named as party defendant in this action. The caption of the action identified third defendant as Sunanda Deshapriya, the Election Commissioner. There is no person who can be reasonably identified as such and in fact no such person used to act as the Commissioner of Election, SLFP General Secretary further added.
The SLFP General Secretary maintained that the plaintiffs are seeking to circumvent the provisions of immunity from suit accorded to the President of the Republic and as such the plaintiffs action is liable to be dismissed in limine.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC on or around January 16, 2015 over the appointment of a new Chairman of the SLFP.
The plaintiffs further alleged that the Executive Committee of the Party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.
Presidents Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Lanka Dharmasiri appeared for SLFP General Secretary. Senior Counsel Nimal Weerakkody appeared for the plaintiffs.

Mushfiqur, Mustafizur carry Bangladesh into Asia Cup final
ABU DHABI, Wednesday: Bangladesh cashed in on Pakistans frailties in their batting to pull off a 37-run win in the final Super Four match of the Asia Cup played at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday and book a berth in Fridays final with India.
Bangladeshs victory was set up by former captain Mushfiqur Rahim who rescued his team from a bad start at 12 for 3 to a respectable score of 239 with a fighting knock of 99 and left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman who outshone his Pakistani rival Junaid Khan by capturing four wickets for 43 runs as Pakistan replied with only 202-9.
Junaid returning to the Pakistan team for his first game replacing the out of form Mohammad Asif took 4 for 19 to bowl Bangladesh out inside 50 overs after they won the toss and decided to bat first.
Pakistan were also pushed onto the backfoot by the early loss of three wickets for 18 runs, but unlike Bangladesh they failed to stitch together any big partnership  highest being 71 for the sixth wicket between Imam ul Haq who top scored for them with 83 off 105 balls and Asif Ali (31) and eventually fell short of a total which they could have easily overhauled on another day.
Bangladesh recovered from their early loss largely through a fighting fourth wicket partnership between Mushfiqur and Mohammed Mithun who blunted the Pakistani bowling which had their tails up after the early successes to put on 144 runs.
Mushfiqur once again showed what a big game player he was batting according to the situation to rescue his team. He battled through cramps on his right leg to score a brilliant 99 off 116 balls with nine fours before edging a catch behind the wicket to Sarfraz off Shaheen Afridi one short of a deserving hundred.
Later Mushfiqur who took the Man of the Match award rated the innings in his top five.
This [innings] is definitely top five. We needed one partnership badly at that time. The unavailability of Shakib and Tamim, the fact that we were three down early, it certainly makes it special. Also, Pakistans attack, their understanding of these conditions, those factors contribute to make it an important win, Mushfiqur said.
Mithun who proved an ideal foil to Mushfiqur made 60 out of 84 balls (6 fours) before Hasan Ali provided the breakthrough for Pakistan by having him hit back a tame return catch.
Bangladeshs innings went into decline once the stand was broken and they lost their last seven wickets for 83 runs as Junaid and Ali produced some excellent death bowling.
Bangladesh went into this crucial match without their most experienced allrounder Shakib Al Hasan who was ruled out with a fractured finger.

Nearly 650 abortions in Lanka daily
Around 650 illegal abortions take place in Sri Lanka daily, Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists attached to the Health Ministry said.
According to them, about Rs. 500 million needs to be spent annually to treat women who develop complications after undergoing illegal abortions under unhygienic conditions.
In addition, another Rs. 10 million is needed annually to educate them on using successful scientific family planning methods and to provide such facilities.
The experts were addressing a health seminar titled `Shed the darkness out of life through the light of family planning, in Colombo.
According to the Consultant Community Physician attached to the Family Health Bureau Dr. S.S.P. Godakandage, a majority of women who seek illegal abortions are married elderly women.
Most seek treatment for complications developed after undergoing abortions. About 100 complications can be developed as a result of illegal abortions. About 11 percent who develop mental illnesses seek treatment from hospitals.
Dr. Godakandage said educating people on successful family planning methods assist the government to save a large amount of money spent on avoidable health problems faced by women.

No allowances for Monitoring MPs- Hector
UNP backbenchers Hector Appuhamy and Kavinda Jayewardena yesterday said that all the UNP backbenchers are currently working as Monitoring MPs to various ministries. However, they emphasised that they were not receiving any allowance for their Monitoring MP posts, but work voluntarily to coordinate various development projects in their respective ministries including the recently launched Gamperaliya project.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, Parliamentarian Hector Appuhamy said that he assumed work as Foreign Employment Monitoring MP yesterday. Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayewardena said that he functions as the Monitoring MP for Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Ministry.
We use the vehicles and drivers allocated to those ministries when visiting those project sites. This provides us training as to how to handle the affairs of a ministry. It also allows us to deliver a productive service to the public with our talents and capacities, MP Jayewardena said.
The two MPs were also assailed with questions on the price formula for fuel. They in response said that they had seen it, but added that it was so complicated that they could not easily grasp it.
We were provided with a document running into 4-5 pages and it included the price formula with examples as to how it is being applied in other countries.
It will take about 2-3 days to properly understand the content of that document. If journalists are interested in studying the formula in depth, one can ask for that document under the Right to Information Act. It is difficult for us to explain it to another person because it is complex, they replied.
The two Parliamentarians added that Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweeras reaction to the statement by Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith does not reflect the UNPs or the Governments opinion.
They said that the Cardinals take on human rights had important points. They added that Minister Samaraweera was expressing his personal opinion when he countered the Cardinal.
We all must respect the sermons of religious leaders. However, we condemn the Joint Oppositions attempts to use even religion for politics.
The JO had been using temples for politics and now it tries to use churches for the very same purpose, MP Appuhamy said.
The MP also praised President Maithripala Sirisenas statement at the UN General Assembly where he called upon the international community to look at Sri Lanka with a fresh perspective and allow the nation to solve its problems on its own. This is an important statement and as Sri Lankans we all must appreciate it, he said.

OPA Annual Conference ends in high note
The Annual Conference of the Organisation of Professional Association of Sri Lanka (OPA) commenced on Wednesday at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo under the theme Innovative Digitalisation.
The Annual Conference which is the biggest event in the OPA calendar was held for the 31st consecutive year and culminated the activities of the OPA for the year 2017/2018.
Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage represented President Maithripala Sirisena as Chief Guest at the inauguration with Ajith P Perera. State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy gracing the event as the Guest of Honour. The keynote was delivered by Dr D Prasanth Nair, Managing Partner and Country Head InHelm, India. The Technical Sessions was held yesterday at the same venue.
Minister Dr Amunugama said the Annual Conference was very important meeting as the OPA was the biggest elitist group in Sri Lanka with a large representation of people who make the country move forward. We look forward to your proposals and suggestions,  he said.
After careful consideration the theme Innovative Digitalization was selected for this years annual conference, said Lalith Wijetunge, President OPA. He said the theme had great relevance in the present context where digital technologies were radically changing peoples lives, workplace and community. The President said as a nation the country should focus its attention on how Sri Lanka could face the immediate challenges of digitalization.
In this mega change, the government should posses a clear policy and formulate and implement a comprehensive action plan covering all critical sectors of the society. Wijetunge said that professionals and the OPA urge the government not only to prepare the blue print of a national action plan but ensure its implementation to achieve the desired results and the OPA was always willing to cooperate in national endeavours carried out by the government.
The Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka was established in 1975, mooting the idea of a joint professional body, to cater to the countrys growing need of professional opinion.
The OPA is now in its 43rd year and is the Apex Body consisting of 50 member associations representing 32 professions such as Engineering, Medicine, Accountancy, Architecture, Human Resource Management, Banking, etc. with a combined membership exceeding over 60,000. Over the years the OPA has grown into a powerful civil society consisting of an impressive list of professionals in various fields, whose outreach is extensive.
To ensure a broader participation, the OPA started the Annual Conference, of which the first one was held in 1988.
Since then the OPA has organized 30 Annual Conferences under various themes and policy papers were also submitted to the government for the inclusion in the National Policy and Budget.
Each year the Conference focuses on a timely theme that is of vital importance to the country as a whole as well as the professionals. This years theme is Innovative Digitalization which is of great relevance in the present context when the government is engaged in a development program for the country with emphasis on innovation and digitalization.
Developments in new digital technology offer new opportunities to innovate in designing new products and services to satisfy the changing societal needs. However, for those engaged in such tasks, creating such products and services may create new issues and challenges that will have to be addressed effectively.
Digitization in todays world has become a must to every type of business for survival and growth, as it facilitates continuous development whilst being cost efficient. Innovation may mean changing your business model completely and adapting to changes in your own environment to deliver better products or services to cater to the new and continuously evolving demands.

Own a happy pet squirrel
Some say that its wrong to keep wild animals as pets. They belong in their natural environment. Then again, others might say that all animals were once wild, and humans managed to tame some of them and turn them into domestic animals. At any rate, no animal should be kept in a cage.
If you want to have a nice, happy squirrel around, you could consider keeping it outside, or letting it come near your house. Its better to let the squirrel be in its natural environment. You can befriend it so that it visits from time to time to eat or play. Nonetheless, given below are some suggestions to care for pet squirrels which are kept in the house.
Water
Always keep a bowl of water around for your squirrel. This water should be changed daily. It is recommended to use non-plastic bowls for the same. As these animals are rodents, they like to chew on plastic.
Diet
They can eat a variety of foods. You can feed them unsalted peanuts or unsalted sunflower seeds. They also like shelled and unshelled nuts like almonds, hazel nuts, walnuts, pecans, and so on. However, these should also be unsalted. Some may also eat fruits and vegetables like grapes, apples, tomatoes, cherries, melons, and avocados. Some may enjoy sugar-free peanut butter, cucumber, corn, pear, spinach, lettuce, blueberries, kiwi, banana, mango, pineapple, raisins, peach, apricot, nectarine, figs, or strawberries. Apparently, each squirrel has different tastes in food, so you cannot know for sure what exactly your pet may eat. Some people feed their squirrels rat food bought from pet shops. However, being primarily wild animals, squirrels prefer their food to be as natural as possible. The best feeding hours are at 8:00 a.m. and 6 p.m. (twice a day). The squirrels diet also depends on its age.
Sleeping Hours
In their natural environment, squirrels are awake for a certain period of time--a few hours after sunrise and a few hours before sunset. They spend the rest of the day sleeping or simply relaxing. They have very healthy sleeping hours. During their awake hours, they usually have plenty of energy, and love to run, climb trees, and play a lot.
Nature and Basic Care
If you want your squirrel to play around the house, you need to make sure that there arent any dangerous objects like electric wires that it might chew on, or cats or dogs that might not be very friendly towards it and may try to hunt and eat it. You should also be careful while handling squirrels because they have really sharp teeth and claws. Some owners solve this problem by using cat nail clippers.
When you hold a squirrel, avoid grabbing it by the tail and hold its entire body instead. It feels a lot more comfortable if treated gently. It is said that squirrels make for wonderful pets and get affectionate towards owners. Some can even recognize their own names and come when called. They can do tricks, especially the flying squirrels that are famous for their jumping abilities. Some also like looking out of the window. They always like to be in action. As they might get bored, the best thing is to let them play outside. They cannot survive otherwise. You can make all sorts of improvisations of tree-like objects that they can climb on or jump from.

PBJ VIOLATED PROCEDURE - FINANCE HEAD
Former Treasury Secretary Dr.P.B. Jayasundera had issued treasury bonds worth Rs.14 billion to SriLankan Airlines in 2012 without following proper procedure, SriLankan Airlines Finance Head Yasantha Dissanayake stated.
He was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing irregularities at SriLankan airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
Although funds had been approved for the airline by the Cabinet and Parliament, Dr.Jayasundera instead had issued treasury bonds to the airlines, he added.
Cross examined by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC, Dissanayake said Dr.Jayasundera had directed not to sell or use bonds as a guarantee to obtain funds but had issued a Treasury Guarantee for SriLankan Airlines to obtain a US$ 175 million loan from the Dubai based Mashreq Bank.
Dissanayake said that when the airline sought permission to obtain loans from NDB Investment Bank and Singapore based Barclays Bank, Dr.Jayasundera had refused the request. He later had given the Treasury Guarantee and instructed to obtain the loan from Mashreq Bank.
Dissanayake further said the Cabinet had approved a US$ 500 million capital infusion earlier and in the 2011 budget,a further Rs.10,000 million for the airline, but at no instance had mentioned about providing the airline with treasury bonds instead of funds.
Dissanayake said the airline had not received these approved funds and as the financial situation of the national carrier got worse he and senior officials had met Dr.Jayasundera to discuss the matter. He said several other senior officials of the CBSL too were present at the discussions in addition to Dr.Jayasundera.
During discussions Dr.Jayasundera had said that he would provide treasury bonds instead of monies. According to Dissanayake, SriLankan officials had met Dr.Jayasundera on three other occasions after that to discuss the matter.
Later, when the airline proposed to obtain a loan from either the above mentioned local bank or the Singapore based bank, Dr.Jayasundera had refused both and instead had given a treasury guarantee to obtain the loan from the Mashreq Bank he added.
Dissanayake said he was accompanied by SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe, CEO Kapila Chandarsena, Director Susantha Ratnayake, W.A.Nalini from the Bank of Ceylon for the discussion held with Dr.Jayasundera on February 13, 2012.

## Title: Peoples sovereignty and legislative power
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, September 28, 2018 - 01:00
Peoples sovereignty and legislative power
The cardinal principle embedded in democratic governance is that people shall have their sovereignty with them which is inalienable to a coterie of rulers. This necessitates the assurance of the prevalence of the substantive safeguards in the Constitution to forestall any deterioration of the liberty of the people. Therefore an undeniable duty is cast upon the framers of a Constitution to insert provisions to strike a healthy balance between the powers of the rulers and the liberty of the people. This is also linked to the need for striking proper separation of powers among the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary in the context of peoples sovereignty.
Article 3 of the 1978 constitution describes sovereignty to include the powers of Government, fundamental rights and the franchise. Moreover, under the 1978 Constitution, there is no supreme body such as the National State Assembly that existed under the 1972 Constitution. Under the 1978 Constitution, of the institutions that exercise the powers of government namely, the Presidency, parliament and the judiciary  none is supreme. At no stage are fundamental rights and franchise delegated to anyone. Thus, clearly popular sovereignty is the basis of the present Sri Lanka constitutional system.
Case Law
The concept of peoples sovereignty and its impact on legislative power may be briefly examined with particular reference to some of the significant decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Development Councils Bill
The Sovereignty of the Peoples came into focus in the Determination of the Supreme Court with respect to the Development Councils Bill. As provided by the Bill:
A Development Council shall have power to levy in the prescribed manner such taxes, rates and other charges as may be determined of the Minister in charge of the subject of finance by order published in the Gazette
The Supreme Court after observing that the power to levy taxes, rates or other charges contained in the Bill has been left entirely to the Development Council and that in terms of Article 148 taxes may be imposed only under the authority of Parliament, held as follows: A wide and sweeping power to impose taxes, rates and levies at will is an attribute of the sovereign legislature and the conferment of such power on any other body constitutes an abdication and alienation of legislative power.
The Supreme Court further stated that, the conferment of an unrestricted power of imposing taxes rates and levies  in another body, is such a fundamental departure from what may be done under our Constitution that it both contravenes Article 76  and is inconsistent with Article 3
Consequently the Supreme Court ruled that  as it stands, the Bill can only become law if it is passed in the manner indicated in Article 83 and is approved by the People at a Referendum.
This ruling in effect takes into consideration not only Article 3 which is entrenched in Article 83 but also Articles 4(a) and 76(1) (though not entrenched) as having an impact on Article 3. However, the prefatory words as it stands in the Supreme Court ruling enabled Parliament at the Committee stage to amend the impugned clause by requiring any taxes, rates or other charges levied by a Development Council to be approved by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister in charge of the subject of finance and confirmed by Parliament and published in the Gazette.
The effect of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent committee stage amendment would appear to be that, although provisions of a proposed Bill may be obnoxious to certain provisions of the Constitution which may impinge on provisions entrenched under Article 83 (in this instance Article 3) the potential which those un-entrenched articles possess to become impliedly entrenched could be got over by a suitable amendment.
The original draft of the Bill had sought to confer unfettered power on the proposed Development Councils to levy taxes, rates and other charges. This is what was found by the Supreme Court to be repugnant to Article 3 read with Article 76(1) (and impliedly Article 4(a). By amending the impugned clause at the committee stage which required Parliament to confirm any by-law of the said Council the legislative power of the people in imposing taxes, rates and other charges which was to be exercised by Parliament stood justified in terms of Article 76(3) of the Constitution. It is submitted that, the Supreme Court ruling carries a special significance in the context of the present Constitution in that, the concept of Sovereign power of the people contained in Article 3 was employed to give effect to the doctrine of Separation of Powers, that is, legislative power of the people conferred on Parliament as separated from the province of executive power.

Princess Charlotte has a double!
Victoria Evereds family were sitting down in their lounge room when it happened.
Her daughter Scarlett suddenly burst up off the couch and dashed to the television screen, shouting: Its me! It was a scenario that mum-of-three Victoria, 38, had seen before.
For two years, little Scarlett, three, had been a Princess Charlotte lookalike and the tot got confused every time her double was on TV.
But Scarlett isnt the only one! Strangers do a double take wherever she and her mum go  and Scarlett absolutely adores the attention.
People comment on it all the time. Youll be in the supermarket and people come up and say she looks just like Charlotte, Victoria tells New Idea.
When were out and about and people say it, she laughs and smiles. She does love the attention.
Adorable Scarlett was signed up by a lookalike agency when she was just 15 months old, after her grandma realised she bore a striking resemblance to the fourth in line to the throne.
Since then the tot has starred in three viral supermarket campaigns, modelled dressing gowns and even got to open up a winter wonderland with other royal lookalikes.
When Princess Charlotte turned one, there was a magazine feature with lots of pictures and my mum said Scarlett looked just like her, Victoria explains.
Mum said: Why dont you see if she could be a lookalike. I sent Scarletts picture to a lookalike agency and she was working that weekend. Her first job was for a viral video campaign for a supermarket when she was 15 months old, to mark the Queens 90th birthday. They were filming so the director was keeping them separate, but people were walking past and doing a double take. It was hilarious. It had millions of views on their social media platforms. It was so surreal.
Stay-at-home mum Victoria also entered her daughter into a competition to find the best lookalike, which she won in April 2017.
Scarlett was then asked to open up a Christmas fairground last year with Prince William lookalike Simon Watkinson and Duchess of Cambridge lookalike Heidi Agan.
It was lovely for her. She got to walk around the park and meet Father Christmas and got to go ice skating before everybody else arrived, Victoria, from Kent, UK, says.
They took pictures of her with the other lookalikes on the ice rink, then people were coming over to speak to her. She loved it. Shes a very sociable, friendly, outgoing little girl and it comes very naturally to her. It doesnt seem like shes doing any work. Shes just having fun. I would love her to meet Princess Charlotte one day  that would be amazing.
But right now, being the princess double is enough.
Ill be over the moon if Scarlett can continue being a lookalike. We have a lovely memory book of all her press cuttings so that she can see it when shes older, Victoria beams.
And Scarletts endeavours bring added joy to her whole family, according to her mum who says the tots brothers are so proud of their sister.
Her brothers love it. They think its hilarious. Every time shes in the paper or part of a campaign, they take it in to show their classmates at school, Victoria says.
Theyre so proud of her  especially when she won the competition. She is a bit of a diva and I think that comes with having older brothers  they do love to spoil her. Shes the princess in our family. She enjoys it and if she stops enjoying it we wont do it anymore. As long as Scarletts having fun, thats the most important thing.

He had noted that the TNA political representatives had given repeated assurances to the people in their electorate that they would resolve the problem of PTA detainees through negotiation with the Government and that they could no longer make them wait.
The Government had briefed the TNA leadership about the current status of legal proceedings with regard to the PTA detainees. According to sources, the TNA had requested general amnesty for the prisoners held under the PTA and the Government members had told them to wait till President Maithripala Sirisena returns to the country to continue the discussions as the power to grant general amnesty lies with him.
Another round of discussions to reach a solution to the matter has been scheduled for next Tuesday at the Justice Ministry.

Rocell implements Carbon Black Defense
Royal Ceramics Lanka (Rocell), one of the largest tiles and sanitary ware manufacturers in Sri Lanka, recently deployed Carbon Black Defense to protect its IT infrastructure from any vulnerabilities from cybercrime.
The cloud-based Carbon Black Defense (Cb Defense) system will provide Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), enabling Rocell to defend itself against the most advanced cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, and non-malware attacks. MS Technologies as the local partner, collaborated with SAT to implement the software.
Sanjaya Padmaperuma, Chief Executive Officer of South Asian Technologies, Authorised Distributor for Carbon Black in Sri Lanka said, Cyber attackers are innovating faster than traditional defenses can keep up.
Therefore, installing a virus guard today is like sticking a band aid for influenza. Today, companies need a solution that captures data from every endpoint and analyses each event stream in context, identifying emerging attacks that yesterdays security technologies might miss and deploy a suitable response in real time and to any location without any delay. This is the solution Carbon Black can bring to customers to ensure their digital transformation journey is secure and complete.
Operating one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities and largest distribution networks spanning over 50 owned showrooms and a wider dealer network, Rocell relies on IT to keep the system operational and expanding, said Isanka Attanayake, Manager IT Infrastructure. Carbon Black Defense, the solution deployed at Rocell, draws from its global footprint, to use advanced predictive models to analyse complete endpoint data and uncover malicious behaviour to stop all types of attacks before they compromise an organisations IT infrastructure.
Carbon Black Defense also allows for quickly visualisation of the attack chain to see exactly what attackers are trying to do and create a secure shell to any endpoint on or off the network to address critical issues.
Another key advantage of Carbon Black Defense is that it can automate operational tasks and integrate with your existing tools to boost the productivity of everyone on your team, taking it a step ahead of traditional antivirus applications that lag behind emerging attacks and requires too much manual effort to stay effective.
It can also deploy seamlessly, with less than 1% CPU and disk space per endpoint, Regional Sales Leader for Carbon Black Singapore Pte Ltd, Kang Yeong Wong said.

Recently, Sudhirs Pakistani counterpart, Bashir Chacha aka Chacha Chicago, helped him out with the flight tickets, food and stay in Dubai and Abu Dhabi for the Asia Cup.
Its pure love. You know money will come and go with Allahs grace. I told Sudhir you just come here and I will take care of everything. I am not a rich person but my heart is as big as an ocean. If I help you, Allah will be happy, Bashir Chacha told www.xtratime.in from the UAE.
Last year, Rohit had arranged for Nilam to return home to Sri Lanka from India to see his ailing father. Rohit had also offered financial help for a surgery but Nilam had refused to take any money.
Besides, Senanayake is no stranger to Indian cricketers. He was invited by Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma for their wedding reception in 2017.
Kohli was rested for the Asia Cup and Rohit was named captain. After winning their opening match against Hong Kong, India defeated Pakistan twice and Bangladesh to reach the final.

Sri Lanka was ranked 165th in the 2014 World Press Freedom Index and has since moved to the 131st place in 2018, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
There is clearly a long way to go, but we are moving in the right direction, he said.
Addressing the 20th Anniversary of the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility yesterday at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, Minister said that the freedom of media directly contributes to the economic, political and social well-being of the country.
We do expect balanced, unbiased and fact based reporting.It would strengthen our democracy without harming our core values, he said.
He further noted that by keeping the government and other institutions accountable for their actions, media is a powerful tool used to promote democracy and the rule of law and added that enabling a free, independent and responsible media should be the priority of any governments agenda.
Since the Unity Government was established, much has been done in Sri Lanka to ensure that journalists can fulfill their role without interference or intimidation by the government, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said that Right to Information Act was a significant reform in empowering an independent media and added that as a result fact based journalism will be more prevalent.
He said that media is moving towards a more sensational perspective rather than giving prominence to facts and pointed out how media sensationalised the Free Trade Agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka without revealing the real facts.

Several PPP projects in the pipeline - Thilan Wijesinghe
Chairman of National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP) Thilan Wijesinghe yesterday said NAPPA is looking at ways how PPP could be used to make state owned entities viable in the country.
He said, Kandy Mahaiyawa Urban Housing Project, Pettah Multimodel Hub, Ekala Aero City Project, Convention Centre Port City, Medical Complex port city, School at Port City, Dedduwa integrated tourism development project, Colombo Port cruise terminal, renewable energy park in Pooneryn, Barge mounted power plant are some of the PPP projects in the pipeline in the country. He was speaking at the 31st annual conference OPA under the theme, Innovative Digitalization, held at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel yesterday.
Talking about technological aspects, Wijesinghe said the delay in implementing the Transit Smart Card Project in Sri Lanka is a major concern. Transit Smart Card project has been gravitating among Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) ICTA, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Transport and various other line ministries over the last two and a half years.
However, we have thrown our hat into the ring and taken some control of it. What we have today is a brilliant technical solution. But it is sad that there is no idea how this project can be implemented from a financial model perspective, he said.
He also revealed that PPP Agency or any other line ministries currently dont have a single tangible large scale digital infrastructure project thats under implementation stage.
He said the government should be essential partners in shaping the transition to new scientific, technological, economic and social framework.
Subsequently, NAPPP would be able to play a catalytic role in facilitating PPPs in digital infrastructure and act as a leading partner for generating economic productivity, he said.

He also noted that Sri Lanka has a successful track record in implementing PPPs with no failed transactions. Also, the government must not over- estimate what it can do, he said.
He added, Sri Lanka has financially closed over US $ 5 billion worth of PPP projects in the last 20 years. If you go back to the 1996-2000 era when I was the Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman, that was the time when Sri Lanka embarked on the PPP journey and financially closed almost a $1 billion worth of PPP projects over a five-year period, he said.

Shift to digital Human Resource Management vital - Prof Dharmasiri
The Organization of Professional Association of Sri Lanka, holding their annual conference for the second consecutive day yesterday listed the importance of moving onto digital Human Resource Management (HRM) for the future Sri Lanka. Not varying with the Basic idea of HRM Digital HR transforms HR by maximizing the opportunities technology brings.
HRM is a matter of seven Gs: Goal, Get, Give, Grow, Glue, Glow, and Guard, addressing the gathering Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, Director of IPM said.
He further said that there should be a proper balance in high-tech high-touch harmony, referring to Human Resource Management and Robotic Resource Management (RRM). Almost 50% of the jobs are invaded by machines in the next 30 years. Hence paradox navigation is the future for digital HR cooperating with the multi-cultural, multi-generational, multi-skilled workforces.
Workplaces, workforces becomes digital except HR. The new generation becomes a digital generation such that there will be a tremendous challenge when dealing with the next generation talents.
Rate of technology is so fast now, Harsha Purasinghe, Chairman and CEO of Microimage said adding further that organizations need to use the power of digital technology in daily routines.
Everything needs to be real time with Employee engagements. Digital tools need to be adopted by organizations so that people can work from anywhere and mechanisms should be there to monitor their performance.
Apparently a digital platform needs to be built with access to cloud facilities, mobile and social technology and data analytics.
We are still in the early stages of AI and concepts such as Internet of Things/ Wearable Technology and Artificial Intelligence have become common topics of discussion.
Therefore devices need to be integrated with such technologies to assist in the working environment. Purasinghe added. Many large companies are re-inventing for the future, new job titles are emerging, however ethics and values cannot be forgotten irrespective of the fact that everything is digital and it must be ensured that peoples wishes are fulfilled within an organization.

From soccerite to a dream ruggerite!
He was a exemplary Cop in its most distinguished sense.And famous as Rugby National Coach, National Selector, Captain of the Police and Manager. He was a Footballer too. He played in 7 --yes, seven Clifford Cup Finals. Arguably a record.

BENNA the Josephian and the Serviceman was Best in Class and bore all these trappings lightly on his shoulders.
BENEDICTS achievements in the field played with an oval ball called rugby is amazing, unbelievable and which is not likely to be equaled or surpassed, not only be any Josephian, but a ruggerite from any other school as well. We will detail his record as we move on.
Records he can boast of
While any other ordinary mortal will want to flaunt his plumes, or walk like a cock of the yard with nothing to show, BENEDICT has records that he can boast of and go tell it on the mountains. But todate he remains a simple, unassuming and likeable character we all ought to know.
BENEDICTS first love was football as a young kid at school. Had he continued in the kicking game he had the inborn talent to succeed and reach the top. But he was forced into the running with the ball, passing and kicking game by a former Josephian rugby captain Neville Perera who persuaded him into the game of rugby.
It was Perera noticing his unlimited ability to be an even better ruggerite than a footballer who finally convinced him to take to rugby. Incidentally once on tour of England covering the Champions Trophy cricket tournament for the ANCL, I had the good fortune of meeting Perera.
Mentioning Benedict
It was at the residence of Dr.Gunasingham a former Air Force and Sri Lanka hockey goalkeeper in Kent in the company of their fair ladies and during a bit of elbow bending talking sport especially rugby and his mentioning BENEDICT and how he spotted Benedicts prowess in rugby.
The moment BENEDICT handled the oval ball, he realized the unlimited, enjoyable moments ahead and the thrills and spills the game beckoned and beyond the touch lines were the bottom lines for him. Believe it or not he is arguably the only ruggerite to play in seven Clifford Cup finals. Amazing isnt it!
His rugby expedition began in 1963 when playing for the schools first side in football that he also took to rugby. He won school colours in both sports and in quitting school in 1964 he joined the Havelocks rugby scrum which team was captained by that outstanding left hand batsman and also captain of Trinity College Nimal Maralande. He excelled as a 2nd rower and in the next year playing under yet another Trinitian who hooked out the oval ball with success Frankie David.
Law abiding citizen
BENEDICT then wanting to be a law abiding citizen and see that others also did so to maintain the lofty traditions of law and order, joined the Police in 1967 in an era where top sportsmen in cricket and rugby players joined the khakied gentry and winning trophies at cricket and rugby became the rule rather than the exception. The names of the outstanding cricketers and ruggerites in the Police in that era are too numerous to mention.
BENNA as he was fondly called joined the Police when an Old Peterite S.Sivendren was making waves as hooker and captain of the Police team that was then playing in the B Division. BENEDICT played a pivotal role and helped the team win the B Division Title which earned them promotion to the top league and rub shoulders with the elite club teams.
In 1967 the Police playing in the big league, served notice of what to expect from future Police teams when playing in the Clifford Cup final they lost to Havelocks 3-11. Then BENNA played in the 1970 Police team led by another inside three quarter who was like a gazelle in M.A.Majeed who also played for the country and shared the Clifford Cup with Havelocks led by Jeff Ratnam 6-all.
Unfortunate to lose
Then in 1971 after the JVP insurrection when many service teams were forced to skip the tournament, Police led by prop forward Tanker Hamid which included a few Air Force players of the calibre of Viper Guneratne, Lofty Perera and king Charles Wijewardene played the knock out Cup final but were unfortunate to lose to CR and FC by 21 points to 7.
But BENEDICTS most memorable moment which he still vividly remembers and treasures was the 1972 Clifford Cup final against the CH & FC led by that bulldozer Y.C.Chang. Under the brilliant coaching of a former Trinity great Kavan Rambukwella, the PolIce were not fancied.
But a fantastic conversion by fly half and Sri Lankan soccerite Nimal Abeysinghe from 45 yards out brought the Policemen into the picture. Then when every heart was beating more than normal, BENNA called on another soccerite Nizam Hajireen to convert a penalty in fading light.
When Hajireen obliged
And Hajireen obliged to give Police victory and send their supporters into raptures and the Police had rewritten history by being the first service team to drink off the Clifford Cup.
Incidentally featuring TUAN NIZAM HAJIREEN in these columns a few weeks back I failed to mention that immediately after kicking Police to the Clifford Cup, he got on his iron horse and rode breaking speed limits to the Sugathadasa Stadium to help Police win the Football Association Cup. A truly amazing feat unequaled or surpassed to date in energy, grit and determination. Sportsmen and fans still talk about Hajireens heroics.
When BENEDCT quit the Police it was home coming to Havelocks again and played in the team led by Thajone Savangham that won the Clifford Cup. In 1977 BENNA played in his seventh cup final when Havelocks coached by another Trinity stalwart Ken de Joodt won the cup.
Steered Havies to victory
Then leading the Havies in 1978 he steered them to win the triple  the Sevens Clifford Cup and the Knockout. Lack of space does not allow me to detail all his achievements but suffice to say that he represented Sri Lanka from 1970 to 77, playing against Singapore, England, Asiads in Hong Kong and Colombo. He also toured Hong Kong, Bombay, Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Italy.
BENNA was also coach and referee. Coaching the Police he helped them to a triple winning the Clifford Cup in 1980 under Nimal Lewke, in 94 under Upali Vidanage and 85 under Upali Sahabandu.
Then on the invitation of Kishin my way Butani he took to coaching the CH & FC in 1994 and helped them savor their best years in the game winning the Clifford Cup and the Presidents trophy.
Charismatic Kishin Butani
The charismatic Butani with Hassan Singhawansa as his secretary had it in them to make the club champions with their inspiration and determination. But once he twosome quit the club, the standards dropped alarmingly.
Another former ruggerite, rugby fanatic and financier Rizly Illiyas has taken over and has promised to bring back those glory days to CH, particularly promising and determined to bring Kandy SC down from their perch and to their knees. It will be interesting watching.
BENEDICTS other achievements are: National coach from 1989 to 92. National Rugby Selector in 1995 and 96. Manager of Sri Lanka teams that toured abroad. Vice President SLRFU In 1992. President SLRFU. BENEDICT is married to Jasmin Rajee and has to lovely daughters in Dhisini and Chrisini. His Christian teaching made him a honorable citizen with impeccable honesty and integrity.

A timely request
The conflict in the North and the East of Sri Lanka ended nine years ago and many issues affecting the people in the two provinces have been addressed satisfactorily in the post-conflict scenario. But we are yet to find solutions to many outstanding issues as well, including forging a truly Sri Lankan identity sans man-made differences.
But this is by no means unique to Sri Lanka. Some countries where similar conflicts ended as many as three or four decades back are still struggling to find peace. Indeed, some of the issues are very complex and require a great deal of foresight, consensus and compromise. But in every such case, it is the rulers and people of a given country who should evolve that solution. It cannot be foisted upon by external forces. While the peace processes and advice of other countries can be drawn upon to some extent, any solution must be home-grown and acceptable to all communities.
This was the crux of President Maithripala Sirisenas message to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, where he urged the International Community to give room for Sri Lankans themselves to resolve the problems facing the country without any undue foreign influence.
Look at Sri Lanka from a fresh perspective and consider the tremendous progress made by the Government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedoms, human rights and the rule of law and extend your fullest support to build a progressive, democratic, free and equal society in Sri Lanka, President Sirisena told world leaders.
This was a timely message  and appeal - to the world. To the credit of this Government, it has successfully managed to uplift the countrys image in the eyes of the International Community, totally reversing the previous Governments antagonistic attitude towards the rest of the world. It had an extremely belligerent attitude towards human rights, which was despised by other countries. On the other hand, this Government has strengthened human rights and engaged with the international community from a higher moral pedestal. It is only when our domestic mechanisms and processes are strong that we can ward off any undue foreign influence or interference.
This was reflected in President Sirisenas well-received speech. As an independent country we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us. Sri Lanka is taking action to consolidate peace and forge ahead to develop the economy, and deserves the support and understanding of the international community. We want to appeal to the international community that the right of the Sri Lankan people to find solutions to their problems should be respected.
This is indeed what Sri Lanka has argued before the UN Human Rights Council  that Sri Lanka needs the time and space to evolve its own solutions to some of the vexed problems. In this exercise, there would be no need for foreign mechanisms or personnel, as Sri Lankas domestic judicial and other mechanisms are adequate to deal with any situation. The Government has already established an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and other accountability and investigative mechanisms are being set up.
All these steps have the ultimate goal of peace and reconciliation, but these do not and cannot work in isolation. Many other factors have to fall into place to make them possible. Hence, the Governments steps to consolidate vital pillars such as democracy, personal freedom, good governance, media freedom and independence of the judiciary. In the words of the President such transformative steps have laid the foundation to forge national reconciliation, communal harmony and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country.
There is a saying that the past is a different country, but the converse is that we cannot think of a bright future without coming to terms with the past. We have to study where we went wrong in the post-independence era. Extremist politicians inflamed the passions of communalism for their own benefit, which resulted in a massive ethnic conflagration later on. We should strive to prevent a repetition of those tragic times. The President alluded to this in his wide-ranging speech: As a country that has suffered from violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict.
The one common thread that runs through our collective conscience is our ability to forgive and forget. This is perhaps a legacy of our Buddhism-centred civilization. This is indeed why the Sri Lankan State has rehabilitated thousands of LTTE cadres. Their reintegration to society is part of the Governments reconciliation plans. During his speech, the President quoted from Buddhist Scriptures on the importance of mental healing to explain his point about reconciliation.
Sri Lanka is undertaking a difficult journey. There need not be any illusions about the depth and the gravity of the task in hand. It is a task that requires all Sri Lankans here and abroad to join hands, eschewing all differences for the sake of the Nation. The International Community must unconditionally support these home-grown initiatives that seek to foster harmony among the various communities.

Train fares revised after over a decade - Nimal
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday that train fares are being revised for the first time in over a decade from October 1.
He said train fares had not been increased since 2008 whereas bus fares were increased every year and that train fares were 40 per cent less when compared to bus fares.
This fare revision is based on the instructions by the Treasury to revise rates by at least 15 percent of government institutions that have not raised the rates during the last three years.
Although there has been no change in the minimum train ticket price of Rs 10 for third class, Rs.20 for second class and Rs. 40 for first class, the distance that can be travelled for the ticket has been reduced from nine kilometres to seven.
According to Sri Lanka Railways sources, due to the absence of a fare hike over the past 10 years, the Department had incurred a loss of Rs. 6.7 billion in 2017 alone.
In an environment where the Railway Department makes losses each year, it is necessary to increase rates in order to maintain the service, he opined.

Two more Railway crossing deaths
Two persons were killed and another two injured after they were hit by a train last morning, Police said.
According to Police, they were crossing the road near the Ragama Railway Station when they had met with the accident.
It is reported that while the rail gates were closed for the Kandy-Matara express train to pass, four persons who had disregarded the warning bell had crossed the track and were hit by the express train.
The accident occurred around 7.30 last morning and 78-year-old Annie Margret Peiris, a mother of four had died in the accident. She is a resident of Welisara. However, the other deceased person had not been identified yet.
The younger daughter of the deceased woman, 43-year-old Nilmini Chandrika, a mother of two, is currently receiving treatment in Ward 20 at the Ragama hospital. However, as she is in a state of shock, it was unable to obtain any information regarding the accident from her. However, she had told a relative that they had crossed while hearing the warning bells signaling an oncoming train. She had sustained injuries to the left side of her head and arm.
The other victim, known as Rajendran is also receiving treatment in Ward 20 of the Ragama hospital.
At the time of the accident, there were three trains at the Ragama station, the slow train from Ragama to Colombo Fort was on Track 01,the express train from Kandy to Matara on Track 02 and the Chilaw train on Track 03.
According to Annie Margrets older daughter, her mother had come to the Ragama hospital with her younger sister to attend the clinic yesterday as she was at a relatives funeral. It was not possible to get information from her too as she was in grief.
Meanwhile, an eyewitness and three wheel drivers in the vicinity said that this accident occurred due to the carelessness of the victims.
They added that while the warning bell was being sounded and there were three trains on the tracks, even motorcyclists and cyclists were crossing the tracks.
They noted that several accidents had been reported at that spot where young people attending school and classes had been hit by trains while engaged in conversation on their mobile phones, crossing the tracks.
The people in the area highlighted the dire need in constructing an underground pass for people to cross as this station is a busy point where multiple trains frequently pass on these tracks.

Walk to forget dementia
Dementia occurs as a result of physical debilitating process of the brain. A person with dementia would show clear signs of impaired memory, thinking and behavior.
One of the most common dementias is memory loss.
According to medical experts Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia. Dementia is a collective term used to describe over a 100 physical brain disorders that cause dementia. Seventy percent of people with dementia have Alzheimers.
Other kinds of dementias include; vascular dementia caused by stroke, Lewy body dementia, Fronto-temporal dementia (including Picks disease) and alcohol related dementias.
While it is also possible to have more than one type, all these dementias damage and kill brain cells hampering the smooth function of it.
While it is still not known what exactly causes dementia, medical researchers all over the world work on finding causes and developing treatment.
However a recent study has found that having an extensive social network seems to protect against dementia. People with poor or limited social network had a tendency of 60 percent increased risk of dementia.
In Sri Lanka it is an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people have dementia.
Lanka Alzheimers Foundation
A friend in need is a friend indeed and Lanka Alzheimers Foundation (LAF) is one such friend for people with dementia and their families.
LAF (www.alzlanka.org) situated in Colombo 10 functions with the mission of improving the quality of life of those with Alzheimers and related dementias and enhance the wellbeing of their families and custodians or carers.
Registered with the ministry of social services, LAF is a member of the world body, Alzheimers Disease International (ADI) that represents 79 countries.
Co-founder and the President of LAF, Lorraine Yu spearheads activities at the centre with her dedicated team of volunteers.
The community has the responsibility to understand the symptoms of dementia and have empathy towards people having dementia. Through awareness building we are on a quest to raise a dementia friendly community in Sri Lanka, says Lorraine Yu.
She recommends people over the age of 60 to take the free Memory Screening conducted at the LAF.
People are concerned of their physical wellbeing but they should know their mental wellbeing is as important as physical wellbeing. It is time people realized the importance of the memory screening and assessment we offer, she said. Everything done at LAF is free of charge for its clients. (LAF calls people with dementia who visit for therapy as clients)
She said social isolation is equally bad for the custodians or carers of people with dementia thus their wellbeing too should be looked into. LAF activity centre offers a day-off to these people by taking care of clients on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
We have setup LAF activity centre here as non-pharmacological intervention is far more beneficial than use of drugs for people with dementia. Volunteers keep company to the clients by stimulating, supporting, encouraging and praising the activities and artistic creations of theirs, she says.
Art triggers dormant memories and emotions and inspire conversions among people with dementia. The art project has provided LAFs clients many enjoyable hours of self-worth, which has helped to enhance their communication skills, brain function and social interaction, she adds.
Identification Bracelet for the clients is an innovation by LAF.
Can people reduce the risk of having dementia Look after your heart, follow a healthy diet, challenge your brain, be physically active and enjoy social activities is the message from LAF to the community.

Walk for your heart
Lanka Hospitals will host the annual Heart Walk in partnership with Sri Lanka Heart Association this month in view of World Heart Day to raise awareness on heart disease.
The Heart Walk, considered one of the largest health awareness campaigns in the country to-date, will be held this month with the participation of members of Sri Lanka Heart Association, medical staff of cardiology units from across the country, school children, the armed forced, corporates and well-wishers. The event will be held under the theme declared by the World Heart Federation, A promise for my heart, for your heart, for all our hearts, to deliver the message on the importance of eating healthy, developing an active lifestyle and saying no to smoking.
Heart disease is considered the main cause of death in Sri Lanka, with a growing number of young people being diagnosed with heart diseases in recent years. The most common form of heart disease is coronary artery disease which is caused due to various risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle. These are factors that can be eliminated by adopting a healthy lifestyle and our campaign is to communicate that message to the public, President of Sri Lanka Heart Association, Dr. M. R. Mubarak said.
Lanka Hospitals considers it a great privilege to partner with the Sri Lanka Heart Association to deliver the message of heart disease prevention. As one of the best equipped, state-of-the-art hospitals in Sri Lanka with a full-fledged Heart Centre on par with global healthcare standards, we are fully equipped to serve patients who require cardiac treatment. We believe that as a hospital we have an important role to play in creating awareness about the risks of heart disease and are firmly committed to working closely with the Sri Lanka Heart Association to deliver this message in future, Lanka Hospitals Group CEO, Dr. Prasad Medawatte said.
The Heart Centre at Lanka Hospitals is acclaimed for performing the highest number of heart surgeries and a vast number of cath Lab procedures in the private sector at present and is the only private hospital specialized in conducting paediatric heart surgeries.
The Lanka Hospitals Heart Centre comprises three cardiac theatres where bypass surgery, complex congenital heart defect corrective surgery as well as valve replacement and repair are performed.

Lanka reached five WC finals under interim committee stewardship :
Who is the best Lankaputhra cricket coach Chandika or Jerome
When the Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha was being grilled in parliament by members of the opposition over the countrys cricketing woes last week, he was seen waxing eloquent on why the country should give every possible chance to a Lankaputhra coach to succeed. He was also seen bandying around statistics to show that Chandika Hathurusingha had a much higher win ratio than the preceding foreign coaches. This is after the Daily News had shown that all previous successes that the Sri Lanka team achieved were under foreign coaches who focussed on coaching without getting themselves embroiled in team selections.
One can only empathize with the Minister for his limited knowledge on the subject, and his dependence on data what his secretaries and advisors are feeding him. A few simple facts that the Minister needs to be enlightened on are:
lChandika Hathurusingha is no Lankaputhra but a citizen of Australia with dual nationality. He in fact falls in to the category of migrant employment which by the way includes his entire support staff hired by the Sumathipala administration on his recommendation. Ironically, at a time when deputy ministers are actively canvassing with people to stop investing in foreign cars and postpone foreign holidays in an effort to prop up the Sri Lankan Rupee, every penny that is paid to the support staff of the Sri Lanka team exits our shores and goes against the grain of what is being advocated.
lWhat the minister has not been educated on is that another Lankaputhra coach has a pretty impressive record chalking up a win ratio of over 50% during the short tenure in which he carried out head coach duties in an interim capacity. That person is none other than Jerome Jayaratne who possessed the required knowledge and credentials. Sri Lanka achieved a 2-0 win in Tests against West Indies, a 3-0 ODI whitewash and a 1-1 success rate against the T20 World Cup 2016 winning West Indian team. His achievements in New Zealand too would have been much more impressive than what the records suggest if not for some strange on-field decision-making.
Unfortunately, he has today been confined to a desk job at SLC headquarters in the capacity of COO (newly created) with scant disregard for his core area of expertise which is cricket coaching. It was during his tenure as Head of Coaching at SLC that much of the youngsters that hold permanent places in the team were groomed and the team achieved creditable successes at ICC conducted tournaments. Ironically, the HOC duties too were entrusted to another migrant employee with no coaching credentials by the Sumathipala administration with a fashionable title of High Performance coach to boot. Should anybody be surprised at the woes SLC is facing today with several key positions at SLC being held sans credentials The million dollar question that begs to be answered is if this caravan can carry us to success at WC 2019 We all know the talent is out there. But who is going to harness that talent and shepherd them!
Jayaratne was tasked with this responsibility by the Sidath Wettimuny interim committee when Marvan Atapattu tendered his resignation over a string of poor results. Jayaratne was parachuted over Romesh Kaluwitharana who was the serving A team coach at the time, due to his coaching credentials. Whilst, Kaluwitharana was an extremely talented cricketer and an opening batsman, ones cricketing skills does not necessarily make one a good coach on retirement from active cricket. It is also a known fact that the interim committee had several preliminary discussions with high profile foreign coaches who had shown keen interest to takeover the position of head coach. However, with SLC elections looming on the horizon, the interim committee was of the view that it was unethical for them to hire a head coach leaving it instead for the incoming elected body. Incidentally, Jayaratne is also a thoroughbred Lankaputhra.
Decisions of this nature, and the spirit in which decisions were made holding the interest of the country paramount at all times, further demonstrates the importance of having ethical, and experienced personnel at the helm to navigate the ship, especially at a time like today when the ship has hit a hurricane threatening to break it apart. It must also be highlighted that when the Sri Lanka team progressed to finals (five in total) at several ICC conducted World Cup championships (2007-2014) it was under the stewardship of interim committees.
These facts are being laid out for the Sports Minister to make learned decisions in the best interest of the country when navigating the stormy waters he is confronted with at present especially where the most popular game in the island cricket is concerned.

Take on favourites India in todays Asia Cup final:
Will Bangladesh be third time lucky 
DUBAI, Thursday: Cricket they say is a game of uncertainties and it was proved on Wednesday when Bangladesh upset the odds to beat Pakistan and qualify for the Asia Cup final against India when the cricket crazy fans of India and Pakistan were getting ready to witness a high-voltage final between Asias two fiercest rivals.
Now, having done the hard work to get there Bangladesh will feel confident that they are only one step away from lifting the Asia Cup for the first time in their history. They of course have an uphill task having to battle for supremacy against India the most threatening side in the Asian cricket circuit. However, given their stunning performances thus far in the tournament, only a fool would think the final is as good as over and India has lifted the coveted trophy.
Bangladesh have previously reached the finals twice in 2012 and in 2016 only to be beaten by Pakistan by two runs and by India (when it was held in the T20 format) by eight wickets respectively. So will it be a case of being third time lucky for the Tigers
Despite their top order without the reliable Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan (both injured) not firing they have incredible depth in their batting as they showed against Pakistan recovering from 12-3 to post a total of 236 and defend it successfully.
Their former captain Mushfiqur Rahim is in the form of his life. The wicket-keeper has scored 297 runs so far in this tournament at an astonishing average of over 70. Mahmudullah is their other key player having amassed over 150 runs while Mohammad Mithun has accumulated 135 runs.
Every match was a final in Super Four
Every match we encountered anxious moments and from Afghanistan Super Four game, it was a virtual final for us. Hopefully the top order clicks in the final. If they dont, then the middle and lower order needs to perform. No point thinking about technique and stuff at this juncture when we are playing a final, said Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza at the pre-final press conference.
When we were in the final in 2012 we rarely used to win matches against big teams and now we have competed regularly. Some of the players like Shakib, Mushfiq, Mustafiz and Tamim have contributed greatly in these victories. This year we are in final without our top two performers, and boys should feel proud about it, he said.
Musfiqur who won the man of the match award for his fighting knock of 99 against Pakistan said, You cannot take any team for granted, this was just another game against Pakistan and we treated it like that, all the guys were spirited with that, this is our third chance to go into the final, and hopefully we can make it number one time winning the final.
In the bowling Bangladeshs most prized asset is the fans favourite fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman who has overcome injuries and obstacles to make a grand comeback to spearhead Bangladeshs Asia Cup campaign along with the cunning off-spin of Mehidy Hasan who has not picked up many wickets but have kept things in check with a magnificent economy rate of just over three runs an over.
The third factor in Bangladeshs progress so far is the leadership qualities of Mashrafe Mortaza. With unparalleled dedication in fielding and with the ball Mortaza has impressed with his clever captaincy that has been another factor of Bangladeshs success.
Moment Tamim entered the field my Asia Cup was won
Let me be honest, the moment Tamim entered the field against Sri Lanka as the last man to help Mushfiq score those runs, my Asia Cup was won, said Mortaza.
Every tournament has been a distinct journey whether 2012 final against Pakistan or 2016 against India. Everytime we encountered a few situations overcame and got into the finals. The journey in this tournament was a difficult one as we started losing players from the very first game (Tamim). There was also concern whether Mushfiq could play or not but then he played despite not being gully fit. We can learn from him, he said.
I think its a great lesson for the boys and young players to learn that its all about fighting till the last ball. It was difficult (road) to the final without performers like Shakib and Tamim not being available. The good thing is that the boys didnt give up although we lost at the group stage against Afghanistan and India. The boys have done really well and with a match to go we can fight on. Lets see.
Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan the leading run-getter in the tournament with 327 runs (avg. 81,75) was very much aware of what his side is up against.
I guess theyre balanced, know what their strengths are, theyve improved a lot. Theyre a competitive side. Hats off to them, the way they played and won against Pakistan. When you play all-round cricket, the results will follow, said Dhawan ahead of the final.
The plan we made against them in the previous game, we will try and stick to that. Conditions will remain the same, well plan for individuals by looking at videos of their batsmen, revise and prepare accordingly.
In the Super Four match India beat Bangladesh quite comfortably by seven wickets after bowling out their opponents for 173 runs. But since then Bangladesh has come back strongly with wins over Afghanistan (by 3 runs) and Pakistan (by 37 runs) to be in the final.
The Rohit Sharma led India are the only team in the competition who are unbeaten are expected to continue their winning streak and lift the trophy for a record sixth time (in 50-over format). They are currently on par with Sri Lanka with five wins each.
Of course well carry momentum and give it a best shot, all teams are competitive. Everyone thought it was India-Pakistan in the final, but Bangladesh won a great match. We cant take them lightly just because Pakistan is a bigger team. Bangladesh is playing better cricket, theres a difference between team on paper and who is doing good on the field, thats how I see it, said Dhawan, the vice-captain of the team.
So it all points out to be a blockbuster final provided Bangladesh live upto their form shown in the last two games.

World suffering from Trust Deficit Disorder: UN Chief
UN: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday warned that the world is suffering from a bad case of trust deficit disorder where polarisation is on the rise and cooperation among nations is more difficult as he appealed to the global leaders for renewed commitment to a rules-based order.
Secretary-General Guterres, giving his second address as the UN chief to the world leaders from the iconic lectern in the General Assembly hall, painted a stark picture of the chaos in international order, saying cooperation among countries is less certain and more difficult, and divisions in the Security Council are stark.
World leaders from 193 UN member states, including US President Donald Trump, listened to Antonio Guterres as he voiced concern over the paradoxes facing the globe today.
Trump has been very critical of the United Nations and his administration has withdrawn from key UN institutions such as the Human Rights Council and the landmark UN pacts such as the Paris Climate Agreement.
Our world is suffering from a bad case of trust deficit disorder. People are feeling troubled and insecure. Trust is at a breaking point. Trust in national institutions. Trust among states. Trust in the rules-based global order.
Within countries, people are losing faith in political establishments, polarisation is on the rise and populism is on the march, Guterres said in his address to the General Assembly at the opening of the high-level General Debate.
Trust in global governance is also fragile, as 21st-century challenges outpace 20th-century institutions and mindsets, he said.
The UN Chief said that while the world never had a true system of global governance, still over decades nations established solid foundations for international cooperation but today, the world order is increasingly chaotic.
Power relations are less clear. Universal values are being eroded. Democratic principles are under siege. The rule of law is being undermined. Impunity is on the rise, as leaders and states push the boundaries at home and in the international arena.
The world is more connected, yet societies are becoming more fragmented. Challenges are growing outward, while many people are turning inward. Multi-lateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most, Guterres said.
He stressed that while individual leaders have the duty to advance the well-being of their people, they also have the responsibility to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system.
We need renewed commitment to a rules-based order, with the United Nations at its centre and with the different institutions and treaties that bring the Charter to life, he said.
Guterres voiced this commitment to reform, and to making the United Nations more effective in responding to the needs and aspirations of we the peoples. - NDTV
