Christmas around the world
Poland
In Poland, Christmas Eve is often seen as the start of the new year. They celebrate Christmas Eve by breaking oplatek, a special Christmas wafer, and wishing each person health, happiness, and joy in the coming year. Dinner will be anywhere from five to 13 dishes and will consist of pierogis filled with cheese and potatoes, beet soup (borscht) or wild mushroom soup, and a number of fish and vegetable entrees. In addition to traditional ornaments, the tree is often decorated with Polish chocolate filled with liqueurs, as well as spiced apples and oranges which are gradually snacked on throughout the holiday.
Norway
A main event for children in the Norwegian celebration is Saint Lucia Day on December 13. While the holiday doesnt take precedence over Christmas, it is celebrated in schools across the country with a procession to symbolize the light overcoming the darkness. One young woman is picked to lead the procession wearing a crown of candles, and the other young students follow her, also holding candles and singing a carol called Sankta Lucia. Later, back at school the children eat a saffron bun called Lussekatter (which translates to Lucia cats, because the bun has a tail).
Mexico
In Mexico, as well as many other Latin American countries, Christmas is seen as a quieter, solemn holiday, while Three Kings Day (Da De Los Reyes) in early January is a day for partying and exchanging gifts. Many children who celebrate Three Kings Day leave out their shoes in hopes that one of the Three Wise Men will leave them gifts.
The sharing of rosca de reyes (Three Kings Day bread) is common, and there is either a coin or a small doll of Jesus hidden inside the bread. And whoever finds the doll in his or her piece of bread has to provide the tamales for the upcoming party!
India
In the South of India, in places like Goa and Kerala, Christmas is widely celebrated, and its becoming more popular in places like Mumbai, as well. The holiday is celebrated with firecrackers and the purchasing of new clothes and shoes on Christmas Eve. Traditional pine trees are tough to find, so mango or banana trees are decorated in garlands made of palm fronds with small stones and dolls, or are painted gold. The traditional dish served on Christmas is Pork Vindaloo, and neighbors often exchange home-baked sweets including Kulkuls and gujiyas.
Kenya
In Kenya, the trek home is an important part of Christmas, as many young professional Kenyans who work in cities like Nairobi and Mombasa make the long journey back to their villages to be with family. The holiday journey home can be chaotic, because everyone is trying to get home on buses, vans, and whatever transport is available, but the season is a time for young professionals to reflect on their origins as well as honor older generations.
Christmas Day is also about making a fashion statement, as many young Kenyans wear special Christmas clothes to church, really dressing to impress. After church, Kenyans eat traditional chapati and goat meat or kibokoni mbuzi, traditional goat curry.
Philippines
The Philippines has one of the longest holiday seasons in the world, starting in September and ending around January 9. Christmas plays, parties, and decorations are in full swing throughout these months, and there are nine night Masses (known as Simbang Gabi) leading up to Christmas Day. The belief is that, if you attend all the Masses, you will get a wish granted in the upcoming year.
When Christmas Eve, or Nochebuena, is celebrated, families indulge in a regional hybrid of local foods like lumpia sariwa, a fresh spring roll, morcon, a meat roll stuffed with sausage, pickles, cheese, and egg, and paella.
Whether youre traveling around the world, or just headed home to spend your holiday season, embracing new and unique traditions is a great way to travel the world from the comfort of your own home and prepare for a fresh and brilliant year ahead. I wish you a happy and worldly holiday and much travel, adventure, and success in the coming year!

CILT conducts John Diandas Memorial Lecture
The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), Sri Lanka held its 16th John Diandas Memorial Lecture recently at the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka.
John Diandas (Hon. FCIT) known as Mr. Transport the world over passed away on 15th July 2002. He was a British citizen born in India in April 1924. He was well known for his extensive knowledge of transport, especially public transport, across the world.
The CILTSL holds three memorial lectures annually in its calendar of events. From its inception the annual John Diandas Memorial Lecture (JDML) was delivered by leading professionals most of who knew John personally. These were always attended by large numbers who are interested about the transport sector.
This years lecture was presented by Dr. Don Jayaweera, Transport Economist / Financial Analyst, Project Management Associate International (Pvt.) Ltd who critically evaluated the topic Can we restore the lost market from Bus Passenger Transport System through Bus sector Reforms
He outlined the reforms attempts in the bus sector, unresolved supply side issues considered for bus sector reforms and key features of the SAHASARA bus passenger reforms project followed by the evaluation of some of the transport development projects and proposals.
The detailed statistics in the presentation showed background information which consist of the economic data, basic market demand on car ownership and fuel consumption of transport sector.
Further Jayaweera emphasized the effect on the traffic, highlighting the fact that the operated vehicle kilometers has increased, but not the passenger kilometersduring the recent past. He added that the estimated average congestion cost in Colombo Metropolitan Area per day has increased approximately to one billion LKR.
Then he deliberated on bus sector reform strategy for 2018 under conceptual outline of SAHASARA which is identified as a cost-free solution for the national transport problem. The basis for SAHASARA is that the total daily income of a bus operator should not depend on the number of passengers who board that particular bus.
Rather, it should be determined by the total take of all buses plying a route on a given day which should then be fairly distributed among all operators based on the total number of turns each bus plied its route.
The question and answer session of the event was very interesting and interactive with the participation of many stakeholders, which has been moderated by Dr. T. Sivakumar, Senior Lecturer, Department of Transport and Logistics Management, University of Moratuwa.
The audience raised many questions on the details of the SAHASARA project and made a number of constructive suggestions for consideration in the implementation. Some of the industry leaders such as Prof. Amal Kumarage, FCILT and Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan, FCILT actively participated in this fascinating session.

Citizens' Mail
Why dont we make law simple and clear
It is now very clear to any citizen of this small island called Sri Lanka that the law of the land should be simple and clear.
Those who have done law and have become attorneys and even Presidents Counsels do state diametrically opposing views on the dissolving of Parliament and appointment of the Prime Minister.
Why it is so It is so because of the fact that the law has been written and published in a style of language which includes so many longer and longer sentences, many different words instead of one simple word, and too many expressions confusing some other expressions in the some context. This is very clear through the different views expressed by different lawyers and many others. The law is like an eel too slippery and big.
Who can avoid laughing at our legal problems Once our legal problem was to know the date on which the duration of the President was over. Common people all over the world do their works without bothering about so many durations and dates.
Law should be made in shorter sentences with simple and clear in meanings and words.
One subject matter should be only at one place. The details of it should not be unmentioned again and again unnecessarily.

Curry for Christmas!
Juliet Coombe tests her haggling skills and learns to cook in the sand dunes on the borders of Yala National Park, one of Sri Lankas most beautiful national parks.
Christmas in the freezing cold might be some peoples idea of fun if you like snow and cooking turkey for hours. However for those who want a wild Christmas in the tropical sun nothing beats a holiday at Jetwing Yala, where you can go on lots of different amazing experiences ranging from the naturalist bat man tour to cooking in the dunes being watched over by the passing wildlife.
If you are serious about cooking curry then you have to get up at the crack of dawn as fresh ingredients are key to making a great curry dish. Its 5am in the morning and unlike everyone else I am not about to jump into a safari jeep and go to the islands national wildlife park, Yala, in search of the much prized leopard or sloth bears walaha that love to eat berries and play as they cross the road. I am in contrast heading off with the hotels Executive Chef, to buy myself a cat fish from the local fisherman and learn to cook over an open bush fire in traditional clay pots, or even buy a mini shark, if we get lucky and the catch proves to be a good one, at Kirinda fishing harbour.
As we drove into Kirinda harbour the place was abuzz with whirling fishing boat engines and wooden crates, dripping with ice and sea water, being unloaded as dealers in brightly coloured sarongs gathered in a circle. Each one had old school notebooks, with well-chewed pencils hanging from pieces of string, recording todays prices based on what the boats were hauling in. I am reminded, by an old man sewing up his net with a giant needle that this is one of the oldest professions in the world and the only place social media does not yet have a hold. The dealers opened and shut their books while they haggled, even walking away at times waving their hands in the air, all part of the theatre of making a deal over the cost of a catch of the day and once decided various sizes of scales are then hung up in a row to weigh in the different boats hauls, which consist of, sadly, owing to the bad weather, a rather large amount of Eratavalla, which is a tough chewy tuna-like fish.
In the background gold amulet necklaces were being sold from a traders arm, alongside rather discoloured ice keeping the fish cool and a lotto guy, on a Singer bike, creating a frenzy after buying the winning ticket, as more door-to-door salesmen turned up from surrounding villages, on the equivalent of Honda MD 90 motorbikes with only a slab of wood tied onto the top to keep the fish from popping out on the bumpy entrance way into the harbour, where you now have to pay a car and persons entrance fee.
Boats keep coming in as the sun rises over the harbour and the price seems to rise with it with each successive lot brought in. I decide to cook Thalapath, better known as Blue Marlin, as it is good with tamarind and the spices grown on the Jetwing Hena Farm back at the Jetwing Yala tented glamping experience. Of course, we must pick up a few curd-cooking pots on our return and this was a wonderful excuse to see how they are made either by machine or hand thrown from the mud that is dredged up from the lake. Here you see the women of the pottery village slap mud onto a turning wheel and keep it moving with their feet as they throw one pot after another.
They are then dried in the sunshine and fired in home built kilns and the more artistic among them make elephant cups with the handle as the trunk to sell to passing tourists. Except for the dogs that darted in an and out of these home run businesses the experience of being with the community and talking about indigenous cooking was as interesting as being part of the daily ritual of haggling for fish.
I am excited to learn more about the health benefits of the island spices and herbs and working out which ones best suit fish or vegetable curries. We go to the Hena Farm, next to the solar panels that give the hotel natural energy, and pick pumpkin, wild gringos and small red chillis with dynamite flavour that in truth could easily blow your head off. We enjoy a refreshing coconut in the palakotya, a small open cottage resting place in the centre of the farm, where more than six vegetables are available to cook Southern style rice and curry.
We head off in a buggy across the dunes to the glamping cooking site, which, for those who are not familiar, is glamorous camping under the stars, and nothing could be more fun with a bar restaurant built into sand dunes surrounded by bushes creating a natural canopy and seats created out of old tree trunks, surprisingly comfortable to sit on during lessons.
We start the course by cutting up all the ingredients and rubbing two sticks together to create fire and when we fail Nalin is not averse to throwing paraffin on it, giving you the most exciting campfire as it blazes in all directions. Once under control we cut up the fish and for those who really want to go back to the good old days Nalin will even show you how to make your own curry powder with a stone grinder, but only if you have managed not to spend the entire budget on fish.
To make Yala style fish curry we first heat up the terracotta pot with the coconut oil, and add curry leaves, red onions, garlic, green and red chilli, and pandam. We then marinate the fish with curry powder, chilli and crushed pepper. As the mix of spices turn a golden brown and fill the air with the real smell of spices, we toss the cut up cubes of fish into the pot adding coconut milk and a touch of tamarind.
Minutes later we have a great Southern fish dish served on a banana leaf and start to cook the other vegetable curry dishes to go with it and enjoy a much more spicy festive season than the more traditional roast joint and veg.
If you are a slow chopper you may find yourself eating the food under the stars and not for lunch.
This is no bad thing as you get a 360-degree clear view of the constellation on the dunes and being on the border of the park you may even see the elephants that come past daily at sunset to watch the staff playing football and you cook. Monkeys play in the trees as I prepared each dish, a monitor stopped for a minute to watch how I was doing and birds darted in and out of the simple dune open air kitchen. After my gourmet bush tucker meal I headed back to the Yala tented camp site for a nice siesta in an Aladdin style luxury tents and fell asleep listening to natures orchestra of birds.

Disgraced Aussie Smith barred from Bangladesh T20 league
DHAKA, Thursday : Bangladeshs Cricket Board said on Thursday it has barred former Australian captain Steve Smith from the forthcoming Bangladesh Premier League Twenty20 tournament following an objection raised by some franchises.
Smith, serving a one-year ban from international cricket and Australias domestic Sheffield Shield and Big Bash League, had signed for Comilla Victorians to play in the next edition of the BPL starting on January 5.
He was expected to join the team in mid-January for the second phase of the BPL as a replacement for Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik. The rule of the tournament is that if a franchise takes a replacement, his name should be in the list of initial players draft. But Smiths name was not there,  said Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Nizamuddin Chowdhury.
Some franchises raised objection about it. So we have to bar him from playing the BPL, he said. Australias ex-vice captain David Warner will however play in the BPL -- which concludes on February 8, 2019 -- having signed for the Sylhet Sixers as one of their two pre-draft signings.
Smith and Warner were handed a year-long international bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal that rocked Australian cricket in March.
The BPL was expected to be Smiths third T20 league outing -- after Canadas Global T20 and the Caribbean Premier League -- since the ban was imposed. He also recently signed for the Pakistan Super League, which will be played in February and March.
The BPL, which started in 2011, was hit by allegations of match-fixing in its early years. After a suspension, the tournament resumed in 2015 and has since been staged without serious controversy.  AFP

UNP, TNA MPs request Speaker :
Dont recognise M.R. as Opposition Leader till Committee decides
Several UNP and TNA MPs had submitted a letter to Speaker Kau Jayasuriya on Wednesday (19) requesting that the Speaker refrain from recognising Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition until a committee appointed decides on his eligibility to hold this post.
Speaking to the Daily News Minister of Labour, Trade Union Relations and Social Empowerment Daya Gamage said the letter signed by several UNP and TNA members had been handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Those who signed the letter were Daya Gamage, Ashu Marasinghe, Rohini Wijeratne, N.P. Colonne, N.S. Thaufeek, Ranjan Ramanayake, Jayampathy Wickramaratne, Palitha Range Bandara and TNA-MP M.A. Sumanthiran.
The letter states that Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected to Parliament in August 2015 from the UPFA to represent the Kurunegala District.
However Mahinda Rajapaksa and several others had obtained membership of the SLPP on or around November 11th 2018. It also notes that neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor any of the other members who obtained membership of the SLPP had denied it.
The very fact that Mahinda Rajapaksa and the several other Members of Parliament have joined the SLPP would amount to the cessation of their membership of the political party on whose nomination paper their names appeared at the time of their becoming members of parliament.
The MPs in their letter claim that the continued presence of Mahinda Rajapaksa and other members in the House is an infringement of Article 4 of the Constitution. Therefore, these MPs had requested that the Speaker appoint a Committee consisting of 11 members who would investigate the eligibility of Mahinda Rajapaksa and others who had obtained SLPP membership, to hold their positions as MPs and present a report within two months of the first sitting.
However, speaking to the Daily News, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said that he had also written to the Speaker confirming that Mahinda Rajapaksa and others are still members of the UPFA. However, he said nothing had been mentioned in the letter about them obtaining membership of the SLPP.

Free at last
The curtain finally came down on the 54 nightmarish days the nation was forced to go through, beginning October 26th, with the swearing-in of the new Cabinet of Ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday morning. A hitherto largely disoriented populace, no doubt, would have heaved a huge sigh of relief after the tension, uncertainty and chaos they were forced to endure when the country was caught up in a vortex of political turmoil for more than one and half months. They certainly would be breathing the fresh air of freedom.
The abrupt turnaround of the political climate and the easing of tensions, no doubt, would be most welcomed by all Christians who are on the threshold of ushering in Christmas in a few days time. Already there are palpable signs of this change everywhere where firecrackers greeted the swearing-in of the new Cabinet in the towns and villages along with the partaking of kiribath which has now become a common symbol of celebrations in this country.
More importantly, the installation of the new Cabinet would also now serve to dispel all doubts and ambiguities in the minds of public officials who were reluctant to commit themselves all these days fearing repercussions. They could now get back to their work in earnest with the establishment of a legal Government following yesterday's appointment of the Cabinet.
The new Government should not lose time resting on its laurels but get down to business right away. The crisis had taken a heavy toll on the economy (the loss to country had been estimated at Rs. 220 billion). Besides, a heavy blow has also been dealt to the image of the country after the high we had reached in the early days of the Yahapalanaya Government. The crisis has also left behind a badly fractured polity at a time the crying need is for unity to overcome the enormous challenges confronting the nation. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should now bury the hatchet and work in unison to pull back the country from the pits it had fallen into due to the ill advised move of the former. There are plenty of ways where differences could be overcome without treading on each other's corns. The future of the country is too important to let personal egos stand in the way of progress.
This is also a time for calm reflection to ascertain the causes that led to the precipitate action of the President and steps taken for non-recurrence of the events of October 26.There may have been lapses and differences on both sides and these should be ironed out by frank discussions. It is gratifying to note that President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe had met for discussions prior to the formation of the new Cabinet indicating a thaw in the hitherto hostile relationship between the duo. Such dialogues should continue, if for no other reason than maintaining stability. This would also inspire public officials to work in unison and harmony, doubling their efforts.
The public would also welcome the downsizing of the Cabinet to a considerable degree, although a 30 member Cabinet is still considered by most to be excessive, given that India, with a population of 1.2 billion, has only a 25 ministers in the Lok Sabha. No doubt political compulsions and configurations have forced upon this situation in the case of Sri Lanka which has cost the taxpayer plenty. In the immediate post-independence era the Cabinets consisted of only a handful of ministers who performed with aplomb, attested to by the fact that there were predictions that we would even leapfrog Singapore on the development front. There is therefore no reason that this lot cannot emulate their predecessors in office.
There is however a need for a corruption-free administration. True, the vast support received by Premier Wickremesinghe during the days of the crisis was chiefly for the restoration of democracy and constitutional Government. But it is also equally true that the public yearned for a course correction in Government reminiscent of the January 8 battle cry.
Premier Wickremesinghe should keep his minions in check and strive to ensure a clean administration. We say this because major elections are round the corner and this fund of goodwill demonstrated by the public towards Prime Minister during the crisis, if it is to be kept intact, should be demonstrated with results, both in terms of performance and clean governance.
On the performance front, he (Wickremesinghe) is now not encumbered by the UPFA/SLFP component of the Unity Government which always blocked the implementation of UNP policies in the mistaken belief that these policies are detrimental to the public good. He now has a free hand to implement his vision for the country with no one now to breathe down his neck. Of course the President who, no doubt, has his eye on the impending elections may try to play spoil sport. But Premier Wickremesinghe who is an old hand in the game will certainly know how to handle things. After all, did he not overcome the greatest challenge to his political career

The Minister soon after assuming duties yesterday said the special price formula for fuel prices on par with world market prices initiated during his tenure as finance minister earlier, will continue.
Minister Samaraweera said fuel prices have reduced in the world market and said the finance minister who replaced him after the political crisis two months back had taken advantage of it to reduce prices slightly.
He said the price formula was simplified with the aim of providing relief to the common masses and added it was a very fair method in comparison with the accepted international norms. Minister Samaraweera in reply to questions by journalists also said the Vote on Account for state expenditure in the first quarter would be submitted for parliamentary approval today.

Fun facts about Christmas food
Thinking of going solo to your Christmas dinner this year Think again. According to Czech lore, an uneven number of guests at the holiday table means the odd man out will die next year. And would you care to guess which British monarch had hogs and eels on the holiday menu And what's with those tangerines in the Christmas stockings Where did that come from With Christmas only a few days away, we bring you some fun and weird facts about Christmas foods that might have you rethinking your own holiday menu and traditions.
Santa snacked on Christmas trees
In Medieval Germany, it was custom to decorate paradise trees with apples, wafers and cookies. Once this tradition merged with Christianity, the tree became a symbol of Christmas. It didn't take long before children noticed Santa (or little mice) had snacked on the edible tree ornaments before taking off for his next stop. Soon it became tradition to leave a plate of cookies by the fireplace mantle to keep them warm for Santa and away from the mice.
How to kill your guests
Carp is a common Christmas dinner menu item in the Czech Republic. But guests who dine on traditional fish soup and carp should beware: lore says if there aren't an even number of guests at the Christmas table, the person without a partner will die after the New Year.
Candy canes make for a silent night
Thank a bunch of noisy kids for the invention of candy canes. A German choirmaster circa 1670 wanted to keep kids silent during the creche scene so he had candies made in the shape of a shepherd's crook. Today more than 1.75 million candy canes are sold around Christmas.
A different kind of Christmas grocery list
King John of England had quite the Christmas 1213 dinner menu: 3,000 capons, 1,000 salted eels, 400 hogs, 100 pounds of almonds, and 24 casks of wine.
Fruitcake goes the distance
Europeans baked fruitcake with nuts at the end of the nut season and saved them for one year to be eaten at the beginning of the next harvest for good luck. Apparently, eating fruitcake was prohibited other than on special occasions because it was "sinfully" rich and delicious.
Tangerines in your stocking
Everyone knows that bad children get a lump of coal in their stocking for Christmas, but in the UK good children traditionally get a tangerine. It's a old tradition that began in 12th-Century France when nuns gifted poor children tangerines in stockings.
It costs what to feed Santa andhis reindeer
Every year it costs $188,906,668.97 to feed Santa and his reindeer cookies, milk and carrots on Christmas night.

Hair Loss: Mange in Dogs
There are two types of mange. They are Sarcoptic and Demodex mange. Mange is the common term for a skin infection from microscopic mites, either the Scabies mite or the Demodex mite. These mites will burrow through the skin causing intense itching and irritation. This is a treatable medical condition, but is highly contagious for other animals and humans. The exposure generally occurs about two to six weeks before the first symptoms of mange are displayed.
Spread
The mite can be spread by direct contact with infected animals. Pet owners are advised to keep the dog quarantined while it is being treated for mange. As the mites quickly move from animal to animal, kennels, animal shelters, dog parks, groomers and veterinary clinics have a high exposure rate of mange due to the close proximity with animals that are infected.
Symptoms
Symptoms of mange can be listed as; intense scratching, skin rash, crust formation in the affected area, hair loss, redness of the skin, wounds & bacterial skin infection, presenting skin with discharge and severe scaling in the skin.
Diagnosis
It is a simple test which can be done at any veterinary clinic in Sri Lanka. The vet takes a sample of skin scraping and plucking hair to collect the mites from their residence within the hair follicles to see under the microscope to identify the parasite.
Treatment
Dogs will be treated with drug that kills the mite. In some cases, the animal will be dipped in a medicated shampoo to kill all of the mites living in its skin. Ongoing treatment is necessary to kill all of the mites as the eggs will take time to hatch, and most treatments do not kill the eggs, only the living mites. Treatment of this condition should be done under veterinary supervision and the dogs entire body must be treated. Depending on your dogs condition, it may need to be treated on a weekly basis for as long as six consecutive weeks. Oral medications can also be a part of the treatment.
Living and Management
Complete response to the therapy may take between four to six weeks. Also, because of how contagious this type of mange is to humans and other animals, it is recommended you limit contact with the dog. In extreme cases, quarantining the animal may be required. A healthy immune system can help prevent the recurrence of the problem, so its important to keep your dog as comfortable as possible throughout the treatment. This can include keeping your dog on a regular feeding schedule and giving it a comfortable place to sleep that is independent of furniture or bedding humans in the home may use but still allows them to feel like part of the family.
Human infection
Humans who do come into contact with a dog infected with mange may develop a purplish rash on their arms, chest or abdomen.
Prevention of mange in dogs
This is a skin disease. You must take actions to keep the skin of your pet dog in healthy condition. There are good shampoos in the market maintaining the healthy skin. Bathing a dog every day increase the dryness of the skin and reduce the natural protection. It is ideal to bath dogs once in three days time. Also daily combing the dogs coat at least for 10-20 minutes also increases the blood circulation to the skin. Vitamin A, vitamin D and Zink enhance the healthy skin and natural hair growth.
Oral medication with such vitamins and minerals is also good for the skin. Routine veterinary checkup at least biannually by a reputed vet should carry out the skin test and skin sore of your pet dog. Make sure to clean your dogs kennel, cushion that it sleeps, any carpet use by the dogs using basic sanitizer at least once a week in order to destroy the count of parasites & eggs of parasites. Any change of the skin coat, suspected itching should be under go veterinary checking immediately.

Minister pledges to resume funds for IDPs
Newly-appointed Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen pledged to resume funds for Internally-displaced Persons (IDP), which were slashed by the recently-dismissed administration.
As an MP representing the Northern Vanni District, I congratulate our Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghes appointment as the National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training, Skills development, and Youth Affairs Minister, Minister Bathiudeen said.
Particularly, his role as the Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development Minister shall no doubt uplift the lives of people in the Northern region, aside from raising its provincial Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Furthermore, as the Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons Minister, I look forward to reinstate funds earmarked to support protracted IDPs in the North, he said.
These IDPs were inconvenienced when because we were wrongfully slashed by the recent illegal government, the minister added. Having learnt of the slashing of funds for IDPs, Minister Bathiudeen staged a protest on November 30 and said, These long-term IDPs, most of them Muslims in Northern Province, are the group to suffer the longest due to the conflict. The governments support for their resettlement and welfare is vital as there is no one else to spend for them, Minister Bathiudeen said.
Before our former Cabinet was replaced by the illegal government on October 26, the former Cabinet had approved funds for the resettlement of these IDPs. Approval was given following a thorough process, and it was also cleared by the previous Policy-planning Ministry, he added.
Using these approved allocations, resettlement work already began in August. It is unfortunate that the disputed PM slashed Rs.250 million from these allocations. Despite leading an illegitimate government, he had also instructed to divert this Rs.250 million for other work, the minister said.

Students with Advanced Level qualifications or Students who have sat for the London A/Levels this year can apply and join the prestigious LLB Law Degree programme, which is a 2+1 Degree Transfer programme, starting from February 2019. Expressing his views of this new partnership, Dr. Jayantha Dharmadasa, Chairman of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies said, The demand for professionals with a thorough knowledge in legal practices is on the rise; both globally and locally.
I firmly believe this partnership will enable us to provide sound academic guidance to Sri Lankan students. University of Ulster curriculum is well designed to bring out the best in students and it is the perfect platform for local undergraduates to nurture their skills to shine in their legal careers.
Our commitment to provide and facilitate quality education at an affordable cost to Sri Lankan students is unwavering. Collaborating with one of the highly rated UK law schools to introduce an LLB Degree programme was another step taken forward in our journey to become Sri Lankas leading higher education provider, said Victor Ramanan, Deputy Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies.
Ulster University provides an inspiring, engaging and intellectually stimulating environment for students of law at the undergraduate, post-graduate and CPD level. Research emerging from the School of Law is both pioneering and world-leading, with results from the UK National Exercise (REF) assessing their research as fourth overall in the UK, eclipsing the results of larger and more established law schools.
Commenting about the quality of the degree programme, Dr. Dayanath Jayasooriya, Senior Academic Advisor NCHS Law School, said, We are much honoured to collaborate with the Ulster University, which has a prestigious history of producing excellent legal professionals for many years.

No issue working with President - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said they had no problem in working in co-operation with President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President had his own peoples mandate while the Government had a separate peoples mandate. Therefore, they had no problem in working together while honouring those two peoples mandates.
Minister Samaraweera said so responding to a question raised by a journalist when he assumed duties at his Ministry office yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera said the Vote on Account covering government expenditure for the first quarter of 2019 would be presented in Parliament on December 21.
He said their first task was to correct the damage caused to the economy during the past month since the October 26 Black Friday. They should allocate funds for public sector salaries, pension payments, school uniform distribution programme, Samurdhi assistance and the fertilizer subsidy.
The Vote on Account is presented for this purpose. He said the Ministry was also ready to present the 2019 Budget in Parliament. It would provide a host of relief measures for the public. It would be much different to the bogus relief measures announced by the illegal government.
Referring to the propaganda carried out by Mahinda Rajapaksa about providing tax relief to people engaged in agriculture, Minister Samaraweera said there were a minute 0.03 percent of farmers eligible to pay income tax.
He said fuel prices would be reviewed on December 21 according to the price formula, taking world oil prices into consideration.
He said the Cost of Living sky rocketed during the last one month since October 26 black Friday. The price of a dollar which was Rs.173 had reached Rs.180. Their intention is to restore normalcy.
Parliamentarian Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa who crossed over to the government was also present on this occasion. Asked why those who crossed over were not given ministry posts, Minister Samaraweera said there was a court decision preventing them from obtaining Ministry posts. They hoped to get the Interim Order revoked and provide ministry posts to those who crossed over as well as others due to crossover in future and take steps to strengthen the economy.

## Title: Rangana HERATH the left arm spinning sensation
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, December 21, 2018 - 01:00
Rangana HERATH the left arm spinning sensation
He is without doubt Gods gift to Cricket. Rangana HERATH from the time he took to bowling a ball at a tender age, served notice that one day he would hit the billboard as a legendary left arm spin bowler. Indeed he evolved into the greatest left arm spinner that the game of cricket has seen and will ever see.
HERATH MUDIYANSELAGE RANGANA KEERTHI BANDARA HERATH, was born on March 19, 1978 in Wadduwa, Kurunegala. He took to the game with great dedication and determination In his first school Mayurapada Central College, Naranmala and later switched to Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala.
Notice of his prowess
He served notice of his prowess with the ball by taking big wickets in domestic cricket and made the selectors take notice.
It did not take long when the selectors fronted him up against Australia in a Test in Galle in 1999.
He made his one day debut five years later against Zimbabwe at Harare.
HEARTH had to play second fiddle to Muralitheran who was the countrys leading spinner at that time and it was only after Muralitherans retirement, that he took his rightful place as the countrys leading spin bowler.
From that moment the left arm spinner did not look back.
He began to take the cricket world by storm. He rattled all opposing batsmen with excellent left arm spin bowling not seen since the time of that great England left arm spinner Derek Underwood.
Cunning left arm spin
HERATH had all the wiles of a cunning left arm tweaker, but it was surprising that none of his coaches insisted on him or taught him to master the chinaman. Had he mastered this delivery, he could have added many more scalps to his record bag.
Wickets in Test cricket came flooding to HERATH with every game. Experts in the game watching him perform predicted that he would end up as the best left arm spinner that the world has ever seen. He did not let the experts down.
Generally, captains do not have much faith in spinners when they get into limited over skirmishes. But Lasith Malinga deputizing for the injured Dinesh Chandimal plonked for HERATH in a Twenty20 game against Bangladesh in the 2014 ICC World Cup against New Zealand in Bangladesh and the magic he weaved is worth recalling.
Strong Kiwi batting
When Sri Lanka were shot out for 120, which score was not beyond the strong Kiwi batting line up, and with them going well in the chase, Malinga tossed the ball to HERATH. HERATH immediately got into the act and produced a magic spell that had the Kiwi batsmen frozen as it were.
HERATH bamboozled Martin Guptil, Brendon McCallum, Ross Taylor, James Neesham and Luke Ronchi to their destruction which saw the Kiwis collapse for an unbelievable 60 runs which was the lowest score to date in an overs reduced game.
HERATH had the amazing figures of 5 for 3 in the semifinal which won him the man of the match award and which finally led to Sri Lanka winning their first T20 World Cup.
Ignored by selectors
After making his Test debut and playing in two more Tests he was ignored by the selectors.
He was playing first class cricket and performing. He went missing for two years and then was slotted in the a side to South Africa and Kenya.
Once he got back into the thick of it which was Test cricket, which game cricket is all about, he hugged the scene and improving his bowling further adding variety to it. He baffled all opposing batsmen and that he went past 400 wickets and ended on 433. A terrific achievement.
Once he booked a permanent slot in the Test line up, he hugged that position and he had the dream of captaining the country  a dream of any cricketer playing the game.
That fortune knocked on his door when he was asked to captain the countrys Test side making him the oldest countrys captain.
Hat-trick to his credit
HERATH also has a hat trick to his credit. That was against Australia when he sent back Adam Voges, Peter Nevill and Mitchell Starc in the Second Test at Galle. He became the first Sri Lankan spinner to perform this feat. In performing the above he became the second left arm bowler ever to take a Test hat trick after Johnny Briggs in 1892. He also became the oldest cricketer to take a hat trick in Test cricket. HERATH made his debut in Galle and also called finis to his glittering career also at the Galle International Cricket Stadium against England. It wasnt to be a memorable end because Sri Lanka lost the Test by a big margin of 221 runs.
Picturesque venue
But HERATH had the consolation of pocketing 100 wickets at this picturesque venue when he took the wicket of England captain Joe the brute Root. He thus became the first left arm bowler to take 100- wickets at a single venue.

Remembering Clarence Wijewardena: Master Music Maker
The 22nd death anniversary of veteran singer, songwriter, music director, band leader par excellence Clarence Wijewardena fell on December 13 this year. The unexpected demise of the great musical legend left an vacuum that cannot be filled in the local entertainment arena. The following lines are all about this versatile and much loved musician of our times. Almost 22 whole years have passed away since the death of Clarence, who was considered as the father of Sinhala pops and pioneer of Sinhala beat group.
A prolific lyricist, successful composer, talented guitarist and much loved singer Clarence Wijewardena, an all-rounder in the local music scene for more than three decades, hailed from the salubrious climes of Haputale.
On mentioning the name of Clarence, one instantly gets the pleasant memories of group song era of the 60s and 70s. Clarence was the brain wave, live wire and leader of some of the well-known aggregations of those good old days. The Moonstones, The Golden Chimes, The Super Golden Chimes were those bands and they were household names during that golden era.
Maestro Clarence was reputed for his scintillating, toe-tapping, haunting melodies and music arrangements. His soothing, inimitable way of singing has robbed the hearts of many.
Songs such as Dileepa podi puthu, Kiri muhudha, Sudu menike, muhudu ralla, Sihin sinawai, Surangana ves vala, Pata pata ranthatu salala, Kimada nave, Mage pal pathe, Moratuwa, Sandak basa giya, Kandasurinduni, Seetha sulangak, Kaniyani, gamen liyumak, Sihina lowak, Kamak ne, Muwa hasarali sagare, Sandapane gaman yanna. Hiruge lowedi, Dinaka me nadi theere, Malata bambareku se, Ramya, Sanda ek dinak, Aluth lowak, Muthu menike, Andura ira, Ran dunuke malase, Seegiri roo landun, Aadareta kiyana katha, Saavun muwan se vane are some of his major hit songs among a repertoire of more than 500 songs recorded with The Moonstones, The Golden Chimes, The Super Golden Chimes and later on as a solo artiste.
He has created many major hits for various other artistes too. Usually he makes the melodies and arranges the music for his creations. Moreover, he himself has written the lyrics for a considerable number of his creations, which were sung by himself and various other vocalists.
Almost all the popular singers have sung under his music direction during the 70s 80s and 90s. Annesley Malewana, Indrani Perera, Anil Bharathi, Milton Mallawarachchi, Priya Sooriyasena, H. R. Jothipala, anjaline Gunathilake, A. E. Manoharan, Rani Joseph, M. S. Fernando, Vernon Perera, Felix Anton, Dalreen Arnolda, Mariazelle Gunathilake, Chandani Hettiarachchi, Nihal Nelson, Punsiri Soyza, Paul Fernando, Lilanthi Karunanayake, Desmond Rodrigo, Desmond de Silva, Pundit Amaradeva, Visharadha Sanath Nandasiri, Piryantha Fernando, Fernando, Feddie Silva, Rohana Siriwardena, Neela Wickramasinghe, Malani Bulathsinhala, Saman de Silva, Maxwell Mendis, Mervyn Mihindukula, are among a vast number of artistes who have rendered their voices to his matchless, scientillating music arrangements.
Clarence did the musical score for some Sinhala films, Sikuriliya, Apeksha, Chatu Madura, Chandi Shama, come under this category, Suseema, Nidikumba Mal are some popular teledramas where he did the needful music wise.
Furthermore Clarence is famous for his catchy jingles. He has done melodious jingles for many products. Even those are catchy like his songs. The jingles he did for Elasto, Bata, Astra Margarine, Bristol cigarettes. Arpico, Dot toffees, Atlas pens, Development lottery, Dasuna cartoon paper were some of them. What is more, the jingle he did for Dot toffee brought him an award too.
Incidentally, Clarence bagged three prestigious awards for the categories of best songs, best composer and best Sinhala pop group in an all island talent competition conducted by the Daily Mirror way back in 1975, If I am not mistaken the remix re-recordings of Sinhala songs became a reality during the heydays of maestro Clarence and his supremely talented Super Golden Chimes in the 70s.
A. M. U. Raj, Chitra and P. L. A. Somapala, Rukmani Devi, Priyantha Fernando, Desmond de Silva, Indrani Perera were some of the artistes who have recorded songs of yesteryear to the refreshing sounds of Clarence and his Super Golden Chimes. Clarence takes a prominent place for introducing electric guitars to the local music scene for the first time. He recorded songs on all the major recording labels namely Philips, Sooriya, Lotus, New Sound, Shans, Gemtone, Tharanga, Singlanka and Torana either with his band or as a solo artiste.
Clarence has written, composed and sang songs on diverse topics and catered to all age group of people. His songs were on love, parents, sons, daughters, sisters, cities, rivers, Christmas, butterflies, fishermen, patriotism, schooling days, upcountry dancer, village life, beauty queen pageant, teacher, Indias greatest poet Rabindranath Tagore, King Parakramabahu and so on. And the long list goes on and on. Those who relish his type of music know what he dished out during the past three decades. They are sort of evergreen types. One can further classify them as Any time anywhere favourites from children to age old grandparents, all of them would agree to this unanimously. His way of singing is something very special, elegantly harmonised. It is like pouring honey into your ears.
He has introduced many artistes to the local music scene over the years. Annesley Malewana, Indrani Perera, Anil Bharathi and Lilanthi Karunanayake are some of them. Many upcoming stars were inspired by his kind of scintillating music.
His sudden passing away 22 years ago has created a vacuum in the local music scene which is very hard to fill. May his fans, friends and relations find solace in his unforgettable, haunting and lovely creations he has left behind. May God grant him eternal peace.

Restoring a castle, remembering its owner
One-hundred-and-eighteen years ago, a rich and ambitious young man decided to build himself a castle on the banks of the Kalu Ganga. It was an ambitious project and would take him 10 years to complete, but driven by the desire to own a palace fit for a Maharajah, Padikara Mudali Nanayakkara Rajavasala Appuhamige Don Arthur Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena did build himself a castle. This grand project which was one of a kind for the island nation was named Richmond Castle and was supposed to ensure that its owners name would be etched in history forever, but today few know of him and his castle is nothing more than a ruin that not even the neighbours know of.
What happened to Don Arthur Silva and his castle The Public Trustee which now owns the castle and the Catholic Church which Silva closely associated with are now on a mission to bring back his lost glory.
On Wednesday (19), a commemorative event was held at the Public Trustee Department auditorium in Colombo with the participation of the Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith and a representative of the Silva family  his niece, Surangani Basnayake  to commemorate the memory of Don Arthur Silva.
A will ignored
When I was the Kalutara Parish priest between 1983 85, I visited Richmond Castle. It was like a palace, artistically constructed, according to various styles. There were many paintings depicting the incidents of his (Don Arthurs) life, several antiques, and gold forks and spoons; so I thought to myself, this man has really lived a successful life, said the Cardinal, addressing the gathering.
I saw it and thought to myself, this is a very valuable house, this is part of our history. A fellow Sri Lankan built this and we hear he lived a good life and helped those in the area, and was also a good Catholic who had even met the Pope. So we need to protect this building which is crumbling, for the future. We should also have programmes to commemorate his life. When I looked into it, I saw that he had left a will which established a trust with the Public Trustee with other trustees, including two members of the Catholic Archdiocese, to look after it. So I was happy I could do something about it, but I was soon disappointed.
The Cardinal was soon informed by the Church that it had been neglected for too long and the will of Don Arthur Silva long forgotten. They had adopted a lets wash our hands off this attitude. But as the Archbishop now, I can do something. So I approached the Public Trustee to ask that we work together to fulfil the mandate of this mans last will.
The last will had also instructed that a boys home be established to help orphaned children, but in the decades since, the boys home was shoddily set up and only houses eight young boys today.
We need to further improve and expand the boys home. More importantly, we need to open its door to boys of all races, said the Cardinal.
The Cardinal has also suggested that the Church work together with the Public Trustee to refurbish the castle and turn it into a tourist attraction in the area which will help them earn more revenue. Further, they have also planned to turn some sections into a museum.
Even schoolchildren in Kalutara do not know about the castle.
The understanding reached between the Catholic Church and the Public Trustee was no easy one. In October 2014, the Cardinal filed a case against the Public Trustee in the Colombo High Court for failing to fulfil the mandate of Don Arthur Silvas will.
This was done rightfully as we had over the years failed to fulfil the mandate of the will as its executors. The case went on for four years with 23 hearings being held. The sad part was that we were using Don Arthur Silvas own money to fight this case. So I met the Cardinal on November 10, 2017, and we were able to come to a settlement, explained Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne.
So what does the will state
Arthurs story
Don Arthur Silva was born on November 12, 1889, to Paulis De Silva Siriwardena who was a wealthy businessman hailing from Baddegama in the South. Siriwardena senior owned vast estates of coconut, tea and rubber, which helped him curry favour with the British administration at the time, and Don Arthur, as was the fashion at the time, was sent to England to study. Here, he met the son of Maharajah Okraman of Calcutta. As chance would have it, Don Arthur happened to visit his friend in Calcutta and having fallen in love with his castle, he had asked the Maharajah for the name of the architect who built the castle.
The Maharajah had snubbed him and said that this was not for him and that he would not be able to build such a castle himself. But Don Arthur, perhaps around 20 years old at the time, decided that he would go ahead and build it anyway, said Weeratne.
Richmond Castle, eventually built on 42 acres of land, had 99 doors, 16 rooms and 38 windows and was designed in the style of Roman Dutch and Greek architecture. They also designed the castle to have cool air from the Kalu Ganga flow across the dance floor of the grand dining hall to keep it cool, a unique feature at that time.
Having built his mansion, he married Clarice Matilda Mode Suriyabandara in a wedding befitting royalty with many senior British officials in attendance.
The story goes that he lived in his castle for 32 years, but the couple could not bear any children. Disappointed in their marriage, eventually they separated  his wife left to a convent in Thimbirigasyaya, Colombo, and Don Arthur spent the final years of his life in a room in Queens Hotel, Kandy, where he died on July 8, 1947.
However, influenced by his contemporary, the late D.B. Jayatilaka, he penned his last will on July 4, 1941, and left all his wealth to be managed by the Public Trustee of Sri Lanka.
The will
The Public Trustee revealed that Don Arthur Silva left them the castle and his 91-acre coconut estate known as Ira Handa Yawa which is an award-winning model coconut estate. The will also states that a trust be formed under De Silva Wijesinghes name to establish a home for orphaned boys between the ages of 6 and 16.
In addition, the Public Trustee was to give a monthly stipend to his wife and an annual donation of Rs. 1,000 (according to the time) to his old school, St. Josephs College, Colombo. The Trust was to be run by a board which was to have seven members: a chairman recommended by the Education Ministry, Rector of St. Josephs College (if willing), the Kalutara District Secretariat, the parish priest of the Roman Catholic Church in Kalutara, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya), a member of the family and the Public Trustee.
He had mentioned that the boys home be run in the model of St Bernados Homes in the UK, said Weeratne.
However, it did not pan out as he would have wished. At present, the boys home is in a derelict state with only eight boys living there, but no Trust has been established. Further, neither his wife nor his old school got any money. According to the records of the Public Trustee, Rs. 9 million had been allocated eight years ago to refurbish the castle, but it remains the same. I am not sure where the money went, remarked Weeratne.
In the past, even a montessori was run out of this castle, quite against the wishes of the Gate Mudaliyar.
Fulfilling the mandate
Richmond Castle is the most iconic property in the repertoire of the Public Trustee at present and thus Weeratne is determined to set things right.
We cannot say we have no money as we were left only assets, not liabilities. This is simply a case of us failing so badly in our administration that the Archbishop had to go to courts.
The Public Trustee hopes in future to work with the Moratuwa Universitys Architecture Department to refurbish the castle. If we do not do anything now, the castle will collapse in another 10 years.
He also hoped to hand over the running of the boys home to the Catholic Church, whilst the Public Trustee would continue to fund it through a new trust.
Seelawathi* who participated in the commemoration on Wednesday has been working for the Ira Handa Yawa estate for the last 50 years, We used to have many people working there, but now we just have four managing 92 acres, she said. A daily wage of Rs. 650 was no longer enough to attract workers to the estate, she added, but those who stayed did so because they had few other opportunities in the area.
When asked if she had ever heard of the former owner of the estate and his legacy, she said, I have never heard of him. I just got to know who he was at the commemoration.
The worst misfortune in life is not death, but to be forgotten, and despite all Don Arthur Silvas efforts, such was the fate that befell him. By keeping to the final wishes of his will however, Weeratne hopes to, in some way, keep the memory of Don Arthur Silva alive through the 99 doors of Richmond Castle.

Russian Federation donates $3 mn to boost food security, nutrition in Syria
The Russian Federation has donated $3 million to help FAO provide conflict-affected farmers and herders in Syria with critical livelihood and nutrition support.
This is the first FAO emergency project funded by Russia. The donation will enable FAO to support 60,000 vulnerable households (or 360 000 farmers and herders) in the area of Aleppo, who were severely impacted by the crisis, to restore their production capacity and improve their food security and nutrition.
The funding agreement was signed today at FAO headquarters in Rome by Daniel Gustafson, FAO Deputy Director-General for Programmes, and Victor Vasiliev, Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation.
Large numbers of farmers have abandoned their lands in Syria because of insecurity, which has taken a devastating toll on their agricultural production and destroyed infrastructure and services.
The costly and reduced availability of agricultural inputs greatly constrains local farmers, said Gustafson. Thus, our priority is to boost the local economy and contribute to reducing local poverty and improving nutrition of those most in need.
The project should provide the initial conditions for the socio-economic development of the country, said Vasiliev. We expect that the project will bring concrete and tangible results for the benefits of the most vulnerable populations in terms of restoring agriculture destroyed by the war.
We count on a more active role of other donors and international organizations to assist the people of Syria on their road to peace, he added.
The two-year project will primarily focus on reviving the local economy, reducing poverty and improving nutrition for targeted groups.
This will be achieved by assisting the most vulnerable households in boosting their vegetable crop, fruit and forest production and restoring irrigation infrastructure.
It also entails providing access to veterinary services to prevent the outbreak and spread of contagious animal diseases and to improve livestock health, production and productivity.
Enhancing livestock production is one of the key elements of the project since the livestock sector has suffered substantially since 2011 with reductions in terms of herd and flock numbers of over 30 percent for cattle and over 40 percent for sheep and goats, while poultry - the main and most affordable source of protein of animal origin - has shrunk by 60 percent.

Second test likely to be more bowler friendly - Williamson
WELLINGTON, Thursday: More bowler-friendly conditions will likely greet New Zealand and Sri Lanka at Hagley Oval in Christchurch for the second test, home captain has Kane Williamson said.
The first test ended in a damp draw on Wednesday after rain restricted all but an hour of play on the fifth and final day, with Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews unbeaten at the end having saved their side by batting the entire fourth day.
The hosts had the best of the bowling conditions on the first day when they reduced the visitors to nine for three, before Mathews, Dimuth Karunaratne and Niroshan Dickwella rescued their first innings.
The pitch then dried out, flattened without breaking up and provided little sideways movement as New Zealand scored 578 before the visitors ended their second innings on 287 for three with Mendis on 142 and Mathews 120 not out.
I think well expect a bit more bounce and pace in Christchurch, Williamson said as he looked ahead to the second game starting on Dec. 26.
We know that the wicket there offers to seam bowlers and generally hold its pace for a long period of time.
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, while pleased with the result on Wednesday, said his sides top order would need to get used to the green pitches in New Zealand quickly, especially if the conditions were to be tougher in Christchurch.
The New Zealand bowlers took three early wickets in both innings in Wellington, with Sri Lanka opener Danushka Gunathilaka scoring one and three, while Dananjaya de Silva contributed one and then made a five-ball duck.
Dimuth Karunaratne scored 79 in the first innings, but fell for 10 in the second, while Mendis scored just two in the first innings.
We have to make a good start, Chandimal said. When we were batting we lost three early wickets in both innings.
So thats an area well have to improve.
Chandimal said it was too early to determine if they might shake up the top order in Christchurch but he expected the rest of the team to get a lift from the performance of Mendis and Mathews in Wellington.
We are really happy as a team, he said.
Weve especially shown a lot of character. They fought hard.
Weve got a lot of youngsters in our side, so Im sure they will learn and execute their plans going forward.

SLFP crossovers to receive portfolios in second round
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party MPs who joined the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would be appointed to Cabinet portfolios by President Maithripala Sirisena in the second round, newly appointed Minister of Health Rajitha Senaratne said.
He stated this speaking to media at the Galle Face Hotel premises last afternoon soon after taking oaths as a minister.
When asked about President Sirisenas recent statement, that he would not grant Cabinet portfolios to SLFP MPs joining the UNP government, the minister said more appointments are likely to be made next Saturday.
The President acted in a very flexible manner in making these appointments, the minister said.
We should immediately present a Vote on Account in Parliament. Otherwise, we will not have enough money at least to pay the salaries, he added. The Health Minister said the President would keep the Ministry of Law and Order under his purview only for a few weeks until some of the investigations going on are finished and work relating to two more Bills on illicit drugs and liquor are finished. After that, he would hand it over, minister said.
The minister said the number of Cabinet portfolios given under the new government would exceed the limit of 30, as it is to go forward in the nature of a unity government.
Parliamentarians, such as Wasantha Senanayake, who joined the recent short-term government led by former President Rajapaksa would be given the ministerial portfolios after eliminating the prevailing legal problems, he said.
Speaking on the issue relating to the Opposition Leadership of the House, Minister Senaratne also said the Parliament would look into the legality of the appointment of the Opposition Leader on Friday.

SLIIT funds research grant to Develop Autism Assessment Tool
SLIIT, the nations largest degree awarding institute also recognised for excellence in research has funded a research grant to develop a groundbreaking Autism Assessment Tool.
While an Autism diagnosis covers a spectrum of children with a wide range of skills and impairments, the diversity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) make it difficult to correctly diagnose and treat children.
Additionally, Sri Lanka is also faced with the lack of autism screening tools among psychiatristsand pediatricians that could assist the identification process. An initial study conducted has also ascertained that in a tertiary children hospital, 34% of the doctors were unaware of the main symptoms as speech delay and a further 39% failed to recognize co-occurring diseases associated with ASD. Understanding the dire need of devising an appropriate, culturally sensitive and standardized diagnostic tools that would assess a child in the Sri Lankan context, Dr. Pradeepa Samarasinghe, from the Department of Information Technology, SLIIT working in collaboration with Dr. Sudarshi Seneviratne, Medical Faculty, University of Colombo and Dr. Pratheepan Yogarajah, Ulster University, UK through a grant funded by SLIIT, the team is in the process of developing a Culturally Sensitive Autism Assessment Tool (CSAAT).
The research findings to-date were discussed by Dr. Samarasinghe during a Workshop on Early Diagnosis and Intervention of Autism held at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital recently.
Additionally, according to the research, the assessment of ASD is achieved through a predictive model based on the Pictorial Autism Assessment Schedule (PAAS) overcoming the limitation of an arbitrary cut-off in PAAS thus achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.
Advancing their study further, the team has developed a mechanism to analyze the speech patterns of autistic children.
Through ongoing research they hope to identify the types and levels of speech deficiencies within the ASD community thus ensuring efficient and effective early diagnosis of ASD in the near future.

Surprising benefits of playing sports
The health benefits of playing sports include proper weight management, efficient functioning of the heart, controlled diabetes, lower cholesterol levels, improved blood circulation, and lower hypertension and stress levels. It helps in the toning of muscles and strengthening of bones. It also brings positive energy, discipline, and helps in building self-esteem and mutual respect.
Playing sports is a favorite activity for many people around the world. It provides us with enjoyment and also freshens up our mind. However, playing sports is actually more than running, jumping, or kicking a ball on the field. Indulging in sports helps our body function smoothly and more efficiently. Sports involve the activity of each and every muscle in our body. This strengthens the body and promotes good health.
Health Benefits of Playing Sports
Playing sports is not only for fun but has many health benefits like weight management, strong muscles, and much more. Lets have a look at the benefits in detail.
Healthy Heart
The studies in the American Journal of Epidemiology suggest that physical activity actually helps lower the risk of heart attacks. Playing sports helps with stretching ability. The heart benefits the most from playing sports and there are fewer chances of malfunctioning of your heart. Playing sports helps the heart in pumping more blood as it is a type of workout for the body.
Diabetes Control
Research performed by the Human Movement Sciences Department, Old Dominion University, Virginia, USA, has concluded that playing sports helps in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Also, sports help diabetics make most of the insulin present in their body. Also, physical activity helps in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. It can also help in weight management since it burns excess calories.
Weight Management
Obesity is a big issue faced by millions of people across the world.
Over 55% of the adults in the US are obese, which is indirectly paving a way for chronic conditions like cancer and heart diseases.
The American College of Sports Medicine says that this issue can be dealt with indulging in sports or similar physical activities.
Lower Hypertension
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, may result in a stroke or heart disease. The National Health Service, UK suggests that aside from diet management, sports and physical activities are important to keep the blood pressure normal.
Balanced Cholesterol Levels
Playing sports also helps in maintaining lower cholesterol levels.
Some experiments showed that compared to athletes, LDL or bad cholesterol levels in sedentary people were much higher, while HDL or good cholesterol levels were significantly higher in athletes.
Improved Blood Circulation
Blood circulation gets better when you start playing sports. The body remains well oxygenated and thus, it remains more healthy and active. Apart from blood circulation, being physically active can also increase the hemoglobin count and the volume of blood.
Stronger Immunity
Regularly indulging in exercise and sports makes the body immune to many diseases that usually affect a person due to weak immunity. When a person exercises, the rate at which white blood cells reach every body part increases significantly.
Playing sports increases sweat production and also removes toxins. Due to the rise in body temperature, the chances of bacterial growth also lessen.
Muscle Toning
Sports are actually the best form of work out for muscles. Toned muscles are always desirable and thats what you get when you play sports.
The endurance of muscles also increases with time and this helps you in gaining a stronger body. Both inner and outer muscles get toned up when one plays any sport. For example, running involves working out both the inner and outer thigh muscles.
Stronger Bones
Playing sports is beneficial in strengthening not only the muscles but also the bones in your body.
Bones get their strength from bone density and aging decreases bone density, which can result in osteoporosis.
Taking up sports is perhaps one of the easiest ways to maintain bone density and strength for people of all ages.
Positive Attitude
Sports can bring a positive attitude to your life if played in a healthy manner. It refreshes the mind and helps in developing a positive and fresh outlook towards life.
Boosted Self-esteem
Playing any particular sport helps in building self-esteem. When one improves in any particular sport or skill, one feels good about it.
Discipline
Discipline becomes a natural part of life when you start spending time playing sports. This is because sports inspire people to live life by certain rules and regulations and move towards a positive end.
Children who indulge in sports feel healthier, and develop better and healthier relationships with other people because a positive, team-based outlook is instilled in them.
Mutual Respect
Playing sports builds mutual respect for others as it includes playing opposite people but at the same time respecting them even if they have a negative attitude towards you.
Calmness
Sports train your mind to think calmly and find new strategies to deal with problems without getting too hyper.
Teamwork
Playing sports helps you build good relationships with people from diverse backgrounds and traits. It encourages teamwork and thus helps in preparing you to work with different people in a harmonious manner.
Goal Setting
Goal setting means that every person needs to have an idea about what he/she wants, whether it is in a game or in life. Sports may help in goal-setting and will improve performance levels in other areas of life.

UNP to seek AGs advice to increase Cabinet- Navin
The United National Party plans to seek the Attorney Generals advice to increase the number of Cabinet ministers by coming into an agreement with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He was speaking to the media after assuming duties as the Plantation Industries Minister at Sethsiripaya yesterday.
The UNP signed an agreement with the UPFA to form a national government and the resolution of the national government has not been cancelled yet. It is still operative. Though the UPFA left the national government, MP Rauff Hakeems SLMC which signed the resolution is still with us. So we believe that we would be able to come into a fresh agreement with the SLMC, the Minister said.
We are hoping that Parliamentarians Sarath Fonseka, Palitha Range Bandara, Piyasena Gamage, Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, Indika Bandaranayake and Lakshman Seneviratne will receive Ministerial portfolios and we are struggling for that, he said.
Democratic political victories cannot be achieved within 24 hours or seven days. We have to struggle for that for a long time. The unity between the UNP MPs resulted in the political victory achieved by the party and Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the newly appointed Cabinet ministers as to how they should carry out their ministerial responsibilities, the Minister said.
Minister Dissanayake also stressed the importance of bringing internal reforms in the UNP.
As the Plantation Minister, the first challenge that I have to face is the salary issue of plantation workers and I hope to find an immediate solution after discussing with MP Thondaman, Minister Digambaram, the Estate Workers Union and Estate Owners Association, the Minister said.
The second challenge we have to face is the price of tea and the sanctions imposed on Iran by the US which has resulted in the reduction in the price, since there is a huge demand for Ceylon tea in Iran, he said.
The Minister paid his gratitude to MP S.M. Chandrasena for holding the Ministerial portfolio without taking any political revenge.

Upholding Democracy
The Supreme Court seven-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera on December 13 unanimously ruled that the gazette notification issued by President to dissolve the Parliament prematurely was inconsistent with the Constitution.
Chief Justice Nalin Perera delivered the judgement and held that the Proclamation to dissolve Parliament has been issued outside legal limits and has resulted in a violation of Petitioners fundamental rights. Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Murdu Fernando agreed with the judgement penned by Chief Justice ordering to quash and render null and void the concerned proclamation published in the Gazette notification dated November 9.

This is an excerpt from judgment delivered by Chief Justice Nalin Perera in respect of the Fundamental Rights petition filed by TNA leader R. Sampanthan.
On 09th November 2018, the President issued a Proclamation which was published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018. The proclamation contains four main components as follow.
(a) Dissolve Parliament from midnight November 9 and summon the new Parliament to meet on the 17th of January, 2018;
(b) Fix, 5th of January, 2018 as the date for Election of the Members of Parliament;
(c) Specify the period beginning on the 19th of November, 2018 ending at Twelve Noon on the 26th of November, 2018 as the nomination period, during which nomination papers shall be received by the Returning Officers; and
(d) Specify each place mentioned in Column II of the Schedule hereto as the place of nomination for candidates seeking election in the electoral district mentioned in the corresponding entry in Column I of that Schedule.
On 12th November 2018, these Petitions were filed praying for a Declaration that the aforesaid Proclamation infringes the Petitioners fundamental rights contained in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution; an Order quashing the aforesaid Proclamation, an Order declaring the Proclamation null, void ab initio and of no force or effect in Law, an Order quashing the decisions or directions contained in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Proclamation and other related reliefs including interim reliefs suspending the operation of the Proclamation.
The Petitioners contend that the dissolution of Parliament sought to be effected by the Proclamation is ex facie unlawful and in violation of the Constitution and nothing flows from the same because; The President is expressly prohibited by the Constitution from dissolving Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting and the date appointed for the first meeting of the Eighth Parliament of Sri Lanka was 1st September 2015. as established by the Gazette Notification dated 26th August 2015.
In this regard, it should be mentioned here that the Petitioner is basing this contention upon Article 70 (1) of the Constitution which states
The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament:
Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.
Thus, the period of four and half years specified in the proviso to Article 70 (1) had not passed when the Proclamation marked was issued;
(ii) The only exception provided by the Constitution to the above prohibition is where Parliament requests the President to dissolve Parliament by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present) voting in its favour. and no such resolution has been passed by Parliament requesting the President to dissolve Parliament..
In this regard, it is undisputed among the parties to this application that, up to this date, there has been no resolution passed by a two third majority of Parliament requesting His Excellency, the President to dissolve Parliament. The Court can also take judicial notice of the fact that, up to this date, no such resolution has been passed;
(iii) Thus and otherwise, the Petitioner states that the purported dissolution of Parliament dated 9th November 2018 was inter alia:
a. In violation of the express prohibition contained in the Constitution contained in the proviso to Article 70 (1);
b. An unconstitutional attack on Parliament;
c. Ultra vires the powers of the President;
d. Unlawful;
e. An assault on the legislative power of the People;
f. A violation of the sovereignty of the People;
g. A violation of the rights of the Petitioner and each and every Member of Parliament;
h. Arbitrary, irrational, capricious, vexatious and unreasonable;
i. Action that offends and is in breach of the principles of reasonableness and legitimate expectation and is motivated by improper objectives; and
j. Null and void and of no force or effect in law.;
Thereafter and with regard to the Petitioners right to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this court, the Petitioner pleads that the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President constitute executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution and were done by His Excellency, the President in his official capacity. The Petitioner goes on to plead that the said impugned actions of purporting to dissolve Parliament amounts to an infringement of the rights of the Petitioner recognized under and in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In this connection, the Petitioner states that the Petitioner and every member of Parliament were entitled by law to complete their respective terms in Parliament according to law and have been unlawfully denied that opportunity by the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President and further, that the said denial violates the rights of all their electors who are citizens of the Republic and are entitled to representation in Parliament according to the law.
The Petitioner in SC FR 361/2018 pleads that the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President referred to above violate the Petitioners rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution in addition to violating his rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. As stated later on, this Court has only granted leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Therefore, the alleged violation of rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 14 (1) (a), 14 (1) (b) and 14 (1) (c) need not be considered.
The gravity and urgency of the matters in issue in these applications made it incumbent on the Court to hear the parties before Court without delay and decide the limited question of whether the Petitioners should be granted leave to proceed in the first instance and, if so, whether the issue of any interim reliefs were essential also in the first instance. Therefore, the Court ordered that these applications be supported on 12th November 2018. Accordingly, these applications were supported on 12th November 2018 before the Bench which had been listed to hear cases in Court 502 on that day in the usual course of listing of cases done the previous week.
On 12th and 13th November 2018, the Court heard submissions made by Mr. Kanag-Isvaran, PC representing the Petitioner in this application [SC FR 351/2018], Mr. Tilak Marapana, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 352/2018, Mr. Viran Corea representing the Petitioners in SC FR 353/2018, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC representing the Petitioner in SC FR 354/2018, Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC representing the Petitioner in SC FR 355/2018, Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, PC representing the petitioners in SC FR 356/2018, Mr. G.J.T. Alagaratnam, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 358/2018, Mr. Suren Fernando representing the Petitioners in SC FR 359/2018, Mr. Ikram Mohamed, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 359/2018 and Mr. Hejaz Hisbullah representing the Petitioner in SC FR 361/2018. Thereafter, the Court heard submissions made by Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, Attorney-General and by Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC, Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC, Mr. Ali Sabry, PC, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC and Mr. Canishka Vitharana representing the aforesaid five Intervenient-Petitioners.
Having considered these submissions, the Court made Order on 13th November 2018 allowing the applications for intervention made by the aforesaid five intervenient-Petitioners. Thus, they are now the 1st to 5th Added Respondents named in the Caption.
On 13th November 2018, having considered the submissions made on behalf of all the parties before us, the Court made Order granting the Petitioners in all nine applications leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In the circumstances of these cases, the Court also considered it necessary to issue Interim Orders in all nine applications staying the operation of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018 (with the petition in the present application no. SC FR 351/2018) until 07th December 2018.
Further, the Court issued Interim Orders in SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 355/2018, SC FR 356/2018, SC FR 358/2018 and SC FR 361/2018 restraining the Chairman and members of the Elections Commission or their servants, subordinates and agents from acting in terms of the said Gazette Extraordinary No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018, until 07th December 2018.
In view of the need to hear and determine these applications without delay, the Court directed the added Respondents to file their statements of objections on or before 19th November 2018, the Petitioners to file their counter affidavits, if any, on or before 26th November 2018 and all parties to file their Written Submissions on or before 30th November 2018. The hearing of all these applications was fixed for 04th, 05th and 06th December 2018.
In terms of the aforesaid Order, the Hon. Attorney General and the five added Respondents have filed their statements of objections [by way of affidavits], the Petitioners have filed their counter affidavits and all these parties have filed their written submissions before 30th November 2018.
A bench comprising the aforesaid seven Judges was nominated to hear and determine these nine applications.
Firstly, the 1st added Respondent has pleaded, by way of preliminary objections that:
(i) the Petitioner has misrepresented material facts; (ii) the Petitioners application is misconceived in Law; and (iii) -His Excellency, the President has acted lawfully and within the powers conferred upon him in terms of Article 33 (2), Article 62 (2) and Article 70 (3) Proviso (ii) of the Constitution and, therefore, there has been no infringement of any Fundamental Right of the Petitioner, hence the Application of the Petitioner should be dismissed in limine.
The 1st added Respondent has also pleaded, by way of a further preliminary objection that what is before Court is not a Supreme Court special determination in order to determine upon constitutionality, but is a fundamental rights application and, accordingly, the jurisdiction vested in this Court when dealing with these applications is to make just and equitable orders that have to be viewed in the corrected perspective in law.. However, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents have not taken up this position in their affidavits.
These preliminary objections averred by the 1st added Respondent address the merits of the dispute before Court and, therefore, will be considered when the Court is examining the merits of the cases of the Petitioners, the Respondents and the added Respondents.
The 1st added Respondent recounts events which have occurred since the conducting of the long delayed Local Government elections in February 2018, the critical challenges faced by the economy and the events which have occurred on and after 26th October 2018 including the events which occurred in Parliament on and after 14th November 2018.
Having done so, the 1st added Respondent pleaded that, in these compelling, unprecedented and critical circumstances, H.E. the President of the Republic, in the due exercise of the powers conferred on him by the Constitution, dissolved Parliament as a prelude to resorting to taking the matter before the People at a General Election..
While acknowledging in paragraph [10] of his affidavit that a General Election cannot be called and held except in terms of the Law, the 1st added Respondent states that in this instance the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of elections is lawful.
In paragraph [16] of his affidavit, the 1st added Respondent avers that the Petitioners application Is incompatible with the larger right of the people to exercise their franchise even prior to the expiration of the formal term of Parliament..
In paragraph [18] of his affidavit, the 1st added Respondent has also stated that, under and in terms of Articles 33 (2) (c), 62 (2) and the Proviso to Article 70 (3), the President has the power to dissolve Parliament while Parliament stands prorogued.
Finally, in paragraph [20] if his petition the 1st added Respondent has averred that the fundamental checks and balances between the Legislature and the Executive, including inter alia the power of the Legislature to impeach the President and the power of the President to dissolve Parliament cannot be eroded into without adversely impacting the inalienable Sovereignty and Franchise of the People and consequently, the preservation by Article 33 (2) (c) of the power of the President to dissolve Parliament subject to Article 35 and as a prelude to a General Election enabling the People who are supreme and the repository of inalienable Sovereignty to exercise their right of Franchise should be upheld by Your Lordships "Court..
The 5th added Respondent has contended in paragraphs [17], [20] and [21] of his affidavit that: (i) the President is under a constitutional duty to uphold sovereignty of the People by ensuring that the Government and the State function without any difficulties or failure and that In the circumstances the President shall have power to exercise executive powers entrusted in him by the people to dissolve the Parliament on permissible provisions in the constitution in order to preserve the State and the Government.; (ii) fundamental rights are subject to the limitations specified in Article 15 (7) of the Constitution and wherefore the decision of the President taken in terms of the Constitution in the interest of national security, public order cannot be challenged by the petitioner."
The 2nd added Respondent raises the following Preliminary Objections: (i) Members of Parliament are necessary parties to the Petitioners application and the failure to add all Members of Parliament is fatal to the maintainability of the application; (ii) the Petitioners application is misconceived in law inasmuch as the Petitioner has not established a violation of a fundamental right, and (iii) in any event, the Proclamation marked - P1 is not subject to judicial review and, further, the basis on which His Excellency the president formed an opinion to dissolve parliament is a political decision which your Lordships court has no jurisdiction to inquire into; and (iii) the alleged violation has a specific remedy provided by the Constitution because where the Presidents act is unconstitutional, a specific remedy is provided in Article 38 (2) (a) (i) and therefore, the Petitioner ought to have if at all resorted to that remedy. In any event it is my position that the presidents act is constitutional and has not violated the law in any manner.
Mr. Udaya Ranjith Seneviratne has filed an affidavit dated 19th November 2018 in the present case  i.e: SC FR 351/2018. He has done so in his capacity as the Secretary to His Excellency, the President since he is not named as a Respondent in his personal capacity.
He states, by way of preliminary objections that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Petitioners application, that the Petitioners application is misconceived in law, that the Petitioner has failed to cite all necessary and affected parties and that the Petitioners application is not in conformity with the Supreme Court Rules, 1990.
In paragraph [12] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states I admit that the first proviso to Article 35 (1) of the Constitution recognizes the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President in his official capacity..
In paragraph [16] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states I state that Parliament may be summoned, prorogued and dissolved inter alia in terms of Article 33 (2) (c), Article 70 (1), Article 70 (2), Article 70 (5), Article 70 (6), Article 70 (7), proviso to Article 70 (1) and proviso (ii) to Article 70 (3) of the Constitution..
In paragraphs [18], [22] and [27] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states that His Excellency the President has acted at all times in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and His Excellency the President has always acted according to the law and in terms of the Constitution.
The Petitioners applications were all taken up for hearing on 4th December 2018 - application nos. SC FR 351/2018, SC FR 352/2018, SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 354/2018, SC FR 355/2018, SC FR 356/2018, SC FR 358/2018, SC FR 359/2018, SC FR 360/2018, and SC FR 361/2018 since the questions in issue in all these applications were much the same. Accordingly, we heard submissions made on behalf of Petitioners in these ten applications by Mr. Kanag-Iswaran, PC, Mr. Tilak Marapana, PC, Mr. Viran Corea, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC, Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC, Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, PC, Mr. Suren Fernando, Mr. G.J.T. Alagaratnam, PC, Mr. Ikram Mohamed, PC, and Mr. Hejaz Hizbullah, respectively.
Thereafter, submissions were made by Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, the Hon. Attorney General appeared in his official capacity. Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC, Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC, Mr. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC, and Mr. Canishka Vitharana who appeared respectively for the 1st to 5th added Respondents.

US Secretary of Defense announces resignation
US Secretary of Defense James Mattis announced that he will step down from the Pentagon, citing differences of opinion with President Donald Trump, with Syria policy reportedly being the final straw.Mattis, who submitted his resignation letter on yesterday, is expected to step down from his post in February.His departure had been anticipated since Trump announced earlier this week that he was withdrawing US troops from Syria despite opposition from US allies and Trump's own top military officials.In his resignation letter, Mattis said he was stepping down to allow Trump to have a defense chief whose views align more closely with his own, especially as it relates to NATO, cooperation with US allies, and standing up to Russia and China."Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position," the letter reads.While his resignation letter doesn't mention Syria, the New York Times reported that he resigned in protest against the president's decision to pull US troops out of the country, a move that some observers say amounts to abandoning Washington's Kurdish allies, who helped the US fight the Islamic State (IS) group.Citing unidentified US officials, the Times said Mattis tendered his resignation after he failed to convince Trump to reverse his decision on Syria during a meeting at the White House on Thursday afternoon.Despite that report, Trump thanked Mattis for his service on Thursday and praised him for making a contribution to his administration. - (Foreign news)

The new cabinet of ministers yesterday approved a Vote on Account submitted by Minister Mangala Samaraweera soon after the new cabinet was set up.

The vote on account will have allocations for Rs. 480 billion of current spending and Rs. 310 billion of capital spending. The vote-on-account will also have provisions for Rs. 970 billion in debt service, the Finance Ministry said.
Sri Lanka has to repay a billion dollar sovereign bond in January 2019, as well as rollover domestic and multilateral foreign debt.
Economists say, the borrowing options following the downgrading of Sri Lankas ratings, as a result of unfavourable political situation during the last several weeks, would be not so easy as the interest rates would be higher.
Minister Samaraweera was to present budget proposals for 2019 in early November. However, a political setback occurred with the removal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 26, two weeks before the budget for 2019 was to be presented to parliament.
President Maithripala Sirisena appointed 28 ministers as well as Prime Minister Wickremesinghe as National Policies and Economic Affairs on Thursday.

Williamson praises stubborn Sri Lanka pair after drawn First Test
WELLINGTON, Wednesday - New Zealand had tried everything to dislodge Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews on the fourth day of the drawn first test at the Basin Reserve, said Kane Williamson on Wednesday, as the skipper paid tribute to the Sri Lanka pairs discipline and patience.
The match ended in a damp draw after only an hour of play was possible on the fifth and final day due to rain, with Sri Lanka on 287 for three in their second innings, still nine runs shy of New Zealands mammoth first innings of 578.
Mendis and Mathews had saved their team from defeat on Tuesday when they took advantage of a placid wicket to bat the entire day. It was the first time in more than a decade that a wicket had not fallen on a complete days play in test cricket. Williamson said he spoke to senior players to try to come up with an idea to break the partnership on the fourth day but nothing had worked.
Everything we did yesterday didnt provide too many opportunities, he told reporters on Wednesday after stating with a laugh that he might have changed everything if he could replay the fourth day again.
We sat down and had a number of conversations ... and said whats something else we can try. We tried pretty much all of it.
Mendis finished on 142 not out, while Mathews was on 120, having combined for a record 274-run partnership. There wasnt a lot happening, said Williamson. We tried a few short balls and changes of tack and tried to build pressure for a period of time to buy a wicket to a certain extent. Very rarely do you go a whole day where theres not an opportunity regardless of what you try. There might be a run out opportunity or anything, but thats credit to the way the Sri Lankan batsmen played and denied us. They were very disciplined, very patient, and werent looking to bat aggressively which might have given us an opportunity. They played very
nicely. Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal also acknowledged Mendis and Mathews had saved the game for his side, who were dominated by New Zealand over the first three days.
Its not an easy task when the opposition leads by more than 300, Chandimal said. Angelo and Kusal Mendis have done a really good job and they put up a really good partnership.At the same time they played for the team. Thats the most important thing. Thats the most important thing with the way that those guys played.

Archaic 150 year old wage model needs change
Sri Lankan Plantations are in a highly disadvantage situation, Protem Chairman of the event W. G. Roshan Rajadurai told the Ceylon Planters Society 82nd AGM held in Colombo on Wednesday.
The raw material cost in Sri Lanka is four to five times more than competitor countries. We export 95% of our product and we have to compete in the world market and despite of those disadvantages our community has sustained this industry and we have provided livelihoods for over one million people, he said.
The current model of employment is over 150 years old and suited times, five to six decades back than it is today. At that time the British had monopolistic power where they could decide on the price. But since nationalization the world has changed. The British foreseeing this trend went and invested in Africa and built a similar model where all of that tea is imported to Britain.
So we are facing significant and very challenging times ahead and that is why the planters association is advocating a model of revenue sharing where the employees are encouraged and motivated to work hard and earn more than the amount they desire now. There are lots of estates in Sri Lanka where the workers are earning Rs 50,000 to 80,000 on this revenue sharing or productivity based model, and the existing archaic 150 year old model needs change.
Rajadurai said planters must have the courage to change this because the current model is not going to sustain. In 1992 when the estates were privatized the labour wage was only 68 percent of a value of a kilo of tea at the Colombo auctions. Today the labour wage is 162 percent percent of a value of a kilo of tea at the Colombo auctions.
He said despite that Lankan plantations were striving and he was confident that the planters will ensure that there will be a sustainable industry for the next generation to take over. That is way we have promoted a productivity based revenue sharing model where the productive workers can aspire to earn far more than what they are expecting now and it is manifestly clear that it can be done, he said.

Dr. Pathirana was speaking at a media briefing at the SLPP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday.
However, some politicians who opposed the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader have proposed the setting up of a Parliamentary Select Committee to probe the former Presidents suitability for the post. But, the Speaker has no powers to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee on such a matter. Such a Parliamentary Select Committee can only be appointed if the UPFA General Secretary conveyed the request in writing to the Speaker, he said. The SLFP MP said the Parliamentary Select Committee cannot abolish the membership of an MP in Parliament.
There is no legal basis for anyone to form a national government in this situation. However, we have received reports that the UNP and SLMC are in discussion to form a national government to increase the number of Ministerial portfolios. This is illegal and the mainstream political party cannot form a unity government with another single party or group, he said.
During the short period of just 51 days, we have been able to form a broad anti-UNP coalition and also provide numerous benefits and relief to the people. For the first time in history, a massive paddy harvest has been reaped from the 700,000 hectares of land across the country, due to the fertilizer subsidy, MP Dr. Pathirana said.
MP Roshan Ranasinghe said for the last 30 years, an Executive President has not been elected from the UNP. UNPers cannot engage in political conspiracy anymore when there is a President elected by the people.
In a letter to the Speaker, UPFA Secretary General Mahinda Amaraweera had said that MPs who contested under the alliance and won the election will continue in Parliament in the capacity of UPFA MPs.
Rs. 3,000 is cut from our salaries for the SLFP party membership every month. However, we have been requesting for SLPP membership for some time. Although we have applied for the membership, we did not receive membership cards. However, our party leader said the MPs who oppose the unity government can stay in the Opposition and that is why we stay in the Opposition, he said.

All await the holding of the AGM of SLC
Cricket fans, cricketers and all concerned with the progress of the game in the country will heave a sigh of relief now that the Competent Authority that was running cricket has announced that the long delayed Annual General Meeting of Sri Lanka Cricket will be held by February 7, 2019.
There was upheaval and a lot of uncertainty when the scheduled elections were postponed. This did not cut a good image for SLC on the Worlds turf.
Cricket is a Gentlemans game given to the world by the Brits and we should not allow it to suffer any ignominy in the eye of the cricketing world after having struggled to get international recognition vindicated by winning the World Cup.
As for us who have been in the sports writing business for over 50 years and who has followed the game and its administration keenly and very closely make bold to say that sport must be played on the field and in the office and not be taken to the law courts. When it is taken to court it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
With nominations closing on December 31, there is going to be a hive of activity with the contestants for all posts. Like in politics we can well expects
promises of the moon and the stars! But the cricketing public are a mature genre and should not be taken for granted. They will want a choice soon that will bring great credit to the game and to our country.
The vote-maker will be king till the results of the elections are announced. They must do a lot of soul searching, study the credentials of the contestants in the fray very intelligently and cast their vote for the individual, individuals with a proven record and those who could deliver.
One hopes that the AGM will be contested with behavior that will be above board and not descend to intimidation that we had seen years ago.
At the end of this election that will no doubt be hotly contested, it is hoped that the best men with experience and the right credentials to take strike and score for the game, the player and the country will be given their rightful seats in the all important Sri Lanka Cricket.
Cricket in the country has been running for far too long without an elected administration. So much so that it earned the ire of the world
governing body --the International Cricket Council --who had to finally put their foot down and ask SLC to endeavour to have an elected body.
Now a big burden and responsibility is to ensure that the election is conducted in a manner fitting the the highest standard of ethics .
If the election is conducted in an unruly or a questionable manner, it might again end up in courts and it might take a long time for the court
to give an order and again it would mean the game, the player and the administration being on a sticky wicket.
The International Cricket Council will not take kindly to it and there is the possibility of them reconsidering our status.
The nomination list shows an array of illustrious gentlemen with tremendous experience in the fray. For the all-important posts of PRESIDENT are: Mohan de Silva, Jayantha Dharmadasa, K.Manthivanan and Shammi Silva.
VICE PRESIDENTS: Shammi Silva, Ravin Wickremaratne, K.Mathivanan, Arjuna Ranatunga, Pramodaya Wickremasinghe and Mohan de Silva.
SECRETARY:Bandula Dissanayake,Nishantha Rnatunga, Shammi Silva and Mohan de Silva.
TREASURER: Lasantha Wickremasinghe, Ravin Wickremartne, Nalin Wickremasinghe, Shammi Silva.
ASST.SECRETARY: Chrisantha Kapukotuwa, Bandula Dissanayake, Ravin Wickremaratne, Hirantha Perera.
ASST. TREASURER: Lalith Rambukwella, Nalin Wickremasinghe, Eastman Narangoda Sanja Sedera, Gihan Weerasinghe. Former crickets strongman Thilanga Sumathipala has opted out of the running for President saying that he is heavily involved in politics and could not find the time to devote to cricket administration.
With Sri Lanka throwing their heavy artillery in an endeavor to bring home the 2019 World Cup that is to be worked off next May/June in the home of cricket England, changes in the coaching department have been effected.
With the announcement that former Aussie wicket keeper Steve Rixon has been saddled with fielding coach title, comes the news that former England batsman John Lewis has been appointed batting coach.
Losing out are Manoj Abeywickrema and Thilan Samaraweera who were the fielding and batting coaches. To their credit it must be said that they did everything possible at their command and with their expertise to help improve the fielding and batting.
And that they could not succeed was not entirely their fault.
It is said that you could take a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink. Similarly Abeywickrema and Samaraweera showed and told the cricketers how, but that the charges failed to respond and deliver was sad.
It wont be long before Sri Lanka Cricket begins to look for a foreign bowling coach. Who will strike that big paying job will be interesting to watch.
At international level the coaches cant show their charges how to play a stroke or how to take a catch or how in the other aspects of the game.
Those should have done by their coaches at school level.
At this level coaches should talk and tell the players how to adapt to situations.
And if the players cant do that, then they should not be playing the game at this level and the coaches cannot be blamed.
In lighter vein, it would not be a bad idea for SLC to push for a running between the wickets coach and a coach who will teach the cricketers how and when to use the Decision Review System!
Anyway with the bottom line being to bring home the 2019 World Cup, and with the signing of new coaches and with many more to follow and more changes likely to be effected, and with the new administration in the saddle it is hoped that the cricketers will play their part to perfection and deliver so that the country could celebrate the bringing home of the World Cup 2019.

Antibiotics should not be purchased from non AC pharmacies - Health Official
The public should not purchase antibiotics from the non-air-conditioned pharmacies, which could damage the effectiveness of those drugs, Laboratory Services Deputy Director General Dr. H.Benaragama said.
He said maintaining the required temperature for drugs in pharmacies is essential to protect the effective time duration of these drugs.
Dr. Benaragama stated this addressing the Symposium on Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention and Control held at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday.
He said the antibiotic drugs are being misused heavily at present.Therefore, the pharmacists should dispense these drugs to the patience only on a prescription issued by a western-qualified doctor, he emphasised.
Dr.Benaragama said patients should complete the full dose of the anti-biotic drugs prescribed by a qualified doctor; otherwise it could be cause for antimicrobial resistances.
According to him, some doctors, not only in private practice but, government medical officers prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily to the patients. He also pointed out that the doctors of the other medical practices such as the Ayurvedic and the Homeopathy and also the quacks prescribe these antibiotics without a proper knowledge or authority. These things could result in Antimicrobial Resistances (AMRs), Dr.Benaragama said.
Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said it has been estimated that antimicrobial resistances would cause for 10 million deaths globally by 2050.Antibiotics that save millions of lives in the world will become useless if it was misused or overused, Dr. Jasinghe pointed out.
He said antimicrobial resistance is on the rise in every region of the world. The world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era. If the current trend continues, sophisticated interventions such as organ transplant, cancer chemotherapy and joint replacements would become more difficult or even more dangerous to undertake, he emphasised.
Sri Lanka adopted the National Strategic Plan for Combating Antimicrobial Resistance in Sri Lanka 2017 - 2022 in May 2017.
Health, Nutrition, Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was the chief guest.

Back to work
After a period of political turbulence, normalcy has been restored thanks to the flexibility displayed by the top leaders by settling issues with an attitude of give and take. While President Maithripala Sirisena can be happy about the conciliatory policy adopted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during prolonged consultations to select Cabinet of ministers, the latter can be happy about the possibility of carrying out the policy implementation that was halted nearly two months ago.
Prime Minister can continue with his economic development package as his trusted colleagues are at the helm of related ministries. While Mr. Wickremesinghe holds the ministries of Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs other ministries related to economic and finance are held by Mangala Samaraweera (Minister of Finance) Lakshman Kiriella (Minister of Public Enterprise Development) and Malik Samarawickrema (Minister of Development Strategies). With this arrangement, Mr. Wickremesinghe will be able to continue to implement his economic plans unhindered.
New Cabinet
President Sirisena too is in a position to work with the new Cabinet, of which he is the chair, without any problems as the ruling United National Party (UNP) agreed to leave out controversial persons such as Sarath Fonseka, Palitha Ranga Bandara and the UPFA former ministers who wanted to cross over and obtain ministries. They include Wijithamuni Soysa, Piyasena Gamage and Indika Bandaranayake.
Although the current government is a single party government, it could continue to work towards establishing a new political culture where the two national parties cohabitate in a government of good governance forgetting their political rivalries because President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe have shown they could work together despite policy differences.
The media highlighted some parts of President Sirisenas speech after swearing-in of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe where he stressed the policy differences between the two. At the same time, President Sirisena wished the new Prime Minister well and expressed his cooperation. Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Madam Wickremesinghe and Hon. Members of the Parliament. I extend my best wishes to the Prime Minister and extend my blessings to him to receive courage to fulfill the duties of the post of Prime Minister in a successful manner, he said.
President Sirisena added that differences between political leaders could be solved through discussions.
I am happy that political parties and leaders contributed to resolve this crisis. I thank Hon. Speaker, for discussing to resolve this issue. You all came to this office. Likewise, all of them, including Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Podujana Peramuna, came together. The UNF leaders and TNA leaders also extended support. I see this as the spirit of cooperation in a democratic country. Even though whatever facts will be discussed in streets, there should be a humanitarian approach to solve problems sitting together, he stressed.
Fraudulent deals and corrupt practices
President Sirisena has outlined his agenda from the beginning. The citizens of the country elected Maithripala Sirisena on January 8, 2015 to create a very clean state rule and to usher in a pure and clean state, to strengthen law and order, establish a fair society and to act against of corruption, abuse of power, bribery and fraud. As the Head of the Cabinet he will continue to monitor government activities and ensure fraudulent deals and corrupt practices would not take place.
However we have to see the practical side. The bitter experiences in the last three and half years show that it is extremely difficult for the two major national parties to govern together. However, political analysts are of the opinion that the failure of the UNP-SLFP cohabitation was mainly due to lack of a common programme and a policy framework.
The only programme the two parties had was the first 100 day programme. After that there was no common programme and what the two parties did was to divide the government into two and UNP managed their ministries while the SLFP controlled the ministries allocated to their party. The clashes took place in overlapping areas.
What the nation learned in the failure of first national government of 2015-18 was the need for a solid programme for a unity government to succeed. It also needs the leaders who place the country and the people first and not the personal interests or party interests.
The task before President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is to get the country out of the financial crisis, debt burden and retarded economic growth and ensure speedy recovery. President Sirisena can be satisfied with the growth in the agriculture sector during the last quarter, during which all other sectors failed.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will be able to get maximum support from the West for speedy development. The government will not face threats of possible removal of General System of Presences (GSP) Plus concessions for our exports to Europe and United States. We will be able to continue our fish exports to Europe.
The country will get the US$ 480 million grant from the Millennium Challenge Corporation in the United States from 2019.
With these positive signals, the government should be able to take vigorous action to speedy economic revival and ensure betterment of the people. What is essential is to ensure genuine political desire to cooperate.

Bangladesh Opposition goes underground
BANGLADESH: Subrata Chowdhury, an opposition candidate in the looming Bangladesh election, is too scared to leave his party office as campaign deaths and threats mount.
The Dhaka lawyer should be out on the streets handing out leaflets on meet-and-greets. But he says it is too dangerous while his party insists authorities are doing nothing to protect candidates.
We were attacked by ruling party men as we tried to hang these posters, said Chowdhury in his glum headquarters amid stacks of unused flyers and banners.
The police were just silent spectators, or actively supported them. At least six people have been killed in campaign clashes between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas ruling Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
Election authorities have deployed more than 20,000 paramilitary personnel across the country to boost security ahead of the December 30 vote. Army troops are due to join them.
But the BNP is not reassured.
It says at least four party activists have been killed -- including one who fell to his death from a Dhaka rooftop last week in suspicious circumstances -- and thousands hurt in the past week.
The party claims that 152 out of 300 opposition candidates have been attacked while campaigning and more than 8,700 activists, including 14 candidates, have been detained in the past month.
The opposition says its rallies have been broken up by police firing pellet guns and tear gas, terrifying voters turning out to show solidarity with the beleaguered movement.
Candidates like Chowdhury, trying to boost their visibility, have been threatened on the campaign trail by ruling Awami League followers wielding metal bars.
Two Awami League followers have also been killed in fights with the opposition.
Police have denied interfering in rallies or harassing opposition campaigners and authorities say those detained in recent weeks -- which opposition figures say are in the thousands -- had outstanding warrants for their arrest.
Obaidul Quader, general secretary of the Awami League, said the party did not tell its workers to attack opponents.
