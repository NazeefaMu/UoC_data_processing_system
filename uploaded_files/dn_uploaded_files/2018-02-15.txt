Business as usual, says John
Politicos on both sides of the divide were shuttling from one meeting to another yesterday as a decision on the political stability and future of the country hung in the balance with various factions trying to diffuse tensions.
A special Cabinet meeting was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday morning. However, the Daily News reliably learns that the meeting had ended inconclusively.
The Cabinet meeting was followed by further talks amongst SLFP and UNP members last afternoon.
Minister Susil Premajayantha said that President Maithripala Sirisena would make a special statement before Friday.
Speaking to Daily News, Minister John Amaratunga who was present at yesterdays Cabinet meeting said that it was business as usual.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also chaired a meeting yesterday at Temple Trees.
A 10-member Committee with equal a number of members from both the SLFP and UNP set up to make recommendations and reform proposals is due to submit its report tomorrow morning on the future trajectory of the coalition government.
There were no questions raised or discussed with regards to the future of this government. It almost seemed as if there is nothing wrong with the current predicament, Minister Amaratunga said. He however added that many were awaiting the recommendation from the Committee which is to be submitted on Friday.
The uncertainty and instability was acutely reflected yesterday when the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated to the highest level ever. The rupee had depreciated to Rs.155.80 to Rs.156 yesterday afternoon against the dollar.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday confirmed that the two parties failed to reach a consensus over the future of National Unity Government. Commenting on what transpired at the Cabinet meeting and the UNP meeting which followed up, he said different views were expressed by the ministers over the continuation of coalition Government.
Explaining the UNP stand point on the current political deadlock, Minister Dissanayake said,People who dont want to work with PM Ranil Wickremesinghe can go and we will continue the Government with whoever remains within the coalition.
Ministers like Dilan Perera have no right to dictate terms to our leader. If he wishes he can leave the Government, Minister Dissanayake said.

Inflation at moderate level, foreign reserve to be above US$ 7 bn
First Capital Research (FCR) believes inflation rate to moderate, foreign reserve position to be maintained above US$ 7 billion levels.
FCR also expects the improvement in credit growth and likely increase in GDP growth in 2018E.
Consideration of above favourable macroeconomic environment, FC research says current monetary policy is appropriate and no change is required.
GDP growth for 3Q 2017 was lower than expected, grew by 3.3% YoY in the with overall agricultural activities reporting a negative growth mainly due to the unfavorable weather conditions (severe drought as well as heavy rainfalls) that prevailed during the last 2 years in many districts of the country.
First Capital Research upgraded private sector credit growth for 2017E to 16% in Aug 2017 from 14% amidst a likely increase towards the end of the year. Private sector credit figure saw decelerated to Rs 41 billion in October 2017 prior to pick up by Rs 61.6 billion in November 2017, we believe overall credit is likely to continue to remain under check.
First Capital Research forecast Feb 2018 CCPI headline inflation to be at 5.1%. We believe inflation will be under control over the next 2-3 months while there could be some upward pressure towards 2Q2018.
Sri Lankas forex reserves assets decreased by USD 286 million to USD 7.67 billion in January 2018 which was equivalent to about 4.5 months of imports, from Rs 7.96 billion in December 2017.
The CBSL had net purchased USD 191 million from currency markets so far during 2018. First Capital Research View: First Capital Research expects foreign reserves to maintain at USD 7 billion which is equivalent to 4 months import bill value.
Economists said the Fed will still pencil in three hikes for 2018 ( March 2018, June 2018 and December 2018), but moved forward one of those projected moves to March 2018 from June 2018.

Poll results, a blessing in disguise for UNP
The local government (LG) election results should be considered a blessing in disguise for the United National Party (UNP), the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) said yesterday.
More than 3.6 million have directly voted for the UNP and a total of over 55 percent of the voters had collectively voted against the former Rajapaksa regime and its family bandyism, the press release said.
The release signed by JSS General Secretary and Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel further said only about 3.6 million out of the 6.2 million who contributed for the 2015 January 8 victory had voted for the UNP this time, due to some failures and prevarications on the part of the party. Among them were the failure to bring culprits of the Rajapaksa regime before the law and punish them, non-availability of fertilizer for farmers in due time, breakdown of the distribution of fuel, failure to do justice to 33,000 party supporters subjected to political victimization, non-availability of employment opportunities for members of UNP supporters families for the past 20 years, pruning of Samurdhi benefits.
These factors made many party supporters to boycott the elections. Another factor is that UNP supporters who suffered inconvenience for 20 years had to languish in the same plight for another three years under the Yahapalana government concept.
The peoples verdict, however, proved that only the UNP was capable of steering the country towards accelerated development.
Therefore, all parliamentarians, including those in the opposition, should join hands to set up a UNP-led government for which the JSS would lend its unstinting support.

Air India operating profit doubles to Indian Rs 298 crore in FY17
Air India has been consistently improving its overall performance and more than doubled its operating profit to Rs 298.03 crore in the last financial year, according to the government.
The net loss of the state-owned airline however widened to Rs 5,765.16 crore in 2016-17. The divestment-bound national carrier had an operating profit of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16.
Air India has been consistently improving its overall financial and operational performance since the implementation of the turnaround plan by the government, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
In 2015-16, Air India had an operating profit of Rs 105 crore while net loss stood at Rs 3,836.77 crore.
The previous UPA government, in 2012, had approved a turnaround plan under which Air India is to receive a total equity infusion worth Rs 30,231 crore up to 2021 subject to meeting certain performance thresholds.
Out of the total amount, Rs 26,545.21 crore has already been infused into the airline till now.
As part of the turnaround plan, Air India has been taking various measures, including rationalisation of routes and enhanced utilisation of aircraft.
The airline's total loans amounted to Rs 48,447.37 crore in 2016-17. This includes aircraft and working capital loans of Rs 17,359.61 crore and Rs 31,087.76 crore, respectively.
Sinha said the draft expression of interest document inviting proposal for the airline's disinvestment is yet to be finalised by the Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM).
Formal proposals from prospective bidders would be received thereafter only. Any unsolicited expressions of interest at this stage are not relevant, he said.
In June 2016, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had given its in-principle approval for considering strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries. It also constituted the AISAM, which is headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
The panel would decide on hiving off certain assets to a shell company, the entities to be offered for sale during the bidding process, the quantum of disinvestment and the universe of bidders, Sinha said in a separate reply.
To another reply, he said the Air India Museum project has been put on hold due to the ongoing disinvestment process.
There was a proposal to set up a museum of arts and crafts in Mumbai to showcase the collection of Air India.

APPOINTING 25% WOMENS QUOTA: Election Commission in a quandary
The Election Commission is to ask that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No 22 of 2012 to be amended to allow councils to be established even without the mandatory 25 percent quota under special circumstances.
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya addressing the media, said the Commission was in a quandary between abiding by tenets of natural justice and applying the letter of the law.
These circumstances occur when political parties cannot appoint the set number of female candidates according to law due to having an overhang and cannot choose female candidates from the additional list to make up numbers.
At present local government bodies which do not complete their 25 percent quota cannot establish a council. There are over 21 councils which have three or more seats as overhangs at present.
At present local government bodies which especially have an overhang of three or more seats have the issue of the majority party not being able to appoint their assigned quota of women into the council, thus assigning responsibility of fulfilling the quota to the other parties.
The Commission was expected to hold a meeting with party leaders to discuss ways in which to resolve the present issue yesterday.
In the Ambalangoda Municipal Council, there are 20 members and according to the 25 percent quota, we should have five women appointed. The SLPP won the Council, and according to proportional representation system, they were assigned nine seats but there was an overhang so they got 10 seats. In addition, the UNP won seven seats, UPFA three and JVP 1.
When it came to the womens quota, SLPP had to appoint two women, UNP 2 and the UPFA 1 but the SLPP only had one woman winning the seat and they cannot choose another female candidate from the additional list as they already have won an extra seat. This means that their other female candidate should come from either the UNP or UPFA seats in order to fulfill the overall 25 percent quota of women in the council. This seems rather unfair, Deshapriya said.
In a similar case in the Dickwella Pradeshiya Sabha, the SLPP received one extra seat through the overhang and only one of their female candidates won though their quota was two. Here seven women need to be appointed to fulfill the quota. The UNP here won seven seats, SLFP two and the JVP two.This means that the remaining six would have to come from the UNP.
When we asked the Attorney General (AG), they asked us to work according to the Act, but the Commissions conscience is greater than the Act. We need to implement the law but what happens to those candidates who have contested and won Do we ask them to resign Do we put the burden of making the numbers to the other parties Deshapriya asked.
We informed the AGs Department that this issue will crop up when they were amending the Act but they said that we are speaking of extreme situations, he added.
If all 25 percent of female candidates had contested instead of the 10 percent, Deshapriya was of the view that more women would have won seats and they would not have to face the present situation.

Arpico Finance partners with SSC for pavilion construction
Arpico Finance Company PLC (AFC) will put its mark on Sri Lanka's most historic cricketing venue, the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC), by sponsoring the construction of a pavilion that will have a 1,000 seat capacity spread over three levels.
AFC was established in 1951, carving out a reputation as a leader in leasing and hire purchase facilities for vehicles and has since expanded into trade finance, real estate and other areas of business in keeping with the demand from the local market.
Speaking about the sponsorship, Managing Director of Arpico Finance Company PLC, Shanil Dayawansa, said, This is the coming together of two pioneering institutions in Sri Lanka - the 118-year-old SSC and Sri Lanka's second oldest finance company established 67 years ago. The opportunity to be present at the SSC is yet another historic milestone for us at AFC and we look forward to building this partnership over the coming years and being part of the legendary thrills and experiences the SSC is synonymous for.
Commenting on the sponsorship, President Sinhalese Sports Club, W.T Ellawala, said, SSC is deeply grateful to Arpico Finance for its sponsorship of a Pavilion that will add approximately a 1000 seats to its spectator capacity.
Arpico Finance is one of the oldest finance companies in Sri Lanka, and the SSC is one of the oldest cricket clubs in the country, and this partnership to support develop infrastructure in one of the finest cricket venues in the country will certainly add more value to the SSC's present position as one of the most preferred cricket grounds in Sri Lanka. We urge the corporate sector to follow Arpico Finance's lead and support the SSC to upgrade and expand its cricket infrastructure.
The AFC branded pavilion will be ready ahead of the upcoming Big Match Season, the most celebrated series of cricketing encounters in the country's sporting calendar. The annual school cricketing encounters between the leading boys schools have attracted over 10,000 spectators on each day of the match, including an influx of old boys living overseas.

Ayurveda a holistic approach to health
Hundreds of patients throng the indigenous ayurveda hospital daily in Colombo District to be treated for numerous ailments. They are here because they are utterly frustrated with what allopathy has to offer, says the hospitals bigwig, Director Dr. Kumari Kumarasekera in an interview with this writer recently.
It is all free of charge, she added. We do have a paying ward for Rs. 1,000 per day and we have treated so many and they are doing very well now and are so grateful to us. The allopathy system has been a total failure and I am glad they had the presence of mind to come here for treatment.
Dr Kumarasekera then went on to explain the magic behind it all.
You see it is like this. Ours is a lifelong process and once you are in it from your infancy you are in safe hands, I assure you. You have to take greater care in what you consume.
A vegetarian diet is recommended and yoga helps the metabolism to function effectively. Apart from this, at the slightest onset of sickness, you have to cleanse the system. It is a process of constantly maintaining your body. Chipping in was Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Amaratunga who said the ayurvedic system was like servicing a car. You have to fine-tune the body like we do in the case of our vehicles. But we seem to be fond of our vehicles more than ourselves, because we are on time for vehicle servicing and not so with ourselves. So disease or no disease, one has to keep in touch with the ayurvedic doctor after observing our body signals. Just in case you wonder what body signals are, you have to watch out for these messages that the body sends and act fast on it. Persistent aches and pains, headaches, puffiness, inability to eat and constant coughs and colds will signal that the body is lacking something and this is where the ayurvedic physician can be of enormous help.
Our drugs do not have any chemicals. It is all only herbs, leaves, roots and so on.
Dr. Kumarasekera says to make it easier for patients, nowadays medicine is prepared at the ayurveda hospital and one does not need to go through the hassle of preparing it at home, which understandably is quite tedious. Medicine comes in the form of powders, paste, liquid, oils and so on. So it is much easier now particularly when people are scrambling for time. All the grinding, pounding and preparation is done at the pharmacological unit under strict hygienic conditions.
Ayurvedic teachings are as old as the earth, said Dr Kumarasekera. Whoever who created the world, created for man the vegetation he needs for his sustenance. Into that he included medicinal herbs as well. Documented long after, this system was widely practised not only by early man, but by animals as well. Even today when a cat is sick, it goes in search of a medicinal herb called kuppameniya. Unfortunately that inherent knowledge in man has been wiped out because of externalities.
The technological era has come in. Computers are ruling our lives and many scientific developments have set in. All this is good and we are keeping abreast of it. But then, it should not be at the cost of the natural knowledge bestowed on man.
The two doctors further explained that according to ayurveda, the cosmos consists of fire, water and ether. All three elements comprise man. If we are to be healthy, these three elements must be well balanced. One must not overtake the other. If it does, the body loses its equilibrium. This is when you have to get yourself treated.
Dr. Kalpana from the University of Gujarat who was in Sri Lanka to attend an ayurvedic seminar viewed ayurveda as a holistic approach to health. It is also a lifelong process. She recommended regular exercise, 6-7 hours of sleep, a vegetarian diet and the intake of a litre of boiled ginger water throughout the day as harbingers of good health.

## Title: Bangladesh keen to expel doubts in their T20 game

1st T20 international against Sri Lanka today:
Bangladesh keen to expel doubts in their T20 game
Mahmudullah, Bangladesh's stand-in Twenty20 skipper, aims at removing the question marks surrounding his side's ability as a T20 unit when they take on Sri Lanka in a two-match series from Thursday.
Bangladesh enjoyed good fortune in their own den in the recent past but things did not go their way during the tri-nation series or the Test series that followed with Sri Lanka clinching the trophy on both occasions.
Mahmudullah, who was named to lead the side after Shakib al Hasan was ruled out of the opening game with a finger injury, said that they were keen to put to rest the doubts that constantly were on their backs and that they were making progress as a T20 side, just as they have made in the other two formats.
"Twenty20 is a different format all together and the pace of it is quite different from other formats," Mahmudullah said in Mirpur on Wednesday ahead of the last leg of the month-long series.
"We have to remove the question mark that is attached with us as a Twenty20 unit," he said. "We are keen to give a message to all the teams in the world that we are developing in the same pace when it comes to Twenty20 comparing to Test and ODIs," he said.
Mahmudullah did not believe that playing at home put pressure on them as the expectations were always high considering the fan following in the nation.
"We have raised the expectations by playing well at home for the last three years and unfortunately we could not deliver in this series," he conceded. "There is another opportunity in front of us and we must grab it," he said.
Bangladesh need to put up a proper account of their ability in the shortest version as they are currently placed 10 - ranked below Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - with their below par outcome in Twenty20 largely being attributed to not playing enough games in the format.
Bangladesh, however, have quite a few T20 games scheduled over the next couple of months with their series against Sri Lanka being followed by the Nidhas Cup in Sri Lanka, comprising India and the hosts to celebrate the 70th independence anniversary of the Island nation, which will be followed by a T20 series against West Indies in June.
[Mirpur pitch rated as below average]
David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees has rated the Mirpur Test pitch between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as below average and, as such, it has received one demerit point according to the ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process.
Boon, whose report has been forwarded to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, said: From day one, there was evidence of the ball breaking the pitch surface, which resulted in uneven bounce throughout the match, along with inconsistent turn, which was even excessive at times. This pitch produced a contest that was too heavily skewed in favour of the bowlers, and didnt give the batsmen a fair chance to display their skills.
Sri Lanka won the Test by 215 runs inside three days with 681 runs being scored for the loss of 40 wickets. Roshen Silva with 70 not out was the top-scorer of the match.

An election free and fair
This is the most peaceful election ever held in this country following a lapse of six decades. This democratic government created the peaceful environment for the people to cast their valuable vote with political freedom to criticise the government.
A country cannot be truly democratic until its citizens have the opportunity to choose their representatives through elections that are free and fair. Elections provide an important opportunity to advance democratization and encourage political liberalization.
The newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has obtained the majority of these local bodies. That phenomenon, however, should not be misread. The President and his democratic government have not lost confidence in Good Governance. The SLPP is only a party in the Opposition. Long live this government designed for the people by the people.

Clifford Cup k/o  CR-CH not for weak hearts
All hail the islands rugby league, the Dialog premier competition, signed sealed, Kandy triumphant, and fully delivered for 2018.
It has been a journey of significant consequence when you consider the quality dictates that kept it all fair and TMO friendly from November ...perhaps a quick trip to across the English channel, might give Welsh fans a beneficial boost in the arm
Coach Jones, more than content to claim it for the boys ..and simply move to the next ...it was a remarkable let off and impossible to imagine, given technology and margin for human error
Wales stunned England and the 1000s of fans...showing how big their hearts for world class delivery.
For us islanders, it was pretty much done and Kandy dusted 3-weeks ago, but still a supercharged finish against Havelocks.....The match was predictable, and true to form ...a 2nd half step which shocked fans and the lions front row.
Farzil amiable Marija signing off his 15 years of pain and dedication, with a 3-try blitz that had the crowd in a frenzy.
A perfect script for his impressive time at school, club, country and Asian rugby.
Best wishes from all rugby islanders for his next step.
Havelocks falling two points short and CR losing in the last min is massive news for the Clifford Cup knockouts....Lady Clifford less nervous about the weather, and well set for more intense sentiment, in the middle.....
CR v CH will be all or nothing, and a tantalising opportunity for both sets of Colombo 7 warriors to stamp their class and claim their time in history...its nothing short of gut wrenching and absolutely no love lost at all.
Patience and skill will be tested to the core ...Ratwatte ready for all sorts and able to inspire his backs to deliver, Omalka hopefully injury free and hungrier for impact and yards, skipper Kavindu able to lead by example and ignite the grandstand at Racecourse ...its billed as a thriller and medical advice for weak hearts not to attend
CH are equally hungry, having gifted generously in both rounds, find themselves staring down the barrel ...No Russian roulette rugby fans ..this is bite the bullet on demand, and full on for this competition.
Keys to a decent essay is between the back row graft team of Sasanka, Yoshita, and Muthutanthri....The more they win the breakdowns, the more they hand Keegal, Herath, Weerakoon, Lee, and boots Samuel, good ball for gains up the park, worries for Saranga all behind and back to his lethal best.
Rugby fans ...prepare the mind for pressure and kit up for the red and stripes quarters .....my mind racing and pounding at the thought ..12 years of running against the Longdon Place lot has never been straightforward...always guts and courage to survive the battle and sharp wit to hit them hard, but essential to dominate in the loose and outwit them with open play ...an impressive list of forwards from both sides ..will well remember the thick Wintegeno air in the dressing room and the taste of adrenaline as we run out.
If you are the betting sort ...feel free to have a flutter and confuse the experts ...this is down to old fashioned blood and guts ...blessings for a scorcher that rips into all we consider normal and fair.
Let's the warriors prevail...!
Navy v Police is a big step for our boys in blue ...as is Air Force v Kandy at Nittawela.
Havelocks v Army will be a tester and down to the last quarter ..if all upfront is control by Havies...life for Dulaj, Dabere, Nishon, Herath and Hasantha...fair.
But can Sharo be his lethal self to contest and rip balls for turnovers...or will he end up giving penalties away for lack of discipline your guess is as good if not better than mine ...but history does not favour our ex Peters back row Fernando, to hold his nerve and that extra yard or gesture of need ..
Let's wish him patience and wisdom around the park, its going to be Havelcks skills v Army fitness and power.
The quarter finals are upon us ...All courage and pace under pressure to all the boys fit and ready to satisfy Lady Cliffords grand design and mesmerize islanders rugby hearts to echo faster ...its all or nothing and everything on the day ...step up step strong and may skills be the dictate from start to finish.
Adrenaline faithful, check your reserve and breathe bigger oxygen...its the only way to survive.
All hail the islanders and little fuss about form...
Enjoy max weekends...
Bula Bula Sri api....

Whereas another testamentary case has been filed by his sister Farida Shabbir in the same court in respect of the same Estate on the basis that his Late Father died intestate and had left behind a positive net worth of approximately 1.3 billion rupees.
Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakhse PC also submitted to court further misappropriations of the deceaseds estate committed by Idris Shabbir having obtained the Limited Letters of Administration in addition to the Petition submitted to court on the 24th of January 2018 by Dr. Ali Asgar Gulamhusein. The revelation that was most shocking and disturbing was the sale of the 778,460 listed shares of Onally Holdings PLC belonging to the estate of late Dr. Shabbir Abbas Gulamhusein at Rs.48/- a share which totals to approximately Rupees Forty Million of which the price has been absolutely undesirable which has caused irreparable loss and damage to the estate of the deceased.
The Petitioner in his petition states that Onally Holdings PLC owns the Unity Plaza building in Bambalapitiya and on or around 10th of January 2018 Renuka Capital PLC floated a mandatory offer at Rs. 48/- a share to purchase the remaining share of Onally Holdings PLC which is valid from 19th of January 2018 to 08th of February 2018.
The Petitioner further states in his Petition that the Urban Development Authority is the major shareholder of Onally Holdings PLC and in the light of the said mandatory offer by Renuka Capital PLC there is a battle for control of Onally Holdings PLC, which had placed the estate of the deceased at an advantageous position to sell the said shares at a premium price had the Respondent Idris Shabbir acted prudently. Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakhse PC also pointed out that the said sale of shares were made by the Respondent Idris Shabbir after the Learned Additional District Judge issued an Order Nisi interparte against the Respondent Idris Shabbir which amounts to challenging the authority of the court, having had perfect knowledge of the said order. The value realized from the sale of shares within forty eight hours from entering the Order Nisi is 5 times more than the proceeds from sale of shares of Deceaseds estate done by the Respondent Irdis Shabbir in the past eight months.
The Petitioner Dr. Ali Asgar Shabbir Gulamhusein in his Petition states that it has become necessary for the ends of justice and/or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court to restrain the Respondent Idris Shabbir from selling or disposing any of the assets of the estate of the deceased until such intermediate account is filed by the Respondent Idris Shabbir and approved by this Court.
Against an imminent threat of irreparable loss and damage being caused to the estate of the deceased and the Petitioner at the hands of the said Idris Shabbir who is currently holding the Limited Letters of Administration to the Estate of the deceased, Dr. Rajapakshe made an application to court to make anorder directing the Respondent Idris Shabbir to submit a Statement of Accounts relating to his administration of the deceaseds property from 09th of June 2017 to 31st of January 2018 and for an order restraining the Respondent Idris Shabbir from selling or disposing any of the assets of the estate of the deceased until such intermediate account is filed by the Respondent Idris Shabbir and approved by the court.
Having heard the lengthy submissions of the Petitioners Counsel Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe PCand having perused the Petition, Affidavit and the documents attached to the Petition, the Learned Additional District Judge having been satisfied made an order directing the Respondent Idris Shabbir to file in Court an intermediate account of his administration for the period from 9th of June 2017 to 31st of January 2018.
The Learned Additional District Judge also made an order restraining the Respondent Idris Shabbir from selling or disposing any of the assets of the estate of the deceased until such intermediate account is filed by the Respondent Idris Shabbirand approved by the court.
Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe PC appeared with Kapila Liyanagamage and Niranjan Arulpragasam Attorneys-at-Law for the Petitioner Dr. Ali Asgar Shabbir Gulamhusein instructed by G. G. Arulpragasam Senior Attorney-at-Law.

CTC contribution to State falls to Rs 117.3 bn
Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) contribution to the government through excise, taxes and levies, has fallen to Rs 117.3 billion during the year ending December 31, 2017, compared to the Rs 135 billion targeted during the year.
The Company also notes that the dip in its contribution to the states coffers is the result of the legal cigarette prices shooting up by 43 per cent following the tobacco excise hike and introduction of 15 per cent VAT during the last quarter of 2016. In the past, the Government had successfully increased its excise revenue from cigarettes, on average, by around 20 per cent year on year, but in 2017 it experienced only a marginal increase of 1.6 per cent over 2016 to Rs 88.9 billion.
The Companys volumes declined by 18 per cent when compared to 2016, while Net Turnover for the year also declined by 0.2 per cent when compared to the same period last year.
Legally manufactured cigarettes becoming unaffordable to average consumers also led to a booming illicit trade in the country. Smuggled cigarettes entering the country increased over 10-fold in 2017, with 450 million sticks infiltrating the market during the year.

Deshapriya laments lack of Tamil language proficient officers
The lack of government officers proficient in the Tamil language has been a reason for election work to be delayed, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat, he stressed the need to hire more officers proficient in Tamil so that the Secretariat can fulfill their mandate of making information available in all three languages.
We decided to send the list of candidates along with the polling cards to all the houses, so that they can make an informed decision. This turned out to be more work than expected as the Government Printers does not have adequate numbers of Tamil proof readers. This meant that our officers had to be sent there to proof read documents, Deshapriya said.
This had resulted in many of their other documents such as instructions to polling booth staff being delayed. In addition, the Commission has also had trouble finding bilingual officers to be sent to work in mixed electorates such as Gampaha or Thihariya, he said.
We have highlighted this problem for a long time now but very little action has been taken. We ask that the government conduct an exam and hire more people who proficent in the Tamil language, said the Election Commission Chairman said.

LASANTHA WICKREMATUNGE MURDER CASE:
Ex-senior DIG remanded
Retired Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on Tuesday, for allegedly concealing evidence in the murder of former Sunday Leader Chief Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Nanayakkara was the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at the time of Wickrematunges murder with Mount Lavinia coming under his jurisdiction.
He was produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday and remanded till February 16.
A CID source told the Daily News that the former DIG was arrested around 10.30 pm on Tuesday from his home at Fairfield Gardens. He is facing charges of aiding and abetting in destroying vital evidence in the Lasantha Wickrematunge killing.
Wickramatunge, was murdered on January 8, 2009 in Attidiya, Ratmalana, while on his way to the office.
Several high-ranking police officers and army intelligence officers have been arrested in connection with the murder including the former Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police who was remanded on February 2 on allegations of having concealed vital information on the murder on the directions of senior officers. The case against the former Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police is to be taken up on February 16.
The Police field note book was found and according to that, the former DIG had instructed the Crimes OIC to refrain from continuing with the investigations. Certain pages of the note book had been removed and replaced. This information was found only after the CID took over the investigations two years ago. The investigations into the killing had commenced nine years ago but no progress was made as these high ranking police officers were trying to conceal evidence and preventing the investigations from moving forward. All these parties had banded together to sweep the investigations under the carpet.This former DIG had acted upon the instructions of the former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne, the CID source said.

Florida shooting: At least 17 dead in high school attack

At least 17 people are dead after a 19-year-old man opened fire at a high school campus in Parkland, Florida, police have said.
The suspect has been named as Nikolas Cruz, 19, and is a former student at the school who had been expelled.
As the attack unfolded students were forced to hide as police swooped in on the building.
It is one of the deadliest school shootings since 26 people were killed at a Connecticut school in 2012.
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Cruz killed three people outside the school, before entering the building and killing another 12.
Two people later died after being taken to hospital.
"It's catastrophic. There really are no words," Sheriff Israel tweeted later.
Dr Evan Boyar of Broward Health told reporters late on Wednesday that 17 people total had been taken to area hospitals.
He added that Cruz was among those treated and was released into police custody. Three people remained in a critical condition and three others were in stable condition, he said.
The victims are still being identified. Sheriff Israel said a football coach was among the dead but no names have been released.
How the attack unfolded
On Wednesday, the local public school district tweeted that "students and staff heard what sounded like gunfire" just before the end of the day at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Witnesses said that the suspect pulled a fire alarm before the violence erupted.
Police and SWAT team members swarmed the campus and began clearing students from the school in Parkland, about an hour north of Miami, as parents and ambulances converged on the scene.
Cruz, who had been expelled for "disciplinary reasons", was taken into custody without incident in the nearby town of Coral Springs about an hour after he left the high school, according to police.
"We have already begun to dissect his websites and things on social media that he was on and some of the things... are very, very disturbing," Sheriff Israel said.
"Just a horrible day for us," said Robert Runcie, the superintendent of the county's school district.
'Worst nightmare'
Many students said they thought it was a drill after hearing the fire alarm go off shortly before the shooting.
Students told US media they hid under desks, in closets or barricaded doors as loud shots rang out.
One student, Bailey Vosberg, said: "I heard what sounded like fireworks and I looked at my friend and he asked me if I heard that."
"Immediately, I knew. I didn't say anything to him, I just hopped over the fence and I went straight to the road that our school is located on - and as I got there there was just Swat cars and police units, police vehicles just flying by, helicopters over the top of us."
Caesar Figueroa, a parent, told CBS News his daughter was hiding in a closet when she called him.
He told the news outlet earlier that he told her not to call him because he did not want the gunman to hear her voice.
"It's the worst nightmare not hearing from my daughter for 20 minutes, it was the longest 20 minutes of my life," Figeuroa said.
A teacher told WSVN that she hid in a closet with 19 students for 40 minutes- and that the school had undergone training for such a situation six weeks ago.

Fonterra surpasses Rs 3 bn investment mark
Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, the dairy co-operative behind Anchor, recently surpassed the Rs. 3 billion investment-mark in its commitment to building a thriving local dairy industry and boosting the availability of high quality, local dairy nutrition for Sri Lankans.
These long-term initiatives span the breadth of the dairy value chain with the local dairy farmer at its centre. From providing thousands of local farmer families with support to uplift milk productivity and milk quality, to providing new farmers direct access to milk collection and chilling facilities, to investing in local dairy processing and storage facilities, to sustainable projects that benefit farmer families; three years of investment have led to a steady development in the local value chain.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent, Sunil Sethi, said the dairy co-operative has been enabling the countrys dairy industry to better meet national nutritional requirements.
As we work towards building a thriving Sri Lankan dairy industry, increased and consistent demand for local, fresh dairy nutrition is just as important as maintaining a steady supply of high quality products. Recognising this, we have most recently focused our investment instrengthening the reach of the dairy cold chain across the country, as well as supporting improvements in milk quality and collection, said Sethi.
In many regions across the country, limited chilling facilities prevent small stores and outlets from providing consumers with fresh dairy products such as yoghurts and flavoured milk. We embarked on a drive to rapidly expand reach and consumption of our high quality local dairy nutrition in partnership with medium and small-scale outlets all over the island. Initially, we expanded our foot print by increasing the number of outlets offering these products from 25,000 to over 40,000, said Sethi.
This rapid expansion has resulted in the installation of over 3,000 chilling facilitiesin trade outlets over the past year, helping more people across Sri Lanka access the goodness of local dairy nutrition.
This expansion has also supported traders in driving consumption of local dairy products, with Fonterras teams regularly providing assistance to ensure safe storage, increase prominence of chilling facilities towards front of outlets and install attractive lighting and displays.

Hemas Outreach Foundation (HOF), the CSR arm of Hemas Holdings together with the Welikada Prison Department, unveiled the newly refurbished Child Care Centre on February 4, at the Welikada Prison Complex.
The occasion was graced by Commissioner General Prisons H.M.N.C. Dhanasinghe and CEO, Hemas Holdings PLC Steven Enderby with other dignitaries including officials from the Civil Defense Force who provided their services to renovate the center.
The 3.5 million project, enriched and empowered the lives of the young children who were compelled to live with their mothers under appalling conditions for no fault of their own.
The newly refurbished child care centre provided improved sleeping conditions, sanitation facilities, and a play area within the premises. Further, along with providing the basic daily nutrition requirements of the children, Hemas will be distributing consignments of its Baby Cheramy products under the supervision of the HOF and Prison Authorities on a monthly basis.
Piyawara Singithi Diriya enhances the lives of the children residing at the prison quarters with their mothers who are prisoners at the Welikada Prisons.
It is part of a larger project, Piyawara which was launched in 2002 in partnership with the Childrens Secretariat of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs.
The project focuses on promoting Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in Sri Lanka.
At present there are 44 Piyawara preschools across the country, focusing on key aspects within the framework of ECCD providing a holistic approach to preschool education.
Senior Superintendent of Welikada Prison Chandana Ekanayake stated,We have received suggestions by well- meaning individuals and renowned companies in the past towards the betterment of these children who have been incarcerated for no fault of their own, but it never materialized until this prerogative by Hemas.
The Management and staff at Hemas place immense value on Piyawara Singithi Diriya and extend their fullest cooperation towards the success of this project, said Shiromi Masakorala, Executive Director of the Hemas Outreach Foundation.
The special occasion was further signified by the planting of trees by two of the most legendary Sri Lankan cricketers, Roshan Mahanama and Kumara Sangakkara along with Yehali Sangakkara who extend their support to Piyawara Singithi Diriya.

I was not intimidated - Deshapriya
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday, rejected claims that he was threatened on election night to delay the results by a certain political party.
Addressing a media briefing at the Election Secretariat, Deshapriya explained that there was no political influence exerted on him to release or not to release results.
We asked two representatives to be sent by each party. MP Ashu Marasinghe representated the UNP, Champani Padmasiri from the SLFP and Sagala Kariyawasam and Renuka Perera from the SLPP. These representatives were there since 7 pm while the SLPP representatives stayed on till the end, the Elections Commission Chairman said.
He stressed that the Election Commission has always functioned independently without fear and that he would not have allowed any party to intimidate him.
I ask that such rumours not be spread. I was a man who went without Police security to monitor the elections in Jaffna.We prevented Rs.2,500 from being distributed during the Uva Province election and we visited Rupavahini to stop them from telecasting biased propaganda. I am not afraid, Deshapriya said.

JO planning to silence Auditor General  Warnasinghe
The Joint Opposition is planning to drive a sense of fear into the Auditor General, with a planned No Confidence Motion in Parliament, the Anti-Corruption Front said yesterday.
The Joint Opposition had not only become upset over the explanation and comment made by the Auditor General about the governments debt crisis, but also planned to bring in a No Confidence Motion in Parliament against the Auditor General to drive a sense of fear into him.
The Anti-Corruption Front condemns this sinister attempt of the Joint Opposition with deep abhorrence, Anti-Corruption Front Advisor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said in a press release yesterday.
The release said the startling revelation made by the Auditor General explained to the nation the gravity of the economic crisis faced by the country due to the unbridled spree of obtaining foreign and local loans during the previous regime.
The Auditor General in his statement not only explained the manner in which the Rajapaksa regime had bequeathed a debt burden on the country but gave a comparison of the loans obtained and the per capita debt incurred during the Rajapaksa regime and the present era. This had irked parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene who is the chief of the joint oppositions Economic Research unit.
The Auditor General who was considered a hero by Gunawardena when he explained the loss incurred due to the Central Bank Bond issue, seemed to have become a traitor in the eyes of Gunawardena.
The Sihala saying Kanna Ona Wunama Kabaragoyath Thalagoya Wenawa is apt to describe the duplicity of Gunawardena who now tries to bring in a No Confidence Motion against the Auditor General. This can also be considered as a ploy to drive fear into the minds of high state officials including those involved in anti-corruption investigations.
While condemning the attempt to bring in a No Confidence Motion against the Auditor General, the Anti Corruption Front requests all forces who value the countrys financial benefit to come forward to protect and safeguard the Auditor General.

Judges wife seeks HRC relief for schoolless child
The Moneragala District Judges wife lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday about the failure of the education authorities to provide a suitable school for her child, due to her husbands transfer.
Speaking to the Daily News Dinithi Kariyawasam said her husband, the Monaragala District Judge, had been transferred from Moneragala to Balapitiya from January 1, 2018. However, despite having applied for admission to Dharmashoka College, she had still not received a response with regard to the admission of her child.
Its been a month since schools have commenced for the year and my child is still at home without a school. Judges are also transferred periodically, but there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper schooling for our children. My Husband was transferred to the Balapitiya Magistrates Court from January 1. We appealed to the Education Director, and applied for the school in November, but still to receive even an acknowledgement to my appeal, she said.
She lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday and said further measures are being taken regarding her childs predicament.

Kandy SC honours retiring Fazil Marija
All Kandy Sports Club rugby fans are sad that the mercurial and national fly half Fazil Marija has announced that he will retire from rugby after the Clifford Cup knockouts, and his last match at Nittawela grounds was played on Sunday. The deafening cry is for him to continue for at least another year.
A player of his caliber and class is born only once in a lifetime and Kandy fans are upset that he has decided to quit when at the pinnacle of his glittering career. In the last game he scored three superb eye catching tries not easily seen at top class rugby.
Highly popular Fazil enjoyed a 15-year career at the top level. He is a player who enjoyed every moment of being a top player and crowds were thrilled to watch his world class play, and are querying as to why he is going when there is more blood and determination in him. He has always been an example to the game and the country is lucky to have a ruggerite of his calibre who represented some great teams of Kandy Sports Club and Sri Lanka on his highly successful rugby road. He is now looking forward to starting the next chapter in his life by joining the coaching scrum.
It is with huge sadness to every rugby lover to see Fazil Marija (born 2 December 1985), known as one of Sri Lankas finest rugby players and one of Asias best, play his last league game on Saturday. He was a man who was a big figure in the rugby field. He showed faith and trust for the game. He was the toughest ruggerite in the recent years, a brave player. In the last few years he had been the match-winner with his brilliant play had no equal in the game.
Marija mastered his rugby skills at Kingswood College under his cousin Ronny Ibrahims guidance. H represented his school teams from U-13 to U-20. He played for 1st XV in 2003 as a fly half, and went on to lead them to an unbeaten triple championship in 2004 as the captain of Kingswood College 1st XV. Marija became the best Schoolboy player in the Singer International 7s tournament and also in the Golden Key Schools 7s tournament, where Kingswood College won both Championships under his captaincy.
Two years back Fazil retired from national rugby, he played for the country for 14 years, considering that rugby is a rib bruising game it was admirable that he ran in amazing number of tries for club and country. His last game for Sri Lanka was in the final defeat to Malaysia at this years Asia Division I championship in Malaysia. He was easily the best rugby sevens and fifteen game player produced by the country in the last several years. Fazil is a player, leader, creator and altogether a fine example for all the rugby players. He is a ruggerite with plenty of ideas and ambition and certainly a knowledgeable player. Fazils capabilities and his potential cannot be matched by any of the fly halfs today.
Fazil hails from a famous Malay sporting family, who are rugby crazy. He first represented Sri Lanka in year 2000. In that year he toured for the first time with Sri Lanka National U 16 team for the Junior Rugby Asiad. While still at school, in 2003 he was called up by Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) to be on the starting lineup at the match against touring Hong Kong at Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy. In 2004, Marija commenced his club rugby career by representing Kandy SC in their 2nd round match against Havelocks SC at Nittawela. He also went on to represent the Kandy SC in the Clifford Cup Knock out tournament matches the same year. To date, he continues to represent Kandy SC and during this period Kandy SC went onto dominate the sport by winning the League and Knockout tournaments continuously. He was adjudged Most Promising Player of the Year 2004 at the Caltex/Observer Rugby Awards. All this he achieved while he was still a schoolboy at Kingswood College. He captained Kandy SC in 2010.
His father Abdul Rasheed Marija, was a sportsman and played for the Police. Mother Fareeda Sherifdeen participated in sports at Kandy Good Shepherd Convent. It was she who encouraged Fazil to take up to rugby. His uncles Tuany Amidon played football and rugby for Army and was an All-Ceylon football player and one of the best dribblers in Asia. Kamil Roy Amith played for Kandy S.C., T.M.N. Sherifdeen - Navy SC, Fazils cousins Ibrahim brothers Raja, Roy, Ronnie, Rinnie and Nilifer, Buks brothers Ansar and Amjad all played for Kandy SC, Dev Ananda played for Navy SC, his brother Faizal is with Kandy SC. Except for Tuany Amidon, the others are products of Kingswood College. Fazil as a schoolboy was spotted by Kandy SCs godfather Malik Samarawickrema in the match between Kingswood and Royal, and was invited to play in the Clifford Cup knockouts and today he is a legend in the game.
Forty minutes before the last league game against Havelocks at Nittawela on Sunday, a section of the tiers was named after him as Fazil Marija tiers. He married Yasara and are blessed with a baby Liyara.

A make or break for Unity Govt.
The present imbroglio in the Yahapalanaya government, following the defeat suffered at the just concluded local government election, is yet to be resolved, as this piece is being written. A section within the SLFP parliament group wants Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down, while the young Turks in the UNP want the present leader to break ranks with the Blues and form a UNP government under the Premiership of Wickremesinghe.
The President, also, in deference to the members of his own camp is insisting that the Premier stands down. Meanwhile a group of UNP Cabinet ministers had also met the President and wanted PM Wickremesinghe retained. In the end, the President appointed a committee comprising members of both sides to decide on the future structure of the government, but not before being critical of the UNP for leaving him out of the loop in matters of governance, which, he had pointed out, was the main reason for the current predicament of the government. This betrays the extent of the policy clashes between the market friendly UNP and the more people friendly SLFP.
Be that as it may, a majority within the UNP may feel that the government's defeat at the LG polls had come as a blessing in disguise. It has now paved the pave for the party to form its own government. The UNP, has, at present, 107 seats in parliament and there are strong indications that a sizable group from the SLFP/UPFA would join the Greens to form a UNP government.
Of course, the constant bickering among the Yahapalanaya partners, no doubt, sent a negative message to the electorate. The frequent broadsides aimed at Premier Wickremesinghe by the likes of Susil Premajayantha and Dilan Perera, on the one hand, and, the attacks on their SLFP partners by the likes of Sujeewa Senasighe and Chaminda Wijesiri, showed up the Unity Government as a tottering edifice ready to crumble at any moment. The public were given the clear impression that no one was in control of the ship of state.
The UNP back-benchers who are clamouring for a government of their own may have just cause for airing their views in the open. Their party cadres had virtually been in the wilderness for over two decades, been forced to endure untold hardships and victimized at every turn in the area of employment and in other ways, during that period.
Now, notwithstanding a government being led by their own party, they are still unable to do justice to their party men, with most of the top ministries in the hands of their coalition partner, closing the door for employment opportunities to UNPers. This is why firebrand MP Nalin Jayamaha voiced his anger yesterday saying that hordes of UNPers turned their backs on the party at Saturday's election, due to the party's inability to cater to their needs (due to the plum ministries being with the SLFP ministers).
The UNP were also hampered in other ways, with most of its economic policies having being forced to be put on the back-burner after being countermanded by the President. True, some of these proposals were hard on the public who expect quick fix solutions to their woes. However, the SLFP always sought to take credit for withdrawing these policies, showing the UNP in poor light before the public.
In sum, both, the UNP, and, SLFP were acting at cross purposes for the entirety of the Unity Government, resulting in sluggishness in the implementation of government policies, for the people's welfare. The public, naturally, were all at sea, unable to grasp this state of affairs. The UNPs hands were tied in most instances, with the SLFP always trying to project the image that it was the Blues that was against placing burdens on the public due to UNPs economic policies.
Be that as it may, it is not clear what the outcome of the committee appointed by the President will be. The civil society outfit puravesi balaya, which played a major role in bringing the January 8 change, wants the Unity Government to continue till 2020. Its leaders have met, both, the President, and, Prime Minister and prevailed on them to stick together. With the soured relations between the partners taking a turn for the worse, after the electoral defeat, it is doubtful whether a rapprochement will be feasible. Both sides will have to hold onto to their guns, which, from the way things look, will be near impossible.
Meanwhile, while the countdown is already on for the decisive moment, the government should not allow paralysis of the state apparatus. The political crisis has already impacted on the dollar vis-a-vis the rupee, and, financial markets too may suffer the consequences of political instability, if it has not already. Hence a quick return to normalcy is of paramount importance. The current imbroglio is over the results of an inconsequential local government election. This should in no way be allowed to intrude into the government's day-to-day affairs.

Its been a month since schools have commenced for the year and my child is still at home without a school. Judges are also transferred periodically, but there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper schooling for our children. My Husband was transferred to the Balapitiya Magistrates Court from January 1. We appealed to the Director, Education and applied for the school in November, but have still not received even an acknowledgement of my appeal, she said.
Therefore,she had lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday and said further measures are being taken regarding the predicament of their child.

Moody's publishes polling results on Asia Pacific credit conditions through 2018
Based on the cumulative polling results, most respondents in Singapore and Hong Kong appear to agree with its base case view that credit conditions across Asia will stay stable in 2018," said Michael Taylor, a Moody's Managing Director and Chief Credit Officer for Asia Pacific.
These were based subsequent to a Moodys Investors Service published polling results survey based on surveys of investors, intermediaries and debt issuers in Asia Pacific, during its Asia Credit Outlook conferences in Hong Kong and in late January 2018. The two events attracted over 300 participants.
"The recent spike in volatility in global markets including across Asia, has not altered the baseline view that credit conditions across Asia will remain stable throughout the year," said Taylor. "We view the recent global stock and bond market movements in the context of improved growth and the inevitable normalization of interest rates in advanced economies. However, they also highlight the risks arising from sudden changes in market expectations of future interest rate paths in not just the US, but also the euro area and Japan."
Moody's conclusions are contained in its just-released report, "Cross-Sector - Asia-Pacific: Heard from the Market: Tighter funding, geopolitics top risks to stable credit outlook".
Moody's forecast for global growth of 3.2% for 2018 is slightly higher than the consensus view of poll respondents. In Hong Kong, 76% of people surveyed expected global growth to register 2.5%-3.0%, while in Singapore, 60.8% of respondents agreed with the same level of growth.
As for downside risks to the stable credit outlook, views in Singapore and Hong Kong diverged. In Singapore, almost half (47.4%) of those surveyed consider unexpected tightening in funding conditions as the top risk, while only 23.2% in Hong Kong agree.
"In our recently published Asia Pacific credit outlook report, we identified three downside risks to our stable credit outlook: an unexpected tightening in funding conditions, geopolitical risk and trade protectionism," says Joy Rankothge, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.
"We do not see a China slowdown as a significant downside risk for 2018, because we expect any slowdown in China's growth rate to be part of a carefully managed process," adds Rankothge.
On the issue of leverage across Asia Pacific, the vast majority (70.9%) of poll participants in Singapore and 74.6% in Hong Kong, say high levels of corporate debt in China represent their top concern. High levels of household debt also proves a concern for 21.5% of Singapore participants and 10.2% of Hong Kong respondents.
"Economy-wide leverage in China will continue to increase in 2018, although at a slower pace than before, as authorities prioritize deleveraging and financial stability," says Rankothge. "In 2017 there was a slight decline in the leverage of the rated portfolio of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs.)
Moody's doesn't expect a significant crystallization of leverage risks in the rated China corporate portfolio in the year ahead."
With Asian financial institutions, poll participants in Hong Kong and Singapore agree with Moody's that the outlook for the sector is stable for 2018.
In relation to the greatest technology-related risk for Asian financial institutions, participants in Hong Kong and Singapore identify cyber security and disruptions to payments and clearing as the two main risks.
Refinancing needs for Moody's-rated corporates remain manageable, and Moody's says that interest coverage will remain healthy, despite monetary policy tightening globally.

Not easy to love
Once many moons ago, I read Miguel Street and liked it. I read A House for Mr. Biswas and liked it. Later on, while in university I read A Bend in the River, In a Free State and Guerrillas. I didnt like them as much as the previous books. But I didnt dislike them either. And, until a few years ago, I confess I held on to the adolescent idea that, like Jane Austin, E.M Foster, George Orwell, V. S Naipaul too, (based on his early novels) was a lovable writer with heartwarming opinions.
I was wrong. The first glimpse I got of the magnitude of my wrong judgment was when I read the interview Isaac Chotiner had with Sir Vidia Naipaul some years ago. The first words the Nobel Laureate said to Chotiner was about the demise of Augustus.
It was calamitous for me. I feel a deep, deep grief. They were sitting in the spacious two-story London flat in Kensington where the author and his second wife, Nadira, lived (when they were not at their Wiltshire country residence). Now that Augustus has died, I want to spend more time in London, Sir Naipaul had continued, slowly picking at the meal Nadira had provided. It is too painful to be [in Wiltshire]. I think of Augustus. He was the sum of my experiences. He had taken on my outlook, my way of living.
He was visibly upset. Chotiner asked him when had Augustus passed away. Naipaul replied, This last September,. It was October 1, and Chotiner quite bravely offered the clich about time healing all wounds. No, no, the previous September 26th, Naipaul explained, sounding deeply wounded. A year ago. The terrible part of it is that people suggest to me that I get a new one, that I invite this one into the home I shared with Augustus. As if he should just be replaced so soon. It shows a lack of understanding.
Augustus is dead. And the writer is grieving over the loss. Whats so strange about that Nothing, except for the fact that Augustus is a cat and Naipaul didnt grieve so much when his first wife, Patrica Hale passed away. She had battled breast cancer  alone. Instead of being by her bedside Naipaul left her for long periods, carrying out serious affairs with other women. Of her death he said, It could be said that I killed her. It could be said. I feel a little bit that way. The day after the cremation, he invited Nadira, a Pakistani journalist, to move into the Wiltshire home he had shared with his wife.
In the eyes of the well known American critic James Wood, Naipaul is The public snob, the grand bastard. Heres how Wood describes his first encounter with Naipaul. A pale woman, his secretary, showed me in to the sitting room of his London flat. Naipaul looked warily at me, offered a hand, and began an hour of scornful correction. I knew nothing, he said, about his birthplace, Trinidad; I possessed the usual liberal sentimentality. It was a plantation society. Did I know anything about his writing He doubted it. The writing life had been desperately hard. But, I said, hadnt his great novel, A House for Mr. Biswas, been acclaimed on its publication Look at the peoples choices for the best books of the sixties, he said.  Biswas is not there. His secretary brought coffee, and retired. Naipaul claimed that he had not even been published in America until the nineteen-seventies, and then the reviews were awfulunlettered, illiterate, ignorant. The phone rang, and kept ringing. I am sorry, Naipaul said in exasperation. One is not well cared for here. Only as the secretary showed me out, and novelist and servant briefly spoke to each other in the hall, did I realize that she was Naipauls wife.
V.S. Naipauls7 Rules ForBeginning Writers
1) Do not write long sentences. A sentence should not have more than ten or twelve words.
2) Each sentence should make a clear statement.It should add to the statement that went before. A good paragraph is a series of clear, linked statements.
3) Do not use big words. If your computer tells you that your average word is more than five letters long, there is something wrong. The use of small words compels you to think about what you are writing. Even difficult ideas can be broken down into small words.
4) Never use words whose meaning you are not sure of. If you break this rule you should look for other work.
5) The beginner should avoid using adjectives, except those of colour, size and number. Use as few adverbs as possible.
6) Avoid the abstract. Always go for the concrete.
7) Every day, for six months at least, practise writing in this way. Small words; short, clear, concrete sentences. It may be awkward, but its training you in the use of language. It may even be getting rid of the bad language habits you picked up at the university. You may go beyond these rules after you have thoroughly understood and mastered them.
Adding more fuel to the fire, Naipaul has also dismissed E. M. Forster as an odious fraud and A Passage to India a pretense and utter rubbish. In 2011 in an interview at the Royal Geographic Society when asked if he considered any woman writer his literary match he replied: I dont think so. He added, I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me. He said this was because of womens sentimentality, the narrow view of the world. And inevitably for a woman, she is not a complete master of a house, so that comes over in her writing too.
No doubt, if a vote were conducted to pick the grumpiest old man of the literary world, V.S. Naipaul would be odds-on favourite to win. Yet, the very irritableness that some see as smug disdain others applaud as refreshing honesty.
Wood believes this is because there are two sides to Naipaul. A hard side and a softer one. These two sides could be called the Wounder and the Wounded. The Wounder is by now well knownthe source of fascinated hatred in the literary world and post-colonial academic studies. He disdains the country he came from: I was born there, yes. I thought it was a mistake.When he won the Nobel Prize, in 2001, he said it was a great tribute to both England, my home, and India, the home of my ancestors. Asked why he had omitted Trinidad, he said that he feared it would encumber the tribute. He is socially successful but deliberately friendless: At school I had only admirers; I had no friends.
The Wounded Naipaul, says Wood, is the writer who returns obsessively to the struggle, shame, and impoverished fragility of his early life in Trinidad; to the unlikely journey he made from the colonial rim of the British Empire to its metropolitan center; and to the precariousness, as he sees it, of his long life in Englanda stranger here, with the nerves of the stranger, as he puts it in The Enigma of Arrival (1987). Again and again, his sense of aggrieved encirclement expands to encompass others, and he manages, with neither vanity nor condescension, to blend his woundedness with theirs: the empire of one is colonized by his characters. They range from the major to the minor, from the educated to the almost illiterate, from the real to the fictional, but they are united by their homelessness.
Born on August 17, 1932 in Chaguanas, Trinidad, where his ancestors had emigrated from Indiahis maternal grandfather, at the turn of the century, had traveled from that country as an indentured servant, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul is yet another migrant with no firm roots. In his essay Prologue to an Autobiography from Finding the Center, he writes: Half a writers work . . . is the discovery of his subject. And a problem for me was that my life had been varied, full of upheavals and moves: from grandmothers Hindu house in the country, still close to the rituals and social ways of village India; to Port of Spain, the negro, and G.I. life of its streets, the other, ordered life of my colonial English school, which is called Queens Royal College, and then Oxford, London and the freelances room at the BBC. Trying to make a beginning as a writer, I didnt know where to focus.
After two failed attempts at novels and three months before his twenty-third birthday, Naipaul found his start in the childhood memory of a neighbor in Port of Spain. The memory provided the first sentence for Miguel Street, which he wrote over six weeks in 1955 in the BBC freelancers room, where he was working part-time editing and presenting a literary program for the Caribbean Service. The book would not be published until 1959, after the success of The Mystic Masseur(1957), which received the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize and The Suffrage of Elvira(1958), which was awarded the Somerset Maugham Award. A House of Mr. Biswas was published in 1961, and in 1971 Naipaul received the Booker Prize for In a Free State. He received a knighthood in 1990 for his service to literature.
There would have been a time when it would have been easy to sympathize with the Wounded Naipaul. In the letters he sent from Oxford to Trinidad he wrote, I want to come top of my group. I have got to show these people that I can beat them at their own language.
But alas, nowadays he spends so much time being disagreeable and superior, it is hard to remember his woundedness. Nowadays, sadly, Vidia Naipaul does not do nice.

NZ cricket legend Bevan Congdon dead at 79
Bevan Congdon, who captained New Zealand to their first Test win over Australia in 1974, has died a day short of his 80th birthday, Cricket New Zealand said.
Congdon, a captain in 17 Tests, had been in declining health for some time.
In total, Congdon played 61 Tests in a 13-year career, scoring 3,448 runs at an average of 32.22 with seven centuries. He also took 59 wickets. He played in 11 one-day internationals, including New Zealands first in the format in 1973 against Pakistan. His average of 56.33 in ODIs is still the best for a New Zealand batsman with a minimum of 10 innings. While he led New Zealand to only one Test victory, it was a momentous five-wicket win over Australia in Christchurch in 1974.
He was also a member of the New Zealand team that beat England in a test for the first time in 1978 at Wellington. Congdons 176 against England at Trent Bridge in 1976 was his most famous Test innings. He was struck in the face by England fast bowler John Snow when he was on 24 but went on to lead New Zealand to the brink of a remarkable win. New Zealand reached 440, chasing 479 to win.
Bevan was at the center of the New Zealand team at a time it started gaining attention on the international cricket scene for all the right reasons, NZC chief executive David White said. Hes left a real legacy in terms of putting New Zealand cricket on the map.

One for womanhood!
A new time has dawned upon Sri Lanka; the time to make a difference. Instead of focusing solely on their own lives and spending their time with friends, more youngsters are going out to create an impact on the world.

Yes I definitely do. And as a Sri Attorney-at-Law Naushalya Manjari Rajapaksha is a youth who has many credentials to her name at a young age. The 24 year old past pupil of Musaeus College, Colombo, was the former Official Youth Delegate of Sri Lanka to the 70th United Nations General Assembly 2015. She was the invited Youth Delegate from Sri Lanka to represent the World Federation of United Nations Associates (WFUNA) for the Inaugural United Nations Forum on Human rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland in November 2016. She was also a Social Change Entrepreneur at the United Nations Population Fund Country Office from 2014 to 2015.
Naushalya was a delegate to the Children and Youth Forum of the United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai, Japan, in March 2015 and to The South Asian Political Youth Leaders Study Tour in China in August, 2014. She was also a member of the International Youth Task Force of the World Conference on Youth Sri Lanka held in May, 2014.
Meeting President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sri Lankan Mission to the United Nations in New York with the other youth delegate
A social change maker who plays a leading role in helping the Sri Lankan Government in implementing the UN Convention against Torture and other significant Human Rights, Naushalya also focuses on venturing into the uncharted gaps in the territories of the medico-legal system in Sri Lanka which concerns the rights of both men and women. She has been awarded as an Honorable Nominee for the Best delegate in the Youth Model United Nations Conference (General Committee one: Delegate of India) Representing Royal Institute Colombo in December 2011.
Ever since school days I was into voluntary work. Rather than making a change I was interested in making sustainable change. I worked towards making the impact of my work last for many years, Naushalya explained.
Taking oaths as a 23 year old Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka
She considers humbleness as her greatest achievement. Though she is employed as a Junior Counsel to Anuja Premarathne PC to acquire knowledge and experience in the field of the Criminal Law System and procedures, Naushalya notes that her journey has not been a bed of roses.
Back then I was always told that this is not a womans profession. A female lawyer should stick to a corporate firm and to take part in panel discussions. As a criminal lawyer I encounter challenges and break barriers every day, she said.
Though the womens representation has been increased in Provincial Councils she questions on who decided to include 25 percent quota for women at the Local Government elections.
It is a good first step though to push women into the forefront. Women are always laidback and do not like to come out into the public because there is a lot of mudslinging involved in the field. However on the long term this is not the solution. Today it is mostly models, actresses, widows of former MPs or daughters of Ministers who represent the women in the Parliament. There are a lot of educated female professionals around but they do not think of going to Parliament. That thinking pattern and understanding has to be changed, she opined.
She says that she believes that there are two kinds of problems related to youth in Sri Lanka: the kind of problems that we think the youth have and the actual problems.
Before I went to New York to take part in the UN General Assembly I covered all nine provinces in Sri Lanka with the aid of the National Youth Council. I spoke to young people across the country and understood their issues and what they want. The issues which concerned the youth differed in each province. I conducted a UN Youth delegation program across the nation encouraging them to apply for the event because I realized that people are not aware about this amazing opportunity for the youth. Millions are spent on us by the citizens in Sri Lanka to take part in the event. I covered more than 2000 youth by visiting universities, creating awareness and training on capacity building for them to apply for the next UN Youth delegation selection process, Naushalya said. She says that the most important lesson she learnt by taking part in international youth conferences is that Sri Lanka still has a long way to go, knowledge-wise as well as capacity building-wise.
Delivering the national youth statement representing 6.4 million youth at the 70th UNGA
We get knowledge from what we read and what we see. However I have met people who are much younger than us but are far ahead of us in knowledge. This is mainly due to the exposure and opportunities they get. Their policy makers are quite welcoming towards youth contribution, she noted.
She has lately narrowed down her youth empowerment initiatives to empowering young women. She headed the first national research advocacy program on sexual harassment in public transport while she was attached to the United Nations Population Fund in 2014/2015. Titled On the Way the UNFPA published her report.
If I get another chance to engage in such a project I would want to research about the perpetrators: on why and what they do. Our focus is solely on the victims  on why and how they got harassed. We never talk to the perpetrator and question about why they harass us. I think it would be a more lasting sustainable change if we could address the mental issue the perpetrator has to harass women rather than put a board saying which number to call if you get harassed. More than name calling them we need to understand their mentality and address those issues, she stressed.
She notes that the actual problem that young women face today is the language barrier. She says that the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is like another world altogether.
It is sad that we cannot communicate with them properly. A trainer has to convey his or her message through a translator to them even when they take part in a capacity training program. They lose the essence of the process then. Education too needs a big boost as women do not have much avenues open to them. There is a gap in transition from education to work. Somewhere along the line they get trapped. For example a lot of women are topping the batches at Law College. However when you come to courts, it is still a male dominant profession. After passing out the female batch toppers get married, attain motherhood and take up family responsibilities as housewives, she stressed.
Elaborating on the importance of education Naushalya notes that though youth activities matter it is essential to have a good education.
At the National Law Students Conference which she organised and chaired
Invest in yourself too by giving yourself a sound education. Then with experience your words will have weight. Youth not only need to have their voices to be heard but they need their opinions to be taken into consideration, she mused. She says that Sri Lanka still has the concept of Disaster Risk Management while the world focuses on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).
Conducting one of the youth consultation programs held around the island to capture the real issues and solutions of the youth of Sri Lanka
They foresee a disaster coming and get ready for it while we wait till the disaster hits us and then take measurements. The United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction 2015s goal was on gender equality during disaster times. Dry rations are the first things that come to mind when we think of aiding the victims. They do not consider the needs of the women and pregnant women there. Most of our disaster management plans are not gender sensitive, she said.
Naushalyas father, Rohan Rajapaksha, is from the accountant field while her mother, Sriyani Rajapaksa, is from the science sector. Her sister, Kaushalya, is into marketing.
Sri Lanka is a very small country and our key priority is survival. Sri Lanka is known to the world through cricket and tea. However we need to make sure that the world gets to know Sri Lanka in many other ways. One of my ambitions is to be one of the first Sri Lankans to be at the United Nations Committee Against Torture. I want to defend my country against all the human right allegations. I seek that field which Sri Lankan women had not ventured into. Charter into untapped territories. There are so many avenues which we can work on. Do not just try to make a living. Aspire a living, is her message to the youth.

Piramal Glass Ceylon gross profit crosses Rs 1 bn
For the nine months ended Dec 31, 2017 the overall turnover of Piramal Glass Ceylon was on par with the previous years sales of Rs.5 billion mark.
The domestic sale for the period was Rs. 3,375 million as against the previous years Rs. 4,065 million depicting a drop of 17%, whilst the export market showed a growth of 70% from 959 million in the previous year to Rs. 1,627 million as at December 31, 2017.
The domestic sale for the quarter under review was Rs. 1,256 million as against Rs. 1,563 million of the previous year which reflected a 20% drop in sales whilst the exports showed a commendable growth of 75% from Rs. 416 million to Rs. 729 million.
The dip felt in the overall domestic market since the beginning of the year did not recover during the quarter under review. Due to the increase in levies and taxes, the final products are becoming more expensive. This results in a decline in consumer demand which ultimately reflects in the reduction of sales in the food, beverage and liquor segments. Added to this, the impact of extreme weather conditions impacted the sales in the virgin coconut oil and agro chemical segments .
The gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 grew from Rs. 934 million to Rs. 1,039 million by thus crossing the 1 bllion mark. This is an improvement of the GP margin from 18% to 21%. The operating profit too showed a marked improvement of Rs. 595 million as against Rs. 448 million of the previous year.

Popularising the drinking of fresh cows milk and provision of solutions to dairy farmers affected by vagaries of weather and climatic changes is underway, the Ministry said in a press release. The plan also envisaged seven development targets including poverty alleviation provision of a nutritious meal to all, encouraging healthy life, gender equality, sustainable consumption and making a contribution towards the country's economic development, the Ministry said in a press release.

Postscript to a tough contest
The outcome of the much awaited local government elections is now known and analysts are busy providing their interpretation of the results. Overall, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the newly established political party representing the interests of the dissident faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) emerged victorious sweeping the polls in the vast majority of local government institutions.
At last count, the SLPP had won 239 of 340 councils on offer while the United National Party (UNP) won 41 councils. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) together emerged victorious in 10 councils while the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) won 34 councils, mostly in the North and East of the country. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), despite their high profile campaign, failed to gain control of any council.
However, in terms of the popular vote, a somewhat different picture emerges. The SLPP polled 44 per cent of the overall vote while the UNP polled 32 per cent. The SLFP and UPFA together polled 13 per cent. The ITAK polled 3 per cent while the JVP polled 6 per cent of the overall vote.
This was also the first ever election in the country where the first past the post system (applied to wards in each local authority) was combined with the proportional representation (PR) system in deciding the allocation of seats in each local authority. There was a collective sigh of relief that the dreaded preference votes did not operate at this election.
UNP, SLFP and the SLPP
Various interpretations have been provided by analysts trying to decipher the results. The results were surprising in that, while many expected a tough contest between the UNP, SLFP and the SLPP, the scale of the SLPPs margins of victory was not predicted, even by SLPP stalwarts themselves.
It appears that the UNP paid the price for its complacency in the run up to the poll. It rested on its laurels, hoping that the division within the SLFPs ranks would make them an automatic victor. The SLFPs vote was indeed divided but the division was not neatly in the middle: it was heavily skewed in favour of the SLPP. Thus, not only did the SLFP suffer, the UNP did too.
The SLFPs strategy of campaigning on the theme of corruption also boomeranged spectacularly. By making corruption the rallying cry, the SLFP hoped it would alienate voters from the SLPP- as its leaders are embroiled in several ongoing investigations- as well as the UNP- which is implicated in the Central Bank bond sale. If its strategy of driving away voters from the UNP was successful, it came at a price: those driven away from the UNP seem to have flocked to the SLPP and not the SLFP.
Also proving to be a disappointment at the poll was the JVP. With public dissatisfaction high with regard to the major parties, the JVP was expected to make an impact at this election. Yet again, they have proved that catchy slogans and crowds at rallies do not necessarily translate into votes at an election.
Undoubtedly, the big winner was the SLPP. As noted in these columns previously, this was a make or break election for the new party. If the SLPP performed poorly at this election, that would have spelled the end of the Rajapaksa dynasty and the project to resurrect their power base would have been stillborn. However, the SLPP- and the Rajapaksas- have proved that, three years out of office and out of power, they are still a force to reckon with.
State resources
What has gone mostly unnoticed and unappreciated is that the election was conducted with very high standards. There were no serious incidents of election related violence apart from minor skirmishes. More importantly, state resources were not abused in the lead up to the poll. Ironically, this was possible because the government kept its side of the good governance bargain, although its benefactors were the opposition.
At the time of writing, the immediate fallout from the elections is as yet unclear. There is no doubt that new political alliances will take shape, but their contours are not discernible right now. However, some potential political scenarios are worthy of consideration.
Revelling in the afterglow of victory, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa held a media briefing, flanked by his loyalists in the SLPP. There he called for a general election forthwith, stating that the government had lost the mandate to govern. He stated that he was not interested in cobbling together a coalition from within Parliament to become Prime Minister and form a government.
Rajapaksas claim that the government has lost the mandate may ring true to his supporters but stark constitutional realities stand in the way of his demand for a general election- and, as a person who was twice elected as President, he cannot be unaware of those considerations.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution specifically precludes the dissolution of Parliament by the President until after four and a half years, unless Parliament resolves to dissolve itself with a two-thirds majority. In the current scenario where the UNP is the single largest party in Parliament, Rajapaksa will not be able to fashion a two-thirds majority for the purpose of dissolving Parliament. As such, this Parliament will be in office until February 2020, which will be until after the next presidential election which is due in January 2020, the latest.
Joint Opposition (JO) stalwarts have been making similar demands, echoing Rajapaksas sentiments. It was however made clear that the UNP will not yield to such tactics. Deputy Leader of the UNP Sajith Premadasa put it succinctly when he said that although Rajapaksa fell victim to the ploy of calling for early elections, the UNP wouldnt be falling into the same trap.
In the aftermath of the election, there has been frenzied political activity. President Maithripala Sirisena has met with SLFP ministers, the majority of whom have indicated that they would be unwilling to serve in a coalition government with the UNP. This is because they fear that remaining with the UNP will hinder their prospects of re-election at the next general election. Most of them have indicated a preference to realign with the Rajapaksa camp.
Major changes within government
The President reportedly gave a patient hearing to the views of the SLFP ministers and indicated that he will be orchestrating major changes within the government but did not elaborate what these changes would be.
For some SLFP ministers, at least, a return to the Rajapaksa camp cannot be taken for granted. In their absence and in forming the SLPP, Rajapaksa loyalists have taken up positions as electoral organisers for electoral divisions and toiled hard in the opposition while their predecessors in the SLFP were enjoying ministerial perks in the government.
Now, when the SLPP has just won an election, they are not willing to let all that hard work be in vain by simply handing over the reins in the electorate to those returning to the fold from government ranks.
The President was also meeting with UNP seniors to try and work out a way forward. It is understood that the UNP has proposed that it would form a solely UNP government with support from other parties. The UNP has the support of 106 parliamentarians (without counting dissident MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe but including one Sri Lanka Muslim Congress parliamentarian) and needs the support of seven others to form a government.
UNP stalwarts point out that Chandrika Kumaratungas 1994 government was in office for its full six year term with 105 MPs. The additional support for the UNP could come from either ITAK (who would support it on an issue by issue basis) or from SLFP MPs crossing over.
At the time of writing, even leading ministers were uncertain what the eventual political outcome would be but they were confident that a clearer picture would emerge within days rather than weeks. In that sense, the local government elections lived up to its expectation: it became an election that defined the future political direction of the country, at least in the short term.

PUBLIC TO BE A PART OF Royal wedding
Saying they want the British public to take part in their celebrations, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have announced a particularly grand way to open up their May 19 wedding to the world. Kensington Palace has announced that the couple will take part in a carriage procession immediately after their wedding ceremony, which will take place at noon at St. Georges Chapel in Windsor.
In a statement released Sunday, a palace spokesman said, Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle are hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement. They are very much looking forward to the day and to being able to share their celebrations with the public.
The carriage procession will leave Windsor Castle via Castle Hill and proceed along High Street and through Windsor Town, returning to Windsor Castle along the Long Walk. A spokesman said, They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.
The ceremony will take place at noon local time, with the carriage procession scheduled for an hour later, at one pm. It is expected that tens of thousands of well-wishers, royalists, and tourists will turn out for the day, and the couple are keen to show their appreciation.
They are deep in the planning stages now and one of the things they wanted from the outset was to do a carriage tour after the ceremony. It will really add to the whole fairy-tale feel of the day and because everything is happening behind the castle walls, it will be the only real chance for the public to see the couple close up, a source said.
There are also plans for a giant screen to be erected in Windsor Town so that the crowds can watch the ceremony, which is due to be televised. There is also talk of some members of the public being allowed onto the grounds of Windsor Castle.
The blueprint for the wedding is said to be Prince Edwards wedding to Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999, when, in addition to a carriage procession, 8,000 members of the public were invited onto the castle grounds via a ballot system.
Now less than 100 days away, Prince Harry and Meghan Markles wedding is likely to be even more popular, with scores of American tourists coming to the UK for the occasion. Windsor is bracing itself for a huge spike in tourism, with some hotels charging thousands of pounds a night for luxury suites. Many broadcasters who will be covering the event have been priced out of the town and have reserved rooms in the nearby town of Slough three miles away.
As family and friends eagerly await their invitations, many guests have already been informed by the couple that they have made the exclusive guest list. The QueenandCharles, the Prince of Wales, who are paying for the wedding and evening party, are overseeing a reception at St. Georges Hall for the couple and guests from the congregation after the wedding. Prince Charles is hosting an evening reception for the couple and close family and friends later that night.
It will very much be for them and their friends. There is no pressure for them to invite foreign royals, state dignitaries, or V.I.P.s. This is not a state occasion, its a family wedding, says a royal source.
Leading party planners Fait Accompli have apparently been hired to oversee the evening reception, and Meghan is also said to have asked her close friend Millie Mackintosh to help her with the plans. The American actress has apparently chosen her wedding dress designer with the help of her close friend Jessica Mulroney, whose four-year-old daughter, Ivy, has been promised a role as flower girl. The name is being kept under lock and key although Meghan has told friends she wants a glamorous but traditional gown.
Kensington Palace has also confirmed that the Dean of Windsor, the Rt. Rev. David Conner, will conduct the service, and the Most Rev. and Rt. Hon. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, will officiate as the couple makes their marriage vows.

REX awareness seminar by CNCI, Dept of Commerce on February 23
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries, pioneering chamber for industries in the country, has organized an awareness training programme on Registered Exporter System (REX), which will be conducted by the Department of Commerce.
This awareness seminar has been organized by the CNCI in order to give a comprehensive understanding about the new system, which will be conducted by the officials of the Department of Commerce at Mahaweli Centre, on February 23, 2018.
The Department of Commerce is the competent authority in Sri Lanka for issuing Certificates of Origin (CoO) under all FTAs and GSP Schemes. As at date, there are around 3000 Sri Lankan exporters who are benefited from the EU GSP scheme.
In order to claim the EU GSP duty concessions, Certificates of Origins (CoO) or Form A issued by the Department of Commerce should be submitted. Currently, these CoOs are issued manually after verifying the rules of origin.
In January 2017, the EU introduced Registered Exporter System (REX) under the suggested reforms in EU Regulation No 1063/2010 and it is applicable to all EU-GSP beneficiary countries. The effective date of implementing the REX system in Sri Lanka is January 1, 2018 with a transition period ending 31 December 2018.
The REX system is a self- certification of origin of goods. Therefore, instead of the CoO or the Form A issued by the Department of Commerce, the exporter will prepare a Statement on Origin (SoO) on the commercial invoice for each consignment.
The Department of Commerce is vested with the responsibility of registering and monitoring the system. Therefore, it is compulsory for exporters to register with the Department of Commerce to obtain a REX number to be eligible to make a Statement on Origin (SoO).
The REX number is issued after examining the documentations and inspecting the operations of the exporter. The Department of Commerce has already started registering eligible exporters under the REX system.

## Title: SIR DON BARON JAYATILAKA: THE EPOCH MAKER
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, February 15, 2018 - 01:00
SIR DON BARON JAYATILAKA: THE EPOCH MAKER
Continued from yesterday
He presented the first budget of the State Council, thus entering the record books as the first Sri Lankan to do so. During the budget he stated that every child should receive education and that a government elected by the uneducated can be dangerous. Many progressive policies were introduced especially in the fields of irrigation, land development and agricultural development. In 1932 D.B. Jayatilaka was knighted by the King thus entering the record books once again as the first Buddhist to be so honoured.
The second election to the State Council took place in 1936 and D.B. Jayatilaka was elected once again as the member for Kelaniya. His national leadership was repeatedly endorsed when he was reelected to the coveted positions of Minister of Home Affairs, Vice Chairman of State Council and Leader of the State Council. The second world war officially commenced on the third of September 1939 with the entry of German troops to Poland. On the fifth of September 1939 under the able guidance of D.B. Jayatilaka the State Council passed an address to the King pledging support to the prosecution of the war.
This was not only an act of allegiance to the throne but also an expression of solidarity in defence of democracy and basic human values. This bold move which was spearheaded by D.B. Jayatilaka; even though scoffed at by some extremist elements paid rich dividends, for it helped in no small measure to Sri Lanka gaining Independence shortly after the war.
The Japanese air raids over Colombo took place on April 5, 1942. The panic stricken residents of Colombo fled to rural areas. The unloading of ships at the Colombo harbor came to a standstill resulting in a food shortage. D.B. Jayatilaka rose to the occasion, mustered 400 volunteers from Kelaniya electorate and unloaded the food ships. As Minister of Home Affairs and leader of the State Council, D.B. Jayatilaka was responsible for maintaining peace and good order in the country. He lost no time in rationing food, organizing food production, establishing Town Guards and stepping up civil defence. The fact that D.B. Jayatilaka was indeed the one and only uncrowned national leader of the Pre Independence era was reaffirmed when the University of Ceylon at its first convocation held on October 15, 1942 conferred on him the honorary doctorate of laws, LLD.
Final assignment of a National Hero
In 1942, D.B. Jayatilaka was cunningly dispatched from national leadership to near oblivion being appointed as the Resident Representative of Sri Lanka in India with residence in New Delhi. In order to hood-wink the masses in Sri Lanka who loved him, wide publicity was given to the two concocted reasons that compelled the authorities to station him in India. Firstly, that it was necessitated by the acute food shortage in Sri Lanka as a result of war and the need to obtain urgent food supplies from India.
Secondly, that there was an urgent need to find a solution to the simmering issue of the expatriate South Indian labour force in Sri Lanka. Whether this assignment demanded the services of the de facto head of government and the first in line for the post of Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka is a debatable issue. Future historians will be debating as to whether the decision to throw him into the political wilderness was taken in good faith or with an ulterior motive. It could be that D.B. Jayatilaka innocently fell prey to a trap laid by his own fellow ministers; as otherwise there was no need to use an axe to kill a mosquito. Moreover, D.B. Jayatilaka who was 74 years of age at the time was not in the best of health being the victim of malaria. Dr. Nandadeva Wijesekara in his biography of D.B. Jayatilaka has summed up the intrigue and the machinations that had been unleashed to get rid of him as follows. The time was drawing near when the malignant forces were manifesting. Old age seemed to be an obstacle in the path of those who were in too great a hurry.
In February 1944 D.B. Jayatilaka while serving in New Delhi fell ill with a recurrence of malaria. From the early 1930s malaria had plagued him and he suffered from several relapses. In April he went to Mussorie as the heat in New Delhi was unbearable. There, he developed a stomach ailment and a minor heart attack too. He wanted to return to Sri Lanka as soon as possible. The Viceroy of India hurriedly arranged a special plane. He passed away in Bangalore on the 29th of May 1944.
A state funeral was ordered jointly by the civil government and the military authorities. A sea of humanity assembled in Colombo to pay their last respects. Tributes flowed from all parts of the country and all corners of the globe. The premature passing away of the great national hero and the irreplaceable epoch maker was indeed an irreparable loss to the country and more so to its people. A newspaper editor of the day while paying a glowing tribute in his editorial said that no leader had touched the hearts of the people of Sri Lanka at so many points or embodied so authentically the very spirit of Sri Lanka as did Sir D.B. Jayatilaka.
Uniqueness
The uniqueness of Sir D.B. Jayatilaka is indeed legendary. His uniqueness lies in the fact that the qualities and the characteristics which were possessed by him and his singular achievements could not be surpassed or even equalled by any single individual who lived before or after him. This uniqueness reflected the sum total of the values of our peoples cultural heritage. His gentle manner was felt and known by all who met him and spoke to him. He was fearless in action. He planned every detail of his life and work well in advance. He spoke true to his conscience. He feared nothing. He feared nobody. The only things he feared were going against justice, truth and righteousness. His serenity of mind and calm mental peace was legendary. He remained unperturbed and untroubled amidst troubled situations. He had the placid serenity of the cultured mind. He approached human problems with all pervading love. He was wise but did not display his wisdom. He was humble but did not yield to any power. He could walk with Kings without losing the common touch.
Sir D.B. Jayatilaka had a tremendous capacity to remember things. His retentive memory was as good as that of an electronic computer. He had the ability to quote from memory whole passages from classical texts. He was a master of sarcasm, irony and innuendo. He never lost his temper nor did he display any emotions of anger. His personal life was exemplary. He led an unassuming, principled, simple and elegant life. Caring and sharing were natural traits ingrained in him. Humility was the hallmark of his popularity, success and greatness. He was accessible to all and sundry. Even though a man of substantial means, he preferred a simple, frugal and non conspicuous style of living. The money thus saved was generously utilized for worthy causes such as helping the needy, meritorious deeds and rural regeneration. His generosity was prompted by sympathy with the suffering humanity. He established several social welfare organizations. As a final act of dana he bequeathed to the public of Sri Lanka the entirety of his estate which he owned at the time of his death.
The combination of Eastern and Western systems of education provided him with the knowledge, training and discipline unrivalled by anyone of his time. That by itself made him unique. His knowledge of Sri Lanka history, Buddhism and oriental languages together with the study of European history and western classics enabled him to command a wealth of material for his writings, speeches and consideration of national problems. In his day there was no greater or better Buddhist disciple (Upasaka) than Sir D.B. Jayatilaka. He travelled abroad to propagate and deliver lectures on Buddhism spending his own money.
He started Dhamma schools throughout the island. He prepared and published a graduated series of Dhamma books for systematic teaching. Today it is difficult to find a boy or a girl or a man or a woman who has not attended Dhamma school.
It has been said that there was no greater servant of the people and their cause than Sir D.B. Jayatilaka. For well nigh thirty years she had suffered for the sake of the people and the country and sometimes in jail too for vindicating the rights and fulfilling the aspirations of his countrymen.
Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was no extremist, nor was he a communalist. He always followed the middle path expounded by the Buddha. He was not racial minded nor was he religious minded. He fought for the restoration of the rightful place for the Sinhalese as well as for the Buddhists. At the same time he respected all races and religions equally. Because of this, the minorities treated D.B. Jayatilaka with utmost respect and confidence. His name was proposed and seconded by minority State Councilors for the high post of Vice Chairman of the State Council. When Tamil members were abandoning the National League he made every endeavour to win them over.
In the political sphere the crowning glory of all his struggles and achievements was bringing the country to the brink of freedom and independence. If not for Sir D.B. Jayatilakas sustained struggle for progressive political reforms the attainment of freedom could have cost dearer in blood and tears. Tamils and other minorities had confidence in him and associated with him loyally. He proceeded on the basis of many races and many religions but one people and one nation. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka, the epoch maker was a unique character indeed. Without him Sri Lankas pre-Independence history may not have been so rosy nor so smooth.

From  skin to scalp
When those pesky white flakes become a source of embarrassment and agony, then it is time for you to do something about it. Dandruff is a vexing problem that has managed to unite over half the adult population across the world - beyond gender, age and race. The good news is that it can be treated naturally and effectively. So go ahead, read on to find the remedy that best suits your hair.
What is dandruff
Dandruff is caused when the skin isnt exfoliating properly. Dead skin gets stuck on the scalp and begins to flake and itch.
Dandruff is the common name for seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp - a condition that causes red, flaky and itchy skin as a result of too much yeast that is present on oily areas of the skin. The only difference is that dandruff is restricted to the scalp, while seborrheic dermatitis can affect other areas of the body.
The most common causes of dandruff 
Dandruff can have
several causes, including:
* Irritated, oily skin (seborrheic dermatitis): This condition, one of the most frequent causes of dandruff, is marked by red, greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales. Seborrheic dermatitis may affect your scalp and other areas rich in oil glands, such as your eyebrows, the sides of your nose and the backs of your ears, your breastbone (sternum), your groin area, and sometimes your armpits.
* Not shampooing often enough: If you don't regularly wash your hair, oils and skin cells from your scalp can build up, causing dandruff.
* A yeast-like fungus (malassezia): Malassezia lives on the scalps of most adults. But, for some, it irritates the scalp and can cause more skin cells to grow. The extra skin cells die and fall off, making them appear white and flaky in your hair or on your clothes. Why malassezia irritates some scalps isn't a known fact.
* Dry skin: Flakes from dry skin are generally smaller and less oily than those from other causes of dandruff. Redness or inflammation is unlikely. You'll probably have dry skin on other parts of the body, such as your legs and arms, too.
* Sensitivity to hair care products (contact dermatitis): Sometimes sensitivities to certain ingredients in hair care products or hair dyes can cause a red, itchy, and scaly scalp.
Factors that might put you at risk 
Almost anyone can have dandruff,
but certain factors can make you more susceptible:
* Age: Dandruff usually begins in young adulthood and continues through middle age. That doesn't mean older adults don't get dandruff. For some people, the problem can be life long.
* Being male: Since more men have dandruff, some researchers think male hormones may play a role in putting you at risk on getting dandruff.
* Oily hair and scalp: Malassezia feeds on oils in your scalp. For that reason, having excessively oily skin and hair makes you more prone to dandruff.
* Certain illnesses: For reasons that aren't clear, adults with neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, are more likely to develop seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. So are people with HIV infection, or those who have compromised immune systems from other conditions.
Is dandruff genetic 
While many hair issues such as graying, thinning, or balding can be caused by your genetics, thankfully dandruff isn't one of them. This flaky skin on your scalp is the result of malassezia, a yeast-like fungus that happens to be found on the scalps of many healthy individuals.
Is dandruff contagious 
Dandruff is not contagious or infectious. However, dandruff may get worse if certain yeasts and/or fungi that normally occur in small numbers on the scalp are increased in numbers.
The increase in these microbes can contribute to increased flaking in dandruff. Since most of these organisms are already present on the skin, they are not considered to be contagious causes of dandruff.

Muslim Council calls for calm, never meant to go public:
SLPP says incidents of violence against Muslims, act of conspiracy
Prof. G.L.Peiris responding to allegations ofattacks on Muslim-owned properties orchestrated by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) members said that such incidents should reported to the police and that the perpetrators were in the government.
Last week, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka headed by N.M.Ameen in a letter addressed to Prof. G.L.Peiris, cited that some of SLPP cadres were suspected of causing violence against some Muslims in Uguraspitiya in Kandy, Veyangalle in Agalawatte and kalutara on the assumption that Muslims in these areas did not support the SLPP.
We never released the letter to the media nor did we want to go public with it, our intention in sending a letter to Prof. Peiris was to bring this to his notice since we feared that these incidents may spread, Muslim Council President N.M.Ameen told the Daily News. We even brought this to the notice of Basil Rajapaksa who assured us he would look into the matter.

Sri Lanka team studded with three Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketers
Sri Lanka national teams, over the past four decades, had the services of at least a couple of Observer Schoolboy Cricketer main award winners.
When Sri Lanka emerged world champions in 1996, beating Australia by seven wickets in the final, there were six Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners in that invincible team  captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Asanka Gurusinha, Roshan Mahanama, Kumar Dharmasena, Muttiah Muralitharan and Sanath Jayasuriya, who was adjudged the man of the series.
There is no exception this time around as the current Sri Lanka national team is studded with three former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main award winners in Dinesh Chandimal (2009 winner), Niroshan Dickwella (2012) and Kusal Mendis (2013).
Having made it to the Sri Lanka team just months after their crowning glory, the trio have become vital ingredients of the national team, cementing their places in double quick time.
Sri Lanka Test captain Chandimal is the most experienced of the three, winning the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2009 when he was representing Ananda College, Colombo. Former Trinity skipper, Dickwella won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012. Kusal Mendis, who led Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa with distinction, was adjudged Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013. Months later, he was chosen to captain Sri Lanka Under-19 team to Bangladesh in 2013.
Twenty-year-old Chandimal has represented Sri Lanka in 46 Tests to aggregate 3,413 runs with an attractive average of 43.75, cracking 10 centuries and 16 fifties that included a career best knock of 164. In 139 ODIs, Chandimal has aggregated 3,433 runs with an average of 32.69. He has scored four ODI centuries and 21 fifties with a career best knock of 111.
Following the footsteps of most other past recipients of the prestigious title, Chandimal made his Sri Lanka debut just months after he was crowned the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2009. He did not get an opportunity for a long innings - made an unbeaten 10 on his ODI debut for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on June 1, 2010, when the visitors had a nine-wicket victory.
Chandimal is one of the most technically accomplished batsman in the Sri Lanka team who is capable of hitting the ball to all corners of the ground with a wide range strokes. Ever since his Sri Lanka debut, he has shown maturity at the crease with a good temperament to build and pace an innings.
Dickwella, one of the most successful Trinity captains and a reliable top order batsman, signaled his entry to the big league by winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title six years ago  having scored over 1,000 runs in the previous season. He is an attacking left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman. Dickwella, who turns 25 on June 23, has been particularly impressive in limited-overs cricket, ever since he basted an explosive 104 off 91 balls in the final of the Inter-Provincial One-Day Tournament in 2013.
Just months after winning the main title at the Mega Show, Dickwella was selected to represent Sri Lanka A in its tour of England in 2013. Since then, he has proved his class both as a top order batsman and safe hands behind stumps. Having made his Sri Lanka debut in 2014 against India in Ranchi, Dickwella has represented Sri Lanka in 36 ODIs to aggregate 1,074 runs with two centuries and five half tons with a career best ODI innings of 116.
Dickwella is just ten runs short of reaching the milestone of 1,000 Test runs after figuring in 16 matches, producing eight half centuries that includes a career best innings of 83.
In a recent interview, the Trinity Lion has said that winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a great source of encouragement. Winning the award was a great encouragement for me. It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for four decades.
This has produced a bunch of some great cricketers in the All Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients are doing well in their chosen professions, be in cricket or otherwise. My best wishes for a successful run of the contest in future, Dickwella was quoted as saying.
Mendis, who had scored many match-winning innings for Prince of Wales before he was adjudged the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013, too has shown good form with the willow. Even before he had stepped into the national team, his aggressive batting had earned him a large following.
As a safe wicketkeeper and dependable right-hand batsman with an attacking bent, Mendis has often let his willow to do the talking. Just months after winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title five years ago, he was appointed Sri Lankas under-19 captain for the Youth World Cup.
He made his Sri Lanka debut with a blistering half century  scoring 51 off 59 balls with eight boundaries in Sri Lankas first ODI against Ireland in Dublin on June 16, 2016. Since then, Mendis has figured in 44 ODIs for Sri Lanka has scored 1,239 runs for an average of 30.97. He has one century and 11 fifties to his credit with a career best knock of 102.
Representing Sri Lanka in 24 Tests, Mendis has aggregated 1,712 runs with four centuries and five fifties. He was the top scorer for Sri Lanka in the first innings in the recent second Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka. His brave 68 off 98 balls mainly helped Sri Lanka to take a vital first innings lead, which eventually won the match for them and with it the two-Test series.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest.
Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
The 40th edition of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest is scheduled to be held in June. Incidentally, this will be the 11th consecutive year that the SLT Mobitel will be sponsoring the Mega Show, which has a rich history of producing legendary cricketers, including Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan and the Chief ICC Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle.

Sri Lankan family allowed to stay in Queenstown

A Sri Lankan family who won the support of the Queenstown community in their fight against deportation have been given a reprieve.
They will be allowed to stay in New Zealand for another year.
Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker has been supporting the family, Dinesha Amarasinghe, Sam Wijerathne and their three boys Senath, Subath and Binath. He said the Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) ruled they could stay in New Zealand for the next year on humanitarian grounds, while their residence application was assessed.
"I called Dinesha and Sam this morning  they were both very emotional and so was I.
"Dinesha and Sam have worked incredibly hard to support their children and give them a bright future in New Zealand and this is the outcome they deserve," Walker said.
The family has lived in New Zealand for eight years but faced deportation after Dinesha's application for a work visa renewal was declined due to health issues. Their residency application, submitted in 2013, is on hold.
More than 400 people in the Queenstown community marched in November to support the family.
"It was incredibly humbling to see the way people came together to show compassion and an outpouring of love for a family that they respect and we want as part of the Queenstown community," Walker said.
"The Wijerathne family are respected members of the Queenstown community and an example of how migrant workers living, working, and contributing to our communities in positive ways are so valuable to New Zealand, and especially communities like Queenstown and Te Anau."
There was still a lot to do however.
"While today's result is absolutely fantastic, the solution is only temporary and the family still need to seek residency.

The national Carrier, Srilankan Airlines Colombo-Melbourne direct flight has reversed the trend of declining passenger traffic into Sri Lanka.
Despite Australia being home to a large Sri Lankan Diaspora and student community, passenger arrivals into Sri Lanka have been on the decline in 2017, one of the prime reasons being the lack of direct flights from Colombo to Australia.

System failure caused poll results delay: Deshapriya
A failure in the computer software system used to tally election results caused the delay in issuing official results at last Saturdays election, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
Deshapriya said he takes full responsibility for the delay. The Commission had promised to officially release results by 8 pm on Saturday, but the first results only rolled in by 12 am on Sunday.
The software this year had been designed by the Kelaniya Universitys IT faculty under Prof. Gamini Wijeratne.
The software was designed well but on February 9, we found that even if a single data has not been entered properly, we would not be able to get the other results from the system.We got Manthai East first and when got Ambalangoda Municipal Council, we saw that what we had was not tallying with the results in the software. This was because the postal voting numbers had not been entered,, explained Deshapriya addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat.
This had resulted in the Commission having to manually type in all data and tally them in their own computers, before releasing to the public, four hours later than expected.
Since 1988, the Commission has worked with the Colombo University IT faculty to prepare election results. In 2011, the University worked on one section and the remaining was done by the officers of the Secretariat and Lanka Internet. During the 2010 Presidential and Parliamentary elections, they went back to the Colombo University. But that year there were many allegations cast on the manner in which the results were computed, We however didnt have problems with it, Deshapriya said.
In 2015, the Secretariat once again worked with the Colombo University but this year, their main officers were not available to work with the Commission, We worked with three main officers at the University but one of them passed away, another left to another organisation and the other said he would not be able to work on it.
Thus they chose the Kelaniya University and despite questions over why this programme was not thoroughly tested for all possible scenarios, the Chairman stressed that the university or faculty were not be blamed for the failure in the system.
Most people knew the results in their wards by 6.30 pm anyway and by 12 pm all knew most results.The delay only affected media institutions broadcasting the results, he added.
He further explained that if they had released results ward wise, they would have finished the job by 2 am Sunday.

Vice President Wholesale Banking of Union Bank, Hiranthi De Silva said, Cash management services are evolving rapidly with the aid of technology and many businesses aren't still taking advantage of these facilities to ease their burdens of collecting, depositing and disbursing funds. Also, some businesses don't monitor for cheque frauds or unauthorised transactions, which could be a costly oversight if an incident were to occur. Inefficiencies like these that cost businesses both time and money, could be completely avoided with an electronically managed process. Union Bank Biz Direct is one such groundbreaking cash management solution which would change the way businesses manage their cash flows by adding a layer of security while boosting efficiencies by a few notches.

U.S. teachers deportation postponed mid-flight
US: The fate of a foreign-born teacher was in limbo on Tuesday after his deportation from the United States was temporarily stopped while his flight was en route to his native Bangladesh.
Syed Ahmed Jamal, a chemistry teacher based in Lawrence, Kansas, was taken off the flight during a layover in Hawaii -- the result of a dizzying chain of events that culminated in a last-minute stay of his deportation. Not much new development today. Syed is still in the Honolulu Federal Detention Center, Jamals attorney Rekha Sharma-Crawford said on Tuesday.
A father of three US citizen children and a beloved member of his community, Jamals case has led to a massive outpouring of support from friends, neighbors and critics of US President Donald Trumps immigration policies.
Jamal, 55, has lived in the United States for 30 years, overstaying his second visa in 2011.
Without a relatively speedy path to citizenship, he had been granted a commonly-employed administrative delay that allowed him to remain in the country and legally work. But immigration authorities could deport him at any time.
He suddenly was arrested three weeks ago while taking his daughter to school.
An immigration judge issued a stay of his deportation last week, but lifted the order Monday. In response, immigration authorities put Jamal on a flight to Bangladesh.
Then, an immigration appeals court granted another stay mid-flight, and Jamal was kept on US soil during a layover in Hawaii.
We are awaiting an update from his case worker on what the decision is with the new stay in place, if he will be moved or not and, if so, where, Sharma-Crawford said.
Jamals supporters emphasize that he has committed no crimes during the time he has lived in the United States.
They say his case is an example of how the recent US immigration crackdown has swept up law-abiding immigrants, despite Trumps initial promise that deportations would target dangerous criminals.
Is the goal to rip a dad apart from the family of US-born citizens Jamals brother Syed Hussein Jamal asked at a news conference late Monday.
Any decent human being would not say Yes, that is the right thing to do.
Hundreds of people have written letters urging immigration officials to halt Jamals deportation. - AFP

Zero tolerance for corruption
According to newspaper reports, the PRECIFAC (Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges) has said that a conceptual change is needed to tackle corruption in the country. It has further stated that acts of bribery and corruption in the country have become normalised in the eyes of the public, thus hindering eradication of these evils from society.
The Commission has also stated that neither a new institution nor large amounts of money is needed to launch an effective anti-corruption drive that would impress upon the public, but a sincere effort is needed to awaken them to the dangers of corruption.
The Commission is quite correct in their comments.
Wide spectrum
We have to agree that corruption in our country is spanning a wide spectrum, ranging from petty to large-scale. It is happening in the political, economic and administrative sectors particularly in public domains. For example, the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) which ranks countries according to the perceived level of public sector corruption has positioned Sri Lanka in 95th position out of 176 countries with a poor score of 36.
The problem with corruption is that once it enters inside the system, it tends to stick there thus making it quite difficult for removal. The reason why corruption is a sticky problem is that none of the players have reasons to change their strategy (to pay or demand bribes). This is so, even when some of them realise what they are doing is morally wrong and highly unethical.
These hesitant players have no incentive to refrain from corrupt practices because, they believe, even if they as individuals start behaving ethically, nothing will change as long as most of their colleagues do not change their behaviour. In such a situation, collective action for the common good is difficult to establish, as long as the majority of the players act to maximize their expected gains.
Lack of transparency and accountability based on the rule of law and democratic values on the part of public officials is the major cause of corruption. Without an environment of openness in government transactions  including independent institutions, vigorous parliamentary oversight, and media attention  politicians and officials who control access to public benefits tend to impose costs on citizens seeking these benefits. And without transparency, there will be little risk to politicians and public officials who are tempted to use their positions for private gain.
Much of the successful experiences on anti-corruption programmes in other countries focus on strategies of increasing the costs and reducing to benefits of corrupt activity. Clearly, this is an essential pillar in an anti-corruption and integrity-building programme: it means, there should be disincentives for unethical behaviour and vice versa.
The current approach as practised in Sri Lanka focusses on reducing corruption through making corruptive behaviour illegal and punishable. However, this approach is costly as it requires extensive surveillance to be effective. Moreover, elaborate judicial procedures might well be needed to protect civil rights and control possible abuse on the part of accusers and those doing the surveillance.
Experiences
When we study the experiences of Singapore and Hong Kong, we realise that corruption can be successfully fought. What we need is the presence of strong and determined political leaders. They can successfully fight corruption if they are determined to do so.
One problem, however, is that both these well-known success stories also come with the theory that democracy is not the best cure against corruption. Neither country was a democracy, in the real sense, when their successful campaigns against corruption were launched. Instead, it was autocratic leaders who were isolated from public pressure and opinions that managed to install effective measures against corruption.
In fact, experiences reveal that democracy seems to be a straight line with curves and bends related to the level of corruption. For example, some of the worst cases of corruption have appeared in newly democratized countries, such as Peru under its former president Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000)
Despite the huge efforts made by many developing democratic countries to curb corruption during the last three decades, there seem to be very few success stories. The reason may be that while leaders do have the necessary means for launching successful policies against corruption, they usually have no incentives to do so for the simple reason that they are often the ones who stand to gain most from a corrupt system.
As a country faced with the task of addressing systemic corruption, we need to ask ourselves two principal questions. First, what types of structural reforms are necessary in order to reduce corruption Common suggestions are to create new or to change existing legal institutions in order to alter incentive structures for preventing corruption.
Secondly, which types of processes are likely to be successful for enacting such reforms
What the success stories from Montenegro, Philippines, Chile, Haiti, Serbia, Sierra Leone and Thailand tell us is that that instead of focusing heavily on regulations and punishment, the fight against corruption should relate more to positive incentives.
This approach recognizes the many non-monetary and intrinsic motivations of officials and employees and honours their role for advancing common goals. Once these motivations are understood and introduced, it might be possible to influence behaviour with prevention of corruption and fostering values within an organisation.
There is a large body of literature that reveals how corruption may result from negative incentives. Price or quantity restrictions may produce artificial shortages, where bribery serves as a market clearing device. Import quotas produce an excess supply of export goods and limited import licenses may be handed out in exchange for bribes
There is consensus that anti-corruption efforts should identify such dismal distortions and try to avoid them, where possible. But apart from such prescriptions, it appears difficult to use monetary incentives to induce integrity. Paying someone a bonus for his or her honesty is impossible to implement. Monetary incentives can only be given for a measurable economic surplus. But there is no yardstick that can measure honesty and the remuneration that it deserves.
Of course, there are non-financial incentives such as benchmarking, preference for promotion and transfer, preference for special assignments, training, certificates and other forms of recognition etc. Applying bon-financial incentives can have an amplifying effect on morals of the people, as for example, public recognition or internal status increases the motivational effect.
The scholars also propose training methods, aimed at coding desired behaviour. These trainings can help to communicate more clearly the conflicts of interest that are unique to specific sectors. Furthermore, ethical training can help to develop an atmosphere of transparency and stewardship among the public employees.
Honest leadership
But incentives alone will hardly ever be sufficient to outbid corruption.Regulations and incentives are both needed in anti-corruption efforts. Good incentives need the regulations to become embedded and to serve as benchmarks for behaviour. In turn, regulations without incentives may backfire.
Regulations and incentives require an honest political leadership that can successfully contain corruption among politicians and public servants.
But fostering integrity among different political levels would be difficult. Political leadership must limit self-seeking among their own ranks.
At the same time, an exceptionally high level of transparency will contribute to holding public officers accountable. This system provides a clear motivation for bottom-up approaches to anti-corruption.
On the part of the citizens, what is needed today is the courage to speak out, courage to unite against wrongs, courage to question the wrongs, courage to take on the corrupt, and courage to ostracise and expose the anti-socials.
