Granting permission to demolish galle Fort structure
Archaeology Commissioner  General provisionally released
Galle Chief Magistrate Nishantha A. Peiris yesterday ordered to provisionally release the Commissioner General of Archeology P.B. Mandawala after he appeared before the Magistrates Court yesterday to make his submissions over the issue of giving instructions to the Galle office of the Archaeology Department directing it not to proceed with the legal action initiated against a resident of the Galle Fort who was alleged to have committed the offence of carrying out repairs on a house with archaeological value located in the Galle World Heritage Site without prior approval of the relevant authority.
Delivering his order, the Magistrate further directed the Commissioner General to appear in court in the event of receiving court notice to do so.

An official of the Galle office of the Archaeology Department had complained to the Police Archaeology Protection Unit against a person of Leyn Baan Street of Galle Fort for allegedly carrying out repairs on a residential place with archaeological value without approval of the Archaeological authorities according to which the special police unit had initiated legal action against the person.
Subsequently, the Archaeology Commissioner General had reportedly directed the Southern Province Assistant Archaeology Director in writing not to proceed with the litigation against the respective respondent.
As per instruction from the Archaeology Commissioner General, Southern Province Assistant Director of Archaeology Wasantha Alahakoon had in turn directed Police Archaeology Protection Unit to withdraw the litigation process initiated with regard to the respondent.
Nevertheless, the Police Archaeology Protection Unit making further submission in the court pleaded with the Magistrate to issue notice to the Archaeology Commissioner General to make his submissions over the letter issued to the Southern Province Assistant Director of Archaeology.
Accordingly, the Galle Chief Magistrate had ordered to issue notice on the Commissioner General and to arrest the respondent for alleged illegal constructions.

Badminton in turmoil as secretary, treasurer resign
The secretary general Mohan Wjeyathilaka and treasurer Mangala Gamage of the Sri Lanka Badminton Association have resigned from their respective posts officials close to the association told the Daily News.
Former Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara had issued an extraordinary gazette suspending the registration of Sri Lanka Badminton Association, the national association for badminton and further ordered that the election be convened and held to elect new office bearers to the SLBA for 2017.
After the gazette order the world governing body of badminton (BWF) banned them. Later Ministry and Association officials held diplomatic discussions with BWF and had the ban lifted after agreeing to conduct proper elections.
BWF have permitted them to set up an interim committee until proper elections are held for Sri Lanka Badminton Association (SLBA). The interim committee comprised Nishantha Jayasinghe, Clarence Homer, Mangala Gamage, Rohan de Silva and a member appointed by the Director General of the Department of Sports Development.
Clarence Homer and Rohan de Silva resigned a few months before due to some internal issue and later Mohan Wjeyathilaka and Mangala Gamage were appointed - now they too have tendered their resignation.
Officials also revealed that there is huge political interference in the current committee and they are not considering the badminton development. The appointed committee is unable to work independently to carry out their work at SLBA.
Mohan Wijeyathilaka has mentioned in his resignation letter that he accepted the position with the intention that elections to the Sri Lanka Badminton Association would held as soon as possible and the administration of the SLBA handed over to the duly elected office bearers, but he finds that it is not a possibility at the moment.
The decision to resign has been taken to ensure the continuity of badminton in Sri Lanka as well as to ensure that the BWF would not deem the Sports Minister to abrogate any undertakings that had been purportedly given by the previous Minister to BWF, in their meeting in Dubai, Wijeyathilaka stated in the letter.
Officials further said BWF refused to accept Wijeyathilakas appointment as secretary, until, Nishantha Jayasinghe the president of the IC completed the required form informing the BWF of Wijeyathilakas appointment as secretary.
The SLBA is in a risky position of being suspended due to these issues, Wijeyathilaka stated.

Balan on playing  NTRs wife  in biopic of  Telugu actor








Vidya Balan has cemented her position as one of the most promising and versatile actors in India. With a National Award and an array of Best Actress trophies for her performances in films like Paa, Ishqiya, The Dirty Picture, Kahaani and Tumhari Sulu, Balan is undoubtedly a delight for directors to work with. It is indeed her acting prowess that has earned her a special role in the upcoming NTR biopic, where she plays the superstars wife.
Speaking to Mumbai Mirror, the powerhouse performer revealed what it feels to play a real person onscreen, that too someone who is not that well known. Basavatarakam was known for just being NTRs wife and much has not been documented of her life on the public platform. She was the daughter of one of NTRs maternal uncles. NTR married her when he was 20 years old.
People knew of her but they didnt know her and that is interesting for me as an actor. Its a biopic on NTR and while Basavatarakam is not NTR, she is extremely integral to his story and thats why Im doing this film. Im looking forward to the experience.
While she was offered a bevy of biopics in the recent times, it was this film on NTRs life that she gave a nod to. She told Mirror that it was rather an instinctive decision for her and that she does not know much about how well it is going to shape up.
Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was one of the biggest superstars in south India. From being an actor, producer, editor and director to a successful politician, serving as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, the life arc of NTR is a formidable feat to capture on celluloid. His sixth son, Nandamuri Balakrishna, will essay his role on screen. The film will be helmed by Krish Jagarlamudi. Mumbai Mirror

A banquet overflowing  with grace
The Holy Eucharist is the most awe inspiring, exalted and poignant enactment of the Lord Jesus Christs sacrifice nearly 2,000 years back. Christ instituted the Holy Eucharist at the Last Supper, the night before He died.
Billions of Catholics simulate this journey while kneeling in church and participating in the Holy Mass. It is a beautiful ritual where in a devoted congregation of believers join the ordained priest of the church to bring back memories of the Redeemer from his birth up to his glorious resurrection. Here, we watch the noble priest with lots of devotion when he changes the bread and wine into the body and blood of our divine crucified victim. For us believers it is the mystery of transubstantiation!
Holy Mass possesses that enigmatic miracle that can heal our body and mind and our soul. In our own motherland, more than 2000 masses are said daily. The celebrant causes us to join him in recalling lovely memories form the birth of our Jesus, as said in our prayer Gloria. The most important chapter during Holy Mass is when the celebrant raises the Host and wine and prays to our Heavenly Father to give us the faith in the sacrament of transubstantiation.
Before this loving miracle, we stand and listen to the words of our Saviour in the Gospel. A sermon in keeping with the text of the Gospel of the day is rendered by the celebrant. Next is the prayer that is for all time. The prayer taught by Jesus. We raise our hands up to heaven and pray to forgive us and to forgive all those who trespass against God.
The celebrant looks at us and says May peace be unto you. We reciprocate and use our hands in salutation while wishing that peace be with the person next to us in church. During the Holy Eucharist we bring to mind our Pontif, our Archbishop, all those in religious robes the persons present in church, the sick and those who have gone to their eternal rest. We also remember our blessed Heavenly Mother, blessed spouse of hers and many other heavenly persons to whom we pray for intervention in our time of need.
Another important rite of the Holy Eucharist is communion. It is not an obligation, but a celebration. Communion celebrates the Gospel: Jesus was broken for us so that we can be fixed by Him. Communion is important because its a command to remember. Jesus wants us to remember every time we taste bread and wine, and even when we sit at the tables in our own homes, that He is the one who provides all we need. He gives us the physical food that we need to survive and the spiritual nourishment we need to keep taking next steps with Him.
Holy Mass could be said in a Basilica or any humble abode worthy of hosting this sacred ritual. Masses are classified into many forms. Pontifical High Mass with lots of singing, and of course the heartwarming Nuptial Mass, Requiem Mass and so on. Holy Mass will vary in words and in music. So will the colour of the vestments worn by the celebrant.
Sunday Mass is as always special, we flock to the church to take part in the Holy sacrament of the Mass as a gesture of absolute obedience to God, who said remember that thou should keep Holy the Sabbath - a wonderful commandment of His, as told Moses on Mount Sinai.
Once a priest had told the congregation during Sunday Mass, that all should read the first three verses in chapter 26 of St. Lukes Gospel for the next mass. Next Sunday the priest had requested all those who had gone through chapter 26 to raise their hands. A few had raised their hands. Next, as directed by the priest, the altar servers had given the obedient parishioners sealed envelopes. The envelopes should be opened by the recipients only when they get home. When the envelopes were opened on a white sheet of paper, in English and Sinhala were the words: Dearly beloved child, the Gospel of St. Luke has only 24 chapters. My sermon should have been on Liars, God Bless you all. (Sorry for the digression)
The Mass is ended go in peace says the celebrant after the final blessing. The celebrant joins the crowd. A happy group, who had spent a few moments with the heavenly Father, Son, Holy spirit, our sweet Mother Mary, her spouse St. Joseph and the saints in whose name the sacred abode is consecrated to.

Wadhera had 9 fours and 3 sixes in his unbeaten 81 scored off 117 balls and Badoni 11 fours and 2 sixes in his 107 not out off 115 balls.
Opening batsman Anuj Rawat played a dependable knock as captain to compile a half century out of a first wicket stand of 92 with Taide. He scored 63 off 59 balls with 8 fours and 2 sixes.

Citizens' mail
Hang them till they are dead!
Have the UNHRC and EU overstepped their understanding in protesting to our government in passing death sentence to hang culprits engaged on mass scale narcotic peddling endangering the present and future young generations
The EU has been reported as saying in a letter that the death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, and has not proven any deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible. Does this mean our judiciary, or as a matter of fact judiciaries all over the world have made these judicial errors If there be, the number may be insignificant.
May I ask boldly, and maybe the voice of those who love to live a decent, peaceful life, is UNHRC and EU encouraging large-scale narcotic peddlers and for what reason I would also question the UNHRC, whether encouraging birth control and termination of births are not a violation of Human Rights It is high time that these organisations, which call for human rights, had limitations and drew the line, without making peace-loving people to live and not suffer.
The Buddha, the Christ and the Prophet Mohammed had preached against such crimes but have miserably failed.
It is therefore left to the law-abiding governments to impose whatever punishment for crimes, inclusive of the death penalty. In this case, there is no alternative but hang them till they are Dead! Dead! Dead!

Compensation of Rs. 2 bn for people evicted by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa
The government has paid compensation totalling Rs. 2 billion to the people who were evicted from their homes by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, said Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim when he went on an inspection tour of the city trade centre and the bus terminus in Mawanella, which are being upgraded.
The minister said that compensation was not paid by the previous government to the people who lived by the sides of the roads which were reconstructed.
He said during the last government, Mahinda Rajapaksa was highways minister and the policy of that government was to forcibly evacuate people from lands and houses when constructing roads.
The victims who were rendered homeless were not paid compensation.
It is this government which took the initiative to settle their dues.
The government has to still pay a further Rs. 5 billion to the victims, he said.
Focusing on the proposed bus terminus which will have four stories, the minister assured the Governor that the government has set aside Rs. 25 million towards this project.

On January 25, 2016 Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. The Thera was arrested by the police on the charges of contempt of court, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
The Homagama Magistrate had sought the Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Dilmah founder honoured with  Lifetime Achievement Award
Sri Lankan Tea pioneer Merrill J. Fernando was honoured at the WorldChefs Congress 2018 with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award for his extraordinary passion and commitment to tea, and for his unique philosophy of making business a matter of human service.
The Award was presented by WorldChefs President Thomas Gugler at the biennial global Congress which took place in Kuala Lumpur last week with the participation of over 1,000 chefs representing 100 Chefs Societies from around the world.
Merrill J. Fernando is recognized for his commitment to tea, especially the harsh early years when he fought for value addition at source, and against the colonial economic system that saw his countrys prized crop sold at auction in London.
When eventually he succeeded his struggle against the interests of big businesses that dominate the global tea industry had taken nearly 40 years. When his brand Dilmah was born in 1988, it was a victory for farmers around the world as it was the first time tea, coffee or cocoa was offered grown, picked, packed and branded at source by a farmer.
The benefit of that accrues to tea drinkers around the world and to workers and their families alike for tea that is packed at source is fresh and therefore richer in flavour and natural antioxidant goodness.
A farmers desire is for quality, fundamentally different to the objective of a trader who buys and sells tea purely for profit from any source to a buyer in any market, and that was so for Merrill J. Fernando, whose words, I devoted my life to tea, resonate powerfully in this time of commodisation and compromise. His tea was named after his sons Dilhan and Malik and underlined by an uncompromising commitment to quality, traditional manufacture, freshness and single origin tea www.dilmahtea.com.
Less well known is Merrill J. Fernandos commitment to family values and their embodiment in his brand through the philosophy of making business a matter of human service. That principle requires each of the Dilmah Tea, plantation, packaging and ancillary businesses to contribute a minimum 10% of their pre-tax profits to the Merrill J. Fernando Charitable Foundation www.mjffoundation.org which utilizes these funds to empower youth, and women in difficult economic and social circumstances, children with special needs, communities that are economically marginalized, and the environment.
Amongst the outcomes of the Dilmah philosophy is the Empower Culinary School, a WorldChefs approved training school that offers culinary training free of charge to young women and men who are economically, socially or otherwise disadvantaged.
Amongst those that have benefited from the Empower School are youth with cerebral palsy, down syndrome amongst other typical persons.
The second Empower Culinary & Hospitality School will open in August this year at the MJF Centre East, the largest privately funded charitable initiative in Sri Lanka, which is designed to serve differently abled children, youth, women and communities that are economically disadvantaged through the principle of empowerment with dignity.

Engineering  in danger
Ignorance and personal wants of the lawmakers and facilitators are killing the foundry industry due to the export of the valuable scrap depriving the country and the local light Engineering industry, against the laws of the country and well-being of the industry. The inaction leads to corruption, loss of employment, closure of light engineering enterprises, loss of employment and loss of revenue in Billions if the formal and informal sectors.
Foundry and ForgingIndustry in Light engineering
The Sri Lankan formal Foundry and forging industry in the Light engineering sector is the mother of all industries. Without the Foundry industry, there will not be manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Foundry industry produces inputs to the local industries while bringing export income by exporting high value machinery and finished goods, such as Aluminium extrusions, steel reinforcement bars and structural products, Brass fittings, water pumps, water fittings, sewing machine parts, and tea, rubber, coconut, oil, coffee mills, cleaners, shredders and other processing machinery for agriculture. Facilitation of tea, rubber, coconut machinery, and irrigation and construction equipment is one of the major activities in the sector. In addition, the foundry industry produces many items to service industry for hydropower, coal power, cement, marine, industry and automobile industry. The industry employs around 40,000 persons directly and also train and employ over 2000 engineers and technical staff every year without any cost to the government. In value addition, foundries recycle metal scrap and add 100% to 1000% value to Iron steel, brass, copper and Aluminium scrap metals to produce thousands of different castings and other products.
Today industry is deprived of the raw material they used for ages. The industry is losing competitive advantage besides the technology and investments and struggle to survive while six industries closed due to want of scrap cast iron last month. The turnover of these industries over 30 Billion rupees with the machinery they produce and is required for the well-being of the fellow citizens and industries.
The informal foundry industry is spread throughout the country and running to over 2,000 small units. These are located in Pilimatalawa producing religious items such as Bronze statues, Caskets (Koth), ornamental oil lamps, vases and other castings, required by temples and churches and wanted in the Sri Lankan culture. In Kiribathgoda construction industry castings hinges, stays, casements, brass screws, decorative valance boards items produced in large scale. The areas of Kaduwela, Gampaha, Panadura and Ja Ela also produce a large number of aluminium castings in addition to pots and pans for the rural industry along with many machine parts.
Today less than 10 individuals are illegally exporting the metal scrap used by the industry putting the entire light engineering sector in danger. The small entrepreneurship 100 to 200 in Kalutara, Gampaha, Kandy, Matara, Badulla and Kilinochchi districts employing over 20,000 people producing nails for cooking utensils are unable to obtain their scrap. Eighty medium scale industries producing parts and many types of machinery, Brass, Aluminium fittings, electric wire and accessories for domestic and export market and employ over another 20,000 persons. Both these industry categories are now in danger due to inaction, bureaucracy, and poor industrial knowledge of decision makers and politicisation of processes.
Many gazettes have been issued since 1993 to stop the export of scrap. The countrys law gazetted now very clearly ban the export of scrap and low value-added items such as bars and rods ingots by the Gazette of November 9, 2009. This, followed by a Cabinet paper, gives the secretary of the ministry of industries clear guidelines, how to issue licence part 1 of schedule 111 of this Gazette.
Licencing authorities
The authorities now give licence to export almost all scrap and over 1,000 tons exported every month otherwise used by the industry. False reasoning and personal interests are the main causes. The technical committee appointed without any industry knowledge, experience and facilities for inspection and without an official fee, give recommendations for arbitrary and false reasons.
A clear example is authorities stating cast-iron cannot be smelted in the foundry industry and issuing 10,000 tons for export is one instance. In another instance, a copper rod is defined as a tube. This is done against the University and FDSI recommendations of the industry and denying the brass and bronze scrap to the industry. Another example is industry, agree for large pieces exceeding 2 tons not used in the industry to be given licence for export but authorities allow exporting all material under the said HS code of Cast Iron used by the industry. This has led to a situation where six exporters obstruct the entire metal sector industry with their financial power and political power, more so they export valuable raw material at one-third the market price depriving the local industry. Cast iron Market price 42 export price 17.
India is the biggest market for this metal scrap, producing higher value-added automobile parts, which Sri Lankan industry is trying to enter.
The industry has made many representations to the authorities and authorities issuing licences keep pointing fingers to different institutions.
The customs department said that they have no facilities to check the materials licensed to be the same as for the invoice and documents. Recommending authorities for scrap say that they have been only asked whether sample materials submitted can be used in Sri Lanka by the foundries no qualitative or quantitative inspection of sample check is done. There is neither value addition formula nor a format to check the value addition and is done haphazardly for certain wire exports. The authenticity of official documents submitted for shipments and price of exports is not checked.
The exporters use over a year old export licence to get past the customs while the validity is only for three months. FDSI has adequate documents to prove that the ban on export is been used as an eyewash in public.
These official actions are not accountable and the country loses billions of rupees due to substitution, undervaluing and making the established light engineering sector in danger. Licencing scheme also stopped many export orders of genuine local manufacturing industry due to reasons known only to licencing authorities.

Fashion Bug continues to brighten Fort Railway Station
Fashion Bug recently announced the completion of the third phase of refurbishment of the Fort Railway Station. Under the project all the signage and direction boards in the station were renewed and repainted.
The CSR project, which commenced back in 2013 is conducted by the request and with the support of the Sri Lanka Railway Department. Throughout the past years Fashion Bug has been instrumental in maintaining the quality of the signage  an immense help for the commuters who use the public transport daily.
The Fort Railway Station is the main train terminal and the busiest in the country, serving probably thousands of travelers on a daily basis. It is the main stop for both short and long distance trains. With the rise in the use of public transport by tourists in the need to experience the local feel, the number of foreigners patronizing railway stations has also increased. Accurate and clear signage has thus become crucial in any such terminal, and even more so in the main ones. Commenting on the completion of the latest stage, Shabier Subian Director of Fashion Bug said, Fashion Bug has always placed social responsibility at the core of all our operations. Therefore we allocate a large amount of our funds for the many CSR projects that we are involved in. The refurbishment of the signage at the Fort Railway Station is one of our long standing projects. We humbly rejoice in the fact that we can be of help to all the train passengers.
Fashion Bug has initiated many social responsibility projects in areas such as sports, education, health and public service. The award winning CSR campaign, Sisu Dirimaga, is a platform established to serve educational needs such as awarding scholarships and conducting career guidance programs. Under Sisu Dirimaga, an annual art competition,Roo Siththam, is conducted, which is focused on harnessing young creative talent and attracts over 60,000 entries from all across the island.

A GARDEN ON EVERY DOORSTEP
Having your own patch of green is therapeutic. Plants can bring infinite joy to those who nurture them. The joy of cooking a meal with freshly grown vegetables, fruits and herbs is boundless. For any nature lover, happiness is synonymous with being among the greens.
Embracing the challenge of bringing a garden to anyones doorstep, Bhagya Wijayawardane strives to improve the countrys economic conditions and provide the answer to the food security crisis that many Sri Lankan families are suffering from. She has developed the concept of growing ones own food in a garden all year long in ones apartment. Her brainchild ESHKOL Garden Works was born out of a passion for nature and sustainability and driven by a sense of patriotism after witnessing the traumatic conditions people face in their physical, social and economic spheres in life as a result of deadly climate changes, unemployment and escalating food price hikes. ESHKOL encourages methods like space-saving vertical farming and hydroponics making it possible to grow plants without soil.
With former British Prime Minister and Chairman of The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust Rt Sir John Major KG CH
She was recently felicitated with the Queens Young Leaders Award for 2018. The event celebrates and supports exceptional youth from across the commonwealth, honouring them for their contribution in transforming lives in the community and beyond.
The malnutrition, stunted growth, absenteeism, increased number of drop outs, and lack of motivation to study in school children stirred Bhagyas compassionate mind into finding an answer to these problems. The reason behind these issues is poverty and hunger.
Not being able to have a decent morning meal to match the dietary requirements in children made me realise that if only the parents knew how a home garden can help them prepare nutritious snacks and meals for their children, it can create a livelihood opportunity for them as well as meet the nutritional needs of their families. A lot of farmers get into debt when buying supplies because they receive no proper support and face CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) due to negligence and lack of sustainable farming methods. We can improve the agricultural state and have access to affordable organic food as a community if we provide the farmers with the relevant knowledge and skills, Bhagya elaborated on how the seeds of ESHKOL took root.
Deriving from the Hebrew term which means cluster the name comes from Bhagyas home where the experiment was carried out first. The team set to work armed with big plans for small spaces. They soon realized that if you possess the suitable equipment and knowledge, a growth trend to fill small spaces with a burst of plants and crops is possible.
ESHKOL provides seeds and seedlings to low-income families. We supply them with plants, seedlings, raised-bed garden kits and other gardening supplies, hold indoor workshops on gardening, harvesting, preparing and preserving vegetables. We bring schools and communities together to uplift rural livelihoods in the Uva province by buying the supplies, encouraging locally grown fruits and vegetables, she explained.
Due to the pesticides and artificial fertilizers being consistently associated with food these days going organic is a boon for your health.
Growing your own food is not a complicated process. However, the majority think it is so. You dont need to obtain academic qualifications to get there. Practice and knowledge about the soil, natural elements and gardening techniques can help you design a beautiful kitchen garden for yourself. It is delightful to make people realize that they too can make a fresh and nutritious feast out of the harvest without worrying about how much money is need to put together a healthy meal, Bhagya opined.
She says that the most memorable and touching thing about her work is the fact that many people have opened up their garden spaces for ESHKOL to grow food for the less fortunate through their Food Pantries programme.
They have done this willingly simple to support the community. Love and trust are the key ingredients that are needed as the foundation to build a community. It is beautiful to see how home gardening can help make it happen, Bhagya mused.
The 29-year-old past pupil of Bishops College, Colombo, says that she is inspired by the beauty and the resources available in the country. She believes that one can get the best out of these by sustaining these elements. Her work on bringing about change to transform the world into a better place too fuels her energy.
She stresses that making people believe that they can overcome poverty and social insecurity if they learn to adapt and live a self-reliant life style is the biggest challenge she had to overcome.
We teach them to put an end to extremism in communities by encouraging creative spaces for community gardening. People are invited to join hands, putting aside their differences, to work for the common good, Bhagya said.
Queried on what kind of impact winning the Queens Young Leaders Award has made, Bhagya said that it has brought her work into the spotlight.
I got to know some people who are deeply interested in my work and who are willing to collaborate with us. People have questioned me more, reached out to me seeking support to start their own projects and have shown their eagerness to help expand the projects to other areas of the country, she expressed adding that she got the opportunity to meet globally renowned entrepreneurs like Jamie Oliver and Freddrick Oli.
They are running their businesses simply to support the community. It was great to network and learn from them, she reflected.
Her ambition is to build a more effective and sustainable urban youth farmers movement, where it will serve as a safe, heterogeneous and creative space for children and youth of the future to engage in critical thinking, improve their problem solving skills, life skills, and engage in vocational training in an interactive way. This will pave way for more green jobs boosting the countrys agricultural sector.
Dream big. No dream is invalid, no one is invalid. There were numerous challenges I had to overcome but I didnt give up. Develop the skill of perseverance. I only worked towards my passion, and didnt use anyone around me to validate me or the work I do. We need every person to help our country progress. Your passion leads you to where you want to go. Dont feel scared to take a risk, or experiment with something new. You can never become an entrepreneur if you ever have doubts about what you are doing. Be ethical and practice good moral and human values, even if people are against you. That makes you a better person. Im doing my work because I think about my future and my childrens future. I dont have any other country to flee too, and dont want to, so if you believe that this is where you want to create a landmark for you and generations to come, do something that is beneficial for the community and yourself. Then youll be happy and can enjoy the great health and wealth that comes along with it, she advised.
ESHKOL is conducting workshops and trainings these days. She invites those interested in following a comprehensive one-day program to join them. They also advice and provide technical assistance on request to help individuals start their own garden space with guaranteed results.

The Green Supply Chain: True sustainability or just one marketing stunt
The supply chain encompasses all of those activities associated with moving goods from the raw-materials stage through to the end user, advocates for business process realized that significant productivity increases could only come from managing relationships, information, and material flow across enterprise borders. In other words SCM is the management that integrate physical flow of goods and related information, from procurement to final consumption, enhancing customer, and economic value.
Environmental management has become a topic of mutual concern for businesses, Governments and consumers due to increasing high levels of industrializationthe growing concern in the global market for green issues and the scarcity of natural resources have forced executives to view supply chain strategies from an environmental perspective. High environmental risk industries, including chemical, plastic, automotive, and heavy engineering, have always considered improvements in environmental performance as one of the basic competitive priorities, alongside lower costs, manufacturing lead-time, and quality.
For instance, thecountries passed the Restriction of Hazardous Substance and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations demanding compliance with the relevant regulatory laws of product recycling and prohibiting the use of hazardous substances in products for sale in the market. In this development, the supply chain manager plays an important role of selecting and developing appropriate green strategies with the objective of improving environmental, economic, and social performance as well as gaining a competitive advantage.
Background on Green
The term green is now widely used interchangeably on the more established sustainability concept, which points to a more holistic view of environmental, social and economic impact. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is an emerging field motivated by the need for environmental consciousness. Stranding out of the conventional supply chain view, GSCM was sparked by the quality revolution in the 1980s and the supply chain revolution in the 1990s. Over the years, GSCM has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners, focusing on reducing waste and preserving the quality of product-life and natural resources. Eco-efficiency, which seeks to minimize ecological damage while maximizing production efficiency, and remanufacturing, have become key assets to achieve best practices. Customer demands and governmental pressures continue to push businesses to be more and more sustainable. Consequently, governmental legislations and public mandates for environmental accountability have brought up these issues on the drawing board of many strategic planners, bringing several green concepts into place.
Following the green or ecological pressures from customers, stakeholders, and governments, a number of operational guidelines, standards and legislative frameworks have been put in place to minimize environmental impact. Motivated by the need for companies to move towards ecologically sustainable business practices, the ISO14000 series standard was designed with the following objectives;
a. Encouraging an internationally common approach to environmental management;
b. Strengthening companies abilities to measure and improve environmental performance, through continual system audits, and improving international trade and removing trade barriers.
In light of the above issues, it can be seen that GSCM is driven by the increased environmental deterioration such as depletion of raw materials, overflowing waste landfills, and pollution in general. Thus, GSCMprimarily seeks to minimise the wastes within the industrial system, to prevent the dissipation of harmful materials into the environment, and to conserve energy resources. The objective, however, is not only about environmental friendliness, but also a good sense of business and higher profits. Business organisations have realised the need to upgrade their supply chain management from a purely functional role to a strategic role to comply with current environmental legislations and maintain an enduring competitive advantage, through technological innovation and improved eco-efficiency.Operations managers in earlierenvironmental management systems were involved only at arms length where individual organizational units managed environmental performance in product and process design, logistics, marketing, compliance regulations, and waste management.Though it has long been realised that green strategies should meet the required order winning criteria in the market place, the idea needs to be extended to the entire supply chain.Best practices call for collaborative integration of environmental and operational performance. There is a growing need for integrating environmentally sound choices into supply chain management practice and research.
Objectives
In view of the above issues, supply chain management has recently shifted its roles to refocus the supply chain in the following areas:
a. Natural environment.
b. Environmental performance.
c. Enhancing supply chain collaboration.

This paradigm shift has been influenced by local and international legislative changes, market pressure, and the increased use of environmental requirements from customers in the supply chain. This has generally encouraged fast acceptance of green principles world-wide. Currently, there is a substantial need for improvement on the best way to select the most appropriate green strategy in a particular industry context. Very few researchers have considered the issue of identifying taxonomies for conventional supply chain management. The taxonomy can provide the basis for developing theories. In addition,taxonomy also provides parsimonious categorical types without losing the main information orcharacteristics that exist within the type, and has been applied in strategic management and logistics studies.
GSCM focus
Four main areas of focus are environmental performance standards, eco-efficiency, green technology innovations, and collaborative supply chain with remanufacturing and recycling practices.
One important observation from these empirical activities is their remarkable focus on operations that influence environmental performance, as opposed to conventional supply chains which focus on customer satisfaction, service quality, responsiveness, and the supply chain cost. The central goals of the green supply chain are primarily centred on those process operations that influence environmental performance.
Thus, the end goals of GSCM are categorised as follows:
a. Waste (of all types): minimization of waste;
b. Energy usage: minimize energy consumption; and
c. Resource usage or material consumption: optimize resource usage.
The success of GSCM goals, that is, waste reduction, minimal energy usage and optimal resource consumption, are strongly dependent on the green operations or processes chosen. On the one hand, processes can be eco-efficient by focusing on operations-based efficient targets which provide secondary environmental benefits. On the other hand, processes can be moreenvironmentally specific, with more product-life cycle considerations. Such processes tend to be more focused ongreen efficiency. It is important to note that the green process operations are directly related to the inherent product characteristics.
GSCM goals are influenced by the green product (process) chosen; a green product (or process) can either be innovative or functional, while a process operation can be cantered on eco-efficiency or green efficiency.
One other important observation in this is that the above empirical activities show that green supply chains tend to improve their performance by developing specific green capabilities and by building collaborative supply chain relationships. The supply chain improvement towards the green practices is enhanced through competitive pressure from the market or customers, regulatory certification schemes, incentives, and direct involvement. Supply chain relationships are often developed based on two different climates, namely, coercive climate, where contractual clauses are enforced between suppliers and customers and collaborative climate, which calls for increased mutual involvement for customers and suppliers. These climates act as determinants of the success of green strategies chosen. Because the coercive approach demands a prescribed minimal level of compliance to standards, it lacks capacity to encourage advanced performance management. On the other hand, collaboration encourages new knowledge, technologies and innovation. However, a higher level of inter-organisation involvement and collaboration is required, if green supply chain goals are to be achieved. In this regard, we draw on the influence of supply chain collaboration on the success of GSCM strategies to define a framework for selecting appropriate green strategies. But how does the nature of process or product influence the success of the green supply chain GSCM goals are enhanced by two types of green supply chain relationships, that is, coercive or collaborative relationships. A common question arises as to what might be the most appropriate green supply chain strategy given a specific context, with a particular product, a specific process, and/or a particular supply chain relationship. What are the underlying GSCM dimensions upon which the right choice of green strategies can be made In this, we draw on the critical issues of supply chain relationship, product and process types to establish a taxonomic methodology for the selection of appropriate green supply chain strategies. The next section identifies the relevant dimensions of GSCM strategies together with their specific gradations.
Dimensions of green
The relationship is a crucial dimension that must be taken into consideration when developing a taxonomic framework for the selection of appropriate green strategies. Findings in this study also identified product and process technology characteristics as key dimensions that influence the choice of green strategies. We suggest a three dimensional taxonomic scheme that is more appropriate for delineating GSCM strategies. The dimensions and their gradations are as follows:
a. Relationship (supply chain relationship) - is either coercive or collaborative;
b. Process - focuses on either eco-efficiency or green efficiency;
c. Product - is either functional or innovative.
Acoercive supply chain relationship is characterised by enforced contractual clauses between suppliers and customers. This approach demands a minimal level of compliance to standards, with very low information sharing. Suppliers seek to meet predictabledemand at the lowest possible costs. On the contrary, acollaborative supply chain calls for enhanced mutual involvement between customers and suppliers.In addition, supply chains tend to respond quickly to unpredictable demand due to their high agility and flexibility. Product life cycle costs and overall supply chaincosts are the main objectives of the collaborative supply chain. This approach is conducive toinnovation and dynamic technology evolution. In light of these issues, we provide a summary of our views on the characteristics of coercive and collaborative supply chain relationships.
Although characterising products as functional or innovative may be an oversimplification, it is a practical high-level classification. In our view, functional products tend to satisfy basic needs, which do not change much over time, e.g., staples. Consequently, such products have stable, predictable demand and long life cycles. It follows that their processes do not change much over time, and they focus on eco-efficiency through optimal resource usage and low waste in order to maximize economic performance. On the other hand, innovative products tend to satisfy fast-changing needs. As such, innovative products have unpredictable demand and short life cycles, e.g., hand phones. What makes a product innovative is the drive towards green efficiency through the application of specialised processes with the aim of keeping up-to-date with emerging environmental legislation. Hence, innovative products and green efficiency are highly related.
Strategies for GSCM
Risk-BasedStrategies, the simplest strategy of GSCM with regard to inter organizational investment resource development is one of the risk minimization. Firms adopting this strategy are proposed to do so in response ostensibly to stakeholder requirements. Such a strategy is ideal for the organization that retains minimal internal environmental management resources or has only recently begun to consider the introduction of a supply chain greening program.
Efficiency-BasedStrategies, a more complex and developing strategy in recent years has been the eco-efficiency or lean-and-green approach to GSCM. This type of strategy derives environmental performance benefit for the supply chain beyond mere regulatory compliance through the requirement for suppliers to meet operations-based efficiency targets
CloseLoopStrategies, the whole supply chain includes the reverse flow of products and materials for the purpose of material replacement, waste treatment, re-processing, remanufacturing, repairing and/or recycling. The complete logistics system must include two parts: Forward Logistics and Reverse Logistics. However, in the present scenario, managers are focused only forward logistics being ignorant towards reverse logistics. There are two types of reverse logistics asset recovery and green reverse logistics The challenges faced by India in reverse logistics are: meeting customer expectations, managing expenses, Infrastructure, unorganized retails, complicated rules and regulation
Compliance-based strategies, include establishment of international standard systems such as ISO 14001, use of performance standards, inclusion of purchasing contracts for suppliers to meet certain regulatory requirements. Similar to basic certification systems is the use of broad statements with purchasing principles or guidelines for suppliers. Most organisations such as Wal-Mart and Seventh Generation introduced procurement requirements for compliant purchasing.
The advantages offered by compliance-centred strategies are as follows:

a. Environmental performance benefits;
b. Use of globally recognised systems, and;
c. Third party management of performance.

These aspects in turn, improve recognition and acceptance not only by suppliers, but also by the market and stakeholders. Any ambiguity in regards to the desired performance is reduced significantly. The disadvantage of these strategies is that, because if their reactive approach, they offer limited competitive edge due to their lack of innovativeness, a lack of uniqueness, and ease of application by competing supply chains. Since these systems are managed in a low collaboration climate, they only guarantee compliance with regulatory requirements. As a result, additional benefits from innovation or economic efficiency are very unlikely.
Lean strategies, are a more recent group of green strategies whose focus is on eco-efficiency in which suppliers are required to satisfy certain operations-based efficiency targets. In addition, secondary environmental performance benefits may be obtained from some operations practices that provide green performance advantages. These strategies are ideal when the supply chain relationship is more collaborative and the process/product is still functional. A high level of inter-organisational collaboration, arising from the use of integrative inter-firm performance requirements, is necessary for situations with complex problems associated with waste reduction and recycling. The lean-based strategies link environmental performance with operational efficiency within the supply chain, allowing for the extension of performance requirements into the supply chain that maximises economic performance while enhancing environmental performance through waste reduction and optimized (minimal) resource usage. Wal-Mart introduced green strategies aimed at creating zero waste and selling of products that sustain Wal-Marts resources and the environment.
The advantages of lean-based strategies are: (i) they offer eco-efficiency to the entire supply chain and (ii) they readily lend themselves to existing organisation goals of optimisation and cost reduction. On the other hand, lean-based strategies do not give room for advanced environmental management initiatives such as green product design, innovation and material substitution. In so doing, the lean strategy is considered as technically weak.
Impact of green strategies on operations policies
The above study highlighted the fact that specific green strategies affect various aspects of supply chain operations, including the purchase of materials and energy, new process technologies, process control involving disposal operations as well as water and air pollution and the output of green and clean products. In retrospect, each strategy has specific impacts on purchasing, product technology, process technology, and logistics and transportation activities, as well as performance measurement systems. We outline the impact of these green strategies in the following sections.
Since the strategy calls for compliance with stakeholders requirements, organisations tend to react to changes to regulatory requirements. As a result, purchasing policies should be focus on avoiding the use of hazardous materials through development of appropriate material selection criteria. Often, ad hoc solutions are introduced on production processes in a bid to adapt to new environmental requirements, which may be costly in the long term. Not many changes are expected in logistics and transport operations. Basic environmental performance standards such as ISO14000 andOHSAS18000series standards are adequate for this strategy.
Significant changes are highly expected regarding operations policies as the supply chain players seek to gain a competitive advantage. Procurement policies are supposed to be changed through collaborative relationships. Supply chain value partners have to collaborate in establishing research and development (R&D) projects that carry out product life-cycle analysis aimed at introducing new product and process technology innovations to contribute to the overall value creation. As far as production processes are concerned, organisations do not only seek to gain green efficiency from an ecological perspective, but also to take advantage of the green strategy to gain a competitive position. New green products that can be remanufactured or recycled are expected. As a result, management should pay attention to developing relationships between supply chain operations. As far as logistics is concerned, recycling and product take back initiatives are a priority. Therefore, logistics operations should be redesigned to suit such integrative relationships between players.
Green Supply Chain management is the field that incorporates majorly environmental and sustainable issues starting from the procurement till the customers shelf. Apparently in the present scenario the green supply chain practices focus on cost reduction and pollution prevention, due to which we are observing positive changes in organizations evolving and incorporating more proactive sustainable measures into their strategy and as everyday practice. However, organizations must also include the factor of corporate social responsibility into their kitty of strategies to build up credence about themselves in the view of customers, stakeholders, shareholders and employees; as the organizations are corporate citizens of the society at large.

The hanging  question
Party politics was briefly overshadowed by the controversial announcement from President Maithripala Sirisena last week that he was willing to implement the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers who, it was reported, continued to mastermind trafficking even while they were in prison.
President Sirisena said that although there may be a conflict between being a Buddhist and enforcing the death penalty, he was prepared to take that decision in the interests of future generations in the country and therefore he did not see this as a sin.
The announcement, made at a public function in Kandy has led to varied reactions both domestically and internationally and both for and against the decision. The government has however indicated that it intends to pursue with plans to implement the death penalty.
Later, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne was to elaborate on the decision, stating the government had drawn inspiration from the Philippines where President Rodrigo Duterte has embarked on an all-out war against drug trafficking while enforcing the death penalty. Subsequently, it was reported that Duterte had commended President Sirisenas decision.
In reality, though, the death penalty has been in Sri Lankas statutes for many years. However, it has not been implemented. The country also has a history of having diverse policies on capital punishment being adopted by successive governments.
For example, in 1956, after assuming office, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike abolished capital punishment. Ironically, it was his own assassination in 1959 that prompted its reinstatement. Talduwe Somarama, the Buddhist monk convicted of killing Bandaranaike, was executed in 1962.
Judicial execution
In 1977, J R Jayewardene campaigning on a slogan of a dharmishta or righteous society, steamrolled into office with a five-sixths majority in Parliament. As it enacted the 1978 Constitution, it wrote into law that executions should be imposed by a trial judge, authorised by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice and ratified by the President. This effectively put an end to executions. The last judicial execution in the country was carried out in 1976.
Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, when she was in office, tried to reintroduce the death penalty but had to back down in the face of public sentiment against it. Since then, there has been a sporadic public debate about the issue, especially when the country is faced with a crime wave or serious drug-related offences.
It is left to be seen whether President Sirisena will be able to follow through with his declared intentions. This is because of the intense reaction the issue has generated over a short period of time from a broad cross-section of Sri Lankan society as well as internationally.
Among those taking issue locally was the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL). Its chairperson, Dr. Deepika Udugama, while acknowledging that drug-related problems were a major social issue, strongly opposed the proposed move.
The death penalty was a cruel and inhumane punishment and seriously violated several human rights, including the right to life and freedom and was an extreme and irreversible punishment but ineffective as a deterrent Dr. Udugama stated, noting that drug-related issues could be curbed only by apprehending drug traffickers efficiently and enforcing serious punishments appropriate to their crimes, not by implementing punishments such as the death penalty.
There were swift international reactions as well. The European Union (EU), which strongly opposes the death penalty, condemned the move. The EU embassy in Colombo said the death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, does not have any proven deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible.
The EU, together with the British and Canadian High Commissions and the embassies of France, Germany, Netherlands, Romania and Norway have urged President Sirisena to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty and to uphold Sri Lanka's tradition of opposition to capital punishment.
Following this statement, there were concerns that the EU could exert further pressure on Colombo by withdrawing economic concessions if the death penalty was to be reinstated but there is no official indication of this at present.
The international human rights organisation, Amnesty International (AI) has also joined those protesting the move. Sri Lanka has been a leader in the region, with an enviable record of shunning this cruel and irreversible punishment at a time when many other countries persisted with it. Now, when most of the world has turned its back on the death penalty, it risks heading in the wrong direction and joining a shrinking minority of states that persist with this horrific practice, AI said in a statement.
AI noted that Sri Lanka had repeatedly voted in favour of the moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly, most recently in 2016. There is no evidence that the death penalty has a unique deterrent effect against crime. Executions are never the solution and, for drug-related offences, constitute a violation of international law. Sri Lanka should choose a more humane and just path, AI said.
Diverse views
Religious leaders, always an influential voice in Sri Lanka, have also had diverse views. Archbishop Malcolm Ranjith, head of the Catholic Church voiced conditional support. Human life is valuable. We never agree to take away the life of any human. However, when people who have been convicted and sentenced to death continue to hurt others in an organised manner, it would only be fair to impose punishments on them, Archbishop Ranjith said.
However, the Anglican Church had a different view. The taking of human life is expressly condemned by the Church, whether by man or by the State, it said in a statement and added that it cannot in any way agree with the move to resume the execution of those sentenced to death for drug-related crimes.
Interestingly, at the time of writing, the Buddhist clergy which has a significant influence on the majority of the population is yet formally to comment on the move.
This decision by President is likely to have political implications as well. Although it was announced that the Cabinet of ministers had been informed of the decision by President Sirisena and there were no reports of dissent from any minister, ministers continued to voice differing views publicly.
For instance, Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka appeared to support the move when he said that he has no trust in the assurance given to hang drug smugglers until a hanging is carried out.
Fonseka, reputed for being outspoken, said that if the death penalty is being implemented, there is no need to select only the convicted who are still engaged in drug smuggling. It doesnt matter whether you are inside or out. Action should be taken. I have no trust until it is done. It is commendable if it happens, the former Army Commander said.
Drug-related crimes
State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera had a different view. Perera stated that carrying out the death sentence will not stop crimes noting that this was his experience as a lawyer. However, he added that he would be supporting the Presidents decision.
It is also significant that while President Sirisena has articulated his position, none of the major political parties- the United National Party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna or the Tamil National Alliance have formally adopted a stance on this issue.
The government meanwhile was pursuing a steadfast course of action. It was reported that a list of eighteen convicts who were sentenced to death for drug-related crimes had been submitted to the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry.
As the issue continues to arouse interest and with national elections looming in less than two years, the issue of capital punishment has the potential to become a political hot potato. How President Maithripala Sirisena and other political leaders handle this controversy may have a bearing on the elections too- especially if the major parties adopt diverse positions on the issue.

Healthcare strengthening at Grama Niladhari level
The Primary Health Care Strengthening Project will be launched on July 20 at 6 pm at the BMICH in Colombo, Project Director and former Health Services Director General Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
He said this five-year project will be launched with World Bank assistance. The agreement will be signed with the Secretary of the Treasury shortly. At present, the world's best medical treatment is available for Sri Lankans free of charge but disease prevention is not satisfactory.
According to Dr. Bandara, at present, 24 percent of Sri Lankan males and 23 percent of females under the age of 20 suffer from hypertension. Hypertension leads to several other health complications and diseases. Under the new programme, each Sri Lankan will be registered to a health centre. This process will commence at Grama Niladhari level.
A health centre will accommodate 20,000 people. All of them will be screened for Non Communicable Diseases and other health issues. They will be graded and categorised according to the risk in developing a NCD in the future. Their current health condition will be managed accordingly.

HOW TO GET QUALITY BEAUTY SLEEP
When it comes to an effective beauty regime, the tips are endless. But the one thing you never hear enough about is the most important factor of all: beauty sleep!
Sleep is essential for the wellness of your mind, body, and soul. Its your internal fountain of youth and a key element to beauty.
How exactly does sleep affect the way your skin looks Rebecca S. Robbins, co-author of the book Sleep for Success!, explains that during a good nights sleep, your body removes dead blood cells and other toxins that can build up in the skin.
USE A HUMIDIFIER IN YOUR BEDROOM
Hydration is what keeps skin buoyant and fresh. But when you spend all night fast asleep, you arent hydrating by drinking water. As a result, your skin loses vital moisture.
To help prevent skin dehydration, run a humidifier in your bedroom. Humidifiers work by taking water from a series of chambers and pushing it into the air, making that air less dry and, therefore, gentler on your skin. For the best hydration results, turn on the humidifier after you apply a night cream.
USE AROMATHERAPY TO WAKE UP ENERGIZED
Aromatherapy can be an effective aid for getting adequate beauty sleep. The scent of lavender, in particular, can help improve sleep patterns. According to a 2005 study conducted by Wesleyan University, lavender had a four-fold effect on test subjects:It increased the percentage of deep, or slow-wave (SWS), sleep in both men and women.It increased stage 2 (light) sleep.It decreased rapid-eye-movement (REM).It decreased the amount of time to wake after first falling asleep.
Overall, subjects reported more energy in the morning after lavender exposure. The study concluded that the smell of lavender can be used to promote deep sleep.
There are two ways to take advantage of aromatherapy. The simplest way is to scent your room with lavender and breathe deeply each evening. Another option is to breathe in the aroma from a bottle of lavender for two full minutes at three 10-minute intervals before bedtime.
WEAR A SILK SLEEP MASK
Avoiding light when you sleep is crucial to getting quality rest. An eye mask completely eliminates vulnerability to light, preventing it from interfering with your sleep. For the best results, use a silk eye mask. Since skin is susceptible to wrinkling, make sure that the material pressing against your face is as soft as possible.
For even more of the beauty sleep benefits silk has to offer, we recommend silk pillowcases and bedding. These bedroom essentials can greatly reduce redness and puffiness for beautiful skin after a nights rest.
KEEP THE TEMPERATURE LOW
At night, your bodys natural temperature declines. Keeping the temperature in your bedroom low is good for both your metabolism and your blood flow. This is important because improving your blood flow helps oxygenate your skin, keeping it plump and even-toned for the day ahead. Maintaining a cool temperature in your bedroom will also help reduce redness in your skin.
EXERCISE REGULARLY
Exercise is another healthy habit that will help you get the ultimate beauty sleep. There is a mountain of research that shows physical exercise improves sleep quality.
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts, for example, note that exercise causes a rise in body temperature followed by a sharp fall in body temperature. This decline in body temperature, which lasts for two to four hours after exercise, makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
A study (found in JAMA Internal Medicine) on individuals with insomnia showed that regular exercise may be a useful therapeutic modality in the treatment of patients with sleep disorders. A different study, found in the Sleep Medicine journal, revealed that aerobic exercise of at least 30 to 40 minutes of exercise per day, four days per week, can improve sleep quality, mood, and quality of life.
As you can tell, the link between physical activity and sleep is well-established. Decades of research show that getting plenty of exercise is a healthy, safe, inexpensive, and simple means of improving sleep.
TRY STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES
Stress and sleep are deeply intertwined. Studies have shown that high levels of stress can disrupt sleep. At the same time, a lack of sleep can cause stress.
The American Psychological Association performed a study that found 43 percent [of American adults] report that stress has caused them to lie awake at night in the past month.
Thats why reducing stress is essential for you to get the best beauty sleep possible! And, of course, reducing stress levels isnt just good for your sleep cycle; its also great for your health in all sorts of important ways.
Here are some techniques for reducing stress before you hit the hay:Practice simple yoga posesMeditate Try deep breathing exercises (see tip number six)Massage your temples, forehead, and neckClear your mind of negative thoughts
Learn which methods help you to relax, and put them to use before you fall asleep.
GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY
To get the ultimate beauty sleep you deserve, go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day. This allows your body to develop a natural sleep cycle, sometimes referred to as your bodys circadian rhythm.
To develop a healthy sleep schedule, simply choose an eight-hour block of time for sleep and stick with it. Perhaps the ideal sleep schedule for you is from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Or if your work requires you to rise a bit earlier, perhaps 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. is best. Whatever times work for you, just remember to be consistent.
We should note here that its important to always go to sleep and wake up at the same time. This includes weekends and holidays! It can be tempting to stay up later than normal and sleep in when you have the chance, but this can disrupt your sleep cycle.
In addition, researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that going to bed early actually makes insomnia worse. This is true because you may sleep less deeply and wake up earlier than normal, which will lead to feeling fatigued the following day and perhaps needing a nap. To get the most restful beauty sleep possible, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even if you havent slept well or feel super tired.

John Keells support for Batticaloa Hospital project
The John Keells Group (JKH) partnered with the Foundation Supporting a National Trauma Service in Sri Lankas Project BEAP (Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Emergency and Accident Project) and the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka in 2015, in a public private partnership, funding a new state-of-the-art, three storey, 6202 square metre Accident and Emergency Treatment Unit (AETU), at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa.
The new facility was opened on June 7, 2018 including an operating theater named after JKH.
Nadija Tambiah Executive Vice President and Head of CSR John Keells Group said, The need for a new accident and emergency treatment unit was recognized by all key stakeholders, given not only the limited size and lack of resources in the existing casualty room of the hospital but also, its distance from other emergency treatment centres, its history during the civil conflict and the growing needs of the people in that region.
As a key player in the tourism sector, JKH recognizes the importance of proximate and state of the art medical facilities to promote tourism. We were delighted to be a partner of Project BEAP and pledge our support by way of a Rs. 26 million Platinum Sponsorship which was made through John Keells Foundation  the CSR entity of JKH, in furtherance of its objectives of promoting health in Sri Lanka, Tambiah said.
JKH expressed its appreciation and admiration of the initiative and drive of Dr. David Young and his team of volunteer managers and professionals who gave their time and talent at no cost to the project as well as the dedicated personnel at the Ministry of Health; particularly Dr. M. S. Ibralebbe, the Director of the hospital at Batticaloa, in completing this ambitious project. The building was designed by the renowned Sri Lankan architect Dr. Locana Gunaratna of Gunaratna Associates who was selected by tender and paid for by Project BEAP to ensure quality and conformity to agreed standards.
The John Keells Group believes that a healthy society is a productive one. Hence, through the health focus area, the Group through its CSR entity - John Keells Foundation - works towards fostering healthy communities in order to enhance the well-being and productivity of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans.
The John Keells Vision Project has since 2004 targeted needy individuals who lack resources and financial support to access timely eye care.
The main project focuses on the eradication of cataract as the primary cause of preventable blindness in Sri Lanka.
A sub project facilitates the donation of spectacles to deserving children and adults. Since 2015, John Keells Foundation has been working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and John Keells Group subsidiary, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, in sponsoring and supporting the Ministrys school screening programme in the Colombo District, whereby school children are screened, vision problems identified early and timely medical attention is provided including the provision of spectacles free of charge.
The project has benefited over 13,116 persons since project launch through sponsorship of cataract surgeries while over 10,372 spectacles have also been donated to needy adults and children.

Kaluganga Development Project gets $16 Mn Loan from Saudi Fund for Development
The Kaluganga Development Project is currently being implemented by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment with the financial assistance of Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) and OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID). Kaluganga Reservoir has a capacity of 265 million cubic meters (MCM) of water and will divert 100 MCM annually to Moragahakanda Reservoir. Under this project, it is expected to develop new irrigable lands of nearly 3,000 ha in the Kaluganga Basin.
Unforeseen geological conditions in the foundations and necessary design revisions have led to price increase and it is noted that the funds available from the above donors is not sufficient to complete the balance work of the project.
SFD has agreed to provide an additional loan of SAR 60 million (USD 16 million, LKR 2,560 million) to finance a part of the shortfall. The Government of Sri Lanka has already entered into agreements with KFAED and OFID to finance a part of the balance of the shortfall.

KDCA out to promote cricket in a big way
Kandy District Cricket Association is all out to promote the game of cricket. They reckon that the game should be given continuity or not be played at all. The new committee with some talented promoters are going to do their best for the game of cricket which was at one time the number one sport in the historic city of Kandy.
The KDCA launched a campaign to boost the grassroots of cricket clubs in their aim to become more vibrant and visible helping them to attract more members, funds and spectators. The new committee has teamed up with ideas for the club to use with an experienced working committee, including several clubs to develop and deliver club programme. A few days back some of the officials of KDCA met the provincial sports minister, where a programme was conducted for cricket playing schools in Kandy. At this meeting there was a long discussion, and they identified the difficulties the schools and clubs are facing. The KDCA coaching committee embarked on a mission to organize an awareness programme for schools and club representatives of both boys and girls cricketers. The president of the KDCA a former Dharmaraja College, BRC and Kandy cricketer Thilina Tennakoon assured to give a helping hand for all needy schools, if he does it will be a great benefit for cricket. It was to improve the cricket infrastructure at playing level, by way of conducting programs such as Mutational Programs, Prevention of Injuries, Nutrition, how to make studies, version to play cricket and pathway to success. It was nice to see Malcolm Perera one time coaching chief of Sri Lanka cricket, a well recognized cricketing figure in the hills, and now the chairman of the coaching committee explain to the authorities how to conduct and uplift the standard of cricket. He was keen that KDCA is organizing a Womens tournament to popularize cricket. School authorities form all schools were requested to submit their requirements. If they do, it will be great for the game.
KDCA has also organized a fund raising project, that is going to be a cricket - get-together, where all clubs and school representatives with their cricket lovers will give a hand.
KDCA wants to look at ways to raise money for teams. That way, you can concentrate on getting better instead of worrying how to afford the competition. So they have organized a dinner at Amaya Hills Hotel on Sunday July 22 where every club will bring in at least five members, to make it a success. Then on July 28 they will be having their annual 6-a-side tournament at Police grounds after many years.

Liberalisation programme under SLSFTA  carefully designed - Malik
Sri Lanka can attract more foreign direct investment with the signing the FTA with Singapore said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama. He was speaking at the Parliamentary Debate on the Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA).
In just the past two and a half months since the agreement came into effect Sri Lanka has received a proposal from Singapore for investment amounting to more than 16.05 Billion Dollars in the pipeline for Oil, steel cement and other projects alone which will create thousands of more jobs for our people.
In 2017, Sri Lanka had a record year for foreign investment earnings of 15.15 Billion Dollars and this year I am confident it will rise further to 17.2 Billion Dollars to to around 2.5 Billion Dollars.
However, these are extremely low figures in comparison to some of the other Asian countries that I mentioned before. For example, annual exports in Singapore is 480 Billion dollars, in Taiwan it is 340 Billion dollars, in Thailand is 254 Billion dollars, in Vietnam it is 250 Billion dollars, and in Malaysia it is 230 billion dollars.
Even Bangladesh, a country that was a much later entrant to the international trade game, is now at 41 billion dollars. Foreign direct investment received by these countries were 77 billion dollars to Singapore, 12 billion dollars to Vietnam, 9 billion dollars to Taiwan, and 5 billion dollars to Thailand.
And all these countries focused on FTAs, trade liberalisation and attracting foreign investment, to reach this level.
More broadly, this FTA with Singapore has been very cleverly negotiated by us. Unlike other FTAs signed by Singapore with other countries where the level of liberalization is more than 90% of tariff lines, in the FTA with Sri Lanka, we limited it to 80%. So, 20% of tariff lines or 1,487 items, were kept protected because of a concern on domestic industries and revenue. Items like footwear, confectionery and many other sensitive items have been kept out of the agreement.
The liberalisation programme under this FTA has been carefully designed to have the least impact on domestic industry and revenue collection.
We have included all revenue sensitive items in the negative list of items which will not be subject to removal of tariff.
Therefore, 97.8% revenue from customs duty is protected. Our tariff liberalization will take place over a period of 12-15 years!
In fact, the revenue earned through tariffs on goods imported from Singapore last year was 35 Billion rupees. The revenue loss for over the next fifteen years due to the FTA is only 733 Million rupees  which when annualized, on average, is just 51 Million rupees. That is just 0.14% per year!
Under the Singapore FTA, there can be services workers only if they are part of a company here so it is always linked to investment in Sri Lanka.

The newest generation  and high tech options to shape Sri Rugbys future
The time has come...to shelve all local rugby and look regional, at the fast growing Asian circuit.
Sri Lanka will feature heavily with all our 7s ..men's, women, U20 boys and probably the U17 boys and girls.
Major sadness when you consider our pinnacle alpha 7s U20 squad only playing one tournament before they hit the circuit.
In addition, we are also up for some more pressure against the best at the September Asian Games ...Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Kazakhstan etc. contemplating that magical step up to the elite world series.
Sri Lanka will certainly be tested to the core....and much pressure in the middle.
However, important to mention that our best chance to beef up our reputation and bragging rights this season...is here. If Muthu, Ratwatte, Weeraratne, Sooriyabandara and company can really step up ...the Asian Games is the ideal platform.
Naveen Heenak...might well stretch across both teams ...his skill and pace vital to our performance clout.
Joining him for a seriously alpha 7s... will be the stupendous talent and running skills of Gem Chetiya, Gani Dilshan, Muthalib etc ..great finishers for coach Nilufer to have realistic ambitions of winning the Asian series.
Welcome wellness and utter inspiration for our new selection panel headed by the master architect ...Rohan Abeykoon ...who will draw on his years in a Sri 7s shirt ..confronting the likes of Serevi and company in the middle.
The rules have changed somewhat, to enable smoother transition from set play and defensive positions.
But the magic is still the same...fit, power, skill, craft and pace...still lethal qualities and impossible to counter the injection of pace ...ala Carlyn Ayles, Dan Norton, Cesil Africa..etc.
Dreaming of the U20 Asian 7s championship is absolutely a realistic possibility... and entirely dependent on the quality and specialists picked as our combination in the middle.
We will have good depth and phenomenal bench strength...so recycling will be intimidating all game.
Let's look forward to some good news indeed.
September's Asian Games will also test our mens depth and experience...it will quickly add impact and recovery to our diets ...especially the contact to clean and secure good ruck ball from tackle situations...that efficiency, very much a decisive and critical factor to separate the stronger 7s outfits.
Here is the most ideal gift for the mighty thinking at Sri Lanka Rugby to profile up our Asian focus and start to create some serious waves of impact.
What a fabulous gifted opportunity.
I am supremely confident and inspired by this line for 7s in 2018.
The mighty Asian series starts in September and time enough on the big clock for our men and women to rewrite some compelling history.
The men are currently 4th after Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea ...with plenty to look forward to.....finishing is no issue at all with good ball...but forward power and strength to win the physical contest, might be our Achilles heel under pressure.
Let's imagine practical options by Muthu and his utility forwards, to present clean ball for our pace merchants..Danu Ranjan, Sooriya B, Kavindu, Ritchie Dharma, Naveen Heenak..etc to pepper the opponents goal line.
Let's step up to the plate and Sri islanders a top 2 finish this season.
For our women, who didn't qualify for the Asian Games ...plenty prep time to push up from 6th ...Japan, Hong Kong, China, Kazakhstan, Thailand...standing above.
Sudath Sampath will need to dig deeper than previous years..to craft our Sri islanders ...no 3 on the rankings.
Fair thoughts methinks...from my work experience....helping their climb from 12th to 5th and Asian Plate champions 2 years running...my job was to make them fit and believe.
Now it's time to boost that to 3rd in Asia.
Music to our rugby hearts and all Sri islanders if ....the U20 grab the championship, our men the silver and 2nd....our women bronze and 3rd.
What a wonderful world it would be...
The future looks promising and strong...but we the previous lot, need it stronger,...we want to sit back, cheer in admiration and maximum pride pouring from our gills, remembering our time in that Sri Lanka pride jersey!
Bula bula our history that endures, and blessings to the new Sri warriors to carry our flag.
Cheers!

## Title: OIL'S WELL THAT  ENDS WELL
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Thursday, July 19, 2018 - 01:00
OIL'S WELL THAT  ENDS WELL
Though there is no easy cure for preventing your skin from producing too much oil, there are ways to control this skin condition. Oily skin usually requires its own range of products so you need to make adjustments suited for oily skin types. Get rid of the excessive shine by following these guidelines.
Identifying oily skin
Oily skin will feel greasy and shiny all over. If you feel like you are constantly reaching for the oil blotting sheets, this means you probably have oily skin. Other signs to look out for are:
You have enlarged pores in your T-Zone.
You notice breakouts.
You get blackheads.
Your skin rarely feels tight or dry.
Causes
Many people suffer from oily or greasy skin for various reasons. Oily skin is caused by excess production of the skins natural oils known as sebum. These occurrences of excess oil are often genetic traits but can also be influenced by changes in hormone production and the products we consume.
Diet: Foods high in sugar, refined carbohydrates and the aforementioned dairy can lead to overactive sebum production and the accompanying greasy look.
Genes: Sometimes, you just cant fight genetics. Oily skin is by no means something that only affects those predisposed to it, but like anything, some people will always just have naturally oilier skin by default as inheritance from their parents.
Hormones: Imbalances in hormone levels caused by anything from diet, exercise, menstruation, pregnancy, birth control, or menopause can cause excess oil production.
Acne and oily skin
All types of skin can develop whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Acne tends to develop when an oily substance called sebum produced by sebaceous (oil-making) glands mixes with dead skin cells and other debris to plug pores and cause bacteria to thrive.
Make up for oily skin
First and foremost, investing in oil-free makeup should be your top priority, and with that comes the responsibility of prepping your skin beforehand. To get that sebum under control, a primer is an absolute must. It not only helps control oil production and makes your skin look smoother, but it also acts as glue to hold your makeup in place for long hours.
Skin care routine for oily skin
It is an obvious one, but its worth repeating: cleansing the skin is a vital step for oily skin types. Wash your face two to three times today depending on how much you have sweat in order to clear the oily buildup and keep your pores clear.
Look for a gentle cleanser free of sulfates and other harsh ingredients that can dry out your skin and cause it to produce more oil to compensate. Cleansers that contain benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid can help with clearing up acne and blackheads. If you arent able to run to the bathroom with your facewash, then be sure to keep the blotting sheets close at hand. Simply absorbing some of the oil throughout the day will really help keep the shine down.
While the first instinct if you have oily skin is to avoid any moisturizer or oil on the market, oily skin is actually in vital need of moisture because a lack of moisture can actually spur oil production in the skin, thereby worsening the problem. The key is to look for lightweight water-based moisturizers that are oil-free and non-comedogenic (meaning it wont clog pores). Rene Rouleau, skin care expert and esthetician, advises looking for a formula with glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, a water-based hydrator that keeps skin cells plump with water.
-Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana


Diet for those with oily skin  Making changes to your diet can be overwhelming at first so its best to take gradual steps. Try replacing one food type, then another once youve got used to the first swap, and so on.l Swap dairy products for: Dairy-free alternatives like almond milk and vegan cheese. If youre worried about your calcium intake, leafy green vegetables, almonds, and oranges will all provide the nutrients you need.l Swap refined carbohydrates for: Wholemeal bread, brown rice, wholemeal pasta, quinoa, and oats. These foods are much less processed and have higher levels of fibre, too. They keep your blood sugar levels more stable, which means your energy levels are steadier.l Swap sugary foods for: Berries, mangos, frozen bananas, good quality dark chocolate, water with fresh lemon and/or lime. l Swap alcohol for water or low-sugar virgin cocktail: Alcohol can also cause you to sweat and eat fatty foods, both actions which can lead to clogged pores. Its all too tempting not to wash your face when you get home after youve had a few, which can make oil slicks worse and give your skin a greasy look.If you cant quite quit the habit, try to stick to clearer alcoholic drinks such as vodka and drink a glass of water in between each alcoholic drink to keep hydrated.

Omar Waraich  Deputy Director, South Asia  Amnesty International
Gener Rondina was at home with his family in Barangay Carreta, a low-income neighbourhood of the Philippines Cebu City, when the police came for him in the middle of the night. Trembling with fear, he pleaded for his life. I will surrender, sir, he cried out, but the police were unmoved. He raised his hands over his head and fell to his knees. The family was ushered out of the room. Then, gunshots rang out.
Rondina is one of several thousand Filipinos slain in President Rodrigo Dutertes murderous war on drugs, with even the Philippines National Police admitting that it has killed 4,000 of them. When not arresting people, let alone presenting them in court, but killing them on the spot, the police assume the roles of judge, jury and executioner. Breaking the very laws they are supposed to uphold, they have acted on the flimsiest evidence to target people suspected of buying or selling drugs, overwhelmingly in the countrys poorest neighbourhoods.
As an Amnesty International report last year documented, hit lists were arbitrarily drawn up by local political bosses. In at least some cases, police recruited paid killers to do their dirty work for them, offering bounties per head. In their own operations, the police planted evidence in peoples homes, faked official incident reports to claim there had been a shootout, and stole possessions from their homes. Even in death, the victims were denied their dignity. Their bodies were dragged along the ground and dumped in the street.
Crimes against humanity
The Philippines, in case some government officials do not realize, is currently the subject of a preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. The wave of extrajudicial executions, which human rights groups believe to be both widespread and systematic, may lead to an invitation to the Hague for crimes against humanity. It is a policy so extreme that the UN human rights chief has recommended President Duterte seek psychiatric evaluation. In a letter that should interest at least one eminent Sri Lankan, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines last year denounced the killings as a reign of terror in many places of the poor.
As the government threatens to deploy troops to carry out Sri Lankas own war on drugs, it is also seeking to revive the death penalty. Executing people convicted of drug-related offences is a violation of Sri Lankas legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which restricts the use of the death penalty - in countries that have not yet abolished it - to the most serious crimes, or intentional killing. The move would also break with a longstanding Sri Lankan practice. The death penalty, as others have noted, was shunned for long periods in this island nations pre-colonial history. Ninety years ago, the Ceylon Legislative Assembly passed a resolution abolishing the death penalty, a move that was thwarted by the British colonial authorities, who insisted on retaining it.
Since 1976, Sri Lanka has turned its back on the implementation of the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, becoming one of the few South Asian countries to do so. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan belong to a shrinking minority of countries that still persist with the practice. In 2017, just four countries were responsible for 84% of the worlds executions. In 2016, by contrast, 117 countries  including Sri Lanka  voted in favour of a call for a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty at the UN General Assembly.
Executions are never the solution. As criminologists have demonstrated in study after study, the death penalty has no unique deterrent effect. Hong Kong, for example, stopped executing people over half a century ago. Singapore, a similar-sized city, still implements the death penalty. Despite these different approaches, the murder rate in both cities has stayed remarkably similar over the decades, failing to produce the deterrent effect Singapores government claimed it would.
Unfair trials
When it comes to executing people for drug-related offences, few countries have been as prolific as Iran. It has executed thousands of people after convicting them of drug trafficking charges in grossly unfair trials. And yet drug trafficking and distribution remains a serious problem. The truth is, the execution of drug smugglers has had no deterrent effect, as Mohammad Baqer Olfat, Irans deputy head of judiciary for social affairs, conceded in 2016. Over recent months, Iran has relaxed its drug laws and, just weeks ago, the authorities announced that hundreds of people have had their death sentences for certain drug-related offences commuted as result.
The death penalty is irreversible. There is no coming back from a flawed judicial process. The punishment is absolute. The mistakes are irredeemable. A coerced confession, the bias of a judge, the failure to collect evidence, or an inadequate legal defence can lead to someone innocent paying the ultimate price. It is also a punishment that disproportionately affects people living in poverty. This turns it into a class-based form of discrimination in most countries, as UN experts warned last year.
Lastly, but most importantly, the death penalty is immoral. If we believe that human life must hold the highest value, we must conclude that taking it away is the lowliest act. This much is clear when a person commits murder. Is it any different when the state commits the same act, inflicting the same pain and loss An execution is not a show of strength, but an admission of weakness. It represents the failure to create a more humane society, one where the protection of the right to life triumphs over the temptations of vengeance.

Pakistan beat Zimbabwe by  nine wickets in one-day match
Bulawayo, Wednesday: Pakistan sealed a series win after strolling to a nine-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the third one-day international on Wednesday.
Pakistan seamer Faheem Ashraf took a career best five for 22as the hosts were skittled for just 67.

In reply opener Fakhar Zaman then hit an undefeated 43 as Pakistan needed just 10 overs to seal victory and take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-game series.
Once again Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to bat first, but their slide began as early as the second over. Prince Masvaure, on his debut, ws caught out on a lifter from Usman Khan and Zimbabwe were under immediate pressure at 1 for 1.
The hosts were wobbling at 26 for 3 when matters went from bad to worse when Ashraf came on as first change in the 10th over.
He quickly had Peter Moor brilliantly caught in the slips by Babar Azam before trapping Chamu Chibhabha leg before wicket with a skidding full delivery.
He then had Elton Chigumbura caught behind and castled Ryan Murray as Zimbabwe slipped to a perilous 54 for 8. AFP

Parliament 18-07-2018
Govt. acts according to Army Commanders recommendations: Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, reiterating that all administrative decisions of the Army are being taken in consultation with the Army Commander, said that it was in the past that the political authority took an upper hand in all affairs of the Army.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, in response to a questioned raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, who queried on the scale-down of the number of Army camps and soldiers in the North. MP Gunawardena charged that the Government was deliberately weakening the Army, adding that unrest was seen developing within the defence establishment, because their promotions and welfare were being hindered.
The PM stressed that it was the Army Commander who has to decide the number of Army personnel and camps and their locations, adding that the Government acts according to the Army Commanders recommendations.
The Premier also pointed out that there had been no change in the number of ranks and positions in the Army and therefore, their promotions had not been affected in any way.
The Prime Minister also said that Army Commander Mahesh Senanayaka, was willing to meet the JO MPs and explain the true facts relating to the concerns they have raised.
The Prime Minister was also highly critical of the construction bill concerning the Akuregoda Defence Headquarters building, observing that it accounts for a major share of capital expenditure of the Army, restraining the investment in more important affairs. He pointed out that many in the Army were not happy that such a large sum of money was being spent on the new Defence Ministry building, without investing that money more prudently.
Who was behind this construction Who wanted the Army Headquarters in Galle Face to be shifted to a new location How much money have we spent on it now Still the constructions are going on. All in the Army are against this spending, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe complained.
Today a Brigadier can become a Major General before he retires. It was in the past that political hands interfered into all these affairs. Today, neither the President nor I muddle in the internal matters of the Army. The war is over. What we wish now is to protect the Army and take it forward, the PM noted.
The Prime Minister further observed that the restructuring of the Army is a normal procedure in any Army in any country. Today, our tri-forces engage in UN peacekeeping activities. The recognition for our Navy has risen as we strive to become the hub of the Indian Ocean. A large number of soldiers who were recruited during the time of war, are now retiring after completing their service period. Those who possess skills and experience, find other jobs after retirement, but we need to help those with ordinary skills to find suitable jobs. This is a timely need when we speak of the welfare of Army personnel, the PM explained.
Commenting on the Aava Group operating in the North, the Premier said it is a law and order matter that the Police could deal with. It is not a gang of shooters. The Police can confront this group successfully, he added.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena alleged, that a circular has been issued to reduce the number of Army personnel in the North by about 23,000, adding that about 100-150 Army camps in the North would be closed down as a result.
Party Leaders meetingto resolve holdingof PC elections: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday, that a Party Leaders Meeting has been convened on Friday to resolve matters pertaining to the holding of Provincial Council Elections.
He made this observation in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. MP Gunawardena asked as to how and why the Government was delaying PC elections, while the Supreme Court had once given a ruling that elections should not be postponed without the approval of the people at a referendum.
How can the Government or the Election Commission override the SC ruling and keep delaying elections I am asking for an interpretation of the Speaker as to whether it amounts to contempt of SC, MP Gunawardena said.
The Speaker pointed out that he had no whatsoever intention to delay elections, adding that the existing matter could be solved during the Party Leaders meeting. It was unfair to blame a single party for the delay in PC elections and no party leader had asked me to delay the elections, he said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella intervening at this point, reminded that former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa had on many occasions, acted in contradiction to SC decisions.
The Supreme Court gave an order not to remove Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. Your Government threw that order to the dustbin and summoned Parliament within 24 hours and removed her. You have conveniently forgotten the past, he told the JO.

Fuel price formula to bedisclosed soon: Arjuna
Particulars concerning the fuel price formula will be disclosed to the public very soon, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday. He further said that his ministry had received several RTI applications, demanding information on the fuel price formula. Minister Ranatunga pointed out that all decisions pertaining to the fuel price formula is not under the purview of his ministry, but is under the Finance Ministry and the General Treasury. Ranatunga expressed his confidence that the Finance Ministry would announce the details of the fuel pricing formula at its earliest.
Minister Ranatunga, explaining the features of the formula, said that it would be used to reduce fuel prices when the world prices drop and to increase when there was an increase in the world market. A committee comprising officials of the General Treasury and the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry, would implement the fuel pricing formula and give recommendations on increasing or decreasing of fuel prices, he added.
Minister Ranatunga made these observations in answer to an oral question by MP Jayantha Samaraweera, with reference to taxes charged by the government on kerosene oil.
Minister Ranatunga also revealed that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation incurs a loss when selling kerosene at a lower price than its cost. According to Minister Ranatunga, the CPC spends Rs. 97. 89 to produce a litre of kerosene, while selling the same for Rs. 70.
Minister Ranatunga also said that no tax is charged by the government in importing kerosene oil.
Army restructuringwill not hindernational security

The restructuring process within the Sri Lanka Army will in no way jeopardizes the national security of the country, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardena assured yesterday. He said that the restructuring process is purely an administrative decision of the SL Army, pointing out that restructuring is not a decision by the President, Prime Minister nor the government. State Minister Wijewardena also said that there is no need to be alarmed of a removal of Army camps from the North or a 25% scaling down of Army troops, since neither of decisions was included in the restructuring process. The restructuring process is a numerical balancing of Army troops, he pointed out.
This is a decision taken by the SL Army. This restructuring process is not an act of taking revenge from the Army or demeaning its value. This is not an international conspiracy either. The restructuring in no way remove any Army camp from the North. If the Opposition still holds fears, the Army Commander is willing to appoint several high ranking Army officers to hold a discussion with the Opposition, to explain the restructuring programme. State Minister Wijewardena pointed out.
The State Minister also said that the restructuring process would increase the efficiency of the SL Army.
Some Army units lack in numbers. So such units will be merged under this restructuring process. This might seem like a decrease, but such thing do not happen. The number of troops in the field or the number of Army camps would not decrease under this restructuring process, State Minister Wijewardena stressed.
He also denied allegations that certain Senior Army officers would not be able to apply for promotions by reason of this restructuring procedure. He pointed out that a decision has been taken to position all senior officers holding ranks in an equal grade.
As we are the largest group,give us Opp. Leaders post: JO

The meeting took place at the Speakers office at the Parliament complex. The Speaker had said that he has an understanding of the request made by the JO group.
We informed the Speaker that we would submit a written communication during the next sitting week. The Speaker promised that he would convey his decision to the House within the same week, MP Weerawansa said.
Tax exemptions under newNation Building Tax Act

The amendments to the Nation Building Tax Act have added a series of tax exemptions which were overlooked by the initial Act brought in by the previous regime in 2009, State Minister Eran Wickremeratne said.
He said the new amendments have also removed the tax exemption on alcohol.
The added exemptions include sporting goods including motor-less items such as Para gliders and parachutes, high tech agricultural equipment, coconut oil and coconut based products.
Wickremeratne observed that enterprise friendly banking loans should be encouraged to increase the number of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. He pointed out that the banking sector should provide more opportunity for innovative and creative business proposals when granting loans.
He said the government aims to increase the number of entrepreneurs by a 100,000 for which the government has introduced more than 100 loan schemes that offer financial facilities for people from all walks of life.

Wekanda Housing Scheme people cry for help
UNP MP Mujibur Rahuman urged the Government to pay immediate attention concerning the plight of the Wekanda Housing Scheme flats at Stuart Street in Slave Island to avert a disaster similar to Meethotamulla.
Speaking in the debate on the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday, the MP said the lives of 114 families living in the Wekanda Housing Scheme flats and at least 32 neighbouring families are at risk due to the poor condition of the building which could collapse at any moment.
They hardly pass a day worrying that they would be buried alive under the flat at any moment. This disaster may outdo the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, MP Rahuman said.
The MP said that the housing scheme had been built in 1974 by the then Minister Peter Keuneman, but it had not been maintained properly for years. The MP said the matter and the possible disaster have been conveyed in writing, both to the President and the Prime Minister, calling for their immediate action.
In 2012, the National Building Research Organisation found that the building was not fit for human habitation. Now, it is on the verge of collapse. The tenants demand that they should not be shifted elsewhere, but be resettled in the same area. I spoke to the Housing Ministry which agreed with us and the residents to do so. The ministry even expressed its wishes to sign an agreement with the aggrieved party, but now I heard that it back-tracked on its position, the MP explained.
The lives of innocent people are in danger. Now we are told that a fresh Cabinet paper has to be submitted to provide alternative houses for the tenants of the flat. We demand that a clause be included in the particular Cabinet paper that the tenants of the flat should be relocated within Stuart Street in Wekanda area, MP Rahuman said.

President tells Global Summit: Govt. committed to weaken Power - Corruption Nexus
Since unlimited power begets corruption, Sri Lanka has taken several important measures during the last three years to break the nexus between power and corruption, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation addressing the inaugural ceremony of the Open Government Partnership Global Summit 2018 at the Tbilisi Conference and Convention Hall in Georgia on July 18.
Prime Minister of Georgia Mamuka Bakhtadze presided over the inaugural ceremony attended by Presidents, Prime Ministers, Speakers, Ministers and other delegates from 75 nations.
President Sirisena further elucidating on the steps taken by Sri Lanka to promote principles relating to Open Government Partnership said when he assumed power, the Executive Presidency wielded enormous powers unprecedented anywhere else in the world.
Within six months of assuming power as President, he transferred those excessive powers to Parliament through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, thereby strengthening Parliament. The President said earlier, all top posts including the Chief Justice, Supreme Court Judges, IGP, the Attorney General and members of various Commissions were appointed at the discretion of the President.
Today, these appointments are made by a Constitutional Council appointed by Parliament, the President said.
President Sirisena who said that even the Judiciary was subject to corruption due to political power when he assumed office added that the present government led by him had re-established the independence of the Judiciary.
All Commissions, including the Commission Investigating Bribery and Corruption have been strengthened and have become independent devoid of any outside interference.
President Sirisena said a politician or any public official should try to minimise his powers and delegate power to a collective by Constitutional means.
The government was now involved in creating awareness about this among public officials through workshops and seminars while creating awareness among the people about the manner in which civil society should exercise its powers to combat fraud and corruption by organising workshops and seminars in this connection, President Sirisena said.
A press release by the President's Media Division said the inaugural session was held on the theme of Utilising open government collective agreements for the benefit and welfare of member countries.
The Open Government Partnership was established at international level in 2011 and Sri Lanka joined it in 2015. In appreciation of the Good Governance programme by the government, this years Heads of government summit will focus attention on global efforts towards strengthening efforts to face challenges in combating corruption and strengthening civil opportunities and public service. The summit will conclude tomorrow.

Root century seals England series win
Leeds, Tuesday: Joe Root became England's leading one-day international century-maker as an innings of exactly 100 not out on his Headingley home ground saw the hosts to an eight-wicket victory over India on Tuesday and a 2-1 series win.
This was Root's second unbeaten century in successive innings after his 113 not out helped England level the three-match contest with an 86-run win at Lord's on Saturday.
This latest hundred was also Test skipper Root's 13th in ODIs, taking him past the England record of 12 he had previously shared with Marcus Trescothick.Tuesday saw Root and one-day captain Eoin Morgan (88 not out) share an unbroken third-wicket stand of 186 as England, first in the ODI rankings to their opponents' second, ended India's run of nine straight bilateral series wins in style.
England, who will be bidding to win the World Cup for the first time when they stage next year's edition, had said they would treat Tuesday's match as a dress rehearsal for a winner-takes-all game at the showpiece tournament. And that made the comprehensive manner of their victory all the more satisfying for Morgan's men.
It was England's bowlers who set up this win, with Adil Rashid and David Willey, two of the five Yorkshire cricketers in their XI, taking three wickets apiece.
But, after left-arm quick Willey had kept things tight early on, it was leg-spinner Rashid who did significant damage by taking two wickets in an over.
He bowled India captain and star batsman Virat Kohli (71), as well as dismissing Suresh Raina, on his way to three for 49 in a maximum 10 overs.
Willey, who took three for 40 in nine overs, received excellent new-ball support from Durham quick Mark Wood (one for 30).
Root, who was dropped from the final match of England's preceding 2-1 Twenty20 series loss, told Sky Sports: "It feels fantastic.
"To come into a big series like this and perform how we have as a side is great."
Morgan added: "I think we were outstanding. I think the tone was set by the bowlers early on, David Willey and Mark Wood were on the money. From that point there was no let up." Meanwhile Kohli accepted his side had been outplayed.
"I thought we were never on the mark as far as runs on the board were concerned, we were 25-30 short, and England were really clinical with the bat and in the field as well," he said.
After Morgan won the toss, Rohit Sharma, who scored a superb century during India's eight-wicket win in the series-opener at Trent Bridge, struggled to make two off 18 balls, his innings ending when he flicked Willey to Wood at deep square leg.
Opening partner Shikhar Dhawan made a fluent 44 before was run out by Stokes's direct hit.
Dinesh Karthik, preferred to KL Rahul for this match, then made 21 before he was bowled between bat and pad by Rashid. Kohli pressed on, however, completing a 55-ball fifty before Rashid struck twice in six balls as India slumped to 158 for five. He bowled Kohli with a superb leg-break and had Raina caught low at leg-slip by Root. James Vince, called up in place of the injured Jason Roy cut the first ball of England's reply, from Bhuvneshwar Kumar, for four.
Vince's frustrating England career has seen him repeatedly get out on Tuesday he fell for a run-a-ball 27, although it needed a brilliant one-handed take by wicket-keeper Dhoni, from Hardik Pandya's throw, to run him out.AFP

Speaker urges improving quality, productivity in work places
The quality and productivity of organizations is important to achieve the expected economic target in our country. This also encourages more foreign investors and tourists to the country, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
Speaking at the awards ceremony of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Quality and Productivity (SLAAQP), he said. If our country needs to enter the competitive world market we have to develop our productivity and also the quality of exports.
He said, it is therefore, important to recognize and encourage employees of many different organizations to improve quality and standards of their products and services. If our employees make an effort to improve the quality and productivity we will be able to increase our exports.
Speaker Jayasuriya highlighted that Sri Lanka was a highly developed country several decades ago when compared to countries such as Japan and Korea, but unfortunately now we are far behind.
Since our production is not up to the required standard we have to still import goods from Korea, Japan and India, he said.
The Speaker was also concerned about valuable time and man-power wastage due to various protests and work stoppages by certain groups. This affects the economy badly.
The speaker also drew attention towards the 176 working days in our country out of 365 days and said too many holidays also contribute negatively to the economy.
He also expressed concern over the negative attitude of some politicians who always seek the power rather than performing their duties to the betterment of the country. He said with 35-years of experience in the private sector, he knows the value of productivity.
Therefore, I urge people and organizations to take a step forward in improving quality and productivity in their working places and contribute positively to the growth of the economy.
President, SLAAQP, D. B. Gamalath said SLAAQP was founded in 1996 and since then the association has contributed immensely to the improving of quality and productivity of local organizations.
He said the SLAAQP is a non-profit organization and consists of professionals who contribute to the betterment of organizations.

TALKING BACK   to Whatever Hurts
I confess I have not read Hilary Mantel. Im ashamed to say, I didnt even know she existed until a few weeks ago. Then I saw her name among the writers who were shortlisted for the Golden Man Booker Prize: V. S. Naipaul, Penelope Lively, Michael Ondaatje, George Saunders and Hilary Mantel. I sat up and wondered why I had never picked up one of her books at the library or in a second-hand bookshop at the Colombo Book Fair. Why had she evaded me so thoroughly, so effectively, for ever so long
I dont know why, but I do know one day when I read her books she would become one of my favorite writers. She has already usurped a few male writers in my heart simply with the interviews she has given to the New Yorker and the Paris Review.
Among all the writers I know it is safe to say Mantel is the only one who has faced the most trying obstacles on her path to becoming the only woman writer to have won the Man Booker Prize more than once.
And yet, the first novel Hilary Mantel wrote was rejected by all the publishers she sent it to  some didnt even read the letter she sent with her eight hundred page story. Mantel says, I wrote a letter to an agent saying would you look at my book, its about the French Revolution, its not a historical romance, and the letter came back saying, we do not take historical romances. She adds, They literally could not read my letter, because of the expectations surrounding the words French Revolution.
She was only twenty-three at the time and her life was beginning to fall apart. Having married her childhood sweetheart Gerald McEwen, at twenty, it took only three years for her to realize her marriage was not going to last. She was not well and in pain much of the time, and above all her book had been rejected. Of these three things, she knew there was only one that she had any real control over. She decided that if she was going to make a career as a novelist she had better try something completely different. Since her historical novel had failed she decided she would write a two-hundred-page modern novel instead, and if that also failed she would reconsider whether she was destined to be a writer.
Mantel was adamant to let no one else decide what would be her fate. Especially the doctors who treated her when she was in law school and started suffering terrible internal pains. The psychiatrist she went to see, did not take her complaints seriously. He diagnosed the source of her anguish: It was stress, he said, caused by overambition. He wondered if law school was too taxing. Mightnt a dress shop be a better outlet for her talents
He made the wrong diagnosis. Mantel already suspected from reading surgical textbooks, that she was suffering from a severe and undiagnosed case of endometriosis. The drugs prescribed for her psychological and physical misery led her to a mental-health clinic. There, she began to write a short story about a changeling that is, about a woman in rural Wales whose baby is snatched and switched for another. When she outlined the story to her psychiatristthe one who prophesied a dress-shop careerhe said, I dont want you writing.
This of course, was the turning point. From then on she could not stop writing. Having given up law college when she ran out of funds to pay the fees she began to work in a dress hop (the way the good doctor suggested) but soon she grew bored selling dresses. Wanting something better to do, she started taking books about the French Revolution out of the library, one after another. Then she began taking notes. After she had been doing this for some time, she asked herself, What am I doing And the answer came: I am writing a book.
She finished A Place of Greater Safety in 1979. The book was not about French royalty or aristocrats she had no interest in them. To quote the New Yorker, It was the revolutionaries she cared about. She cared about them because of their political achievement, but also because they were young, as she was, and had been driven from the provinces to the capital, as she had, by extreme ambition. Camille Desmoulinsrash, witty, louchewas the easiest character for her to imagine because he was a writer. Somewhere in A Place of Greater Safety Mantel writes of Camille, I wonder why I ever bothered with (love), he thought; theres nothing in this breathing world so gratifying as an artfully placed semicolon.
But the book didnt sell. So she switched to a cunning plan. Mantel explains she decided to write another novel. I thought, Ill write a contemporary novel. That was Every Day Is Mothers Day...It was an act of defianceI thought, Im not going to be beaten...It was, for me, a way of getting a foot in the door.
The New Yorker described Every Day as a bleak, airless story of awful people trapped in miserable lives: a deranged mother; a mute, malignant daughter; a coarse wife; a depressed failure of a husband. She punished her characters without mercytortured them with hostile specters,mold, filth, boredom, angst, canned food, social workers. Yet, the book was bought at once, and published. Every day was followed by the sequel Vacant Possession, and two others. Now that she had entered the world of published writers when she presented her historical novel again to her publishers they accepted it. Hilary Mantel was finally on the path to becoming a legend. In 2009 she won the Man Booker Prize for Wolf Hall, and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Bring Up the Bodies, the second in her Wolf Hall trilogy won the Booker in 2012.
Mantel says she was a slip of a thing when she was young, and that her ill health - her struggles with severe endometriosis was what made her become a writer. Endometriosis followed by a thyroid problem had caused her body to rise like a loaf left in a warm place. In her autobiography she has written of how ignorable you become when you are fat  like a piece of furniture. Im like a comic-book version of myself. My body is intent on telling the story, so my mind had better go along with it and write the memoir. And yet, as these words suggest, this body that has again and again betrayed her has also empowered her as a writer. While Mantel still struggles through days and weeks when she feels too ill to work, paradoxically her
Hilary Mantel Quotes

1. The things you think are the disasters in your life are not the disasters really. Almost anything can be turned around: out of every ditch, a path, if you can only see it.

2. Those who are made can be unmade.

3. She is very plain. What does Henry see in her He thinks shes stupid. He finds it restful.

4. A novel should be a book of questions, not a book of answers
illness also seems to be her hardest and therefore her most loyal task master. As she puts it now, You cant get away from dire health, but you may as well get some use out of it. It is not a question of making sense of suffering, because nothing does make sense of it. It is a question of not sinking into it. It is talking back to whatever hurts, whether that is physical or psychological, so that it doesnt submerge you.
Today Mantel lives with her husband Gerald McEwen (they divorced in 1980, but in 1982 they married again, in front of a registrar, who wished them better luck this time) in a cheerful flat overlooking the sea in a little town on the Devon coast.
But when she was a child, she lived in a village in the northern part of Derbyshirenot a pretty English village but a bleak, dank, cold Northern village on the edge of the moors, its people distrustful and life-refusing, she wrote in her memoir, working in the cotton mills from late childhood, living in cramped houses without bathrooms or hot water, barely educated in harsh schools.
And so, even though she is now a successful writer she still finds making money as something very important. Like for most of us, to Hilary Mantel too, one of the most significant markers of success in the world is to be able to open the household bills and know that she can pay them.

Water scarcity in Anuradhapura
Tanks below 50-percent capacity
As water scarcity prevails with the ongoing drought in the Anuradhapura district, the Disaster Management Ministry and Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake had made preparations to distribute dry food ration bags, each worth Rs. 5,000, to around 70,000 drought-stricken families from July 25 onward.
Distributions that were planned for the month of May had been postponed due to lack of funds. The Anuradhapura Government Agent told the Daily News that the number of beneficiaries for rations were decreased from 149,000 to 72,000, in accordance with the criteria stated in a circular that was passed by the Disaster Management Ministry.
He added that he had planned to hold discussions with Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake, in order to increase the number of beneficiaries.
At present, around 10,000 families in the Mahawilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Kahatagasdigiliya and Palugaswewa areas are being provided with drinking water with the use of bowsers. It had been predicted that if the district were to not receive rainfall soon, the drinking water scarcity would expanded to about 100 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Thirappane, Nuwaragam Palatha, Medawachchiya, Kebitigollewa and Padaviya areas.
Anuradhapura District Irrigation Director Prasanna Silva, upon submitting a report with regard to the current water levels of the 13 major tanks located in Anuradhapura, Rajangane, Hurulu Wewa and Padaviya, said the water scarcity was so high that Yala cultivation under the Padaviya, Wahalkada and Mahawilachchiya reservoirs had been abandoned. Only the Rajanganaya, Angamuwa and Thuruwila tanks had water levels at or above 50-percent capacity due to the additional Mahaweli water being supplied to them.
According to Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee sources, the total acreage being cultivated utilising the 13 major tanks under normal conditions, is 7,0000 acres, whereas during the 2018 Yala season, only 30,000 acres had been cultivated with paddy and additional crops. We have planned to request the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to provide 150,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water to the Nuwara Wewa, Hurulu Wewa, Tissa Wewa, as well as the Nachchaduwa and Thuruwila reservoirs, a committee spokesperson said, There have been numerous complaints from irrigation, water supply and drainage authorities as well as farmer organisations, that Mahaweli water flowing along feeder canals to the Hurulu Wewa and Tissa Wewa, was being tapped by certain hoteliers and farmers, preventing the complete water quota from reaching the tanks.
This in turn, would dwindle the area of irrigable lands depending on the said tanks, they added.
At a recent District Coordinating Committee (DCC) meeting held on July 16, Anuradhapura Government Agent Wanninayake appointed a special committee comprising of divisional secretaries, irrigation engineers, land officers and Grama Niladharis, to investigate the alleged illicit water-tapping.

Thai cave boys leave hospital
THAILAND: The12 boys and their football coach rescued from a cave in Thailand were expected to leave hospital yesterday, a government spokesman said.
The Wild Boars football team are being discharged a day earlier than announced and authorities hope that by holding the question and answer session before they head home it will satisfy the huge interest in their story.
The reason to hold this evening press conference is so media can ask them questions and after that they can go back to live their normal lives without media bothering them, Thailands chief government spokesman Sunsern Kaewkumnerd told AFP.
But with experts warning of possible long-term distress from the ordeal inside the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand, the briefing will be closely watched.
The public relations department in Chiang Rai province solicited questions from news outlets in advance and they will be forwarded to psychiatrists for screening.
Called Sending the Wild Boars Home and broadcast on major television channels, the session will last for about 45 minutes, Sunsern said, adding that it would be conducted in an informal style with a moderator.
They are likely to return home immediately after the press conference, he said.
Thailands junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha urged media Wednesday to be cautious in asking unimportant questions that could cause unspecified damage.- AFP

Trump backtracks on Russia comments
US: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday moved to limit the damage from his summit with Vladimir Putin, claiming he misspoke in appearing to accept the Russian leaders denial of election meddling -- in a rebuke to US intelligence chiefs.
At their meeting in Helsinki on Monday, Trump failed to challenge Putin over the 2016 presidential election, seeming to accept at face value the strongmans denial that Moscow interfered in a bid to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
But faced with outrage at home, with even some of his political allies demanding that he reverse course, Trump -- in an extraordinary postscript to the summit -- sought to walk back his remarks.
Trump said he accepted the intelligence communitys assessment that Russia had meddled in the election, and offered a rambling explanation of his assertion that he could not see any reason why Russia would interfere.
In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word would instead of wouldnt, Trump said, speaking at the White House ahead of a meeting with Republican lawmakers.
The sentence should have been, I dont see any reason why it wouldnt be Russia. Sort of a double negative, he added -- repeating the laborious clarification several times.
But while the US leader expressed his full faith and support for Americas great intelligence agencies, he insisted that Russias actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election. And he again floated the idea that other people could be involved.
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer was quick to pounce.
President Trump tried to squirm away from what he said yesterday. Its 24 hours too late, and in the wrong place, Schumer said.
Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign has increasingly put pressure on the White House.
The president -- who regards the probe as an attack on his legitimacy -- has dubbed it a witch hunt, and again said Tuesday there were no collusion at all. But the investigation is progressing, as evidenced by the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents on Friday -- timing that was embarrassing ahead of the summit with Putin.
Trump initially sounded a defensive note on Tuesday, insisting his meeting with Putin had been even better than his one last week with traditional allies NATO -- a testy gathering seen as having badly strained trans-Atlantic ties.
But the US president found precious little support for his decision not to confront the Russian leader -- on either side of the political aisle.
Former House speaker and longtime Trump ally Newt Gingrich put it bluntly.
It is the most serious mistake of his Presidency and must be corrected -- immediately, he tweeted as Trump headed home.
By Tuesday afternoon when he faced the cameras, Trump had changed tack.
Were doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018, the President said.- AFP

Uncertain future for Galle  International Cricket Stadium
The future of Galle International Cricket Stadium as an international venue is in danger.
The stadium which is one of Sri Lankas luckiest venues faces the prospect of being relocated elsewhere when a initial proposal is presented in December.
A special discussion was held regarding the matter at the Ministry of Cultural Affairs yesterday with the participation of Archeological Department, Urban Development Authority and officials of Sri Lanka Cricket and Western Province Cricket Association.
The Ministry of Southern Development has stated that the Galle International Stadium has been located near the Galle Dutch Fort which has been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO and that it has been constructed without the approval of a responsible authority.
Some were of the view that the final decision on the Galle International Stadium should be taken by the Cabinet.
The Galle International Cricket Stadium is currently the property of Sri Lanka Cricket having been leased out to them by the Galle Municipality and since it was devastated by the tsunami in December 2004 it has been renovated. The renovation of the stadium began in May 2006 where new buildings including a new pavilion and media centre were constructed and the pavilion named after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in December 2007. This pavilion provided seating for up to 500 VIP guests and contained a media centre that can hold 150 media personnel. It is also equipped with two TV control rooms and a radio commentators room. The dressing rooms of the two teams are also in this pavilion.
From time to time UNESCO has requested Sri Lanka to take action and remove unapproved constructions which have been built within the old Galle Fort and its buffer zone.
We have not heard anything officially from the Cultural Ministry. As the Sports Minister is out of the country a further discussion maybe held after his return before a final decision is taken, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
De Silva pointed out that one of the building that was demolished was the indoor nets which was damaged by the tsunami, but no other demolishment has taken place since.
Recently the venue came under the radar when allegations surfaced that two Sri Lankans had agreed to tamper with the pitch to alter the outcome of a Test match against England later this year.
The stadium has been Sri Lankas lucky international venue having won 18 of the 31 Test matches played and losing only 7.  ST

Underworld links haunting JO
The Joint Opposition these days appear to be obsessed with the underworld. Some of its members make statements that are an insult to the intelligence of the ordinary public while others speak as if they were born into this world after January 2015. These elements speak as if the underworld was a phenomenon that came into existence with the advent of the Yahapalanaya government and before that the people lived in a blissful nirvana with no marauder stalking them.
JO Moneragala District parliamentarian Pathma Udayashantha Gunasekera raised an Oral Question in parliament on Tuesday directed at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wanting him to clarify a newspaper report that a government minister had recruited four underworld figures as his bodyguards. The Premier in his customary style, rising to the bait, queried as to what right had the JO to speak about the underworld when they could not even take legal action against Pradeshiya Sabha members who raped foreign women. You were the people who protected rogues, underworld leaders and rapists. You could not remove even the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman who raped many women. How can you speak like this and what right have you to point the finger at us the PM asked. He however said action would be taken against any minister found to be protecting underworld leaders and that he had issued directions to the police to make inquiries in this regard and also ascertain the veracity of the news report and its source.
Meanwhile, Law and Order State Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said the government would soon reveal to the country a list of underworld leaders who attended the weddings of powerful politicians of the former government.
Like the Premier noted, the functionaries of the Rajapaksa regime are the last persons who can point the finger at the present government where protecting underworld leaders are concerned. It was common knowledge at the time that well known underworld figures Wambotta and Julampitiye Amare, just to name two, operated with the full patronage of the Rajapaksas. Wambotta of course perished, shortly after spilling the beans, killed, by what most believe to be a government hit squad, while the latter is still at large.
The hands of the police were tied in the face of the murders and other grave crimes committed by the duo, due to their connections to the very top. Ditto for the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman and his gang who caused the death of a British national and raped his fiance. But for the intervention of the British authorities, this murder too would have found its place into the long list of unsolved crimes in this country. The Deraniyagala PS Chairman who is now serving a life sentence for the murder of the Noori Estate Manager too would have gone scot-free if not for the high profile nature of the killing. Another underworld figure from the south who was also a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha and got himself killed by a rival member of the underworld was posthumously honoured by the visit to his home of the former President to pay his respects.
Hence, it was clear that the underworld figures were handpicked by the Rajapaksas to be Chairmen of local authorities so that they could muscle their way in obtaining votes to keep the former leaders in power forever. It would be no exaggeration to say that the local government leaders owed their appointments to being underworld figures themselves, to perpetuate Rajapaksa rule.
Not just at local government level, this phenomenon was also witnessed at national level. A Colombo district parliamentarian who was a well known drug distributor, with the underworld in his pocket, was made the Monitoring MP for Defence. This worthy was also appointed to nurse an electorate in the Colombo suburbs which would soon turn out to be a hub in the drugs trade. It was also well known that the clash between the underworld commandeered by this politician and that which was led by a Presidential Advisor, no less, it was that culminated in the murder of the latter, on the day of the local government election in 2011. Hence, the underworld at the time was not just protecting ministers, but had links to the very top, by association.
In fact, during the Rajapaksa era, there was no need for an underworld, to get the dirty work done. The underworld was then clothed in respectability, with men in khaki uniform filling this role admirably. The revelations made in the questioning of former members of the security forces, now in custody, reveal the whole sordid tale of how special units manned by the military in Colombo did the bidding of those at the helm of power in abducting Tamils in white vans for ransom and carrying out attacks on journalists opposed to the government. The underworld, of course, operated in the shadows, but these units went about their business with impunity secure in the protection that was forthcoming. Proceedings in the specials courts, now about to commence sessions, would hopefully shed more light on the whole operation and the masterminds exposed.

Western Union, a leader in cross-border and cross-currency money transfer, has expanded its network in Sri Lanka facilitating greater access for international money transfer customers, following an alliance with Hatton National Bank (HNB), Sri Lankas premier private-sector commercial bank.
With this collaboration, customers can now receive their Western Union money transfers in minutes1 from more than 200 countries and territories, across HNBs island-wide branch network of 251 customer centres.
Western Union has been providing money transfer services in Sri Lanka since 1995. Customers can receive money at more than 4,600 Agent locations2 across the country or directly into bank accounts from participating countries.
As more Sri Lankans seek employment opportunities abroad, we are extremely proud to be able to work together to connect the Sri Lankan diaspora from nearly every country in the world, by enabling money movement to their families and loved ones in Sri Lanka, said Sohini Rajola, Regional Vice President, South Asia and Indochina, Western Union.
We believe that when money moves, good things happen. Western Union is always committed to enabling individuals, families and friends to securely and conveniently send and receive money, she said.
Sri Lanka was one of the top five remittance receiving countries in South Asia in 2017, according to the Migration and Remittances Brief by World Bank3.
Many Sri Lankans choose to live and work overseas and remit money to support their loved ones back home, contributing significantly to shaping the local and national economy. The reliability and ease of these transactions is what many families across the island rely on, and this is part of the rationale driving the agreement between our two organizations, said Kalum Wijesooriya, AGM - Deposits & Remittances, HNB.
HNB is delighted to be collaborating with Western Union and providing customers with access to the speed, convenience and reliability of Western Union, and their extensive global network spanning over 200 countries and territories and 130 international currencies, he said.

WINSHAW   would love  to return for 'PADDINGTON 3'
It looks like everyones favorite marmalade-eating bear could be back for another adventure. Ben Winshaw, who has voiced Paddington the Bear in two live-action films, was recently asked if he would be interesting in returning for a third installment. And as he explained to Entertainment Weekly, it definitely could be in the cards.
I absolutely love doing Paddington, Winshaw revealed. It takes a lot of time, and each time Ive done it, its taken the better part of a year. But I would love to do another one.
But as Winshaw went on to say, whether or not he would return for a third Paddington film would depend on the availability of writer-director Paul King.
I cant imagine what it would be like without him, so I think its really down to whether he wants to or not, Winshaw explained.
Paddington has become a bonafide sensation since the first film debuted in 2014, with the sequel being deemed the best-reviewed movie of all time on Rotten Tomatoes.
Its incredibly gratifying, King said of Paddington 2s positive reception. Its such a strange process making these films which are preposterously labor-intensive. Normally you feel a film is coming into shape fairly quickly, but when its semi-animated so much of it evolves over the following year and you spend so many dozens of hours in darkened rooms looking at incredibly small details. You get incredibly meticulous and controll-y over every last frame. But theres a danger you entirely lose your mind - and theres an extraordinary moment when your head comes above water and the first response is from critics. Its a strange experience and you cant help but hope for the best for this little character and the film youve created. Its very lovely they were warm and enthusiastic.
Of course, those qualifications would definitely make a sequel seem likely, but its unclear when that could happen. In the months since Paddington 2, King has signed on to direct live-action reboots of both Willy Wonka and Pinocchio, a pivot that Winshaw seems to understand. Entertainment Weekly

Are you eating for health




Its essential for weight control and especially weight loss, to recognise and act on the feedback your body gives you about when and how much you need to eat. However its also important to aim for a regular eating pattern of meals, or meals and mid meals.
A planned pattern of eating is more likely to include the recommended number of serves from the five food groups. A spontaneous, unstructured eating pattern is more likely to include too many discretionary foods which means too much saturated fat, added sugars, added salt and kilojoules at the expense of fibre and important nutrients.
Don't skip breakfast 
Breakfast skippers are more likely to be tempted by unplanned discretionary choices during the morning and large serves at the next meal or snack. Just think of how yummy those large baked muffins look at morning tea if youve missed breakfast! People who regularly eat a breakfast based on wholegrain cereal or bread, low fat milk or yogurt and maybe some fruit or vegetables are much more likely to be eating well and lose weight than those who skip breakfast.
Eat with other people not TV 
We also know that people who eat with others and eat at the dining table, are more likely to eat regularly and eat well than those who eat alone or in front of the TV. Meals with others tend to include more foods from the five food groups. For example, people often report that they cant be bothered cooking vegetables just for themselves. Television watching is associated with eating more discretionary choices like take-away or convenience foods and fewer foods from the five foods. It also makes it much more difficult to recognise and respond to our bodys signals abouthunger and satiety. Good meal planning and making healthy choices can sometimes be tricky but a few useful tips can make it easier.

Bakery Owners compelled to increase bread prices
Bakery owners would be compelled to increase the price of bread within the next two months, unless the government were to introduce relief measures for bakery owners affected by recent tax hikes, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association had warned.
Excessive taxes levied on imported bakery ingredients had inconvenienced small-scale bakery owners with the prospect of driving them out of business, All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association President N. K. Jayawardene said.
Addressing a press conference held at Ragama, he said the tax hikes made by the government would only inconvenience small bakery owners, especially those in the rural sector, bringing job insecurities to thousands of workers under their employ. Super bakeries run by expatriates selling buns and fish buns at exorbitant prices such as Rs. 150 each, would not be affected by these ad hoc tax increases.
Jayawardena said the tax levied on a kilogram of butter was Rs. 215, but bakeries use palm oil instead, adding that a litre of palm oil was taxed Rs. 120, while the tax on butter was Rs. 600 per kilogram.
He said a kilogram of butter was currently Rs. 2,000, while a two-percent tax was levied on bread. All other products except bread had been levied a two-percent Modified Business Tax (MBT) and a 15-percent Value-added Tax (VAT).
A tax of Rs. 5 was levied on fish buns priced at Rs. 35 each. Short eats such as bread buns and Chinese rolls were common food in great demand among consumers. Unless the government implemented some relief measure for bakery owners, they would be compelled to increase the price of bread within the next two months, he said, adding that the escalating price of fuel and gas had adversely affected bakery owners as well.
The government had decreased only the price of individual domestic gas cylinders, and not the bulk of cylinders used by businessmen.

Celene Fung, Strategic Advisor of WUSC and Board Member of Women Transforming Cities International, participating in a discussion on, Women Friendly Cities Challenge, jointly organized by the National Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka and WUSC said that women have historically been excluded from city building and despite progress in many areas; there are still significant gender gaps and inequalities.
Making women friendly city is not to exclude others but to make the city more inclusive.
According to her, using a gendered-intersectional lens can eliminate the gaps and ensure that all, including young children and other vulnerable groups like the disabled and migrant community are able to fully participate in the life and economy of the city.
If a city is female friendly, it is friendly for everybody; and when women are happy and everyone is happy.
A female-friendly city is one where womens perspectives are central to the design process, and where women can safely access services such as healthcare, public transport, social services, and education with the same ease and opportunity as men.
The Women Friendly Cities Challenge is an international initiative to educate the public to make cities a safer place for women to give the proper security and safety measure. And it was launched by Women Transforming Cities International at the UN World Urban Forum, held in February, 2018.
It is a call for action to the stakeholders, organizations and academia, corporations to make unified effort to find ways and means towards making it more women friendly and nature friendly environment.
Fung said that Batticaloa district is taking the lead on the Women Friendly Cities Challenge and the Batticaloa Municipality has a vision to develop the city as a model where women could live without any discrimination and free of violence.
Noting that over 90% of Sri Lankan women endure sexual harassment on public transport, Fung highlighted the importance of improving safe public transport for women in Sri Lanka.
In addition, WUSC recommended that Sri Lanka needs to reduce barriers to women participation in paid work, strengthen girls early orientation to career development and to improve law and anti- harassment measures to create female conducive workplaces.
Speaking at the event, Ajith Colonne- Formerly from the Directorate of Internal Intelligence, Vocational Training Authority (VTA) National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) said that many Sri Lankan women in the corporate sector endure harassment mainly from those who have studied in boys school.
He suggested that Sri Lanka needs to create mixed schools as much as possible and do away with boys and girls school concept to address this issue. He also revealed that Sri Lanka administrative service comprises about 80 % of female and 20% of male labour force while education administrative service has 70 % of female and 30 % of male workforce.

Presidential election  2019
LG poll votes a deciding factor for SLFPs victory
The 15 percent of total votes obtained by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the recent local government (LG) elections, would be a deciding factor at the next Presidential and provincial council elections, Ports and Shipping Minister and SLFP Vice President and Media Spokesman Mahinda Samarasinghe said recently.
Addressing a meeting of the Minuwangoda electorates SLFP Bala Mandalaya (central organisation), he said the 15-percent vote garnered by the SLFP would keep increasing as a result of the new reorganisation plan launched by the party. The SLFPs 15-percent vote would therefore become a deciding factor for a President to gain 50.1 percent of total votes to be elected at the next Presidential election.
At the next Parliamentary election too, one would have to gain the SLFPs 15-percent vote to form a government, he said, adding that at present, certain individuals had flocked behind the Pohottuwa party due to the attraction towards former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
However, Rajapaksa could not be in politics forever; he would have to retire one day, and what would be the fate of the Pohottuwa party then, without a leader he questioned.
The minister said the Pohottuwa was puzzled today due to the inability to name its next Presidential Candidate. The utterings made by Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama proved that he was not supportive of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being the next candidate. There were many others undecided like him as well, he added.
Minister Samarasinghe said that during the last Presidential election, he rendered a dedicated effort to help former President Mahinda Rajapaksa win the election by addressing rallies countrywide, but in the end, Rajapaksa came a cropper, adding that if Rajapaksa could not win back then, how could he wish to win this time
The minister said that all those who had been drawn to the Pohottuwa party would finally end up in the SLFP.
Minuwangoda SLFP Chief Organiser Ruwan Ranatunge and Western Provincial Council member Lionel Jayasinghe participated in the event.

Say no to five sins on July <U+200B>20
Say no to five sins, a special campaign organised by the office of the Provincial Director of Health Services in the Western Province will be launched on <U+200B>July <U+200B>20 at 3 pm at Nawa Rangahala, Colombo 7, Western Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Anil Samaranayake said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday. He said the five sins are, committing road traffic accidents, breeding dengue mosquitoes, spreading HIV/AIDS, promoting diabetes and consuming drugs, alcohol and tobacco. These five sins should be prevented through a social marketing campaign, he said.
According to Dr. Samaranayake, all religions discourage people from committing these five sins. Road traffic accidents can be prevented by driving carefully. Dengue can be prevented by disposing garbage properly. HIV/AIDS is on the rise due to various reasons including a large number of foreigners coming into the country for various purposes and internal migrations. Sexual misconduct is the main reason for being infected with HIV, he added.
Diabetes is one of the most common Non Communicable Diseases on the rise. It can be prevented or controlled by food. Most Sri Lankan males do not visit health centres to be screened for NCDs even when facilities are available free of charge. The consumption of tobacco has gone down but the consumption of alcohol has gone up in Sri Lanka during the past few years. The illicit drug business has targeted schoolchildren as well, he added.
