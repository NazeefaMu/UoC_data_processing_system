Government has  taken steps to develop  rural infrastructure
The current government would rule the country until 2020 sans any hindrance, though certain power-hungry elements attempt to come into power, said Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
The Minister was addressing a meeting that was held in support of United National Party (UNP) candidates contesting the upcoming local government (LG) elections, at Meegahapitiya, Dambagalla, on Wednesday. Minister Madduma Bandara said the government has taken all measures to improve the infrastructure of rural areas and uplift the living standards of the people.
He said under the i-Road Project, the government plans to carpet 700 km of roads in Moneragala, this year, which would benefit many.
The government earmarked Rs. 8 million to provide laptops to AL students in order to boost their computer literacy, he said.
"The memories of the people are still fresh that it was the UNP government that commenced the provision of free uniforms and text books," the Minister said.
He said the UNP government maintained good discipline and democracy within the party, which was evident when the government requested former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka to resign from his position when he was accused of bond scams, even before the case was filed against him.
The minister added that UNP party leaders decided to remove Ravi Karunanayaka from the Deputy leadership of the party, casually, yet, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) does nothing to the wrongdoers within their party today. Social development Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake also addressed the meeting.

MR is attempting to destroy SLFP by supporting Pohottuwa
The same thing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did at the 2010 presidential elections to rival candidate Sarath Fonseka, is being repeated today against President Maithripala Sirisena, for thwarting the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFPs) political power, said SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake at a local government election public meeting held recently at Horowpothana.
Being a SLPFer himself, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, by insisting that people vote for Pohottuwa, has tarnished the image of the SLFP. It was the former president who once admired Sarath Fonseka, uttering that he was an efficient and brave war hero who led the war against terrorism to victory; but in 2010, seeking vengeance on Fonseka for contesting the presidential elections against him, Rajapaksa put him behind bars. With the blessings of the former president, a new political party was formed with the intention of retaliating against President Sirisena and curbing his political future, Minister Dissanayake added.
The minister further said, If Mahinda Rajapaksa truly loved the SLFP and its members who hoisted him to the position of the countrys president twice, would he urge SLFPers to be members of another political party Although we loved Mahinda Rajapaksa, he seemed to hate us; the SLFPers. As such, voters, especially SLFP supporters, should not allow themselves to be hoodwinked or cheated by hippocratic and disappointing political leaders any further and should not to contribute to the fragmentation of the longstanding SLFP party.
Do not waste your franchise by voting for the JVP, for they dont have the strength they boast about to convert villages into heaven. On the other hand, the SLFP, jointly with the UNP, formed the Good Governance Government to develop the country, having curbed bribery, corruption wastage of public funds, and nepotism, in a combined and integrated way. But since the UNP is alleged to have been involved in certain fraudulent activities, intelligent UNPers who are on a political dilemma, have no other alternative than to support the SLEP, and we invite such UNPers to join hand with us, Minister Dissanayaka said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has provided Rs. 500 million for development work in the Galle District, said Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena.
The Minister was addressing a United National Party (UNP) election meeting in Samagi Mawatha, Galle.
He said they are taking steps to further improve the Karapitiya Hospital in Galle, which at present is the third largest hospital in the island.
The dental, haepatology, and lung units for children are currently being planned to be built there.
We have laid the foundation stone for a Rs. 250-million, seven-storeyed childrens hospital complex, and we will complete it in 2019, the minister said.
The Home Affairs Ministry, he said, has relieved many grants from the Asian Development Bank and added that those funds would be used to develop dilapidated religious places (Buddhist, Hindu, Islam, and Christian) around Galle. I came into politics to work for the people, not to fill my pockets. To this day, I do not even own a Tikiri account in any bank.
After entering politics, many politicians purchase petrol sheds, hotels, and tea estates, but I will help the general public purchase hotels and petrol sheds, he added.
He asked that the public vote for the UNP and ensure their majority in Galle at the upcoming local government polls.

SLFP against removal of MRs civic rights
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will not support the removal of civic rights of Mahinda Rajapaksa but legal action should be taken under civil and criminal laws against the former President, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday, the State minister stressed that depriving a persons of his or her civic rights was against the policies of the SLFP.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Large Scale Corruption and Fraud (PRECIFAC) recommended that legal action be taken against MP Rajapaksa, his brothers and several ministers and officials of the previous regime over charges of corruption and fraud.
The SLFP will not take part in the process of depriving Rajapaksa of his civic rights but the SLFP stands for taking legal action under civil and criminal laws against the alleged financial malpractices of Rajapaksa, the State minister further explained.

421 incidents of election violence reported - NEMIHR
A total of 421 incidents of election violence have been reported since the government declared the Local Government Election, The Chief Executive of Network for Election Monitoring Dr. Uditha Gunasekara said.
According to Dr. Gunasekara, 264 acts of illegal propaganda activities, 78 acts of making unnecessary influences on public opinion, 42 acts of violence, 11 incidents of using public servants for election campaigns, eight incidents of misusing state properties, seven acts of police being biased and six acts of appointing, promoting and transferring public servants had been reported during the same period.
There is a improvement of the quality of this election campaign when comparing with the election campaigns took place since 1997. There is a significant decrease in acts of violence and their nature. Not giving any special opportunity for financially strong candidates is a special plus point in this election campaign which ensures free and fair election with equal opportunities for all candidates, he said.
The tough election laws, rules and regulations imposed by the Election Commission has made it impossible for the candidates to carry out their election campaigns without hazards. They are going through a tough time due to the rules and regulations. Some election laws have created certain unnecessary conflicts, he added.

70th  Independence and Youth
To identify their role for a sustainable future
For the 70th Independence Day which is to be held on the 4th of February this year (2018), the youth have come together in celebrating Independence Day for the very first time in Sri Lanka. Under the theme 70th Independence and Youth, the forum on February 4, 2018, will be held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute from 2.00 p.m. onwards, organized by The Road to Rights Youth-led Organization.
Under this theme, the plan is to bring the youth together from various platforms to have an intelligent dialogue on many cross cutting issues found in Sri Lanka. The National Independence Day is celebrated throughout the country, mainly in Colombo, with parades, the hoisting of flags and nationally televised speeches. However, the youth does not have any contribution when it comes to this except for the participation in parades conducted in schools. Sri Lanka went through many a struggle in gaining independence which was something that every person must reflect on and value. However, it is time for the youth to reflect on their past achievements, especially in bringing about a discussion among the youth on where it was right and where it went wrong in the process of building a better future for Sri Lanka.
After the gaining of Independence in 1948, there were two major youth struggles which took place in 1971 and also in 1981, including the conflict in the North, where we lost more than 200,000 youth. Behind these struggles, the main reason was the need to live, to have an income and to be employed. Including these incidents, Sri Lanka has been going through various social transformations politically, economically and socially. Today in year 2018, we stand on the post-war era, where there were many transformations taking place in the country. As a young generarion, we have a key role to play in contributing to the nation building process, while identifying ourselves as global citizens. This was the reason why, as a youth-led organization the 'Road to Rights' is bringing in the 70th Independence and Youth, to create a conversation among the youth to identify their role in drawing the way to a sustainable future.
The 70th Independence & Youth Forum would take place with two panel discussions under some major points relating to youth and society, and it would consist of three key speakers, who would they would be delivering a speech leading to an open discussion with the participation of youth. There would be 150 young individuals representing leading youth networks, organizations, various sectors, as well as young professionals, young entrepreneurs, social media influencers, and journalists.
We also plan on incorporating the outcomes of this forum into a formal document which would be presented to the President, the Prime Minister and other policy decision-makers in the country. It would also be posted to the social media, blogs and websites. Delegates would have the opportunity to interact with the speakers, while the Forum would be live streaming on many websites. We will also mobilize young people to engage in the forum virtually through leading volunteer networks.

Abortive Coup detat
Many perceived the botched attempt as a last ditch effort by the military elite to safeguard their eroding position. Rapid Sinhalisation of all facets of the government and paying scant respect to the aspirations of other ethnic groups also contributed to the campaign led by N.Q. Dias, the Defence Secretary, who championed the Sinhala-Buddhist cause and Minister, Felix Dias Bandaranaikes speech in support of an authoritarian system of government.
It was exactly 56 years ago that a conspiracy by military and police high-ups along with a senior civil servant, propelled by an overriding feeling of loss of power and the status that they enjoyed planned to take over the administration from a democratically elected government saying that the politicians were ruining the country through maladministration. The coup, code named, Operation Holdfast was expected to be accomplished within a few hours.
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who continued her slain husbands language and socialist policies they thought as inexperienced, weak, and unfit to govern, and therefore should be replaced. According to strategy, she was to be arrested on her return from Kataragama on the night of 27th.
As per blueprint, at 10 p.m. senior DIG, C.C. Dissanayake was to issue a Take post order. Seizure of Colombo city and cordoning it off was deemed important to resist a potential counter-strike. Ex- DIG, Sydney de Zoysa co-ordinating Army and Police operations from field force HQs, Col. Maurice de Mel at Army headquarters; Col. F.C. de Saram was to position himself at Temple Trees with Dissanayake at Queens House. ASP Johnpillai will clear strategically important highways, all main roads of traffic, while Douglas Liyanage, played a silent role. Officials, N.Q. Dias, DIG- S.A. Dissanayake (Jingle) who was twin brother of C.C. Dissanayake (Jungle), Senior ministers including Felix Dias Bandaranaike, acting Navy chief and the SP- John Attygalle were to be arrested and dispatched to an underground bunker at the armoury. A junta of coup leaders was to run the show in the first phase and the second a council of ex-Prime Ministers coup leaders and the G-G and back to democracy under a new constitution
Telegraph Exchange and the CTO was to be shut down; Police headquarters, Lake House, Times, and the only electronic communication institute, Radio Ceylon were to be seized by 11 p.m.
Acting Navy commander Kadirgamar, Army commander Maj-Gen. Wijeykoon, Air Force chief, Barker and IGP Abeykoon were entirely in the dark about the conspiracy. On successful accomplishment of the coup the leaders would meet G-G and request for the suspension of the constitution and take direct authority. This original plan went awry with cancellation in Sirimavos itinerary. The conspirators feared that she had come to know of the coup. As a contingency Lt. Col Willie Abraham was moved into Temple Trees.
It was on January 27, during their regular morning walks on Galle Face that Dissanayake uncovered the idea to his subordinate, Stanley Senanayake SP, inviting him to join. However, Senanayake remained non-committal and that afternoon he declined the offer. Realizing that he had misapprehended Senanayake, he kept mulling over. There were reservations among the core members comprising the De Mel brothers, De Saram, De Zoysa and Dissanayake about the viability of going ahead as designed. Stanley Senanayake wrestling with his morals for hours told his wife Maya, daughter of P. de S. Kularatne, who was a Parliamentarian, about the intended conspiracy. She spoke to her father around 6 p.m. and Kularatne informed the IGP and Felix Dias Bandaranaike of the scheme, who immediately got into counter action.
The conspirators sensed Senanayake spilling the beans, had met around 9 p.m. and decided to give up the plan. By mid night, except for De Saram, the rest were apprehended. After a prolonged trial 11 out of 24 were found guilty, but later discharged by the Privy Council in UK, on a technical point.
Sir John Kotelawala and Dudley Senanayake 
In a statement to Parliament on February 13, Felix Dias Bandaranaike revealed that a police officer in his statement had said about the involvement of Sir John Kotelawala and Dudley Senanayake. Dudley promptly and vehemently denied any involvement and volunteered to face an inquiry. Not only UNPers, some government Parliamentarians too pooh-poohed it as a fabrication by Felix. Journalist H. Ludowyk, addressed a manuscript named The story of a coup de-tat to J.R. Jayewardene (Mss 321 JRJ Centre) states that, Felix himself an interested party,. . unethically using judicial powers, investigated suspects in secret. . . , wrongfully detained, and ill-treated to destroy their integrity and morale for the purpose of extorting confessions of guilt.
The Criminal Law Special Provisions Act no. 1 of 1962 with Draconian provisions was passed with retrospective effect introducing a Trial-at-bar with three SC judges. It also made provisions for accepting a statement by a suspect as valid evidence against any of the suspects indicted. However, JR., responding to interviews by Professor K. M. de Silva, the author of his biography, stated, that at a meeting with Sir John on April 13, 1966, he learnt from the latter that both Sir John and Dudley had been involved in the planned attempt. He further says,
Yet we have uncovered very solid evidence of his involvement in the coup. Was he driven by a personal animosity against Sirimavo so deep-rooted that he would countenance any measures to bring down her government Or was it that, in his view, the government incompetent in handling the countrys affairs. . .damaged the economy, relations between Sinhalese and minorities, that he would encourage a coup once he came to know that it was being planned Or did he believe that Felix Dias was planning a coup of his own in association of men like N. Q. Dias, and that he would look upon this military coup as a genuine counter-coup, a very necessary measure of preventive action He carried this secret with him to the grave and so we will never know. --The JRJ biography (vol. ii- page 114):
JR Jayewardenes role 
Sir Olivers reputation suffered with his removal from office as G-G a month later. JR told Esmond Wickremesinghe Lake House boss, [PMs father] and JRs political ally, who influenced Sir John to make a written statement on January 11, 1968. (Copy preserved at the J.R. Jayewardene Centre). The two professors, who interviewed Sir John on September 15, 1979, write (page 116, vol ii) He explained how the coup leaders had met him . . . far from discouraging them, asked them to be extremely cautious in what they were doing. . . . and told them to get the support of Dudley and Sir Oliver,. . . he stated that the meeting to finalize the coup took place at Kitulwatta stores, an abandoned plumbago store house in Borella, owned by him and the next at his Kandawala residence, on January 26, both chaired by Dudley.
The author professor, in 1979, spoke to coup leaders F. C. de Saram, D. Liyanage and Royce de Mel for interviews, who declined, but after Horowitzs book, Coup Theories and Officer Motives, that included interviews by most of them, de Mel, [who was made Chairman of Shipping Corporation by JR] divulged his knowledge of Sir Johns and Dudleys alleged roles. Explaining his meetings with both at the plumbago go-down in Borella and at Kandawala, he said, Dudley was billed to address the Junta shortly after midnight on January 27, at the Independence Hall, Torrington Square, after the success of the coup. A smart, but pitiable mud-slinging attempt or a conspiracy within a conspiracy instigated by Jayewardenes and Kotalawalas on Senanaykes.

All Blacks legend Carter hints Japan will be last hurrah
Hong Kong, Thursday: All this week with his French club Racing 92, for the Natixis Cup exhibition fixture against South Africa's Sharks, the 35-year-old said retirement was looming fast.
Carter, widely hailed as the best fly-half to grace the game, will see out this season with Racing before embarking on a two-year stint with Kobelco Steelers, which will straddle the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.
"It's (retirement) obviously just around the corner... but exactly what I do, I'm not a hundred percent sure yet," he said, ahead of Saturday's game.
"But you know I'm still really enjoying playing and that's why I signed to play a couple more years in Japan so that'll take me through to 2020, sort of mid-2020... that's when my contract finishes in Japan."
Speculation has been high about Carter's plans after he stops playing but the two-time World Cup winner, now retired from national duty, said he had his eye on the commercial side of rugby, rather than coaching.
"I think immediately after rugby going straight into coaching you know, I don't think I'll be ready for that," he said, when asked about coaching the All Blacks.
"To be honest the coaches work harder than players. They're away every weekend for games, it's quite a big commitment."
'One-legged players'
Carter played 112 times for New Zealand and remains the highest points-scorer in Test history.
He moved to Racing in 2015, winning the prestigious Top 14 in his first season and helping the team reach the European Champions Cup final in 2016 -- a first for the club and "a huge achievement" for Carter.
Though he has suffered a string of injuries in recent months, he says he is working hard to be fit and return to the team for the latter part of the season.
His decision to join the Steelers was mocked by outspoken Toulon boss Mourad Boudjellal, who scoffed that he would be playing against "one-legged players" in Japan's Top League.
But it has been met with enthusiasm in Japan, where the Steelers' team director is hoping Carter will boost rugby's profile as the country prepares to host the World Cup.
Carter said the sport had already caught on, particularly after Japan's shock upset of South Africa in the 2015 World Cup.
"I've seen how much rugby has grown in Japan and also Asia over the last couple of years," he said.
"Obviously it doesnt compete with the likes of baseball and sumo wrestling and things like that, but I think leading into the World Cup it's going to increase."
Dan-san
Carter is not the first big name to make the switch to the East Asian country, which often attracts top-level veteran players -- with mixed results.
Ex-Wallaby George Smith, who plays for Suntory Sungoliath, was arrested in Tokyo recently for allegedly assaulting a taxi driver, and in 2013 the late former All Blacks flanker Jerry Collins was arrested for illegally carrying a kitchen knife.
But Carter, who suffered a dent to his own image after a drink-driving charge in Paris last year, said having more top players in Japan could inspire a new generation of fans.
He said the shorter rugby season made Japan appealing for foreigners, and named Australians Matt Giteau and Adam Ashley Cooper, as well as New Zealand's Andy Ellis, as among the familiar faces he hoped would help him settle in.
"With the season structures, you know it works out pretty well and a lot of guys are starting to play in Japan and also play Super Rugby as well... Not for me, bit old for that now," he said.
Asked if he planned to learn Japanese -- after trying his hand at French -- Carter promised he'd give it a try.
"I think it's one of the requirements as well to learn Japanese. I don't think I'll be very good at it... but I think it's important that you learn the basics and are able to communicate, so yeah, give it a go." AFP

Apple, Amazon, Alphabet:  The race to a trillion dollars
When it comes to predictions for 2018, most financial analysts agree on one thing: one tech firm is likely to become Americas first ever trillion dollar company. The question is: which one will it be
On Thursday, well get a big clue as to who might hit that incredible milestone first, as the three biggest tech giants in the US release their latest results.
Could it be Apple
That largely depends on its latest and supposedly greatest smartphone, the iPhone X.
If sales are strong - and theyll need to be very strong - Apples value will hurtle towards a trillion dollars in no time at all.
With a higher price tag - $999 - the iPhone X wouldnt need to break sales records in order to draw record profits, and convince investors Apple still has the ability to bring innovation to its biggest product line by far. But there have been reports lately that suggested Apple could cut its production targets for the device by almost half. Thats not what investors wanted to hear.
Still, even if iPhone X sales are modest, the company is still expected to report revenue growth of more than 10%. That would put it nicely on track to hit a market value of $1tn by the end of the year.
But Amazon might get there first.
Chief executive Jeff Bezos is now comfortably the worlds richest man. The share price of his company rose by more than 50% in 2017. Most of that was fuelled by big growth in its cloud business - Amazon Web Services. But the company now also has Whole Foods in its portfolio. There is talk of increased synergy opportunities here - the overlap of Amazon tech and Whole Foods physical locations could be extremely lucrative. BBC News

Asian shares bounce back, but  rising U.S. yields pose risks
Asian shares eked out modest gains on Thursday, clawing back sharp losses from earlier this week, however, rising U.S. bond yields and interest rates could dampen investors optimism toward the global economic outlook.
The U.S. Federal Reserve flagged interest policy tightening later this year and upgraded inflation outlook, at its policy meeting that ended on Wednesday, its first in 2018 and last to be chaired by Janet Yellen, who will be replaced by governor Jerome Powell on Feb 3. It kept interest rates on hold as expected.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.1 percent in early trade, slowly recovering after Tuesday's 1.4 percent fall. Japan's Nikkei .N225 also gained, rising 1.3 percent from a four-week low hit the previous day.
U.S. S&P 500 mini futures ESc1 gained 0.4 percent in Asian trade on Thursday, helped by 1.4 percent gains in Facebook (FB.O) in after-hours trading following the companys solid earnings.
Later in the day, three U.S. tech giants, Apple (AAPL.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) will announce earnings.
Investors have been expecting strong profit growth in U.S. firms due to a sound global growth, with U.S. President Donald Trumps tax cuts seen giving an additional boost to Corporate Americas bottom line.
Economic data released overnight underscored the strength of the global economy. ADP payrolls data in the United States showed job increases of 234,000 in January, 49,000 more than economists forecast.
Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, a private business survey, came at 51.5, matching Decembers reading, which was the highest in four months, showing growth in Chinas manufacturing sector remained elevated in January.
The U.S. is cutting tax and spending $1.5 trillion in infrastructure when the economy is really strong. There would be little wonder if the economy overheats, said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
For a growing number of investors, the biggest worry now is that the economy may accelerate too fast, lifting inflation and prompting central banks to tighten their monetary policy faster.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note - the benchmark for world lending - briefly shot up to 2.754 percent, a level last seen in April 2014. It last stood at 2.725 percent US10YT=RR. Investors inflation expectations have also risen to 3 1/2-year high of 2.12 percent based on the so-called breakeven inflation (BEI) rate calculated by the gap between conventional bonds and inflation-protected bonds US10YTIP=RR.
U.S. interest rate futures are now almost fully pricing in three rate hikes this year, compared to twice at the start of year, with some now talking about the possibility of four rate hikes.
The dollars weakness and higher oil prices are boosting inflation expectations in the United States, which in turn is boosting U.S. bond yields, said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC Securities. (BBC)

Authorities say Royal etiquette guide is fake

The Foreign Affairs Ministry and the British High Commission said today that a document circulating on social media, giving advice on how to interact with the visiting British Royal family, is fake.
The one-page guide, is written in Sinhala, appears to be authored by a group called the Welcome Committee of British Royals.
But in a joint media statement, the Foreign Ministry and High Commission said the pamphlet was not genuine, and that no such committee had been set up.
The document contains of a list of guidelines for interacting with the visiting Earl and Countess of Wessex, who are visiting for the countrys 70thanniversary of Independence.
When meeting them, men should bow down, and women should always curtsy, the document says.
It also says never to turn your back on a member of the royal family, not to look directly into their eyes, and not to take pictures with them.
Anyone who does not follow royal greeting etiquette could face legal action, it says.
Dont forget that they were the last royals to rule Sri Lanka, so you have to be respectful to them, the document concludes.

Basils almanac case interim  order extended till March 16
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga currently presiding over Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court, until March 16.
Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne made this order consequent to a Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Court was informed that the Attorney General had filed objections against the interim order on last Monday (29).
The petitioner was directed to file his counter objections before March 15.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other court of the High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga also delivered the judgment regarding the Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
On November 15, the High Court case against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was fixed for trial to be heard on a day-to-day basis beginning November 24 by Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January 2015 Presidential election.
Counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Basil Rajapaksa. Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for Attorney General.

British PM wants free trade  deal with China
Britain is seeking a free trade agreement with China, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday as she flew to the country for talks with Chinese leaders, adding that more should be done immediately to open up market access for British firms.
The ambitious long-term goal of securing a free trade deal with the world's second-largest economy comes as May begins a three-day visit to China accompanied by businesses from sectors where Britain feels it can capitalize on China's growing middle class consumers and rapidly expanding services sector.
China is a country that we want to do a trade deal with, May told reporters aboard her Royal Air Force jet on the way to Wuhan - a university city where she will announce half a billion pounds worth of education deals. But, I think that there is more we can be doing in the interim...in terms of looking at potential barriers to trade and the opening up of markets to ensure...British businesses able to do good trade into China.
China accounts for just a small proportion of British exports, 3.1 percent in 2016, compared with 43 percent for the European Union.
While diplomatic sources say China has expressed willingness to talk about a future free trade deal with Britain, formal talks cannot begin until Britain officially leaves the EU next year. Free trade talks typically take many years to conclude.
Britain has also pushed a strong message to Chinese companies that it is fully open for business. Notable Chinese investments in Britain include the Hinkley C nuclear power station which is being built by China General Nuclear Power Corp and the British arm of France's EDF while British firms such as Rolls Royce have won large deals from Chinese firms to supply items like plane engines.
Both May and senior Chinese officials have restated their commitment to a golden era in ties but a row over May's decision to delay approval for the Chinese-funded Hinkley nuclear plant in late 2016 chilled relations.
However, Britain was the first Western country to sign up to the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Britain sent Finance Minister Philip Hammond to a Beijing summit last year about President Xi Jinping's flagship 'Belt and Road Initiative' - a trillion-dollar infrastructure-led push to build a modern Silk Road.
May said the Belt and Road had huge potential, but cautioned that the project had to be carried out in the proper way. What I would like to see is ensuring that we have transparency and international standards being adhered to, and I will be discussing that with my Chinese interlocutors, she said.
May also said she would raise the future of Hong Kong in her meetings with Xi, underlining Britain's commitment to the 'one country, two systems' rule in the former British colony.
Britain's last governor in Hong Kong before it was handed back to the Chinese, Chris Patten, had written to May on Monday urging her to raise concerns over the increasing threats to the basic freedoms, human rights and autonomy in the territory.
Hong Kong was rocked by pro-democracy protests in 2014 in the largest show of defiance against Beijing rule since 1997. The government has since cracked down on activists, including last week banning one from running in a by-election in March. We believe that the future of Hong Kong, that one country, two systems future is important. We are committed to that, May said.
I've raised this in the past with President Xi, and he's shown commitment to that but I will continue to raise it with him. BBC

Cabinet Decisions
Prohibiting use of state property for political promotions during elections
The Cabinet approved a proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena to submit the Election Commission Gazette No. 2048/2 of December 4, 2017, which prohibited the use of state property for political promotions work during the election period.
The gazette formulated by the election commission under section 104 B (4) subsection A of the Constitution, prohibits the use of movable or immovable state property to promote a political party or group of candidates or to cause an injustice to those parties or obstruction to a free and fair election.

Restriction of unauthorised use of railway reservation lands 
The Cabinet also took a decision to take action against the unauthorised use of railway reservation lands. The total extent of railway reserves was about 1,4000 acres.
Of these lands, around 10 percent has been leased out to various parties, while 80 percent of the balance land was under unauthorised use.
The ordinary public was among the majority of encroaches, while certain present and retried employees were also among the unauthorised occupants.

Implementing Customs duty concessions fourth round under APTA
The Cabinet approved a proposal by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, to issue and order under Revenue Protection Act No. 19 of 1962, to implement the fourth round of Customs duty concessions under the AsiaPacific Trade Agreement (APTA) and submit it for Parliamentary approval.

Establishment of think tank forum for fisheries sector
The Cabinet approved a proposal by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, to Establish a think tank forum for the progress of the fisheries sector, The forum would include economists, environmentalists, lawyers, marine engineers, Naval and wave architects, social serenlists representatives of the fisheries and tourists industries, and fishermen.
The forum is expected to formulate a policy for sustainable use and management of Sri Lankan marine resources towards achieving economic development.

Requesting CGPCS to establish marine operations secretariat in Sri Lanka
The Cabinet also approved a proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity of Defence Minister, to request the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), to establish its marine operations secretariat in Sri Lanka.
Construction of additional lane on entrance, exit of Ja-Ela interchange
The Cabinet approved a proposal by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, to construct an additional lane on the entrance and exit at the Ja-Ela interchange of the Colombo Katunayake Highway, in order to expedite manual toll collection. Although electronic toll collection has been introduced at the interchange, more motorists have preferred manual toll collection, causing a heavy rush at the manual toll collection gate. An additional lane would help ease the congestion.

Introducing legislation to de-mutualise Colombo Stock Exchange
The Cabinet also approved a proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity of National Policy and Economic Affairs Minister, to introduce legislation towards the de-mutualisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The Colombo Stock Exchange, established in 1985 as a non-profit limited liability company, is the main stock exchange in South Asia which functions as a collective stock exchange. It should be established as a de-mutualised stock exchange or a profit-earning company in order to ensure proper control and promote ownership for diversified stocks.

Capita shares collapse after warning on profits
Capita shares have plunged almost 50% after the outsourcing firm warned on profits and announced a major shake-up.
New chief executive Jonathan Lewis said the company had become too complex and driven by a short-term focus and needed to change its approach.
Capita, which issued a series of profit warnings last year, has again cut its profit forecast and revealed plans to raise 700m by issuing new shares.
The move comes after outsourcing rival Carillion collapsed earlier this month.
Capita operates the London congestion charge, runs the governments Jobseekers Allowance helpline and administers the teachers pension scheme. It also collects the TV licence fee on behalf of the BBC.
Shares ended the day 47% lower at 182.5p, prompting calls from Labour and trade unions for urgent government action to avoid another Carillion.
A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said as a strategic supplier Capita was always monitored by the government.
The firm employs 70,000 people, about 50,000 of whom are in the UK.
According to Tussell, a firm which analyses UK public sector contracts, Capita won 154 government contracts last year.
Lewis, who took over two months ago, said a review had found the company worked across too many markets and services, meaning it was difficult to maintain a competitive advantage in every business.
Capita had relied too much on acquisitions to drive growth and had also seen weakness in new contracts, he added.
The company does have some financial strengths. It can call on 1bn in cash and credit facilities, has a significantly higher profit margin than Carillion did and has been taking steps to reduce its debt burden.

Chicken-flavoured energy drink for working dogs
Scientists have developed a new chicken-flavoured energy drink for canines that can safely hydrate working sniffer dogs who are at risk of heat stroke in hot weather.
Dogs did not suffer from a buildup of electrolytes from the drink, researchers said.
The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, suggests that electrolyte drinks are a safe hydration alternative to plain water or injected electrolytes for sniffer dogs.
A previous study had reported that dogs who were offered a non-flavoured electrolyte drink, drank very little of it.
The chicken flavouring may have been key, making the dogs think they were having a tasty treat, researchers said.
People use different techniques to hydrate working dogs, said Cynthia Otto of the University of Pennsylvania in the US.
Dog handlers disagree about the most effective method, and since there was no data on the safety or effectiveness of each technique, we wanted to provide some clarity, said Otto.
Working dogs, such as search and rescue dogs or police dogs, are crucial assistants when authorities respond to disasters or check for contraband at border crossings.
These dogs often work in challenging environments, and can sometimes exert themselves to the point of exhaustion and heat stroke.
In fact, hot weather can be dangerous for working dogs, as dogs do not sweat much and rely on panting to cool themselves, meaning they can overheat easily.
The risk of heat stroke increases with dehydration, so one effective way to help working dogs stay safe is to keep them hydrated.
However, there are different ways to do this. The classic hydration technique is to provide free access to plain drinking water.
A second technique involves delivering water and electrolytes through a needle under the skin, which is known as subcutaneous hydration.
Drinks containing electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, are a third option, but these are controversial.
Such drinks make sense as a rehydration aid for humans, as we lose electrolytes when we sweat. However dogs sweat very little, leading critics to say that the drinks could cause an unhealthy buildup of electrolytes in dogs. The research team investigated these three common hydration strategies in a group of sniffer dogs who inspect vehicles at the Texas border, during the hot summer months. The team took a variety of measurements for each dog, including their hydration levels, fluid intake and work performance.
All three hydration strategies appear to be effective, and the dogs showed similar behaviour, body temperature, and work performance regardless of the way they were hydrated.
In this controlled setting, all the hydration techniques were safe and effective, said Otto.
Dogs receiving a chicken-flavoured electrolyte drink drank significantly more fluid and had greater hydration levels. These dogs did not suffer from a buildup of sodium, a component of electrolyte drinks that could have negative effects in the body in large quantities.

## Title: COLOMBOS  WETLANDS  AT RISK
## Supertitle:

COLOMBOS  WETLANDS  AT RISK
There is a breeze in Diyasuru Park that feels distinctly un-Colombo. The air is more lush, the birds more diverse, the grass more green. The park, located near the Parliament building in Thalawathugoda, is 18 hectares of urban wetland. And its one of the few the city has left.
Colombo is drying upliterally. Since the 1980s, the city has lost almost 60 percent of its wetland area. Today, on World Wetlands Day, its more crucial than ever to consider why all of this mattersand why the fight to save Colombos remaining wetlands is one that should involve each and every one of us.

What are wetlands
Simply put, wetlands are land areas that are saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, and thereby take on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. They are distinguished from other landforms or bodies of water by the vegetation of their aquatic plants, which adapt to unique hydric soil. Colloquially, wetlands are also known as marshes or swamps.

Unfortunately, wetlands get a bad rap. People dismiss them as smelly breeding grounds for disease. This public perception is in some ways understandable, said Senior Researcher Human and Environmental Health at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) Dr. Priyanie Amerasinghe, due to the potential for some subspecies of disease-transmitting mosquitoes to call wetlands home. And yes, wetlandslike any element of naturemight occasionally smell funky.
But the current emphasis on the negative aspects of wetlands is wholly distorted and obscures all the good that they do for cities. And their undeserved reputation, coupled with a drive toward development in a city short on space that dates back to the colonial era and lasts to this day, has led to the degradation and near-elimination of Colombos wetlands.

On the verge of disappearing
Due to its strategic location alongside and at the mouth of the Kelani River, Colombo has for millennia served as a sea port, connecting Sri Lanka and the east more generally with the west. In fact, almost every suggested etymology of the citys name contains references to the water bodies which have for so long sustained it. One theory is that the word Colombo, first introduced by Portuguese colonists in the year 1505, is derived from the Sinhalese Kolon Thota, or port on the river Kelani. Another holds that Colombo was derived from the Sinhalese Kola-amba-thota, or Harbour with leafy mango trees.
Regardless of its etymology, though, one thing was clear to all who passed through Colombo, from Arab traders in the eighth century to the various colonists who followed. The citys identity is inextricably tied to its water bodies.
Deputy General Manager Wetland Management at the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) Dr. N. S. Wijayarathna explained that the Dutch, over the course of their colonial rule in Sri Lanka, further sophisticated a canal system initiated by King Parakramabahu VIII of Kotte in the 15th century, leaving behind a legacy of harnessing the citys wetland identity for transport that is apparent even today.
Dr. Wijayarathna added that the British colonial impact on the citys wetlands remains, too. However, it is one not of transportation or utilization but degradationor, technically speaking, reclamation.
Land reclamation is the process of draining or otherwise filling seabeds, riverbeds, or lake beds to create new land. Its how the Colombo Port City is being built in the Indian Ocean today. And since the British colonial era, and the drive to develop the country that accompanied independence, reclamation has been happening to Colombos wetlands at an increasingly, near-unbelievably rapid pace, as if an occult hand were doing the filling.
Wetland measurement in Colombo began in earnest in the 1980s. Since then, the city has been losing an average of 1.2 percent of its wetlands each year from both reclamation and indiscriminate dumping of solid waste. Once making up 60 percent of the Colombo metropolitan area, wetlands now occupy just 20 square kilometers of the city.
Just as critical, in two thirds of the remaining wetlands, water quality is considered extremely poor due to untreated domestic wastewater. According to Dr. Amerasinghe of IWMI, the situation has become critical in the last five years, threatening the ecological health of wetlands, a situation made worse by routine dredging and drainage.
Though there once were, there are currently no wetlands left in Colombo from the extent between Beira Lake to the BMICH complex. Theyve been replaced with homes and high rises, office complexes and shopping centers, roads and landfills. Estimates from IWMI project that if the current trend of wetland loss isnt reversed, wetland area in Colombo will decline by an additional one third over the next two decades.

What wetlands do for cities
Regardless of its etymology, though, one thing was clear to all who passed through Colombo, from Arab traders in the eighth century to the various colonists who followed. The citys identity is inextricably tied to its water bodies
This is bad. Really bad. Colombos urban wetlands are not optional; theyre indispensable. During a tour of three of Colombos remaining wetlands organized by IWMI, various experts in the field likened urban wetlands to lungs for the way they refine air, to kidneys for the way they absorb waste and filter out pollutants and contaminants. In performing these bodily functions, wetlands help reduce the incidence of various cardiopulmonary, respiratory, and otherwise infectious diseases. But thats not all.
Wetlands also combat climate change; they store or sequester carbon doubly and, through evaporative cooling, reduce extreme temperatures across at least half of urban Colombo. They mitigate flooding; with a capacity to store enough water to fill 27,000 Olympic-size swimming pools, Colombos wetlands are estimated to contain 39 percent of the citys storm water. They harbour extensive biodiversity, providing a habitat for more than 250 plant species and 280 animal speciesa significant number of which are critically endangered. And nearly 90 percent of the wetlands contribute to urban food supplies through the production of rice, vegetables, and dairy and poultry products, as well as through fishing and gathering of native plants.

Nadeera Rajapakse Rubaroe, a wetlands ecologist and consultant for the World Bank, put it this way: Colombos wetlands provide so many services for the city that we cant afford to lose even one inch more.
The economicside of things
Rubaroes word choice, calling further wetland loss unaffordable, is key. Sure, naysayers might concede, conservation of wetlands is an environmental issue. But is it an economic one as well
According to Lucy Emerton, an environmental economist, the answer is a resounding yes.
Emerton, the Director of Conservation Economics & Finance at the Environment Management Group, has spent her career studying biodiversity and ecosystem valuation. Across continents, she strives to make the business case for environmental arguments. In her view, wetlands are a type of urban infrastructure that must be valued as such.
The goal is to shift peoples perceptions, from seeing wetlands as unproductive wastes of land [that would benefit from reclamation] to seeing them as valuable, she said.
How do we recalculate the balance sheets so that when both private and public investments are made, we actually look at the services of the wetlands, their economic services, and realize that rather than being a barrier to urban development, wetlands are a key part of the infrastructure we need to live in cities
Emerton provided the Maha Oya river estuary, which is currently being degraded due to sand mining within it, as an example.
The big challenge here is recognizing that sand mining may generate important income, but its also costing the government and the private sector a lot of money. By undermining the hydrology of the river and the transport of sediments, its also having a horrific effect on coastal erosion.
She referenced a study that analyzed the economic cost of the sand mining, and explained how continued degradation would cost water users, the fisheries sector, and the tourism sector, and would as well force the government budget to be spent on infrastructure redevelopment. Environmental Foundation Limited, who conducted the study, calculated the cost to be over Rs. 35 billion over the next twenty five yearsmany times more, she said, than the money generated by degrading the wetlands.
As well, Rubaroe of the World Bank estimated that better conservation of wetlands could have saved Colombo millions of rupees in costs incurred from flood damage over the past decade.
What next

The Ramsar Convention, named after the Iranian city in which an international treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands was signed in 1971, is a convention on wetlands that gathers representatives from its contracting parties every three years to improve the implementation of its objectives. Following the most recent meeting in June 2015 in Uruguay, the conventions secretariat put out a call for applications for Wetland City Accreditationa scheme that encourages cities near wetlands to increase public awareness of the value of these ecosystems in municipal planning and decision making.
Colombo is drying upliterally. Since the 1980s, the city has lost almost 60 percent of its wetland area. Today, on World Wetlands Day, its more crucial than ever to consider why all of these matterand why the fight to save Colombos remaining wetlands is one that should involve each and every one of us
Sri Lankas Department of Wildlife Conservation submitted an application in response to the call. Accreditation will be doled out at this years Ramsar Convention, to be held in Dubai in October.
Dr. Wijayarathna of the SLLRDC sees this as a way for the city to reincarnate.
Colombo was known in colonial times as the Garden City, he said. But now we can rebrand it as the Wetland City, and with rebranding, be sure to conserve the wetlands.
Dr. Amerasinghe of IWMI explained that while the Wetland City Accreditation doesnt provide monetary funds for conservation, it isnt empty either. She insisted that the designation would help her and others in her field make the case of conserving wetlands to government officials across the political spectrum, upping the pressure on them as well by placing the city in the spotlight.
Already, some of Colombos wetlands, such as Talangama Tank in Battaramulla, have been designated as Environmental Protection Areas (EPAs) by the Central Environmental Authority under the National Environment Act of 1980. Others, such as the Thalawathugoda wetlands, now Diyasuru Park, have been developed for conservation and recreation and designated as wildlife sanctuaries by the Department of Wildlife Conservation under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance of 1937.
Going forward, Amerasinghe said, the governmentwith or without Ramsar accreditationmust do even more to ensure that wetland conservation is compatible with future urban development. As well, it must invest in rehabilitating irrigation waterways that have been polluted by previous development.
In the meantime, she said, regular citizens must recognize the benefits wetlands provide and do their part, too: cleaning up waste they see in wetlands, advocating for their conservation to politicians.
After all, at stake is no less than the fate of Colombo as a livable city.

Couple weds in toilet
A bride and groom tied the knot in a courthouse bathroom after 'unusual circumstances' nearly saw their dream wedding cancelled.
The big day was underway for Brian and Maria Schulz at Monmouth County Courthouse, where the couple's family and friends had gathered to see the pair wed. But not long after the ceremony had begun Brian's mother began to have breathing difficulties and felt an asthma attack coming on.
Quick-thinking sheriff officers took the mother-of-the-groom to the bathroom where they gave her oxygen while waiting for the paramedics to arrive.
The couple were worried for her health, but also faced the prospect of not getting married there and then.
If they did not marry that day they would have to wait 45 days for a new marriage license, and the ceremony could not continue without the groom's mother as she had signed the marriage license and needed to be present.
Not being able to leave the bathroom for fear her condition would worsen, the Schulz's were left with few options. It was then suggested the ceremony continue - in the women's bathroom.
The pair accepted the venue change, and the wedding party including Honorable Judge Katie Gummer relocated to the restroom to continue proceedings on January 2.
he new husband and wife tied the knot by the paper towel dispenser, and are said to be grateful for the courthouse staff for being so accommodating, Eyewitness News reports.
Sheriff Shaun Golden said: "I commend the sheriff's officers and EMTs involved in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the groom's mother.
As for the nuptials, the quick thinking and determination of our officers and commitment from the judge to perform the ceremony in unusual circumstances led to one happy couple. I congratulate them both and wish the mother continued health."

Cuba: Fidel Castro's son 'takes own life'

The 68-year-old son of Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro has killed himself in Havana, according to Cuban state media.
Fidel ngel Castro Daz-Balart was found on Thursday morning and is said to have suffered from depression.
The first-born son of the late president was nicknamed "Fidelito", or Little Fidel, because of the family resemblance.
He was a nuclear physicist, trained by the former Soviet Union.
"Fidel Castro Daz-Balart, who had been treated by a group of doctors for several months due to deep depression, took his life this morning," Cuba's official newspaper Granma reported.
State television said he had been receiving medical treatment as an outpatient in recent months, following a hospital stay.
At the time of his death, he was a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State and he served as vice president of Cuba's Academy of Sciences.
He headed the island's nuclear programme from 1980 to 1992, before it was suspended after the Soviet Union's collapse.
Castro Daz-Balart was born during his father's brief first marriage to Mirta Daz-Balart, the daughter of a prominent pre-revolution politician.
His maternal family went on to become prominent figures in the anti-Castro community in Florida. His cousin Mario Daz-Balart is a US congressman.
The television announcement said his funeral would be planned by his family, but no further details were given.
His father,Fidel Castro, a revolutionary figure and one of the world's longest serving political leaders, died aged 90 in 2016.

The T. B. Tennekoon Open Air Theatre in Dambulla which began construction in 2005 to further arts in the region has now been all but abandoned, complained artists in Matale.
The construction work of the theatre started with an initial capital of Rs. 10 million and construction took place in a slow pace. In 2014, the Budget allocated an additional sum of Rs. 36 million for it. But in 2015 when the government changed, construction on the theatre also came to a halt. The artists now ask what happened to all the money that was allocated for it
The Open Air Theatre now has an audience hall as well as a half built theatre and has become home to the wild animals in the area who have taken over the abandoned construction site. The area residents also complain that the audience hall is being used by certain individuals for nefarious activities, causing trouble for many who live around it.
The artists in the meantime ask that construction on this theatre be completed so that it can be used for its original purpose.

De Silva hits ton in strong  Sri Lankan reply
CHITTAGONG, Thursday: Dhananjaya de Silva struck a century and shared 187 runs in an unbroken second wicket stand with Kushal Mendis as Sri Lanka gave a strong reply to Bangladesh in the first Test in Chittagong on Thursday.
De Silva made an unbeaten 104 while Mendis hit 83 not out, guiding Sri Lanka to 187-1 at stumps on the second day.
Earlier, Rangana Herath and Suranga Lakmal took three wickets each to help the visitors dismiss Bangladesh for 513 in their first innings.
The pair came together after spinner Mehedi Hasan got rid of Dimuth Karunaratne for a duck shortly after Bangladeshs innings ended with skipper Mahmudullah Riyad unbeaten on 83.
De Silva led Sri Lankas batting charge with his aggressive approach and brought his fourth Test hundred off 122 balls with a cover drive off left-arm spinner Taijul Islam.
This is de Silvas second successive Test century after scoring an unbeaten 119 in Sri Lankas last match against India in New Delhi in December.
Bangladesh, who are now leading Sri Lanka by 326 runs, wasted two reviews against Mendis and also dropped two chances offered by the right-hander.
Mehedi dropped Mendis on four off paceman Mustafizur Rahman at second slip, before Imrul Kayes grassed another chance - this time off Mehedis bowling - with the batsman on 57.
The hosts, who resumed the day on 374-4, added 139 runs to their overnight score with Mahmudullah leading the charge on the second day.
Mahmudullah added 58 runs with debutant Sunzamul Islam for the eighth wicket, after three quick wickets rattled the home side early in the morning.
Spinner Herath brought Mominul Haques majestic knock to an end in the third over of the day when the left-handed batsman flicked a catch to Mendis at forward short-leg. He made 176. Mominul who hit 16 fours and a six, faced 214 balls and added just one run to his overnight score.
Herath struck again as Mosaddek Hossain lofted a catch to Lakshan Sandakan at mid-on after making just eight.
Mehedi took Bangladesh past 400 with a lovely straight drive off paceman Lakmal, before smashing Herath for a six. But he was soon run out for 20 by Lahiru Kumara at third man. Sunzamul made 24 runs before he was stumped off left-arm wrist spinner Sandakan.

Drop in inflation - Harsha
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said the inflation rate has been reduced to 5.8 percent and as a result there is a reduction of Rs.500 for food commodities per month.
Addressing the media at the UNP headquarters in Sirikotha yesterday, he said that there is a decrease in coconut prices as well and added that there is a reduction of Rs.229 from the expenditure on coconuts per month, according to the Household Income and expenditure survey -2017.
In the meantime, the inflation rate during the previous month (December 2017) was 7.1 percent.
De Silva refuted the recent allegations made by Basil Rajapaksa that inflation, tax and unemployment rates have increased under the present government.
He said that one should not make such statements without adequate proof and added that the Rajapaksas should go through the reports issued by Census and Statistics Department.
The recent quarterly report of the labour force survey stated that the employment rate was 7,700,489 in 2014 and it has been increased to 8,163,869 in 2017. Deputy Minister de Silva further said Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy does not have any political motives and he is determined to reduce the inflation rate.
The former government practiced an irresponsible financial management but the present Governor maintains professional stability and we are thankful for it, he said.
The Deputy Minister noted that after getting Parliamentary approval for the liability management action plan, it will be exclusively used for liability management.
He said that the action plan will deal with all prevailing issues related to loans and added that they have strategies to deal with the loan bunching issues as well.
The IMF, rating agencies and economic experts have approved the liability management action plan. But, there are a few people who continue to find faults, he said.
He added the stolen assets task force are also in the process of finding the stolen assets under the previous government.
They are mainly hidden in Dubai and many other places. No mutual legal agreements were signed. Therefore, there is no official link to look into those agreements, he said.

Duchess dj vu !  Kate takes style notes from Diana
Kate dons a custom Catherine Walker houndstooth coat that looks VERY similar to one Diana wore at Sandringham - hours after she wore the princess earrings to dinner
The Duchess of Cambridge made a serious style statement when she stepped out a houndstooth coat for her second day of engagements in Stockholm.
The red-and-white coat, custom-made by royal favourite Catherine Walker, is another bold choice for Kate, 36, who has so-far eschewed her typically safer styles in favour of standout looks for the high-profile Scandinavian tour.
It is also a subtle nod to Williams mother, Princess Diana, who wore a strikingly similar look to Sandringham nearly three decades ago.
The coat marks the second time in less than 24 hours that Kate has paid tribute to her late mother-in-law with her outfit. Last night she arrived for a black tie dinner wearing a pearl bracelet and a pair of pearl earrings that belonged to the princess.
Diana turned heads in her houndstooth jacket by luxury fashion house Moschino as she joined senior royals for Princess Eugenies Christening in December 1990.
She layered her jacket over a high-neck black blouse and paired it with a black and white skirt in the same houndstooth pattern. The ensemble was finished with low black and red pumps and a red wide-brimmed hat trimmed with a black satin ribbon.
One style expert notes that why the looks are very alike, Princess Dianas styling of the print is more daring than the Duchess, who teamed her coat with a quilted maroon bag and fringed leather pumps from Italian label Tods.
Hannah Eichler, Senior Brand Stylist at Oasis, explained: From polkadots to red coats and floaty pastel gowns, Kate Middletons wardrobe choices have long drawn inspiration from Princess Diana.
Her latest outing in Norway has proved The Duchess Of Cambridges looks continue to be synced with her late mother in law in the sartorial department.
Choosing a punchy red houndstooth coat which she teamed with matchy matchy burgundy accessories, it appears The Duchess isnt the only one who was a fan of the iconic print  Princess Diana sported a similar look back in 1990.
Whilst Princess Diana might have opted for more fashion forward styling by mixing colours instead of going tonal like Kate, it certainly proves that real style never goes out of fashion. From 1990 to 2018, houndstooth prints are a fashion mainstay.
Two days ago Kate donned a pair of Princess Dianas pearl earrings as she joined Prince William and Swedish royals for a dinner at the home of the British Ambassador in Stockholm.
The simplicity of her jewels perfectly her 1,945 saffron yellow gown. To show off the pearls, which Diana wore to a Paris state banquet in 1988, Kate wore her brunette tied back in a low chignon. She also wore a slender pearl bracelet beloved of Diana.
On the second day of their high-profile visit to Sweden, William and Kate, who is six months pregnant with the couples third child, were given a riotous reception at Matteusskolan school.
While dozens of pupils waved hand-drawn flags and bunches of flowers, one lucky youngster managed to get a high-five from the Duchess as she greeted the crowds.
Outside the couple spent about ten minutes shaking hands with the schoolchildren, with William repeatedly telling them youve got cold hands and complimenting them on the flags they were waving.

Education: bitter roots with sweeter fruits
Education is so important for our children and the future of our country. It helps our economy to grow, it helps us build our society and it develops our nation. Well-educated students become the well-educated workforce of the future  the innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders of Sri Lankas future economy.
The best investment any government can make is to get the most effective, the most talented and the best teachers to mould our children. Without a strong economy we cannot provide necessary funds to local governments. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Investing in education is an investment for the future. The UNP is investing in our future generations. The UNP in national government had already spent Rs 2.7 billion on the Suraksha insurance scheme that benefits the entire student population in the country  over 4.5 million students.
Moreover, we will be spending another Rs 3.5 billion on the 13 years of education programme which ensures and guarantees 13 years of compulsory education for each school going child in this country so that our children are able to make more informed decisions about their futures when they leave school. On top of that the government has launched another scheme, the Nearest School is the Best School which has provided more physical infrastructure facilities for almost 10,000 schools in the country, with an investment of Rs 64 billion. This will help raise standards of education in our most rural areas.
Shortly we have crucial local government elections. The UNPs presence at the local level following these elections will determine the future of your local economy. A strong UNP presence in local government means a stronger UNP in national government and a stronger national economy. A weak UNP presence in local government means a weaker UNP in national government and a weaker national economy. So the choice is clear. Only voting for the UNP locally guarantees a good deal from the national government for your area.
In national government the UNP has a track record of delivering for our people. The UNP in national government has a track record of delivering. We have created over 400,000 jobs and committed to bringing more jobs to your area. We have housed over 260,000 families. Fuel prices have been reduced by 22 per cent to help low income families with the cost of living. We have provided Rs. 20,000 to pregnant women so the next generation arrives safely. Serious crimes our have been cut by a third making Sri Lanka safer for our families. Public sector salaries have increased by Rs. 10,000 so public servants can make ends meet.
Victory at the local elections will enable the UNP to build on the progress made since 2015 and means sticking with a plan to build a stronger economy and help us secure an outright victory in the next general election.
Rajapaksa and his cronies have nothing to say, are empty of any positive ideas for Sri Lanka and are only able to criticise the UNP. If we are not successful at local level, we will provide an opportunity for Rajapaksa and his cronies to consolidate their position and threaten our future in government.
So I truly hope you understand that the elections will be round the corner and every vote will count. So not voting, is effectively the same as voting for another party and not voting for the UNP locally risks the future development of the local area.
Only the UNP has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future. And only voting UNP will deliver funds for your area.

Eriksen stuns  United as Chelsea crash to Bournemouth
London, Wednesday: Tottenham's Christian Eriksen scored within 11 seconds on Wednesday to overshadow Alexis Sanchez's Premier League debut for Manchester United, while Chelsea crashed to a 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge.
Manchester City ignored the carnage around them to march serenely on, widening their lead to an enormous 15 points with a 3-0 victory at home to West Brom with just 13 games still to play.
The build-up to Wednesday's matches was dominated by late moves in the transfer window but Spurs ensured the focus switched back to the pitch immediately, stunning Jose Mourinho's men with a performance full of attacking verve in a 2-0 win. Chelsea, who earlier announced the signing of Olivier Giroud from Arsenal, conceded three second-half goals while Theo Walcott scored twice for his new club Everton in a 2-1 win against Leicester.
"We always try to be aggressive from the beginning," said delighted Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino. "Our aim is to be focused from the beginning. You can win a game if you're ready to fight. It was massive to be up early in the game.
"Three more points puts us in a very good position to fight for the top four. I'm sure new signing Lucas Moura enjoyed that a lot."
The painful defeat for United realistically ends any lingering hopes they may have harboured of catching runaway leaders City.
Mourinho signed Sanchez this month to bolster his attacking options but Spurs caught the visitors cold at a packed Wembley, Eriksen opening the scoring from the kick-off following a long ball from inside the Tottenham half.
The goal, timed at 10.48 seconds, was the first United have conceded in 2018 but despite some bright moments of their own they were 2-0 down just before the half-hour after Phil Jones lashed the ball into his own net. Tottenham, who announced the signing of Moura from Paris Saint-Germain shortly before kick-off, were a constant threat and had multiple chances to stretch their lead.
Mourinho threw on Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini in the 63rd minute but bizarrely took Fellaini off just seven minutes later, replacing him with Ander Herrera. The Belgium international took off his shirt and marched straight down the tunnel.
The impressive win for Spurs puts them right back at the heart of the hunt for a Champions League qualification spot, just two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
"It's a performance that starts with a ridiculous goal," said Mourinho. "That goal after a few seconds has a big influence in the game because Tottenham can play the way they like to play.
"In the end we played against a very good team. Both goals were ridiculous goals." AFP

Farmers lost their privileges due to Yahapalana regime: MR
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, adressng an election meeting at Ambalantota, said the Yahapalana regime used the Hambantota International Airport to store paddy.
Continuing, the former president said the farming community was pleased when the son of a farmer became the president of the country, because such a president would be a boon to their community, but what happened was quite the opposite; the farming community in the country lost all their privileges.
A large extent of paddy lands in the country currently remain barren and uncultivated, while the Yahapalana regime expects shipments of rice come from foreign countries, he said and queried from the audience whether those were the things that the people of the country expected from the son of a farmer. President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speak of a loan trap left behind by me. I do not deny the fact that I obtained loans from foreign countries; those who say so must travel around the country and witness the developments achieved utilising those loans, he added.
The former president said Hambantota was where he was born and bred and as such, it was his bounden duty to develop it. In the same manner, President Maithripala Sirisena can develop the Polonnnaruwa district where he was born and bred, he said.
Former President Rajapaksa said the latest allegation against him was that he had not settled his debts to the independent television network ITN. He added that he has not signed an agreement of any nature with ITN and it was done by the relevant ministry.
Another allegation directed against me is that I have not settled amounts due to the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB). The Yahapalana regime has taken steps to deprive me of my rights, he said.

The road to the Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawala has become highly polluted. Garbage is dumped at several points at the Kegalle-Karadupana junction in the area.
Residents complain that visitors to the Elephant Orphanage litter the area and request authorities to enforce stricter punishments on visitors in this regard.
At certain places where the local government authority has erected signboards asking people not to throw garbage too, there is garbage strewn about. Non-biodegradable plastics, glass bottles and other waste are found in the area.
Further, the Karadupana stream flows past the main road and as it goes past Pinnawela, the waste material is washed into it. This water ultimately ends up in the Pinnawala drinking water system.

Govt. income from tobacco falls in 2017
The tax earnings for the government from cigarette sales are likely to experience a dip in 2017 for the first time in five years.
According to provisional data, the government revenue from the tobacco industry is set to dip by Rs.2.7 billion or 3.1 percent year-on-year to Rs.86 billion.
In 2016, the tax revenue from tobacco grew 12.46 percent YoY and government excise earnings alone from tobacco was Rs.57 billion in 2014 before it peaked to Rs.88.7 billion in 2016.
Cigarette monopoly player in the country, Ceylon Tobacco PLC (CTC), attributes the reduction in government revenue to the unprecedented 40 percent drop in volumes last year due to the significant increase in price of sticks in the last quarter of 2016.
At pre-October 2016, the government would have earned a record Rs. 105 billion from CTC during the year that ended, officials say.
In order to combat smuggling of illicit cigarettes, the government through the Budget 2018 proposed to issue new licenses to import cigarettes while clamping down on smuggling.

Gymnastics doc abused at least 265 women and girls, court told
Charlotte, Wednesday: The number of women and girls now known to have been abused by Larry Nassar has risen to 265, a Michigan judge told a final sentencing hearing Wednesday where the former USA Gymnastics doctor faced his accusers once again.
At least 65 of Nassar's victims were to speak out over several days at the last of three sentencing hearings for the disgraced doctor who molested his patients for two decades under the guise of medical treatment.
The 54-year-old Nassar was sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years for molesting girls at his Michigan State University (MSU) clinic, in addition to a prior sentence of 60 years for possessing child pornography.
The poignant accounts of abuse suffered by more than 150 young women and girls, who took the stand over the past two weeks, have had profound repercussions for the US sporting world, with resignations, retirements and new investigations announced at a rapid pace.
Under pressure, the entire board of USA Gymnastics has stepped down as of Wednesday.
As the final hearings got under way, star gymnast Simone Biles slammed the US Olympic Committee for failing to reach out to her after she revealed this month she had been molested by Nassar.
She revealed she was initially in denial -- and broke down when she realized she had been abused.
"I remember just bawling my eyes out," the four-time Olympic gold medal winner told NBC News. "It feels like he took a part of me that I can't get back."
Biles, along with fellow gold-medalists Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, have all identified themselves as Nassar victims, along with scores of female athletes in gymnastics and others who sought medical treatment at Michigan State.
The small courtroom in Charlotte, Michigan filled up early in the morning, long before Nassar was brought in for hearings that were expected stretch into early next week.
"We have over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims in the state, in the country, and all over the world," Judge Janice Cunningham said.
"As a result, by allowing live streaming and tweeting, all individuals are able to participate in this process."
Jessica Thomashow, 17, who had also testified at Nassar's previous sentencing hearing, urged the judge to impose the maximum allowable sentence.
"Larry Nassar is evil," she said. "Larry Nassar is a criminal of the worst kind."
Under a plea agreement, Nassar could get a minimum 25 to 40 years in prison, in addition to his prior sentences.
Gymnast Madison Bonofiglio testified against Larry Nassar in March 2017, when molestation charges were initially brought. She said she knew of at least 10 other victims who have not come forward.
"This really makes me sad that some of my best friends think because they were only assaulted by Nassar five to 10 times, that it doesn't matter," she said.
The latest hearing relates to abuse that took place at the Twistars gymnastics training facility. Approximately 30 statements were read Wednesday, and another 35 expected when court resumes Friday.
The victims' courtroom revelations have sent shockwaves through the sport.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation of the Karolyi Ranch -- until recently the training ground for America's top gymnasts, where victims said they were abused.
USA Gymnastics severed ties with the ranch and three board members resigned, but that failed to quell the furor. The US Olympics Committee demanded all USA Gymnastics board members resign, and they complied Wednesday.
"USA Gymnastics embraces not only the changes necessary," it said in a statement, "but we also will hold the organization to the highest standards of care and safety."
US lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bipartisan bill mandating reporting of all sexual assault allegations in amateur sports.
Meanwhile, the fallout from the Nassar case may yet grow, with the US Olympic Committee, MSU and USA Gymnastics all facing investigations in what victims see as a belated push to establish who knew about Nassar's conduct, and what could have been done to stop him. AFP

HEMAS INTEGRATED LOGISTICS REBRANDED  AS SPECTRA INTEGRATED LOGISTICS
zHemas Integrated Logistics known across the industry for its service excellence, proven track record and corporate backing, turned a new chapter in its journey when the company rebranded itself as Spectra Integrated Logistics. The rebranding was carried out as a result of Hemas going into partnership with GAC Sri Lanka which itself is a partnership between GAC Global and McLarens Holdings.
Spectra Integrated Logistics is the union of two local giants of the shipping industry backed by a global logistics player, commented CEO of Spectra Integrated Logistics Niranjan Nallaratnam. He further added that launching a common brand was a strategic move to position ourselves as one of the biggest integrated logistics providers.
The company is taking several giant steps towards expansive growth under the new brand including the establishment of a state-of-the-art container yard which will be followed by an ultramodern warehouse.
The new container yard is located in a 15 acre land in the Muthurajawela Industrial Zone in Wattala, within the designated logistics city in the Western Region Megapolis Masterplan Project  a locality promoted by the government as a logistics park between the Port of Colombo and the Bandaranaike International Airport.
With an investment of nearly US$ 20 million by Spectra Integrated Logistics, the new container terminal  which commenced operations following a soft opening on 22 January 2018  is equipped with top notch modern equipment related to container handling, container repairing, container washing and container rigging to name a few.
This venture is a stepping stone for the company to create a centre of excellence in Sri Lanka in order to go out to the region, focussing mainly on Bangladesh and Myanmar in the Indian subcontinent. The new brand and container yard which targets most of the major shipping lines also seamlessly align with the prevailing expansion plans of Hemas Holdings.
Scheduled to be in the second phase of Spectras operations, the company has already commenced building one of the largest distribution centres in Sri Lanka targeting pharmaceuticals, white goods and retail trade.
With this facility and the gamut of freight and logistics services in our portfolio, Spectra Logistics is set to meet the growing demand for third party logistics services in Sri Lanka, brought about by the increase in global trade, as well as the increasingly important role that the country plays as a sourcing base in South Asia for international buyers, and to introduce the true benefits of supply chain solutions of global standards to Sri Lankan customers, said Lars Bergstrom, Group Vice President, Asia Pacific & Indian Subcontinent of GAC Group.
To be commissioned in mid-June 2018, the warehouse will have a future focussed set up with a capacity of nearly 25,000 palette positions. The distribution centre will be designed in accordance with global industry standards with five chambers and seven high racking, in addition toelectric material handling. The entire operation is further backed by proprietary software developed by GAC Global and supported by global IT centres in Singapore and Dubai.

The Heritage of Hydraulics
Juliet Coombe learns that great minds leave incredible legacies like the Polonnaruwa tank to the world and that a thousand years on it is as vital as ever to the farmers in the dry zone.
Man constantly attempts to recreate Eden and there are many examples of such endeavours throughout history and the world but there is one example in Sri Lanka that sticks out and was discovered, quite by accident, by the British army in 1820. A Lieutenant Fagan no less, commanding a brigade from Batticaloa to Minneriya, and fortunately with a considerably more civilised outlook on life than the previous army of savages that swept through like a tsunami, and turned the city upside down, committing the most heinous crimes known to man and leaving it absolutely destitute having gouged out the eyes of its King before torturing him to death  a treacherous serpent with pure evil and envy in its heart.
Before the great kingdom of Polonarruwa was destroyed, the place had become famous throughout the world for the ingenuity and attitude to water and nature in general. Walking around the site I learn how the Romans traded here for the gems, Arabs for the spices and even the Iranians came to do business as recently in a archaeological dig a great deal of Iranian pottery was discovered. Not even a single drop of water that comes from the rain must flow in to the Ocean without being made useful to man, King Parakramabahu was heard to say, making him one of the first recorded recyclers and creators of a hydraulic civilisation. He was also credited with building three huge river dams so that the use of water could be controlled minutely for all the inhabitants and extended the Elahera canal so that the three large irrigation tanks of Minneri, Kaudulu and Kanthale were all linked together, thus completing an impressive array of water engineering feats that were both highly technical and beautiful to behold, and described thus, a giant blue ribbon wrapped around a mystical garden city that even by todays terms was ahead of its time, and on a huge scale, It is of such a width that it is impossible to stand upon one shore and view the other side. Other canals were constructed to discharge additional water from swampy lands to make them suitable for paddy cultivation.
As well as farming hundreds of varieties of rice, they harvested honey from bees both to eat but also, interestingly, to seal their fresco pictures in the picture houses and on caves, as honey is a well known preservative and can last for millennia in the right mix and conditions. Living as part of nature this civilisation would have been aware of the dangers of monoculture and the need for diversity to support all the different creatures within an ecosystem; they would certainly not have needed to be encouraged to sow wild flowers to save the bees, something we are being warned might signal the end of a huge range of plants and indirectly animals, even many of us, in our world today.
Furthermore, the Kings boulder gardens reflected the Eden like majesty of the place, and were built with defence moats, though sadly these were not capable of repelling the rapacious barbarians, in 1215 AD, of the South Indian King Kalinga Magha, a malingerer who couldnt be bothered to create his own slice of paradise, instead destroying anothers and its people.
During the time of great King Parakrambahus largesse also extended to establishing alms halls to feed the poor, and promoting intellectual debate and the discussion of new ideas through scholarly teaching to everyone. Besides building a great city he was also an expert physician, to boot, building stone baths for healing with oil, as well as a hospital and special halls for attending sick people, truly a great philanthropist and visionary.
But his skills and those of his people go beyond these hydraulic marvels and in some cases tap into them, like the arrangement of gravity fed pipes and water channels that are used for creating open air domestic showers downstream of the dams or from the vast water tanks. The rooms of these ancient palaces and temples were also built thick and made to last with the added bonus of having excellent insulation qualities that negate the need for aircon as even in the heat of the day the thickness of walls keep the rooms cool. Similarly, houses were to some extent built with open ends to allow and facilitate the free flow of air through them both to keep them cool and to prevent the build up of harmful house dusts. Another revolutionary and extraordinarily visionary invention of the time involved the strategic placement of statues opposite windows within houses and inserting gemstones in their eyes, which would reflect the light, entering through the windows as the sun rises, and sending light around the room, so brightening it up with colours and being like a free electricity supply.
As with many great civilisations they left records, via stone inscriptions on giant books the most famous one being the galpotha stone book weighing 25 tons, which was brought over 90km from Mihintale by elephants rolled on logs. It took a year to get the stone book to the city and is a fascinating read as it covers many aspects from wars that took place to the cities rules and regulations. All in all this was a very advanced civilisation that fully appreciated and lived within natures needs and constraints, helped the poor and needy, was extremely sophisticated with its engineering, and recognised the importance of spirituality as a key part of the healing process. Some say the Great King was inspired from Pali inscriptions from temples in the area even older than the ancient ruined city we see today.

I am fully aware that Ampara District needs a lot of development projects and many issues need to be solved, but I regret very much that no one has approached me in this regard. Now that I have found a capable leader to associate with me to go ahead with these tasks, I request you all to strengthen his hand for the development of good governance, the President said.
He advised candidates contesting under the National Congress horse symbol and SLFPs hand symbol that serving the common masses should be the prime objective and warned that anyone involved in corruption and malpractice would be severely dealt with. Hence, my humble request to you all is to be loyal and honest in your service to the people, President Sirisena said.
The President said that he has been regaining the image of Sri Lanka in foreign countries that was tarnished by the previous government and he has taken all measures to strengthen rapport with other nations.
He added that Sri Lanka was in the bad books of more than 200 countries and only five were in favour of us. This was due to the corruption, malpractice and other unlawful activities prevalent in the country during the previous regime.
President Sirisena also revealed a dream he had for Sri Lanka and said that he would be the happiest person if this dream becomes a reality. We Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in this country should join hands and work together as brothers and sisters forgetting all communal and petty differences and be patriotic citizens of this beautiful country.
Former minister Athaullah, in his speech, said that Ampara District consists of all three communities who are living together peacefully. The sacred Deegawapiya Dagoba in Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat area was protected by the Muslims from the LTTE during the war. We have common problems and individual problems and I appealed to the President to look into these matters and he has assured his support all the times, Athaullah said.
State Minister A.H.M. Fouzie, former provincial minister M.S. Uthumalebbe, former Akkaraipattu Mayor Athaullah Zackie and National Congress Propaganda Secretary M.M. Baheej also spoke.
At the conclusion of the programme, Athaullah presented a memento to President Srisena. State Minister Siriyani Wijewickrema, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama were also present.

The team found the brewery being run in an abandoned plot of land in the Iththapana area in the Welipenna Police division.
A large tank of goda, seven iron barrels, copper funnels and equipment used to make moonshine and 25 bottles with moonshine from another place (28,750 ml) were apprehended.

India concerned over leasing of Hambantota Port to China company
Hinting at security concerns over Sri Lanka's handing over its strategic Southern Port of Hambantota to China, Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has raised doubts as to whether that country would confine itself only to port activities.
Whether China would confine itself to only port activities in the Hambantota Port is a question and I do not widh to say anything further, she told reporters after a meeting on the implementation on New India vision 2022 at the Collectorate here on Wednesday.
She said the Sri Lankan Government had handed over the port to China on a 99-year lease after having failed to repay a loan. On whether China was setting up its base in Hambantota Port posed a security threat to the country and whether India was prepared to face the threat, she said, whether China would use the port only for port activities was a question mark and my reply answers all your queries.
She refused to answer questions on the proposed expansion of the INS Parundu, the Indian Naval Air Station at Uchipulli near here and the establishment of an armament depot at Erwadi. Kerala had reportedly not responded to a request of the Naval Armament Depot to allot additional land at Angamaly in the Ernakulam district. Ms. Sitharaman said the media should check the veracity of such proposals before posing questions.
Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman having discussions.
She said the issues concerned four ministries and as many departments and she would not make any off-the-cuff remarks. You have raised valid questions and about the unrest among the local people, but you should give me time to check with the departments concerned and clarify.
She said that she was not aware of the developments and it had not come to her for taking a decision. I will check what stage it is, she added. On reports doing the rounds that the Centre had ordered the shutting down of the Ordnance Clothing Factory in Avadi near Chennai, Ms. Sitharaman said: I dont know about it.
About the failure to identify the killers of Rameswaram fisherman K. Britjo, she said it was taking time as it was an international issue and the Centre was following it up. We will not give it up, she added. (The Hindu)

Black cat Winston disappeared after his owner Jan, 56, moved in with her new husband Peter Barnes 65, in 2002.
Initially, the adventurous feline would go off for a few days then return fatter than before but eventually left and failed to return.
Peter and Jan had long given up hope of ever seeing Winston again - but were stunned when a vet called to say he had been found just before Christmas. He was seen staggering in the road in Launceston, Cornwall, 35 miles from the family home in Carlyon Bay.
Sheep is addicted to cigarettes - and will go to incredible lengths to get hold of them
Winston has now been returned to the family home but Peter said they have no idea where he has been all these years.
He said: "The children were sad he was gone and would make a fuss of him when he came back, but he's a very aloof cat and I don't think he liked too much fuss.
"He was found in Launceston by some customers of Castle Veterinary Group, they found him staggering in the road and they stopped the traffic and took him to the vets.
"The vet took him in, scanned him and gave us a call. You get strange phone calls and I thought, 'this can't possibly be'.
Winston, pictured with owner Janet, was found by a group of local children (Image: SWNS.com)
"But when they said the cat is Winston, how could they possibly know
"Because he was a rescue from the RSPCA he was chipped but we would have got him chipped anyway.
"It saved this cats life, because if there hadn't been any thing he would have been euthanised because of how bad he looked."
Peter, a retired printer, believes the cat may have left because he couldn't settle after moving house.

He said the JO has suspicion that the government is attempting to postpone elections and trying to bring in new laws.
He said their is a likelihood for the government to be split after the LG election with a possibility of a group of UNP and SLFP MPs forging an alliance with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader and Member of Parliament Anura Kumara Dissanayake, speaking at a JVP meeting held in his hometown in Andiyagala in the Palagala Divisional Secretariat, Anuradhapura, to promote their candidates for the area, said he had sacrificed much during his career in politics, including his property as well as family, and would continue to do so for the sake of the future of the children in the villages.
He said the JVP had fought hard to change the old electoral system.
Whilst many say that I have not visited my village in a long time, I have not been able to visit as often as I would like due to national responsibilities, Dissanayake said.
The JVP leader, who said that many capitalist parties were promising various goods and benefits to the people in order to get votes for their party; Sil cloths to arrack is being distributed for that purpose, and today, we see many villages divided over party lines and that should not be the case.
It is time for everyone to get together and vote for a party which would break away from the old ways and build the country.
He asked that the people think carefully before casting their votes on February 10; You elected Maithripala Sirisena as President and he appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Now ask yourself, what have they done during the last three years That period was a failure.
Therefore, think before you vote, he said. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the meantime, is asking that his Pohottuwa be voted into power.
Do not vote for that either. They destroyed the country in the past and lied their way into winning votes. He earlier spoke of the electric chair, but that too turned out to be a lie.
Their MPs and brothers have filled their bank accounts to the brim. You had voted for such people in the past and they have failed you.
Vote for the JVP and you will see that our members who are not corruptwho do not draw a salary from the governmentwill make a difference, he added.

Looking ahead  for the Sri Lankan  Banking sector  In Challenging Business Environments
The capital growth of the Sri Lankan banking sector had been satisfactory during the last decade in spite of many bottlenecks and unfavourable business climates on a number of occasions and for lengthy periods.
Banking sector provides bulk of the much needed capital for the growth of the private sector. In addition, the living standards of the general public of this country also rose with the provision of long term finance at affordable rates to acquire personal assets such as house and property, vehicles, houdehold goods, IT equipment and articles of personal use.
The entire business sector both the corporates and the non corporates have benefitted immensely in building up their business empires due to the continuous support given by the local banking sector. Although there are many banks in existence in the country, all banks are now in a much stabilized platform due to the untiring efforts of the respective boards of management and the staff. Most of the stable private banks are listed in the Colombo stock exchange and have raised finance through the Colombo stock exchange. Internally generated profits also contributed to the stable growth of the banks. The interest rates also have come down sharply as opposed to the rates which existed in the nineties. Ease of loan procurement has also contributed to the growth of the banking sector. Leasing activities have been also a success story in the bank facility portfolio with many inducements and incentives provided by different banks with eye catching advertising and sales promotion campaigns.
The banking sector is also instrumental for the cash circulation of the country to a great extent with the banks in the country having branches in all districts, cities and in most villages and towns. The literacy rates of the general public also improved considerably with the opening of accounts and transacting business through their bank accounts. With enhanced information technology, the banks are linked to their branches and the customers are benefitted immensely. Rural banking and credit growth is quite encouraging and have assisted in rapid rural poverty alleviation. The banks in Sri Lanka has now fallen into many categories such as commercial banks, Development banks, Housing banks, Grameen banks, Savings banks and more. Each type of banks serve a specific purpose and have been in the forefront in ensuring steady economic growth rates of our country over the years. However, the rates of interest for different types of loans/facilities vary from bank to bank. The central banks fix the interest rates from time to time based on the state of economy of the country, rate of exchange of local currency, import dollar demand, forex flows to/from the country and other factors attached to economic growth/stabilization of the economy of the country. With economic turbulences lashing countries worldwide, a continuous vigil is needed by the central bank and the entire banking sector. At times the finance companies of the country compete with the banking sector for banking and finance activities. There could be intense completion among the banks, finance companies and also between banks and finance companies for customers in same banking products, sometimes in a same geographical location or territory
Talking about staff, state banks have excess staff at both their Head Office and their branches and may also be lagging behind in level of knowledge and skills in comparison to their counterparts in the private sector. This is a major drawback for the state banks and is an obstacle to the growth of the state banks. Many private banks have established centralized loan factories and take much less time for loan approvals. The personal contact with the customer is at a much higher level as private sector bank staff work with the sole objective of meeting the requirements of the customers and satisfying them. Liquidity is another important aspect of any bank in the provision of loans/facilities to the customers. Avoidance of Non Performing Loans should be the sole objective of all banks in the provision of loans/facilities to the customers. It is up to the state sector banks to carry out work study and time study exercises to determine their optimum staff requirements in order to achieve higher profitabilities and market leaderships. State banks will have to improve their corporate governance measures as well and may be lagging behind their private sector counterparts. This is of paramount importance in the light of the directions, regulations and fund requirements of the Central Bank.
Let us now consider some of the core areas of the contemporary banking systems and the banking environment and the progress directions.
n Capitalisation
The Central Bank OF Sri Lanka is the governing body for the banking & Finance activities in the country and have introduced regular legislation for mandatory mimimum capital requirements and capital adequacies for the sector from time to time over the years.
n Non performing loans (NPL)
Levels of NPL have come down in recent years,especially in commercial banks with stringent controls and analytical loan evaluations.State sector need greater attention on this aspect as liquidity of banks is directly affected.
n Collaterals
Standards for collaterals are now eased as asset values have gone up substantially to warrant immediate disbursement of loans/facilities. Some banks have relaxed their stringent conditions to compete with rival banks. Type and liquidity of the collateral will determine the interest rates attached to various loans/facilities.
n Loan growth
Loan growth is satisfactory in certain sectors while some sectors need streamlined promotion after evaluation and research.
n Loan portfolios
Loan portfolio of a bank need continuous attention and evaluation to determine the active sectors of the economy. More attention should be paid to vulnerable sectors with direct supervision of the business activities of the customer on a monthly or weekly basis, if required, with frequent visits to the places of business of the customer to determine the level of safety of recovering the loans/facilities granted.
n Banking products
Banking products vary from bank to bank at times to create exclusivity and customer attention. Banking products should be carefully designed to take advantage of specific customer needs/group needs or to meet directions of Government, sectorial trade requirements. Banking products will ensure niche markets and a rich harvest of customers for a bank to tap loyal long term customers.
n Taxation
State imposes taxes on the banking and finance sector and some of the taxes cannot be passed on to the customers. A substantial portion of profits of a bank will be netted by the state by way of taxes. It is high time for banks to make representations to the state to mitigate taxes to a realistic level with the long term growth of the banks in mind.
n Provisions
Banks usually provide General and Specific provisions in their accounts for loan losses and fall in value of investments. The basis adopted should be prudent and in keeping with contemporary local and international banking standards.
n Branch control
This is a very vital aspect of the controls exercised by banks. The controls exercised should be well supported by sound information technology installations. Control exercised should be continuous with weekly/monthly progress reports on profitability and marketing efforts and the success of the marketing efforts. Branch cash flows also play a pivotal part.
n CSR activities
CSR activities could be well designed to attract new customers with public appreciation of the CSR projects. Projects leading to provision of public utilities will go a long way in the attraction of new customers.
n NIM (net interest margins)
Net interest margins of banks have come under pressure due to increased share of term deposits. This is a major task for the banking sector as a balance need be created at most times if not at all times.
n Yields
Yields are supported by the growing exposure to the SME & retail sectors
n PPOP positions
In most banks Pre Provision Operating Profits are satisfactory
n Exposure to housing sector
State banks have greatly exposed themselves to the Housing sector loans and the private banking sector is catching up at a good pace.
n Ratings
Most banks have National and International ratings. Ability to raise domestic and international finance depends very much on the latest ratings achieved.
n Dividends
State banks usually pay higher dividends than the commercial banks due to fund requirements of the General Treasury.
n Competition among banks
During economic downturns, there is intense competition among the banks for customers. Interest rates, loan approval and disbursement periods and ease of procuring facilities play a big role during these times.
Let us now move into the latest trends and scenarios in the international banking scene.
Internationalization of banks and increase in Bank size has grown at a steady pace during the decade from 2004 to 2014. The total asset size of the worlds largest banks has also increased steadily. while developed country banks opting to curtail, developing country banks continued to invest overseas, through cross border and other operations. Financially, globalization comes with both opportunities and risks. Possible benefits include a globally more efficient allocation of capital and enhanced risk sharing. A liberalized capital account assists in external financing and increased competition as foreign entry is likely to improve efficiency and domestic resource allocation. Better knowledge and financial skills are also imparted as well as advanced technology.
South - South Banking
One of the important recent trends in international banking has been the rise of SouthSouth banking. With developing countries becoming more prominent in international banking and these activities have become regionalized, SouthSouth banking would be associated with better access. The increasing particioation of developing countries in global financial transactions have allowed these countries to not only diversify their investments but also obtain financing from abroad, complimenting domestic markets and widening their available funding choices.
South---South banks invest in countries within their region/continent and tend to be more familiar with the cultural, legal, linguistic, geographical and international environment of the host country.
Shifting towards alternative sources of funding
With the global financial crisis hitting the banking sectors of major high income countries, firms around the world compensated for this contraction by substituting across funding sources. Corporate firms with access to capital markets have moved to bond markets in high income and developing countries.
Syndicated loans have come to the assistance of the banking sector where large conglomerates seek extensive loan facilities on flexible terms. Syndicated loans also assist in spreading the risks associated in granting loans of large quantums and form the platform for low risk loans
Maintenance of share value of banks in stock markets
Values of quoted shares of banks are under pressure during low economic growth of a country. Every bank is keen and would endeavour to achieve higher profits more than the reported profits of last financial year as the shareholders expect stable dividends and solid liquidity to confirm with the requirements of the Central Bank. The management of banks will have an uphill task in this aspect as most corporates are not venturing into diversification of activities or broadbasing their business platforms.
Banks face multiple risks such as:
n Level of consumer spending
n Government tax rates and new taxes
n Competition from other banks
n Level of public savings
n Currency value fluctuations
n Political instability in the country
n Budget proposals of the ruling Government
n Central Bank regulations especially the interest rates, capital adequacies, liquidity ratios.
n Threat of acquisitions by other banks
n Security situation of the country
n Inability to raise fresh capital or long term debts due to lower ratings
n Increase in Non Performong Loans
n Poor cash circulation in the country
n High staff turnover levels with banking executives/staff taking up overseas appointments
n Fall in value of collaterals pledged for loans/facilities
n Fall in value of investments
n Inability to develop new banking products beneficial to customers and the economy
As we can see that the thebanking system faces inherent/unexpected high risks, it is up to the state to provide all assistance to both state and private banks to achieve their long term stability and build up a strong base of reserves to utilize in turbulent times. The state should also pay attention to the fact that instability in the banking sector would lead to the eventual instability in the entire economic circles of the country.

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of jailed politicians

The Maldives Supreme Court has ordered the immediate release and retrial of the exiled former president Mohamed Nasheed and other opposition leaders.
In a statement, the court declared that their original trials violated constitutional and international law.
The court decision effectively restores the opposition majority in parliament, reinstating 12 members who had been stripped of their seats.
Opposition supporters took to the streets to celebratethe ruling.
Police in the capital, Male, used tear gas to disperse one group.
The country has seen political unrest since Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was convicted in 2015.
His conviction and 13-year sentence was internationally condemned, and he was given political asylum in the United Kingdom.
Former Vice-President Ahmed Adheeb Abdul Ghafoor and other opposition leaders were among the others named in the latest order.
It called for their immediate release and said the "questionable and politically motivated nature of the trials of the political leaders warrant a re-trial".
In a tweet, Nasheed called for President Abdulla Yameen to resign. The call was echoed in a joint statement issued by the country's opposition parties.
Nasheed told local television that he planned to return to Male, but not immediately.
"I will move forward wisely with the advice of the party and the united parties," he said.
The US ambassador to the Maldives urged the country's leader to respect the court's judgement.
A spokesman for the president's office said in a statement that the government questioned the ruling but would comply.
However, the chief of police has reportedly been fired following the ruling, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said.
The Indian Ocean nation has been independent from Britain for 53 years, during which time it was ruled for decades autocratically by then President Maumoon Abdul Gayhoom.
It became a multi-party democracy in 2008, but since President Yameen took power in 2013 it has faced questions over freedom of speech, the detention of opponents and the independence of the judiciary.
The nation is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 individual islands, and is popular among foreigners as a luxury tourist destination.

Malik Samarawickrama: Ruggerite and promoter par excellence
The name MALIK SAMARAWICKRAMA, like good wine needs no bush. Be it the sport he loved best and in politics a different game, he is a household name and is still making waves as a politician and god father of Kandy Sports Club rugby. The hill country club, in the good old days when I watched and reported on the game, the names of Stanley Martin, Col. Stanley Ratwatte, KB Sangakkara and Philip Buultjens were synonymous with the club. Over the past 50 years however, there has been no one who has given more of his time, his wealth and his heart and soul to the club than MALIK.
SAMARAWICKRAMA.is a selfless man whos charm, winning ways and humility are exemplary.
Tagged as MR.RUGBY, Kandy Sports Club and the Hill Capital will have his name inscribed in letters of gold for the wonderful and stunning revolution he made in the game in Kandy.
From the time he planted his business interests in Kandy, and while watching rugby there, he quickly spotted the talent flowing like the Mahaweli and with Royal rugby blood in him did not lose time in throwing his lot with Kandy Sports Club.
He brought about a rugby reawakening in Kandy and today Kandy Sports Club is the kings of rugby in Kandy. The clubs record of winning the league 13 times, the Clifford cup 15 times and the sevens 11 times is ample testimony.
Rudiments of the game
After schooling at Royal College where he was baptized in rugby, he learnt the rudiments of the game and excelled in inter-school exploits as a famed scrum half, he launched his career in the game that saw him sports Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club and Sri Lanka colours.
Excelling the mans game from schoolboy level which is much more demanding tough and rib bruising he continued to play in many CR teams that won trophies with the CR-Havies game being the local rugby derby at that time.
During his playing days at Royal from 1966 to 1968 his team mates were Jagath Fenando, H.C.P. Malwatte, A.J. Yusuf, Maiya Gunesekera, Fred Pereira, B Liversz, C.R.de Silva, D.J. Perera, R. Thurairatnam, Brian Baptist and G.Mohammed to mention a few. At the CR he had team mates Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Ronnie Shockman, Jagath Fernando,Reggie Bartholomeusz, Ratnapala.
Representative rugby
SAMARAWICKRAMA also sported Low Country colours playing in the Capper Cup game against Up Country and played for the Presidents XV quite regularly. Once he had enough of club and representative rugby he hung up his boots when everyone was asking why and why not.
He was a wippy and daring scrum half who gathered the ball from the base and slung intelligent and well directed passes to his fly half who always was well positioned to get the line moving that resulted in an avalanche of tries for school, club and the country.
But quitting the game he loved best did not mean that he would be lost to the game. On the contrary he moved on to the administration, the sponsoring scrum and many schools and clubs enjoyed his largesse, especially Kandy Sports Club and the Kandy players have rewarded him by winning trophies at will with no club able to stop this rugby juggernaut. In the early days to take Kandy rugby to the top he had a brilliant coach in Nimal Leweke who helped them win the triple.
President of SLRFU
He served as treasurer at the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, Vice President and it was not long when he attained the high office of President. He was also manager of many Sri Lankan teams.
He with his expertise realized that sponsorship and professionalism is what is urgently and badly required to help players and take the game forward. Rugby too is an expensive game and it is not all players who have finances to keep playing.
When professionalism is being spoken about the pioneering names in this endeavor that come to mind are philanthropists the famous E.W.Balasuriya and My way Kishin Butani. Balasuriya first did it for Kandy Lake Club and Butani for CH and FC.
Professionalism
At that time Balasuriya and Butani were scourged for introducing professionalism into the game. One remembers Balasuriya getting Maurice de Silva and Didacus de Almedia among others to play for Kandy Lake and Butani getting down Simon Hunter and the Fijians to play for the Maitland Crescent Club, outstanding being Nagata. Butani had an efficient helper in king Hassan Singhawansa. But what Balasuriya and Butani pioneered then is the done and must thing now.
SAMARAWICKRAMA while being in the scrum of Kandy Sports Club introduced foreign flavor into the game when he introduced the Singer/Sri Lanka Airlines International Sevens tournament to celebrate 125 years of KSC in 1999. He saw to it that the tournament which was much looked forward to went on for 10 years.
He helped KSC rise Phoenix like from the ashes and today the club is dominating the game, with some of the finest players in the game and is the envy of all clubs with no club in the scene able to bring them down. Every club takes the field determined to beat them, but finally come a cropper.
Modern pavilion
The new look he gave to the Nittawela ground is amazing. He brought it to international standard by adding tiers round the ground and after building a modern pavilion named it after one of Trinitys and Sri Lanka great player and daring soldier the late Denzil Kobbekaduwa. The cry now is for the Nittaela ground to be named the MALIK SAMARAWICKRAMA rugby stadium. It will be a fitting honour if it is done.
SAMARAWICKRAMAS contribution to the game has made many schools in Kandy to take to the game and show their prowess putting to second best some of the leading rugby paying schools in the country. It is sports promoters of the calibre of SAMARAWICKRAMA that Sri Lanka sport is lacking and yearning for.
The trophies that are packed in the shelves of Kandy Sports Club are ample testimony for SAMARAWICKRAMAS popularity and the great work he is doing for the player, the game, the club and the country.
SAMARAWICKRAMA is now Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade in the Unity Government.

My Morning Cuppa..!
My morning cuppas been getting some good press lately: Last week she was featured as a preventive for diabetes and this mornings papers reported a cup of coffee a day keeps memory loss at bay!
Ha! And to all those people whove stared at me as I sip my daily addiction, do I hold such cuttings up for them to see. Though I glance at such reports, Ive never needed to sustain my deep love and bonding for my cup that cheers.
What do you have when you return from your morning walk I ask my friends.
Gallons of water! says John looking at me suspiciously.
Yeah water replenishes the sweat youve lost, says another, and you
My morning cuppa! I sigh in anticipation.
Very often during the walk Im joined by friends and neighbours laughing, joking and taking about events that have happened the day before on matters pertaining to football, cricket, politics or other stuff men love to chatter about. I become a little quiet after a while and suddenly friends whisper and look at me, Bob they ask, working on your next piece
I smile and say nothing.
How do you tell this bunch of warm, friendly good-natured fellows youre just waiting to leave their company, that all their banter and jesting cannot replace the temptress waiting at home!
Sizzling hot, seductively sweet, whose aroma you sniff in anticipation, taste buds drooling with longing.
Ah my morning cup of coffee!
Not a day can I live without her. I remember years ago as a bachelor I had to make a choice between her and another; one more prettier and more shapely. What do you love the most she asked.
My coffee! I said and did I see disappointment in her adoring eyes.
I make good tea! she said.
Tea I asked in disdain.
Our friendship never went farther and sometimes when I do think of choice I made, I pat myself and whisper there was no choice at all was there
And yet one day I walked away from my coffee. It was in Milan Airport a few years ago: What will you have sir asked busy waitress as I sat alone. Coffee! I said.
Which coffee she asked and threw menu on my table and hurried away.
Which coffee! I stared at the card. There was Caffe Latte! Expresso! Caffe Macha! Cappucino! There was Breve and Caf Cito! And there was Granita! And also Caf Americano and Expresso Romano!
I sighed as the card stared mockingly back at me, Choose! it said, choose between us!
I couldnt. How could I be disloyal to any one of them. The waitress came back, Have you chosen she asked.
Tea..! I said weakly, and glanced away from menu card. But did I hear a sigh of relief from all on menu card When it comes to coffee, Bobs got no favourites! they whispered happily!

Native treatment to cure kidney diseases to be introduced
North Central Provincial Council has decided to introduce native treatment which has been proved to cure kidney patients, including CKDu patients, in all ayurveda hospitals in the Province.
NCP Chief Secretary H.M.P. Bandara said the treatment will be initiated at Medirigiriya Provincial Ayurveda Hospital on February 15.
A group of allopathy and ayurveda doctors headed by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe of Kotelawala Defence University, who pioneered treatment formulated by late Ven. Waharaka Abayarathanalankara Thera, have been practising this particular treatment method at Kebithigollawa ayurveda community health centre for two years.
We have been appraised by Dr. Kumarasinghe and his colleagues about this ayurveda treatment for kidney patients which seems highly successful. I, along with provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulsena, Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis and others, decided to expand the programme to all ayurveda hospitals in NCP. Following the Medirigiriya clinic, it is intended to open similar treatment units at Kabithigollawa, Medawachchiya, Rambawa and Padaviya, as well as at Anuradhapura ayurveda general hospital, Bandara said.
He said that the Presidential task force for the prevention of kidney diseases has pledged full support and patronage to promote this programme. According to Ashela Iddhawala, head of the task force, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed that this treatment be introduced countrywide. Initially a sum of Rs. 2.5 million would be allocated to the provincial ayurveda commissioner for the first phase of the expansion programme.

NECSL to form National Think Tank
The National Economic Council of Sri Lanka (NECSL) will play a key role in contributing their inputs to the national economy and by streamlining proposals that are not detrimental to Sri Lanka, said its Secretary General and Chief Economist, Lalith P. Samarakoon.
In a round table meeting with media at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday he said that the council was formed mainly to re look at some of the proposals form line Ministries before they were been forwarded to the Cabinet for approval.
He said that the NCESL is being headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and includes Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, Finance Minister, Central Bank Governor and several other key officials.
Samarakoon said that currently they were re studying several proposals that have been forwarded for approvals by line Ministries. In addition we are also re looking at the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines which is a major burden to the national economy. I think the debt burden is too high for an investor to come forward and we may suggest a method to reduce this burden and then offer it back to a foreign airline.
Samarakeeon also said that the NECSL will recruit new staff and move to World Trade Centre end of March 2018. We will also form a National Think Tank to help economic development.
Asked if the formation of another council to check proposals forwarded by line Ministries may take additional time for approvals he said that it may be so. However this on the long run would be better for Sri Lanka rather than hurriedly approving projects.
Samarakoon also said that they will also talk with Central Bank to ascertain Sri Lankas current foreign debt and the best way to settle it. The current debt burden of the country is Rs. 10. 3 trillion, which is 80% of the GDP.

President Maithripala Sirisena emphasized that despite allegations leveled against him that he is attempting to divide the country, he would not allow that under any circumstances.
The President made these remarks addressing a public rally held in Sevanapitiya, Polonnaruwa, yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the President said today, the people will not become victims of false propaganda and opportunistic political tactics.
President Sirisena said today the country needs a system of government in which people have to play a pivotal role, instead of a dictatorship and further said that during the past three years, he was committed to bring that essential political as well as social transformation into the country.
Today, corrupt politicians are aligned as a single group, the President said, that adding the people should understand this reality and most of them are demanding the power to achieve their personal development, but not to serve the people or to develop the country.
As a result of the reluctance shown by the leaders of the previous regime to take action against the corrupt politicians and to speak about it, fraud and corrupt activities increased in the country over the recent past, the President added.
The President recalling the incident where he discussed about fraud and corruption of the then government with the Ministers and MPs as the Minister of Health while attending a meeting on development activities of the government at the Central Bank headquarters in Colombo, the next morning he was summoned by the then leader who asked him to refrain from talking about fraud and corruption of the government as a Minister and as the Secretary General of the Party. He was also asked whether he is trying to start a new journey.
The President added that on that day, he decided to commence a new journey for the betterment of the people as he was not able even to talk about corruption.
Political differences, social status or relations will not be considered when taking action against fraud and corruption, the President said, adding that he has shown this through his actions.

Not an ounce of human talent will be wasted-PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged not to waste even an ounce of human talent in Sri Lanka when he addressed employees of WNS Global Services (Pvt) Ltd, one of the pioneer IT-BPM operators in Sri Lanka.
Quoting Parakramabahu the Great that not one single drop of water would be allowed to flow to the sea without being fully utilized, Wickremesinghe said his government would employ a similar approach towards the countrys talent pool.
The Premier said that IT and related industries are crucial to the countrys future and committed to provide the support required to grow the industry. During his visit the Prime Minister met with Dinesh Wickremanayake, Managing Director, WNS and senior representatives of the company. Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama and the Director General of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), Duminda Ariyasinghe also participated in the discussions on expediting the countrys future IT growth.
Keshav R. Murugesh, Group CEO, WNS said, We are delighted to see the commitment of Wickremesinghe and his government to make Sri Lanka a leading destination for BPM work. The country has already taken big strides towards creating a conducive eco-system, and I am confident the support will grow in the years ahead.
WNS started its operations in Colombo with 35 employees in 2004, and today it has grown its presence to over 700 employees across two locations. Following extensive private and public stakeholder consultations in 2017, Sri Lankas National Export Strategy (NES) identified ICT to be one of the six priority sectors in strengthening export competitiveness and sustainable investment growth. The IT/BPM industry aspires to grow its export revenue from US$ 1.2 bn at present, to US$ 5 bn, provide employment to 200,000 people and enable 1,000 startups by 2022.
With the potential to become one of the leading export earners for Sri Lanka, the IT/BPM industry will see the development of related infrastructure facilities, capacity building for talent and improvements in ease of doing business as part of the implementation of government policy objectives. These initiatives will complement the industrys strengths and fuel its growth, positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for world-class knowledge solutions.

Olympic confusion as CAS lifts doping bans on 28 Russians
Pyeongchang: Sports top court CAS on Thursday overturned Olympic life bans on 28 Russians accused of doping, a decision hailed by Moscow but a major embarrassment for the International Olympic Committee just days away from the start of the Winter Games in Pyeongchang.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the there was insufficient evidence that the athletes had benefited from a system of state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Winter Games, hosted by Russia.
The cleared 28, which includes Sochi cross-country gold medallist Alexander Legkov, are now eligible to compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics starting next week, but their participation is by no means certain.
Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation to the 2018 Games in South Korea, the IOC explained in a statement. Russia are banned from Pyeongchang over the doping scandal but 169 Russian competitors have been cleared to take part as neutrals.
The IOC warned that CASs verdict may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping.
Therefore, the IOC will analyse the reasoned decisions very carefully once they are available and consider consequences, including an appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.
The exonerated group were among 42 Russians -- bobsleighers, cross-country skiers, competitors in the skeleton and ice hockey players -- to appeal their bans. In addition to clearing the 28, CAS also lifted the life bans of another 11 Russians but barred them from competing at Pyeongchang.
Delivering its judgement CAS said: In 28 cases, the evidence collected was found to be insufficient to establish that an anti-doping rule violation was committed by the athletes concerned.
The evidence put forward by the IOC in relation to this matter did not have the same weight in each individual case.
CASs decision was warmly welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
We are very glad for our athletes, Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
The information about the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport proves that energetic work to stand up for our rights in court and elsewhere -- it is justified, it can be effective and it should continue, Peskov added.
And we are hoping that this work will certainly continue.
He said it was unclear whether the 28 who had their appeals upheld would now compete in South Korea.
It is a difficult question, the Kremlin spokesman added, noting Russian officials would continue talking to the IOC. Last weeks mass CAS hearings were as a result of allegations of a vast state-sponsored doping programme contained in the report into Sochi authored by sports law professor Richard McLaren for the World Anti-Doping Agency. - AFP

Co-convenor of the Left Centre Chameera Perera yesterday charged that the Pohottuwa Party is an Ambalama (Leisure Lounge) which was created by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to form a peoples force for his own protection.
He further charged that the former President is attempting to escape the allegations leveled against him by using this new party and its supporters.
He was addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) yesterday.
Commenting on the recent statement by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who claimed that the present government has no discipline, Perera said that the former President only knows about suppressive ruling. But today the country has a democratic ruling.
He also charged that the former government led by the three Rajapaksas ruled the country in an anti-democratic manner.

Police can shoot if Penal Code is violated  Spokesman
Police personnel have been issued orders to shoot in instances where Clause 93 and 96 of the Penal Code is violated, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said this does not suggest that Police can simply shoot a person. But what it means is that Police can use force required even upto the point of killing a person in such instances. Shooting a person is also included in this clause. In one sentence it says during incidents of looting or such violations of the Penal Code, the Police Spokesman said.
SP Gunasekara was speaking at a media briefing at the Police Headquarters yesterday.
Gunasekara noted that there are also instructions included in the Police orders which outline the instances where Police could open fire. These laws are also formulated based on Clauses 93 and 96 of the Penal Code under the conditions specified.
He further added that two armed Police personnel will be deployed per polling station for security during the upcoming Local Government elections, in addition to the mobile patrols. The Police Headquarters has issued a booklet to all Police stations bearing instructions and guidelines in terms of all Police duties. The booklet which will be distributed within the next few days is printed in all three languages and it provides all the regulations and advice required to be followed by Police personnel with regard to the upcoming elections.

Police uncover polling cards, ID buying plot
Police have discovered a new form of election violation where voters polling cards and IDs are being obtained for money by a certain group, in a bid to prevent certain candidates from receiving these votes.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said official polling cards and IDs are being gathered by paying these people money.
Our initial investigations have revealed that certain parties are collecting these IDs in this manner to prevent a certain party or independent group from getting these votes. We have issued clear instructions to all police stations that under the instructions of the Elections Ordinance, it is an offence to cause undue pressure or influence. It is an offence to influence anyone to obtain a vote or influence or pressure anyone against giving his/her vote to the party or independent group he/she desires. These are both offences according to the election laws.
In such instances, they will obtain the approval of the Attorney General and file charges against such individuals or groups irrespective of who they are, he said.
Those found guilty of causing undue pressure or influence before a court of law will lose their voting right for seven years. If the person deemed guilty of this crime is a candidate, he would be stripped of his/her seat even if they had won the election. Further, it is illegal for a person to hold the ID of another person and the police will strictly enforce the law irrespective of who they are, if they are found guilty, the Police Media Spokesman said.
He also noted that if any candidate is found to have a criminal record, then he would be disqualified, according to the election rules and regulations.

Previous Govt misused loans - Deputy Minister
Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha de Silva said that the recent statement made by the President about loans taken by the previous government was certain and added that they never maintained a proper assets registry.
President Maithripala Sirisena recently said that of the Rs 10 trillion loans taken by the previous government only about Rs 1 trillion could be accounted for in the assets and huge sums of money could not be accounted for in the documents in the Finance Ministry.
Addressing the media yesterday at UNP headquarters in Sirikotha, de Silva said the previous government could not maintain a proper asset registry as the loans were spent on their daily expenses.
The Rajapaksas claim that they got loans for development purposes which is not true. If they had taken loans for development projects, they could have easily maintained an asset registry. All the money went into their pockets, so they did not want to mention anything about it, he said.
Deputy Minister further said that former governor of Central Bank Nivard Cabraal who was helping the former government in every way to hide their corruption is today claiming that nothing as such happened.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about President Sirisenas statement that he is going to take up economic management in to his hands, Deputy Minister said that if he really meant it, he would have already taken the ministries in to his hand but what he mentioned was to work through national economic council.

Otara Foundation for Animal Welfare and Wildlife Conservation
Pursuing a childhood dream
Riding on the tides caused by the killing of the Galgamuwa tusker and the renewed interest in the ubiquitous Human-Elephant Conflict, the Daily News turned to one of Sri Lankas most successful and influential entrepreneurs, Otara Gunewardene for her perspectives on the matter. Her passion for wildlife and conservation is no secret and she believes that our wildlife is one of our greatest assets. Known particularly as being the founder of ODEL, Otara has now shifted her focus to her childhood dream which is focussing on animal welfare and wildlife conservation.
Could you please tell us a bit about the Otara Foundation
After ODEL I decided to focus more on animal welfare and wildlife conservation through Embark and the Otara Foundation so that I could pursue my childhood dream which was to help animals. It was definitely one reason to leave business.
What inspired you to establish the Otara Foundation
The desire to pursue my childhood dream of helping animals.
What are your thoughts on the Human Elephant Conflict
It is an incredibly unfortunate situation, but it doesnt need to be that way. Wildlife and forests are of utmost value. They are one of our greatest assets and it should be made possible for other things to function around it. Unplanned development is a key factor that escalates this issue. We have the knowledge to enable development and protecting our wildlife to go hand in hand and we must use that knowledge to protect our natural heritage. It should also be kept in mind that the Human-Elephant Conflict not only affects elephants but also the people, other wildlife and forests around. There are so many alternative options for development while ensuring the protection of elephant corridors and their homes. We have to understand that the elephants are just trying to survive and provide for their families when this conflict happens. We should be proud and understand the uniqueness of what we have with our elephants and wildlife. Something needs to be done to improve the management and enforce the laws to stop the poaching of all animals.
As an ambassador for wildlife and someone who promotes a world with animals and people, what are your thoughts on the shooting of the Galgamuwa tusker
Its incredibly sad and also frightening that a trend to kill our tuskers has started again. When you travel around Sri Lanka, you will understand how much poaching there is now of all animals. We need to do something about it, and it must be done now. I believe we are at the tipping point towards losing a lot of our wildlife forever. We should be doing everything possible to protect them for future generations.Animals are also affected by individuals who are poaching for the meat trade, when habitats are destroyed when trees are cut for timber or for ad hocdevelopment. The importance of protecting such an incredible natural heritage as the one we are blessed with is well known by many and they all hope that stronger action will be taken to protect it.
What do you think about the laws in Sri Lanka to do with the conservation of elephant and minimization of the Human Elephant Conflict
I am not a lawyer and my legal know-how on the matter is limited, however while we have good fauna and flora protection laws, the animal welfare laws in this country are inadequate and extremely weak. The new animal welfare bill which was approved by the Cabinet 2 years ago is still pending approval by Parliament. For wildlife, what really needs to be focussed on is enforcement of the laws which will deter the escalating poaching, especially for elephants and tuskers, as we dont have many left. Action needs to happen because there is no use in making arrests once the damage is done and the species are no more.Justice while rendering some satisfaction does not solve the problem.
Do you have any plans for elephant conservation
The Otara Foundation supports some environmental organizations and groups and sometimes the government when possible. We do whatever we can to help various movements, but a lot to do with wildlife has to be done by the government, so it is not easy to help directly. They are the main stakeholders and guardians of our wildlife. An overall action plan is necessary.
What message would you like to give regarding the importance of elephant conservation
Elephants are one of our greatest assets. They are also a source of revenue through the tourism that we bring into the country. It would be an absolute shame to lose them. Killing off the males which roam out of protected areas will make the species unable to reproduce.
Translocating them too is making the gene pool weak. We cant keep jumbling up a natural environment, at some point its going to give.
Waves of disappointment are apparent across social media as citizens too are realizing the gravity of the situation.
There are even murmurs and campaigns about voting only for those candidates who care for animals both domestic and wild and for those who understand the need to protect our last remaining forests and offer a solution for conservation. It is of utmost importance that we act now.

He also revealed that Prof. De Broe had found an inclusion body that is the root cause of CKDU and he will reveal it for the first time at the conference.

Royal couple lays foundation stone for SLTAs new Tennis Complex
Prince Edward Earl of Wessex and Countess Sophie who will be the chief guests at Sri Lankas 70th Independence Day celebrations on February 4 representing Her Majesty the Queen made a historic visit to the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) yesterday to lay the foundation stone for a modern tennis complex at Green Path.
The proposed tennis complex will have five indoor and six floodlit outdoor courts with all modern facilities, which will play a vital role in moulding Sri Lankan future tennis stars. The estimated cost for the facility is Rs. 800 million and SLTA hopes to complete the facility within one and a half years. After laying the foundation stone Prince Edward unveiled the inauguration plaque at the SLTA.
The royal couple also witnessed an exhibition wheelchair tennis game with four Lankan wheelchair players in action. Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress in wheelchair tennis at international level since its re-introduction in 2001 by former SLTA president Suresh Subramaniam. By 2004 Sri Lanka was producing wheelchair tennis players of Paralympics standard.
The British Royal family has a history of being closely associated with tennis as patrons of the game. SLTA is the second oldest tennis association in Asia and we celebrated our centenary in 2015. SLTA is honoured by this historic royal visit as we inherited the game from the British, said SLTA president Iqbal Bin Isaack. The visit allows us the opportunity to gain worldwide exposure for our wheelchair tennis that has brought immense credit to the country.
Isaack further stated that the new complex will be a major leap forward for Sri Lankas tennis and thanked Aelian Gunawardene of JAT Holdings for coming forward as the developer of the complex.
Wheelchair Tennis players, Sri Lankas Commonwealth Games participants and Davis Cup tennis players too were introduced to the royal couple on the occasion. Asian Tennis Federation president Anil Khanna, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, former SLTA president Suresh Subramaniam and SLTA officials were also present.

Samsung enters crypto-currency  chips business
The firm made the disclosure in its latest earnings report, where it said the activity should boost its profits.
The report also confirmed that the South Korean company overtook Intel to become the biggest chipmaker last year.
And it forecast strong demand for its forthcoming Galaxy S9 smartphone, which is due to be revealed on 25 February.
Samsung Electronic's fourth quarter net profit totalled 12.3tn won ($11.5bn; 8.1bn), which was roughly in line with analysts expectations.
But its shares jumped nearly 9% after the company revealed that it was splitting its stock 50-to-1, which should encourage trade in the asset.
For now, Samsung is providing little detail about its new crypto-currency business.
Samsung's foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing of crypto-currency mining chips, it said in a statement given to the BBC.
However we are unable to disclose further details regarding our customers.
Mining, in this context, refers to solving complex mathematical problems as a means to verify crypto-currency transactions - a task for which the owners of the computers involved are rewarded with new digital tokens or coins.
The Bell, a Korean-language newspaper, has reported that the processors involved are Asic (application-specific integrated circuit) chips.
These are chips that are custom-designed to carry out a single task - in this case mining Bitcoin or another specific crypto-currency - but not general computing operations. (BBC)

Singer revenue tops Rs. 51.5 bn
Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC announced yesterday its Group results for the year ended December 31, 2017. The results showed an increase in Group revenue of 9.8 % compared to the previous year, with Group Revenue exceeding Rs. 51.5 billion in spite of tough business conditions.
The continuous drought in the dry zone resulted in a sharp drop in the harvest eroding the purchasing power of a large segment dependent on agriculture. Customer purchasing power was further affected by increased Value Added Tax (VAT), higher interest rates compounded by floods in the wet zone. The consumer durables industry, is normally affected much more than other sectors when consumer incomes decline.
Commenting on the results, Asoka Pieris, Group CEO said The change of ownership has been extremely positive. Singer continues to pursue its strategies to maintain market leadership in consumer durables. We believe that with additional ideas, plans and resources generated by the new owners and synergies with Hayleys PLC, a bright future augurs for the Singer Group.
Commenting on the outlook, Mohan Pandithage, Group Chairman said Hayleys Group as the major shareholder is confident that Singers position as the leader in consumer durables will further strengthened as Hayleys and Singer have an excellent strategic fit with potential for significant growth prospects.

SL exports up, further increases to come
An upturn in exports and investment helped counter weaker output from Sri Lankas agricultural sector in 2017, facilitating steady growth overall and raising prospects of further gains this year.
In an October update the World Bank forecast Sri Lankas economy would expand by 4.6% in 2017, up two percentage points from the previous year, on the back of rising private consumption and investment. However, the IMF was more cautious: at the end of September it forecast full-year growth of below 4.5%, rising to 4.8% in 2018.
Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), was also cautious about full-year growth projections, revising the banks forecast downwards in November to 4-4.5% from 4.5%.
Weather events weigh on agriculture
The severe drought of 2016 continued to impact agriculture in the first half of 2017. Several of the countrys key crops under-performed in the first quarter, with rice production down 53%. Despite this, the economy showed resilience, growing 3.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first half, according to the Asian Development Bank.
In the third quarter, however, growth eased to 3.3%, down from 4.6% y-o-y, as widespread flooding in May caused agriculture to contract by 3.4%, according to CBSL data. The industrial sector also contributed to the deceleration, expanding by 1.9% y-o-y in the third quarter compared to 5.9% in 2016. However, stronger performance from services, which grew 4.3% y-o-y, helped offset this.
Inflation continued to be above targeted levels during 2017. The national consumer price index (CPI) rose from 8.2% y-o-y in February to 8.4% in November, the CBSL said in a report issued at the end of December, having hit a six-month high in September of 8.6%.
The bank noted that inflation should fall in the first quarter of 2018, as the effect of adverse weather conditions on agricultural production and, in turn, food prices, begins to ease.
meeting of 2017 to hold its standing deposit and lending facility rates at 7.25% and 8.75% respectively. Both have remained unchanged since March.
FDI increases to $795.5m
Among the positives, foreign direct investment (FDI) increased significantly in 2017. At the end of November Dumindra Ratnayaka, chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI), said FDI was expected to total 1.5bn for the year, almost doubling the inflows of 2016. According to the latest data from the BOI, which measures up until the end of the third quarter, manufacturing and services accounted for roughly half of all FDI, while the rest was accounted for by infrastructure and utilities.
The 2018 budget, ratified by Parliament on December 9, contained several support mechanisms aimed at boosting investment, including enhanced depreciation allowances and incentives for investment across designated zones in sectors such as renewable energy and information technology. It also foresees the lifting of foreign ownership rest the shipping and freighting agency segment, allowing for FDI in the maritime and in logistics sectors.
In addition, there were measures to boost revenue, such as the narrowing of exemptions for value-added tax and national building tax, new banking fees and increased levies on car sales.
Exports up, further increases to come
Sri Lanka also posted strong export growth in 2017, with outbound shipments totalling $12.5bn in the 10 months to the end of October, according to data released by the Export Development Board in December.
In a key development, foreign trade was given a boost in May, when Sri Lanka regained its place on the EUs generalised scheme of preferences (GSP)+.
In tandem with the move, which saw duties removed on 66% of tariff lines on local products and services, exports to the EU increased by 4.1% in the January-October period.
The reinstatement of GSP+ benefits will support several sectors in the short-to-medium term, according to Ashroff Omar, CEO of Brandix, an apparel firm.
With Sri Lanka regaining EU GSP+ status, businesses involved in traditional sectors will experience great growth, as happened last time the country belonged to the scheme, he told OBG.
Apart from the apparel industry, marine products and spices are expected to flourish with easier access to the European market.
However, the expected rise will be offset by a likely downturn in exports to the US market, after Washington chose not to renew its GSP programme when it expired on December 31.

SLPP leader tried to  change countrys  unitary status: Minister
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said Prof. G. L. Peiris, the leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), has suggested thrice that the unitary status of the country be removed from the Constitution.
While drafting three new Constitutions in 1995, 1997 and 2000, Prof. Peiris removed the unitary status from the drafts. Besides, Peiris further suggested that the clause, which gives priority to Buddhism, be removed from those three drafts of the Constitution.
That is how he behaved and acted. Peiris tried to remove the unitary status from the Constitution on three occasions. It is amazing that he now talks about the unitary status of the country and priority for Buddhism, he said.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Speaking on the political behaviour of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Perera said people do not trust the SLPP as it is backed by Basil Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa, who are mainly responsible for the SLFP defeat in 2015.
During Mahinda Rajapaksas regime, true SLFP parliamentarians were sidelined. But persons who crossed over were welcomed by offering various benefits including portfolios, he said.
Even now the situation is unchanged as outsiders such as Udaya Gammanpila, Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa etc. are given priority while the true SLFPers are sidelined, he said.
State Minister Perera said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee will decide whether this unity government goes any further after the forthcoming election.
He added that it can be observed that there is a hidden agenda between the SLPP and the UNP regarding the election.
He said the majority of the United National Party (UNP) members are against fraud and corruption and therefore, they are intent on getting the name of the party cleared.
Perera added that even though the forthcoming election is not a General Election, moves can be taken by the people to change the Prime Minister with the election. According to the Constitution, the power of appointing the Prime Minister is vested with the President but it is up to the people to cast votes in favour of the SLFP to strengthen the President who could take a decision in connection with the appointment of the Prime Minister.
The Minister said the President will take up the responsibility of creating a new Constitution and handling the countrys economy soon after the election.

## Supertitle:

SRI LANKA: 70 YEARS INDEPENDENCE
Sri Lanka achieved independence seventy years ago. What does this mean What we achieved was self-government  the ability to elect our own rulers; but as a society did we become freer We are no longer administered by rulers appointed from afar but is the citizenry free
Representative, constitutional democracy is the best means known for keeping rulers accountable. Contrary to popular belief its real benefit is in removing bad leaders, not in choosing good ones.
To get elected politicians may lie or may make meaningless appeals to emotion, only a handful truly understand the problems or have real intent on solving them. Citizens have to sift truth and assess ability with minimal information. There is no way to know how a politician will perform once elected.
As a system for choosing leaders, it fares poorly but citizens can remove the really bad ones. This is the most important, maybe even the only real check that citizens have on power.
Thus while democracy is an improvement on colonialism, it does have its limits. Power remains in the hands of fallible human beings but at least the bad can be booted out. It is a good way to make a few big decisions-once elected the politician has little concern with the citizen until the next election-but it is best to leave smaller ones in the hands of citizens themselves.
What matters in daily life is personal freedom.
The Government intervenes heavily in the economy, its motives driven by corruption and the protection of special interests. They benefit a few to the detriment of the many. Fiscal prudence must be restored and cuts made to the size and scope of Government spending. This regime was elected on mandate of good governance, so they should use the mandate to restore the personal freedom of the citizenry in all spheres of life
Freedom is about not being limited by in ones actions by threats, coercion or interference of others  specifically, other individuals or institutions, such as government or religious bodies. The only good reason to interfere with peoples freedom is to prevent them doing or threatening actual harm to others.
Freedom is guaranteed by laws that restrain the power to interfere in peoples lives. The role of Government is to uphold the rule of law. As Francisco de Paula Santander (1792-1840), Colombian soldier and statesman said Weapons have given you independence. Laws will give you freedom.
Colonial laws
Sri Lanka has no bill of rights and we inherited some colonial laws that intrude into personal freedom.
For example, articles 365 and 365A of the Penal Code are widely considered to criminalise homosexuality and are used to arrest, detain, harass, intimidate, blackmail and shame. The Vagrants Ordinance is used to harass, arrest and detain sex-workers, and is also used to criminalise the poor, mentally ill, disabled and other vulnerable people. Abortion is illegal except to save the life of the mother. Half the population, women, are discriminated in the Thesawalami, Kandyan and Muslim laws.
These are questions of morals, customs and ethics, things that concern individual citizens. It is individuals who must tussle with these issues, not the law. In any case the law should apply equally to everyone, regardless of gender, race, religion or language.
We may well detest other peoples morality, religion, political views or lifestyle. We may worry that they are harming their health but these are not valid reasons to interfere in the lives of others. Minors should be protected but consenting adults should be left in peace.
Any regulation should focus on limiting public harm, not protecting morality. Strict laws on drunk driving, prohibition on sale of alcohol to minors or limiting public smoking may make sense but the recent foray of state policy, through punitive taxation and restrictive laws to stop the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is wrong.
There are licenses and taxes that most countries impose but they must be reasonable. The fact that some people disapprove of something is no reason to restrain others. The goal of taxation should be the raising of revenue, not punishment.
It is a fact that individuals disagree on things. What is the interest of one is not necessarily of the other. When one is called to give up some freedom for society what happens in reality is the sacrifice of one set of interests to another, there is no real common interest.
Self interest of politicians, officials
When the state makes laws, a choice will be made over many conflicting sets of interests-a choice in which only one side can win. The process of lawmaking is tainted by the self- interest of politicians, officials and lobbyists. It can lead to minority groups being exploited and their liberties curbed.
Therefore the passing of laws, especially those that curb rights should only be resorted to only when strictly necessary. Calls to curb or ban activities must be viewed sceptically. For example, why is horse racing banned in Sri Lanka This may not be an important example but the problem is mission-creep restrictions start innocuously but then keep expanding.
If freedom is to be restricted it should be up to those who want to do so to show why this is both necessary and sufficiently beneficial to warrant it. Election success does not license the winning majority to treat other people exactly as it chooses.
The philosopher John Locke listed life, liberty and property as basic freedoms: people have a right to live, to do as they please (provided they do not infringe the equal right of others) and to enjoy all that they own.
Lockes concept of property was not limited to land, he claimed people had property in their own lives, bodies and labour. They deserved to own the things that they had spent personal effort in creating and ownership should be secure under the law.
Sri Lankas emergency regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism Act granted the authorities sweeping powers of search, arrest, and detention, which have led to arbitrary detention, torture, and enforced disappearances. The Government has been widely criticised for abuses against political opponents and innocents, particularly minorities who claim to have been targeted purely on suspicion.
These laws remain even nine years after the end of the war. For at least some, the right to life could be under threat. The right to property has also been under attack.
Land, houses and businesses were expropriated by law. Laws were passed limiting what property citizens could own and how they could use it. For example, land classified as paddy land can only be used for paddy, not other crops or purposes. Restrictions apply to the sale of tea, rubber and coconut land. Never mind that people may no longer want to farm or have other needs, such as housing. The colonials also confiscated land but there is no need to repeat the error.
Land reforms
Whether the exercise even benefited society is doubtful, certainly Sri Lanka never became rich as a result.
Land reforms, ostensibly to help the poor, weakened a fundamental pillar of freedom-the right to hold what we own. Once personal property is no longer sacrosanct a precedent is set for future abuse: witness the complaints of the poor evicted from their homes in Colombo or the plight of some of the displaced in the conflict zone, denied access to their land. Laws enacted to reengineer society for the betterment of the weak have created the conditions for their oppression.
Money, lawfully earned cannot be used as we wish. Exchange Controls, introduced in 1953, later expanded and later partially reversed dictate how we spend our own money. At one time it was impossible to travel abroad, spend on overseas education or buy anything imported unless deemed essential by the state. Thankfully some rules have been relaxed but try sending money to relatives overseas (for medical or other reasons) or remit the proceeds of property sales and we face obstacles. Are these trivial issues Perhaps, but even so why Colonial Ceylon had no restrictions but independent Sri Lanka does. Problems of mismanagement of finances by the Government translate to restrictions on citizens.
If citizens, even if displaced or poor, feel their rights are infringed they should be able to seek justice through the courts. Few seem to try. The system of justice has corroded. The courts exist and the police exist but are they independent enough to uphold and enforce the law Can an ordinary person hope to win in court against a politician
A new regime is in power, when they celebrate independence they must reflect on the state of personal freedom.
The purpose of Government should be to expand freedom, not restrict it.
New constitution
A new constitution can help protect natural justice: enshrine the due process of the legal system, ensure equal treatment; and define a personal sphere into which legislation and officialdom can never intrude.
They must recognise that peoples beliefs, lifestyle or morals vary. There is no common agreement on what is acceptable, unacceptable, tolerable or intolerable. As long as no harm is done to others the state should not intervene in such matters, legislation that permits this should be rolled back.
The independence and integrity of the system of justice must be restored.
The Government intervenes heavily in the economy, its motives driven by corruption and the protection of special interests. They benefit a few to the detriment of the many. Fiscal prudence must be restored and cuts made to the size and scope of Government spending.
This regime was elected on mandate of good governance, so they should use the mandate to restore the personal freedom of the citizenry in all spheres of life.

Sri Lanka Pavilion launched in Fliggy Tourism Platform of Alibaba
Sri Lankas Supreme Global Holdings, and Alibaba Group owned Alitrip which is now called Fliggy, launched the Sri Lanka Pavilion in Fliggys tourism platform that will target to bring a million new Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka every year. The grand launch was made in Beijing om Tuesday.
Alibaba, setting new standards in its globalization moves also launched an online visa center for Sri Lanka establishing ease of travel. This move will allow Chinese consumers to stay at home and use their smart phones to apply for their visas.
Both Alibaba and Supreme will work closely with Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau on the project implementation which will result in large scale impact on Sri Lankas tourism positively. The ultimate goal of the partnership is to secure a major share of the 137 Million Chinese tourists who travel overseas every year. Sri Lanka currently has secured only 230,000 out of this big market.
A notable feature of this very potential market is their habit of making payments using Alipay. Supreme Global intends to promote Alipay actively in Sri Lanka upon receiving the necessary clearances eliminating this barrier thus taking Sri Lanka Tourism to new heights.
As part of Alibaba Group, Fliggy has access to more than 500 million mobile monthly active users on Alibabas China retail marketplaces. This means that by partnering with Alibaba Sri Lanka can gain valuable insights into the Chinese market, with massive access to better customize Sri Lankas tourism products and services for Chinese tourists.
In particular the Alibaba platform and data mining will enable specialist Chinese tourist interest to be fine tuned to the specialist Sri Lankan tourist market, be it be in Buddhist studies and history, eco tourism, biodiversity, tea cultivation or wild life and bird watching specialisation.
R. M. Manivannan Chairman of Supreme Global Holdings said that this is one way Sri Lanka can develop high value added tourism, matching customer needs to services on offer on an individual case by case basis and link that to the specialist hotels that cater for a wide range of interest.

Suspension bridge a death trap
The suspension bridge across the Mahaweli River on the Ginigathena-Wevelthalawa road in the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha area in Nuwara Eliya District has been in a state of disrepair for several years. The wooden planks fixed on the 40 metre-long bridge which was constructed by the then Ambagamuwa North Village Council several decades ago are decayed and its supportive wires have become loosened making it a death trap.Villagers of Wevelthalawa walking daily to and from Ginigathena town, urge the authorities concerned to take steps to renovate the bridge.

Tackling bribery, corruption
The revelation made by President Maithripala Sirisena that although the Bribery Act was introduced 23 years ago only four convictions had been achieved up-to-date, no doubt, is an indication how the canker of bribery and corruption had been treated with frivolity in this country by its leaders and those in authority. Addressing a local government election rally in Matale, the President said during the time of his predecessor those arraigned for bribery were either granted bail, or, the charges changed following a telephone call to Hulftsdorp, while the Bribery Commission was weakened and rendered impotent.
The President, who was a senior minister under Mahinda Rajapaksa, certainly would have had inside knowledge on how the system operated. It was plain to all that the Attorney Generals Department too dawdled on the cases against Rajapaksa henchmen. Not just on bribery and corruption cases but also cases of rape and murder. It was party time for those in the regime, bent on filling their kitties, in illegal ways.
It is not that the law was inadequate. The Bribery Commission was active and showed results during the times of Nelum Gamage and Ian Wickremanayake although the latter was accused of carrying out a political witch-hunt. After all, four convictions had indeed taken place, as the President had acknowledged, from 1995.
It is blatant interference into the Commission's functions and orders to sit on cases that resulted in the poor conviction rate. Nay, bribery was allowed to flourish. Mega corruption, at the very top, seeped down to the bottom layers. The President recently made the rather interesting remark concerning his predecessor, in this connection. He said when, as SLFP General Secretary, while addressing a local government election rally, he had prevailed upon the candidates not to engage in corrupt acts but to serve the people honestly, only to be made to eat humble pie by then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, while making the final address, requested the candidates that when they steal, to do so discreetly, without being found out.
The President, we are certain, had no reason to make up this story. This puts in perspective the attitude displayed towards bribery and corruption by the leaders of the day. The twin evils thrived to the hilt, what with the green light given by the highest in the land. Not just encouraging bribery and corruption. Exposing corrupts acts within the government was also frowned upon. Minister Rauff Hakeem, on Wednesday, recalled his own experience, that went onto demonstrate this in no uncertain terms.
As one time Chairman of COPE he was instrumental in exposing the monumental VAT fraud at the Inland Revenue Department. Instead of being commended for unraveling the fraud, that cost the state tens of billions of rupees, all that he received from the former President were strictures for placing the government in an embarrassing position, by making such a revelation, forcing him to quit as COPE Chairman. Government MPs and Rajapaksa lackeys, who were nabbed for graft, and, summoned before the Bribery Commission, were given the kid glove treatment, following orders from the top. One recalls the famous instance where a Deputy Minister and staunch Rajapaksa ally, who was unable to explain how he acquired assets worth Rs 400 million, when summoned by the Commission, was conveniently stung by a polanga. The Commission took this explanation lying down and did not pursue the matter further. Regrettably, this case is still lying in abeyance, with hearings repeatedly postponed. This worthy, incidentally, has today become a vociferous crusader against corruption and one of the vocal critics of the Yahapalanaya government, on the Bond matter.
The Chairman of the Bribery Commission Sarath Jayamanne has called for the amending of the anti-corruption laws, as it stands, in order to give it more teeth to facilitate prosecution. But will amending the law make a difference, going by the past record, in this connection It all boils down to the will to genuinely implement the law without political interference. There are positive signs, though, that this sad chapter of political interference to bail out crooks will be closed, if recent developments are anything to go by. The President is determined to see the anti-corruption drive continues in earnest. Addressing yet another election rally he said he would not hesitate to take action against corrupt elements without any consideration as to which party they belonged to. He noted that he stepped out of the party he was in earlier due to its corrupt nature. But having formed a new alliance, if there was corruption, there too, he would certainly not accept this as a policy.
It is such sentiments, and, open expressions of commitment to eradicate bribery and corruption in government that were singularly lacking during the ten year rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa. This naturally gave his cronies the license to indulge in corrupt acts. So much so, a powerful minister, and, Rajapaksa sibling, was known as Mr. ten percent. This worthy too is among those vociferous JO stalwarts, railing against government, over the bendumkaraya.

TBWAL takes on 2018 with stronger  focus on brand, business building
Best known for their Disruptive approaches to brand building, TBWAri Lanka has been a steadfast agency in Sri Lankas advertising industry over the past few decades.
With time, having established and nurtured strong and long-standing relationships with their clients, the Agency has grown and evolved together with the brands they manage, to produce some of the most iconic, disruptive and effective work the country has seen.
Armed with their wins from 2017 and powered by new leadership, the Agency has stepped into 2018 with an even more strengthened focus on brand and business building.
Disruption is who we are. Its what we are known for. Its whats in our blood. While our work will continue to be propelled by Disruption, we are taking 2018 head on with an augment focus on brand and business building, said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director  TBWAri Lanka.
2017 was a spectacular one for us as an Agency. Among others, it was the first time ever that the TBWARegional Leadership and Creative planning meeting was held together and more importantly was hosted by TBWAri Lanka. This was an immense win for us as it showed that the region recognized the importance of Sri Lanka and what we have to offer, she said.
Everything we have achieved is because our Agency has grown stronger as a team. Having a strong and diverse team, with a touch of quirk is a wonderful strength and something we have always embraced. We are strengthening our team to meet the rising demand of the market and will continue to fuel them with trainings and exposure at both a local and international level, I am extremely excited to see what 2018 has in store for us, she added.
2017 was another year of steady progress for TBWAri Lanka. Having been named the 2017 Agency of the Year by Campaign Brief Asia; being the only Sri Lankan Agency to be awarded metal at Adfest, Ad Stars, Midas, Epica and Sharks; winning 3 Gold, 8 Silver and 3 Bronze awards throughout the year; retaining Silver at the Agency of the Year Awards for the 3rd consecutive year and winning the Peoples Choice Award for Maliban Cream Cracker are only some of the noteworthy achievements TBWAri Lanka accomplished during 2017.
Additionally, 2017 saw the Agencys experience further expand into new categories, growing the already robust brand portfolio.
To spearhead the creative leadership of the team from 2018,the Agency also recruited industry expert S. Nathasoruban as their Chief Creative Officer. Soru, as he is better known in Sri Lankas advertising industry, has a strong reputation in the marketing fraternity as a whizz in brand building, which falls in perfect alignment with TBWAri Lankas focus for 2018.
We are so pleased to have Soru join us to head our Creative Department from this year on. He is also an individual with a plethora of experience in some of Sri Lankas biggest and strongest brands. We look forward to having him lead and strengthen our team with the wealth of knowledge and expertise he has to offer, said Renuka.

U.S., Sri Lanka to celebrate  70 years of working together
February 4 marks the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka's Independence. It also marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Sri Lanka. In honor of this milestone, the U.S. Embassy in Colombo will launch a series of programs over the course of the next twelve months, the U.S. Embassy stated in a press release.
Encompassing cultural events, educational opportunities, and community engagements that will involve Sri Lankans from all backgrounds and regions of the country, the #USASL70 campaign underscores the seven decades of respect and partnership that have characterized the U.S.-Sri Lanka relationship, the statement said.
Our Embassy community is delighted to celebrate this wonderful anniversary with our Sri Lankan friends and partners, said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap. For seven decades, the United States has stood shoulder to shoulder with Sri Lanka, whether as one of the largest donors of foreign assistance or as Sri Lankas largest trading partner.
Later in February, celebrated New York City jazz artiste Wycliffe Gordon will travel to Sri Lanka and premiere a special composition commissioned by the U.S. Embassy commemorating the 70th anniversary. Gordon will perform at a gala concert in addition to informal shows around Colombo that will be open to the public. Other major cultural events during the year-long celebrations include the American Film Showcase featuring visiting U.S. filmmakers, an education fair on American university academic opportunities, and sports exchange programs with Sri Lankan youth, the release added.
#USASL70 will also highlight new significant bilateral initiatives, such as the signing of the Peace Corps bilateral agreement to return to Sri Lanka. During the campaign, exercises between the two countries militaries will enhance disaster response capabilities and expand interoperability. Supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development, job training programs will help prepare Sri Lankan youth for employment in the 21st century, while agricultural assistance will help make Sri Lankas dairy industry more productive.
Our #USSL70 campaign is about more than looking back at our shared history; its about a vision of Sri Lankas future as a stable democracy that could stand as a beacon of tolerance and prosperity in the region. For another 70 years and beyond, the United States is here to help make that vision a reality, added Ambassador Keshap.

Viduras victorious cast
English Drama at Vidura is all about solidarity. They have grown together as a team and with the guidance of their teachers they have proved that they can meet any challenge. Dramatic Moves features the dramatists of Vidura who are getting into the habit of winning.
Teacher in Charge of Drama Achala Amarathunga, pointed out that it has been a process of growth when it comes to Drama at Vidura. She has seen these children gather knowledge over time and develop into competent dramatists.
When it comes to the personality of the child, it needs to be improved so they can cope with the outside world. It helps them form good relationships and they are able to develop empathy. They learn to work as a team. And through that, their qualities can be improved. We have seen students blossom under us and have received recognition in the school by doing drama. So as a teacher I am very happy when I see such things, said Amarathunga.
Amarathunga pointed out that doing drama allows the children to explore themselves very naturally.
It allows them to find their path and free their minds. That is very beneficial to them. There have been absolutely no problems regarding their discipline. I would also like to thank our Principal Mr. D.G. Sumanasekara for his support. Here we have our girls and boys working together, stated Amarathunga.
Memorable productions
Teacher of English Language and Literature, Sanjeewa Gunarathna is proud of these students. Together they have proved that Vidura College can compete against the best in the English Drama Circuit. These are memories that he will cherish because what they have achieved they have achieved as a team.
We participated in the Inter School Shakespeare Drama Competition 2017 organized by YMCA and Colombo Rotary Club and won best novice award for our production of Two Gentlemen in Verona which is considered as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays.
I selected it because our students did not have much experience in doing Shakespearean dramas
We put together a memorable production at the 2017 Inter-School Shakespeare competition, and we did this within a short period of time. While some people say it is impossible to train a drama group within a few weeks, I was able to train them within six weeks.
While other schools have a number of script editors, directors and stage managers, like Jerome De Silva and Jehan Aloysius, I did everything alone. We did not get any advice or ideas from any theater genius. I alone edited the script, did the directing as well as the lighting too. I had a stage manager who was an A/L student with very good organization and managing skills.
The Students in Vidura College are really talented and can follow instructions very well. Although we were not selected to the final round, we proved to everyone that we are capable and talented, said Teacher of English Language and Literature, Sanjeewa Gunarathna.
Gunarathna pointed out that doing drama makes you a well- balanced person. He says that, that is the main reason he has fallen in love with drama.
Drama helps me learn right and wrong
Dramatist Pulasthi Udugamasooriya, rates Two Gentleman of Verona as one of his favorite plays. That was the first time he has participated in a drama.
It was not easy since there were a lot of things we had to do such as cooperating with the others. It helped me develop my skills to a great extent. The fact that we won an award makes me very proud. There are a lot of things that make me happy when I think of that achievement, said Udugamasooriya
In the Two Gentlemen of Verona, Udugamasooriya had to act two characters  The Duke and Antonio. Udugamasooriya had a certain affinity to the Dukes character since it was close to his personality. The social status and the power the Duke had certainly appealed to Udugamasooriya.
I think the Two Gentlemen of Verona has sudden plot twists and is not as lively as the other plays Shakespeare has written. It is a happy ending but the way that the ending happens with the twists and all of that, to me it is not a very good flow. There are other plays he has written like Hamlet and Othello, and I prefer them more. So Two Gentlemen of Verona could have been better if there was a better flow of incidents, pointed out Udugamasooriya.
Drama has taught him how to address an audience properly and how to face an audience without feeling nervous.
When I had problems in my mind I was able to free myself doing drama. It helped a lot to improve my personality. I think drama allows us the opportunity to look at life from someone elses point of view. We are used to seeing things only from our own perspective and that is why lots of problems happen. So when you act, you see things from another perspective. You learn right and wrong, added Udugamasooriya
A big impact on my life
Dramatist Akalanka Welagedara, said his favorite play was Twist of Tales which he did in 2012. It was a comedy and Welagedaras character involved a lot of humor.
I love humor and in real life I am a very jovial person. That was the main reason I loved that play. My character was named Tweedledumb. Doing it was fun for me because he was very lively. It was a comedy with no moral at the end. It was all based on humor, said Welagedara.
Welagedara commented that drama has had a big impact on his life. He has received a merit award for one of his roles.
Doing drama has done wonders for my social life as well. I am highly regarded at school. I am happy with what I have achieved. I would like to thank my teachers for all the help. I would also like to thank my dear Principal. I would also like to thank my mom and dad. I have a dream and an ambition and I am working towards it. My school has given me the platform and I am doing my best, said Welagedara.
I can do almost anything on stage
Dramatist Jayathri Rathnayaka, said that her favorite play was the one she acted in called We Are One. It was about a multi-cultural country, where there were so many conflicts and in the end everyone gets together.
That really made me very happy. Because it is not something that you see nowadays. Seeing that in a drama made me feel really pleased. I played the character of the principal. My mother is actually a teacher, so it suited my character a lot, said Rathnayaka.
Rathnayaka who is naturally a bubbly, easygoing and outgoing young girl, likes to do comedies and calls herself a happy go lucky character.
The stage is a place where I can express myself. I can do almost anything on stage. I can make people laugh or make people emotional. I feel happy and at ease on stage. I feel very pleased to be on stage performing with the others, I can skip my boundaries on stage. I was even able to talk to people I did not know, said Rathnayaka
Fathers role is memorable
Dramatist Vinuk Thismalpola, feels very positively about the drama, Little Angel because that play was based on the Tsunami that happened in 2004. It was based on a true incident.
It was a drama based on a true story. To enact it on stage was a very powerful experience taking into account the emotions that it involves  how people reacted to the Tsunami. Because when the Tsunami hit Sri Lanka it was a new experience for us. I feel very fortunate to take part in that drama.
The character I played was the role of a father, and that character is memorable to me.
I feel drama is a field where I can explore myself and you can express anything. You can give any sort of message out to the people. It helped in my personality development and helped me address an audience. It has taught me how to express my creative abilities, said Thismalpola.
Indeed teacher in charge Achala Amarathunga pointed out that Thismalpola has great organizational skills. He excels academically as well.
