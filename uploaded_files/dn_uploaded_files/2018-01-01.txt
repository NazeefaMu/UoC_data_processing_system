The year that was
2017 a bruising one for Sri Lanka cricket
What has happened has happened it is no use dwelling into the past and regretting of what might have been. One has to look at the positive side of things and keep moving. In that context the year 2017 is something that Sri Lanka cricket should quickly forget and put behind and hope that 2018 will be a rosy one for them.
Since winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996, the past year has been the worst that Sri Lanka has ever gone through in international cricket. No one ever thought that Sri Lanka cricket could fall to such despicable levels that it came to a point where people who followed cricket were so frustrated and angry that they simply switched off their TV sets or changed to a different channel rather than watch a team wilt and go down without a fight time and time again.
Dilruwan Perera
The departures of Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilhan and the fading performance of Lasith Malinga as a potent match winning fast bowler over the past two years had a telling effect on the team as the replacements tried out could not match up to the class of the four and subsequently the performances suffered. It has been a gradual decline of the performances since the 2015 World Cup when the two big guns Mahela and Sanga decided to quit international cricket. The culmination of it was 2017.
It is no surprise that Sri Lankas bane for the losses was their batting. What, with Mahela, Sanga and Dilshan all match winning performers missing from the line up the batting struggled to come to terms especially in the one-day format and the failure to run up competitive totals left the bowlers with a hard task of trying to contain world class batting line ups.
The consistent chopping and changing of players (some of them due to injuries and others due to cricket politics) and captains had an adverse effect on the overall performance of the team.
For the record Sri Lanka fielded 36 players in ODIs, 23 players in Tests and 31 players in T20Is during the year which is the highest by any country for all three formats in 2017.
So it was no surprise to see Sri Lanka ending 2017 with a dismal record of 23 defeats from 29 ODI matches with only five wins to show for the entire year. It came to a point at one stage that Sri Lanka were in danger of having to qualify for the 2019 Cricket World Cup  something they have never experienced since 1979, but thankfully to West Indies who were the only team that could have put them in such an embarrassing position, Sri Lanka were denied of that humiliation. West Indies had to beat Ireland and England to rank above Sri Lanka but they failed.
Even in T20 internationals where they were once the world champions not so long ago, Sri Lanka faltered badly suffering 10 defeats from 15 matches. They began the year promisingly with surprise 2-1 series wins in South Africa and in Australia but fell away in the remaining nine matches to record just one win.
Sri Lankas performance in the Tests was not as bad as that as in the one-day game. Although they suffered two 3-0 whitewashes at the hands of South Africa and India and a maiden Test loss to Bangladesh handing to them a rare win in their 100th Test, Sri Lanka stunned Steve Smiths Australians with a rare 3-0 whitewash of the series at home and followed it up with another 2-0 whitewash of Pakistan handing to the hosts their first series defeat in the UAE.
Apart from these two Test victories, Sri Lanka had only an unexpected win over India in the Champions trophy and another win in the first ODI at Dharamsala also against India to show in what was a terrible year. The most talked about and much publicised moment of the year was the sitter dropped by Thisara Perera off Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed in a crucial quarterfinal match that denied Sri Lanka a place in the semi-final and allowed Pakistan to go and win the Champions trophy beating India in the final.
The absolute nadir for Sri Lanka cricket came when they lost the five-match ODI series to Zimbabwe for the first time that resulted in Angelo Mathews stepping down from the captaincy across all formats.
Amidst all this onfield gloom Sri Lanka won accolades when they took international cricket back to Pakistan by sending their national team to play the third T20 international of a three-match series in Lahore  the venue of a terrorist attack on their team bus in 2009, an incident that brought to an end international tours to Pakistan. Amidst tight security the match went ahead without any incident and it issued to the ICC a strong statement that it was now safe for cricket to resume regularly in Pakistan. How other non-Asian countries would view it was a matter of conjecture.
Everything looked rosy for Sri Lanka at the beginning of the year when Graham Ford came on board for a second stint with the national team. But his tenure was soon cut short the moment Sri Lanka Cricket appointed former World Cup star Asanka Gurusinha as the cricket manager of the team. Ford had differences with Gurusinha and the relationship soon ended with Ford quietly making his exit without much fanfare at the end of the Champions trophy. Sri Lanka were left without a head coach for the next seven months and had to manage with their fielding coach Nic Pothas who was elevated to interim head coach. With the limited knowledge he had of handling a national team Pothas somewhat managed to keep the team afloat despite the mounting losses until Sri Lanka Cricket eventually found a permanent head coach in former Sri Lanka cricketer Chandika Hathurusingha whose arrival has renewed hopes of a much needed team revival for 2018.
Individually in the Test arena Dimuth Karunaratne and skipper Dinesh Chandimal showed consistency in their batting each reaching 1000 runs in the calendar year, while in the fifty-over format Upul Tharanga achieved a similar milestone. In the bowling the improvement of Suranga Lakmal as the spearhead of the bowling attack in Tests and ODIs was a redeeming feature. Veteran spinner Rangana Herath continued to churn out Test victories for Sri Lanka but at 39 his days are numbered as a regular Test player finding it difficult to continue playing three-Test series as the demands on his body and recovery period gets getting longer.
The biggest disappointment was the fading form of Lasith Malinga who could not produce the pace that made him a feared one-day bowler.
Of the individual performances Kusal Mendis two outstanding knocks 176 against Australia and 194 against Bangladesh marked him as a player for the big occasion, Niroshan Dickwella continued to impress and depress with his approach to batting. With Danushka Gunathilaka he figured in two back to back double century opening partnerships against Zimbabwe in ODIs. Mendis and Dickwella are the players to watch in 2018.

Agar ready for another spin tilt at England in Sydney
SYDNEY: Ashton Agar said Sunday he was ready for another crack at England after being called into Australia's squad as the second spinning option for this week's final Ashes Test in Sydney.
Whether Agar plays alongside first-choice spinner Nathan Lyon depends on the state of the Sydney Cricket Ground pitch, which in the past has earned a reputation as a turning wicket.
Agar shot to Test fame when he made a record score of 98 while batting at number 11 against England at Trent Bridge in July 2013.
However Agar, 24, has played only three Tests since then after he managed just two wickets at 124 in two matches in that series more than four years ago.
He played in both Tests against Bangladesh this year and said he was ready to take on England if he got his chance in Thursday's Sydney Test.
I feel better coming into a Test match now. It doesn't feel too fresh or too out of the blue, Agar told reporters.
Playing the one-dayers in India (this year) was a pretty whirlwind experience. So I certainly feel a lot better walking out onto the SCG now. Skipper Steve Smith said he was unsure what to expect from the SCG pitch following Saturday's attritional fourth Test draw on a lifeless Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch. The hosts have already clinched the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series ahead of the final Test in Sydney.
Pace spearhead Mitchell Starc, who missed the Melbourne Test with a bruised heel, was bidding to play in Sydney and it was likely either Agar or Starc would replace Jackson Bird in the final Australia XI.
Agar insisted he was a far more consistent bowler than the one who made his stunning Ashes debut in 2013.
I don't look back on that (Trent Bridge) too much. They are great memories but I've definitely moved forward since then and I feel like I've improved as a player, Agar said.
I was a kid. I was 19 ... I'm certainly better for the experience. I've grown up a lot since then. Life experience and cricket experience.
I'm still reasonably young, but the time is now so I'm just going to give it a good crack. Agar has worked with mentor John Davison and Indian spin guru Sridharan Sriram to prepare better for Test cricket.
We've worked on my action a little bit a few years ago. It's just been a lot of bowling and self-confidence, Agar said.
All you've got is yourself out there and it's certainly grown. Smith, who hit an unbeaten 102 to play out a draw against England in Melbourne, said he did not know what to expectin Sydney.
We'll turn up there and see what the wicket is, Smith said after Saturday's Test draw.
You don't know what you're going to get in Sydney. One day it could be green, one day it could spin a bit.
We've got all options there. We'll wait and see how we go. AFP

Rowena Ahlip
She was an inspiration
A shining light has gone out of the Malay Community in Sri Lanka with the passing of the doyen of the Padang Triumvirate (the Colombo Malay Cricket Club, the Sri Lanka Malay Association, and the Sri Lanka Malay Association Rupee Fund), Rowena Ahlip, in September, 2017, just two months short of her 101st birthday.It was only in November, last year, that she turned a glorious 100 years, when past and present spread across the globe, from down under to up yonder, counting four generations, gathered at her Mount Lavinia residence to celebrate this remarkable lady and rejoice her 100th birthday.
While not wanting to mourn her death, let us rejoice Rowenas life. In doing so, I wish to go back in time and provide some insight for people who may not remember that there was a world before the advent of Facebook, the worldwide web, and the internet.
The eldest progeny of that great Malay Statesman and Cabinet minister in then Ceylons first post independent government, the late Dr. T. B. Jayah, I have known Rowena for well over 50 years, which is more than two thirds of my life time. In 1972, as Assistant General Secretary of the Colombo Malay Cricket Club, which is the oldest Ceylonese cricket club, it was my privilege to have been in the committee organising its centenary celebrations and the golden jubilee of the Sri Lanka Malay Association, alongside many stalwarts of the Club, including Rowena.
Playing a pivotal role, I greatly benefitted in enhancing my organizational skills, thanks to Rowenas counsel. Whatever she embarked on, she did it with great finesse, and it was indeed a pleasure to have her on board the continuing committee.
For everyone who knew Rowena, especially her children, she was a loving matriarch devoted to family and friends. For her six children and their spouses, nine grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren, she was not only a repository of memories from every family and holiday occasion or party, but someone who was always vibrant. To her children who grew up in her warm and loving home, she was more than a mothershe was an inspiration.
She leaves behind a legacy made up of all facets of her life. To my mind, a portrayal of her time in this world is that she chose to live until death without spending time dying until death occurred.
May her journey through the gardens of Jennah be devoid of all obstacles, and in the fullness of time, may Allah grant her the bliss of Jennathul Firdouse.

Newton Gunasekara
Brilliant and enthusiastic
A remembrance of my friend Newton Gunasekera cannot be written without his good qualities as friendship with correct friends and love with all he associated as friends or relatives.
He was able to form a Novelists Association of Sri Lanka with popular novelists, namely Kumara Karunarathne and Edward Mallawarachchi as his vision was to join hand with all the novelists together in Sri Lanka and produce good novels for the sake of the readers in the country.
Others associated with him to set up this Novelists Association of Sri Lanka were Raja T. Basnayake, Deeman Ananda, Wimal Thilaratne, Laksaman Mallawarachchi, Chandi Kodikara, Shantha Kumara Withana, etc.
I was close to Newton during my younger days while I was studying at Bandaranayake Central College at Gampaha. He was a popular student at that time and was residing at Gampaha itself, but I was a boarder at late Dr. Kapurubandar's house. He was a brilliant and enthusiastic character during his school days If he found a problem faced by a friend, neighbour or relative, he was able to write a very interesting short story on the above issue in a very favourable manner.
After he graduated from the Colombo University (B.A. Ceylon), he was able to produce a large number of novels for the sake of the Sinhalese readers in Sri Lanka. He also supplied stories to Sinhala weekend newspapers as well. After he graduated from the university, his maiden appointment was to the Ceylon Tourist Board in the capacity of information and administrative assistant. I was fortunate to associate with Newton Gunasekara again at the Ceylon Tourist Board, when I served as its officer-in-charge of the Samudra Art Gallery.
Newton Gunasekara suggested the then chairman of Ceylon Tourist Board, late Dharmasiri Senanayake, to print and publish a family magazine for the Ceylon Tourist Board, and proposed its name as Sancharika. I contributed regular articles to Sancharika as Newton was keen to publish it on a monthly basis, and distributed the magazine in all Sri Lankan tourist resorts and hotels. He left the Tourist Board and joined his second employment under Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation as its news editor. Then he handed over the printing and publishing of Sancharika to me.
After two years, he received a transfer to the Rajarata Service of the Broadcasting Corporation on the promotion as its Controller. He helped hundreds of creative radio artists in Rajarata to come froward, produced radio programmes, and also wrote some novels on the influence of the Rajarata environment.
All of Newton Gunasekara's novels were published by the Dayawansa Jayakody Publishers Company, Limited at Maradana. I feel truly blessed to have been able to associate with him for more than 50 yeas of my life. I hope to always remember and follow the principles of life you taught me.
May you will attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Pillar of strength
Appachi, it has been only three months, but it seems like a lifetime since you passed away. Words can never express how much I miss you. Everything I see around me reminds me of you, bringing me to tears. The times we held hands was a journey and story that I hold so precious in my heart, with loads of love and gratitude to you.
Amma could not have asked for a better husband, and the two of us were blessed with the most precious father. We take joy and pride in looking back as you lived a life to the fullest and gave us nothing but the best. You gave us hope, strength, and grace to make our world a better and brighter place. You were by our side to help and support us, to celebrate, to understand our problems, and accept our defeats.
You taught me the value of hard work, good judgment, courage, and integrity and said until the end, take it with a pinch of salt. Appachi, you were like no other. Your unconditional love was a blessing to my life. You went even further and spoilt your grandchildren to your best and never missed a single responsibility towards them. And best of all, they have your wit to carry on in life's journey.
I could go on and on, Appachi; you were just wonderful in a million different ways. For that we are forever grateful. I will always hold your precious memories in my heart; that special smile, that caring heart, and for being there for me, rain or shine. Your love will forever dwell in my heart, and it has been a blessing that I count every day in my life. Thanks for being the pillar of strength in my life.
Appachi, you are deeply missed, but your legacy will live on.... Goodbye, Appachi, until we meet again in this sansara journey. Love you to the moon and back, stars and back, space and back.

D. H. Jayaindra Fernando
Man of many talents
A remembrance of my grandfather, D. H. Jayaindra Fernando, cannot be written without the mention of his greatest love; building and construction. The oldest son of Jason Fernando, he hailed from a family dedicated to the construction industry in Sri Lanka. He was the driving force behind many constructions projects in Sri Lanka, such as the original Savoy cinema and Mount Lavinia Hotel, however his greatest achievement was truly a monument of love.
He spent many months travelling to Kandy, to supervise the building of the Kandy Market which was inaugurated on the September 23, 1959, under the auspices of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The constant visit to Kandy to the building site of the Kandy Market was also fueled by the presence of Devika Perera, an undergraduate at the Peradeniya University at the timemy grandfathers greatest inspiration. They subsequently got married in January 1960 and were the proud parents of Deepa Wijetunge (nee Fernando) and Sajit Fernando.
Jayaindra was a man of many talents; he was an artist, with the ability to design jewelry and produce beautiful drawings of trees endemic to Sri Lanka. He was also a very talented cook; I still recall vivid memories of how we would all gather in his kitchen every Friday after school, to assist him with his latest Chinese culinary dishes, however this task did not include cleaning up thereafter, a task which always fell to my grandmother. A great lover of good food, he would always take the whole family to any new restaurant that opened in Colombo, attempting to improve and recreate the dish subsequently.
He was always generous with his family and friends equally, lending a helping hand in any crisis, with any form of help needed. He was a dutiful son to his parents, as well as a pillar of strength of all his siblings.
My grandfather was a pious Buddhist, and I am always proud of see tables donated by him and built by Rovim Concrete Works Ltd. (where he was the chairman) at various temples throughout Sri Lanka. He was true follower of the Dhamma.
Seeya, I feel truly blessed to have been able to spend 29 years of my life with you, and I hope I will always remember and follow the principles of life you taught me. I feel privileged to have learnt our family history from you, and will always cherish the many chats we had over all those years.
I miss you every day!
Until we meet again in Sansara.
To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.

The Blessed Visit
Sakyamuni Sri Siddhartha Gautama, at the height of his struggle for Enlightenment, developed the superhuman powers of divine vision which he diverted a countless number of times on the lives of countless beings in their journey through Sansara. He came to their aid and relieved them of their suffering.
This was said to be his daily routine. Sri Lanka is privileged to have been attracted by his attention several times which means that so-called Darmadweepa was blessed by the living Buddha the most sacred event for we Sri Lankans in human history. Not once by thrice on various occasions. The greatest blessing to the island was the Buddhas first visit to Mahiyangana in the ninth month after the enlightenment.
The Buddha advised his numerous disciples to spread the doctrine and the message of Dhamma to all mankind in the world. Having sent them on this great mission. The Buddha is said to have focussed his attention on Sri Lanka. Ancient chronicles reveal that the Buddha arrived at Mahanagavana a splendid park in Mahiyangana located in the vicinity of Mahaweliganga. The island at the time of the Buddhas visit is said to have been inhabited by Yakkas and Nagas referred to as Amanussa. Here the reference may be to the primitive state of civilisation in the island. Here the Yakka and Naga with their rough behaviour opposed the arrival of the Buddha. However the sudden appearance of the Great Master in yellow robes radiating the glow (BuduRas) the yakkas had thrown away their weapons as they had the good luck to be familiar with the teachings of the Buddha. They had then become good citizens. The Buddha with his miraculous powers had them driven away to Giri Deepa on Duruthu Full Moon Day.
The most significant event at this juncture was the presence of the Deva Maha Sumana the guardian God of Samanala Kanda. According to Mahavamsa, the earliest Buddhist relic was the hair relic of the Buddha which had been offered to Deva Mahasumana when he begged Thathagatha to give something to worship on his first visit to the island. Accordingly, he gave him a handful of hair from his head which Mahasumana placed in a golden casket, later enshrined in a stupa embedded with blue stones, built to the height of seven riyanas (a measure) which was later constructed to the height of 80 riyanas by the royalty at different times. This is the MahiyanganaChetiya the first dagaba in Sri Lanka built by a divine being on the spot where Sakyamuni made his first visit to the island.

Acquisition of private property to enlarge Sinharaja forest
On August 2, 2011, the Divisional Secretariat of Kalawana issued a notice to nine owners of a private property, (planted with cardamom) at Ilembakanda to acquire it, for the purpose of enlarging the Sinharaja forest.
Later, on July 15, 2013, the Environment Ministry summoned the owners for all inquiry, vide 4th enactment of the Land Acquisition Act. At the inquiry all the owners made written statements against the acquisition.
They appealed to the then President to cancel the acquisition. But that appeal was stuffed to the bin.
When the present government assumed power, another appeal was submitted to the incumbent President. On May 25, 2016, five years after the first notice regarding acquisition, the owners were informed that the acquisition is finalised and compensation will be given.
The period taken for the acquisition is more than five years. This is ample evidence that, the purpose is not urgent and really necessary. However, this is the plight, and the misfortune of nine owners and about 40 dependents (children) who are law-abiding citizens of our motherland.

## Title: Cultivate Upekkha to remain serene
## Supertitle:

Cultivate Upekkha to remain serene
Upekkha or equanimity is one of the mostsignificant and helpful mental factors to be practiced in our daily lives. It serves as an excellent strategy that helps us stay serene and unruffled as we manoeuvre the ups and downs of our lives.
It is little wonder why the Buddha accorded equanimity a prominent place in his teachings by designating it as one of the four meditative states, or Brahma Vihara. The other three states of Brahma Vihara are metta (loving kindness), karuna (compassion) and muditha (appreciative joy). Each of these factors play an important role to play in keeping our minds well-balanced, healthy and buoyant.
If we seek a definition, we might say: Equanimity is the quality of being calm, even tempered and composed, even in the midst of stress, tension and provocation.
Approaches
In this essay, we shall examine the role of equanimity in maintaining our mental wellbeing and happiness.
Life is constantly throwing new challenges to us. To deal with them, we could take one of three approaches. (1) We could stand your ground, like a rocky crag in the ocean, resisting and striving to fight against the barrage. However, ultimately, our resistance will be futile. The ocean of life is stronger than us, and it will break us down. (2) We could try floating on the surface, like a cork, just going with the flow. Although this approach seems safe, as a piece of flotsam we risk being dashed against the rocks or thrown upon the shore. (3) The third approach is the middle way, a buoy that is attached to the ocean flow, allowed to rise and fall with the waves, but not to get thrown around. The buoy exhibits a kind of equanimity, a paced resilience that allows it to survive in any kind of weather.
Imagine how nice it would be if we can always be calm and cool, unfazed and unruffled by all the ups and downs of life! We know that such is life and this, too, will pass and we maintain our inner calm and peace.
The mental quality to develop for the attainment of an unshakable mind is equanimity. The Buddha who, himself, possessed a mind that cannot be shaken by the vicissitudes of life, stressed that intention and resolution are important supportive factors in the development of any wholesome mental quality.
Mindful meditation
As ordinary humans, we all have shortcuts for handling the onslaught of events and information in our lives. Emotion is one such shortcut that serves as real, useful strategies, but which, like some drugs, we come to rely on too heavily.
The primary shortcoming of emotions is that they take the conscious mind out of the decision- making loop, and its not uncommon for the resulting behaviour to be completely out of line with our goals.
To focus on your mind as you function in everyday life, you need to turn your mind inside out. Indeed, your mind must be strong and focused in order to be mindful of itself. So, naturally it is difficult to focus on your mind if you are agitated or distracted.
Here are ways to develop equanimity:
1. Balanced emotion toward all living things
The first and foremost is to have an Equanimeous attitude toward all living beings. These are your loved ones, including animals. We have a lot of attachment and desire associated with people we love, and also with our pets. This experience does not contribute to equanimity, which is a state of balance.
To prepare the ground for equanimity to arise, we should try to cultivate an attitude of Non-attachment and equanimity toward the people and animals we love. As worldly people, it may be necessary to have a certain amount of attachment in relationships, but excessive attachment is destructive to us as well as to loved ones. We begin to worry too much over their welfare. We should try to put aside such excessive concern and worry for the welfare of our friends.
One reflection that can develop nonattachment is to regard all beings as the heirs of their own karma. People reap the rewards of good karma and suffer the consequences of unwholesome acts. They created this karma under their own volition, and no one can prevent their experiencing the consequences. On the ultimate level, there is nothing we or anybody else can do to save them. If we think in this way, we may worry less about our loved ones.
We can also gain equanimity about beings by reflecting on ultimate reality. Perhaps we can tell ourselves that, ultimately speaking, there is only mind and matter. Where is that person you are so wildly in love with There is only nama and rupa, mind and body, arising and passing away from moment to moment. Which moment are you in love with You may be able to drive some sense into your heart this way.
2. Balanced emotion toward inanimate things
The second way is to adopt an attitude of balance toward inanimate things: property, clothing, the latest fad on the market. Clothing, for example, will be ripped and stained someday. It will decay and perish because it is impermanent, like everything else. Furthermore, we do not even own it, not in the ultimate sense. Everything is non-self; there is no one to own anything. To develop balance and to cut down attachment, it is helpful to look at material things as transient. You might say to yourself, Im going to make use of this for a short time. Its not going to last forever.
3. Avoiding people who have possessiveness
The third method is avoiding the company of people have a deep possessiveness. They cling to what they think belongs to them, both people and things. Some people find it difficult to see another person enjoying or using their property.
4. Choosing right friends
As a fourth method of arousing upekkha, you should choose friends who have no great attachment to beings or possessions. This method of developing equanimity is simply the converse of the preceding one.
5. Inclining the mind toward balance
The fifth is to arise is constantly to incline your mind toward the cultivation of equanimity. When your mind is inclined in this way, it will not wander off to thoughts of your dogs and cats at home, or of your loved ones. It will only become more balanced and harmonious.
Equanimity is of tremendous importance both in the practice and in everyday life. Generally, we get either swept away by pleasant and enticing objects, or worked up into a great state of agitation when confronted by unpleasant, undesirable objects.

Defaced notes accepted upto March 31, 2018
The deadline for exchanging willfully defaced or altered currency notes with banks has been further extended by three months till March 31, 2018, following instructions given by President Maithripala Sirisena to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Earlier, the Central Bank had decided that payments should not be made in respect of willfully defaced or altered currency notes after December 31, 2017.
After that date all willfully defaced and altered currency notes will be held by the Central Bank and they would not be exchanged by any commercial banks.
This decision was taken because the government had to incur a heavy cost outlay in printing new currency notes.
According to the Monetary Act No. 58 of 1949, legal action cold be taken against persons responsible for willfully defacing or altering currency notes and punishment meted out to them.

Defence arms to be deployed in massive development effort next year
massive nation-building development effort is to be undertaken next year with the deployment of one third of the Sri Lanka army cadre and the support of other security arms including the Civil Defence Dorce while giving top priority to national security.
Under the programme, the Army will renovate 500 tanks in Trincomalee, 150 tanks in Polonnaruwa and build and renovate other tanks in the dry zone to help fill the national larder.
Several other development projects would be undertaken in Aaralaganwila assisted by retired army personnel.
The Defence Ministry, Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry, Civil Defence Department and several other government departments contribute to the programme and also launch a programme to combat kidney disease programme initiated by the Navy. It would be extended to the Northern and Eastern Provinces and maritime security services for commercial navigation would be enhanced to derive additional income to the national coffers.
Steps have been taken to save expenditure on obtaining foreign expertise and labour by using army labour and know-how for a number of development projects undertaken this year.
The Sri Lanka Air Force, which makes a special contribution towards safeguarding forest reserves, would join hands with the Navy to protect Sri Lankas maritime zone.

Experiment beyond death
As humans, curiosity is a part of our being. Throughout our lives, every one of us will find an urge to know what cannot be known, to discover what others have not yet found, and to realise the most impossible things before anyone else One of the questions that we will often find at the back of our minds, without a solution, is What happens after death
Todays world, as with all other seemingly unresolvable problems, has come up with various theories to this question. Many believe that there is a next life and that there is a soul that passes on from this life to another, either to heaven or hell.
And some believe that there is no life after death and that after death you simply cease to exist. Buddhism, however, has a completely different outlook on beings after death. As Buddhists we believe that there is an endless journey of birth and death known as Sansara.
We leave one life, and move on to the next depending on our Kamma- meaning the merits and demerits collected from either doing wholesome or unwholesome deeds.
The suttas in What happens after death clearly specify wise reasons as to why beings are born as they are and what happens as a result of previous acts. Let us take the very first sutta as an example- Balapanditasutta (The fool and the wise). In this sutta, we see how to characterise a fool and a wise person.
We see the severe consequences that a fool who has committed unwholesome deeds will suffer in hell, as well as the suffering he would face if he/she was born in the animal world, and how rare it would be for them to return to the human world.The book, What happens after death which is based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, provides much needed insight to a question that has befuddled us for many years, With the help of the Dhamma, may you all be able to realise the Four Noble Truths, and may this book- translated by Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera- help us right our wrongs and lead a virtuous life that brings happiness in this life and the life-after.

New Year Message
Geared to further restore economic stability - PM
The year 2018 dawns on us as we recall the victory won in restoring political and social values, in realising a dream long cherished by the people of this country.
It reminds us that we still have a task ahead - that of consolidating the true meaning of that victory.
When we established the Government of Good Governance, the country was facing a time of social, economic and political decline.
Amidst great challenges, we were able to steer forward in restoring economic stability and a process of sustainable development.
We have been successful in presenting Sri Lanka to the world as a country that respects and recognises human dignity, one in which all have access to social and political freedom. A country that abides by the principles of good governance. In the process, we have been able to generate a greater sense of goodwill among the international community towards Sri Lanka.
We take this opportunity to thank everyone who accompanied us on the journey of emerging as a country with the highest regard for the principles of democracy and ethics.It is my most sincere hope that you would continue to be with us as we go forward.
May 2018 be a year of hope and courage for all,Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his New Year message.

For a new look New Year
Yet another year has dawned and all Sri Lankans, no doubt, will enter 2018 with much expectations for an improved performance, all round, by the rulers and a better quality in their lives. There are also the imponderables in the months ahead of the new year. These may be personal or collective, the latter, no doubt, influenced by factors on the political stage. The beginning of 2018 will be marked by an election to the countrys local government bodies, the first poll to be held under the Yahapalanaya government, which, no doubt, has generated much public interest. The cohesion between the countrys arch political rivals, getting together for the first time to form a Unity Government, no doubt, will be ruptured to some degree with the parties going their separate ways to contest the elections. How long this rivalry will continue after the election is anyones guess. Will there be a parting of ways or will the Unity Government continue with the marriage or deege, as they say, will be watched with much interest by the public.
The election will also be watched with eager anticipation for another reason - the emergence, as a force, by a significant segment of the SLFP led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, into the fray. Hence, the country will be witness to a humdrum on the political stage at the very outset of the new year. The results of the LG poll, no doubt, will provide a clear indicator as to which way the winds are blowing and shape the political mindset of the public.
Politics apart, the people, certainly, will be expecting some relief from the rulers on the cost of living front, in the new year. Of course, there were factors that were beyond the control of the government, leading to the high cost of living such as the vagaries of the elements. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has moved in to cushion the CoL burden on the public in a positive way by co-opting the private sector to play a hand. The supermarkets which are patronized, even by the ordinary folk, are now offering essential items at much reduced prices to the great relief of the public. However much needs to be done for the overall picture to change and the new year, it is hoped, will usher in this change, as will be the wish of the vast majority.
They will also wish for the government to deliver on its unfulfilled promises made, at both, the Presidential and General elections, in this new year. Of course the public servants received a bonanza of a Rs. 10,000 salary hike as promised by the government, though at great cost to the exchequer. There was also the reduction of fuel prices and the cost of all essential drugs. Most of all a climate of peace prevails in the country with the fear psychosis which was marked under the previous regime a thing of the past. Democracy has been restored to its optimum and the media unshackled, which is event by the frontal attacks launched against the government by certain private media. The judiciary has been freed and the Attorney Generals Department no longer an adjunct of the government, as was demonstrated in the intense grilling of powerful government politicians at the Bond Commission.
Still though, there is much disillusionment and disenchantment among the vast majority of the public at the slow pace in which investigations are being carried out against corrupt politicians, which was a major slogan of Yahapalanaya at the elections which they (public) hope will see a change in course within the new year. The President has already read the riot act and has vowed to cleanse public life of all manner of corruption, which augurs well for the new year.
There is also the economic front which needs the urgent attention of the administration amidst the mounting challenges. There indeed was a setback, entering into the new year, when Russia decided to ban tea imports from Sri Lanka. But the timely intervention by the President mercifully prevented what would have been an economic catastrophe. The new year, hopefully, would see the settlement of the imbroglio surrounding the loss making national carrier and the infusion of fresh capital to bail out this failed venture that has been a heavy burden on the Treasury. Hopefully the many projects that are already lined up for take off will be seeing the completion in the new year. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has already stated that the Port City will be completed within this year which will open the doors to a large influx of foreign investors injecting new life into the economy.
Be that as it may, 2018, it is hoped, will end the spate of strikes, agitations and street protests which was a regular feature last year, causing much hardship to the general public. It is the wish of all right thinking people that saner counsel prevails and all stakeholders come to an understanding, in a spirit of give and take, to resolve their issues, for the sake of the public.

New Zealand wary of Gayle revival as series sweep beckons
WELLINGTON: New Zealand were Sunday wary of Chris Gayle coming into form in the second Twenty20 as they eyed a series sweep against the West Indies.
The home side have already tucked away victories in the two Tests, three one-dayers and the first of three Twenty20 matches.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said it would be great to pull off a series sweep in the Twenty20 in Mount Maunganui on Monday, but the Gayle factor was lurking in the background.
The West Indies talisman was in devastating form in early December when he smashed a record 18 sixes in an unbeaten innings of 146 off 69 balls in the Bangladesh league.
But he has failed to fire so far in New Zealand, with scores of 22 and four in the two ODIs he played and 12 in the first Twenty20.
He's a fantastic player, probably the best T20 record in the game and can take the game away at any time, Williamson said on his return to the New Zealand squad after sitting out the last three games.
If he gets away on you in 10 overs or so he can change a game and that's what it's about.
We know in this format the West Indies T20 side are one of the best sides in the world and we know that at any time they can turn it on. Williamson said New Zealand could only focus on building on their performances, with an unbeaten run in six games so far against the West Indies.
In the first Twenty20 they unearthed two new stars in rookies Glenn Phillips and Seth Rance.
Phillips, in only his fourth international, scored a half-century with the bat and pulled off two stunning catches behind the stumps, including have to turn and run nearly 30 metres to dismiss Gayle off debutant Rance.
Seamer Rance removed Chadwick Walton with his next delivery and finished with the impressive figures of three for 30 from his four overs as New Zealand cruised to a 47-run victory. AFP

Rs. 2,500 million was released on December 29 to enable the farmers to purchase their much needed fertiliser for this season, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President said that following information that the farmer community had not received money into their bank accounts to purchase fertiliser this season he made inquiries about it from the Finance Ministry and issued directives to release the money to the relevant bank accounts of farmers on December 29 itself. The President disclosed this when he addressed a Jana Hamuwa at Bendiwewa in Polonnaruwa on December 30.
The President, who stressed the importance of the views and suggestions of public servants as well as peoples representatives in promoting rural development by resolving the problem of rural folk, said funds needed were adequately available but what was needed was a group of peoples representatives dedicated towards the development of the rural sector.
This problem would be overcome with the local council elections to be held on February 10, the President said adding that along with it, the programme aimed to provide development dividends to rural folk by resolving their problems would be implemented concurrently with the extensive development programme countrywide.

SA series is not just about my duel with de Villiers - Kohli
CAPE TOWN: He has the highest regards for his Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate and Indian skipper Virat Kohli simply does not understand why every Indo-South Africa series to be billed as a battle between him and AB de Villiers.
It's not like only two guys are playing in this series. AB is a great friend of mine. I respect the way he plays the game and I have always respected him as a person as well. But, when we are playing against each other - it's not that we cross the line with each other, we are just not like that, Kohli said when asked about his duel with the premier Proteas batsman.
Kohli also reminded that merely getting De Villiers out won't ensure a Test match victory for India.
It's just that we want to get AB out and the opposition will want to get me out or Pujara or Rahane. The mindset I don't think there is any different in terms of the mindset in any of the batsmen in the side.
Every player wants to be the stand out batsman and make contributions towards the team winning. Unless you have that as a group, you don't have too many chances of winning a series. Some people may have brilliant individual performances and then you will be fine with one or two people doing well, Kohli said.
The Indian skipper said that his team is hungry to do well against a quality opposition.
Right now, the hunger we have in the group, everyone wants an opportunity to perform and that's very exciting. I can't speak for the opposition because AB hasn't played much Test cricket since he played against us and he's coming back after a while.
But, look, setting apart all the spice created on the outside, the team that plays well together for a longer period of time has a better chance of winning the series, he said.

Salah fires Liverpool to victory, Chelsea close gap at top
LONDON, Saturday - Mohamed Salah took his goal tally to 23 in all competitions with a second-half double to help Liverpool come from behind to beat Leicester City 2-1 at Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday.
Chelsea had no such struggles at home to Stoke City, with Mark Hughes men thrashed 5-0 at Stamford Bridge, as the leagues most porous defence couldnt cope with their rampant hosts.
Chelsea climbed to second, above Manchester United, after Jose Mourinhos men were held to their third successive draw following a 0-0 stalemate against Southampton at Old Trafford in Saturdays late kickoff.
Romelu Lukaku was carried off on a stretcher in the first half and United looked toothless in attack in the Belgium internationals absence, mustering just three shots on target.
A win for neighbours Manchester City at Crystal Palace on Sunday will see Pep Guardiolas men move 16 points clear at the top of the standings and 17 ahead of United.
One of the performances of the day came at Vicarage Road where Swansea City netted two late goals to come from behind to beat Watford and climb off the bottom of the table, as Carlos Carvalhals tenure got off to a winning start.
However, the spotlight once again was on Liverpool striker Salah, who continues to look unstoppable in front of goal.
Jamie Vardy once again scored against a big six side after being picked out by Riyad Mahrez in the first half at Anfield, and Leicester held on until Salah took centre stage.
Two neat second-half finishes took the Egypt international to 17 for the season, one behind Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane, with the goals sealing the victory that sees Liverpool move to 12 unbeaten in the league  their best run under Juergen Klopp  and opens up a four-point gap over Spurs in fifth.
He (Salah) can keep this standard for sure, hes young, improving - its not only about scoring goals, Klopp said.
Hes so important for us. He knows and I know he couldnt score so many without the fantastic support from the other boys.
I think he can keep the standard.
Four points ahead of Liverpool, Chelsea were out of sight after 23 minutes against Stoke with goals from Antonio Rudiger, Danny Drinkwater and Pedro putting the champions in command.
Willians second-half penalty and a Davide Zappacosta goal put the seal on a fourth win in five league games for Antonio Contes men.
We know we must continue to work and improve, and prepare for a very difficult game against Arsenal, said Conte, whose second-placed side are now 13 points behind Manchester City.
Every win is important for us, today it was important to get three points to continue our positive run.
There was plenty of movement down at the bottom of the table, with Swansea no longer propping up the division after goals from Jordan Ayew and Luciano Narsingh in the final four minutes of the match cancelled out Andre Carrillos opener for Watford to seal a first win for Carvalhal.
Bournemouth were also big movers, as two goals from Ryan Fraser ensured Eddie Howes men climbed out of the bottom three and up to 13th after a 2-1 victory over Everton, with Sam Allardyce tasting defeat for the first time as Everton manager.
Newcastle missed their chance to climb clear of the relegation zone after being held to a 0-0 draw by Brighton at St James Park, while Huddersfield and Burnley also played out a stalemate at the John Smiths Stadium. - Agencies

Spiritual privilege of diplomatic relations
The modern calendar ranks Duruthu as the first poya of the year. Sinhalese year dawns with Bak followed by the leading Poya, Vesakha. Buddhisms steady growth kept track on its followers observing Sil on any full moon day staying away from worldly commitments long before Gregorian standards stepped in.
Duruthus prestige hence rests not on the calendar, but on the Buddhas first visit to Sri Lanka. It ushered in the Buddhist diplomacy between two countries established by Arahant Mahinda at a later date. The Buddhas journey to Sri Lanka is not scripted in the Pali Canons, probably for its historical esteem rather than philosophical element.
Mahawamsa reworks the Buddhas three visits to Sri Lanka between 563 BCE and 483 within the very first chapter.
The legend has the Buddha mellowing out at Anotatta lake, one of the seven great lakes of Himava, when he noticed a conflict in the neighbour country.
Mahawamsas hotly-debated narrative is reproduced to kindle interest:
To this great gathering of that Yakkhas went the Blessed One, and there, in the midst of that assembly, hovering in the air over their heads, at the place of the (future) Mahiyangana-thupa, he struck terror to their hearts by rain, storm, darkness and so forth.
The Yakkhas, overwhelmed by fear, besought the fearless Vanquisher to release them from terrors, and the Vanquisher, destroyer of fear, spoke thus to the terrified Yakkhas: I will banish this your fear and your distress, O Yakkhas, give ye here to me with one accord a place where I may sit down.
The Yakkhas thus answered the Blessed One: We all, O Lord, give you even the whole of our island. Give us release from our fear. This key event has been traced in many ways. We can well gather that the Buddha must have looked like an invader to the islanders especially at a moment of crisis.
On the other hand many Sutta sources report instances people being traumatised by nature for not heeding the Buddhas advice. Anybody who does not heed a holy mans good-willed advice will be naturally burdened and this must have been the chronicles definition.
The description does not figure out the Buddha to have caused terrors on the islanders; it was naturally caused. Some sources let on that the Buddha used Yama Maha Perahara the miracle he performed earlier to convince his relatives of his enlightenment. Definitely it must have been amazing for the islanders to see a foreigner with fire and water at the same time. Which must have watered the fiery hearts. God Sumana Samans episode stirs up a multi-positioned controversy. As some sources let on Saman is one of the deities who listened to the Buddha on his first visit. Whereas some sources observe Saman as a prince who became a god in the following birth. Both these accounts, however, have no disagreement with the fundamental Buddhism.
The Buddha acknowledged the existence of celestial beings such as gods and Brahmas, born upon developed virtues. The celestial realm is not the goal in Buddhism; it is in fact far behind the Nibbana.
Celestial realms, like human worlds, are impermanent and unstable, equipped with birth, existence and death. Prince Saman must have been sotapanna - stream-winner, the first stage of Buddhist sainthood - hence chances are more for him to be a god the following existence. Importantly Sumana Saman is not identified as a Hindu god.
Prince Saman requested the Buddha for reverence object. The Buddha gave him a lock of hair from his head and it was enshrined in the Mahiyangana stupa, the first Dagoba constructed in the island during the lifetime of Buddha.
Prince Saman had received the sacred lock of hair in a golden pot and he put the sacred object on a heap of multi-coloured gems, seven cubits round, stacked up at the Buddhas seat and covered them over with a shrine of sapphire.
The existence of Arahants as well as their link with Sri Lanka was evident even following the Buddhas demise. Arahant Sarabhu, the student of Arahant Sariputta, got hold of the Buddhas collarbone and brought it down to Sri Lanka to lay it in the same shrine. Covering with gold-plated stones, the Arahant had made it 12 cubits high before leaving the isle. King Dutugemunu was to make the shrine 80 cubits high later on.

Struggle today, strength tomorrow
Maha Nayaka and Religious Leader of the Agonshu Temple sect in Japan Most Ven. Fukada Seia Thera said that the Buddhas teachings pave the way to create a disciplined society.
Most Ven. Seia Thera expressed these sentiments while delivering the keynote address at the silver jubilee scholarship awards ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation held at the BMICH recently.
The Thera, while addressing the scholars, said that Sri Lankans are blessed with noble Buddhism, inculcated high values to produce a valuable person to the society. Therefore, Sri Lankan Buddhists are duty-bound to follow the Buddhas doctrine while propagating the core values of Buddhism to the world. Speaking on the scholarship programme, the Thera said that more poverty-stricken students of the country will be assisted for their studies in future by the Agonshu Temple, Japan, through the Sri Lanka AgonshuFriendship Foundation (SLAFF).
The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Award Ceremony of the SLAFF was held under the patronage of Mahopadyaya Maha Nayaka Thera of the Sri Rohana Chapter of Siyam Nikaya Most Venerable Udumalagala Sri Mahinda Nayaka Thera and a delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.
The Agonshu sect was founded in 1978 by Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera, who was born on January 5, 1921. After becoming a Mahayana monk, Most Ven. Seiyu Kiriyama Thera engaged in extensive research on the Buddhas teachings. He travelled to a number of countries to pass on the message of Buddhas teachings.
He combined the traditions of Theravada, Mahayana and Tibet Buddhism and founded the Agonshu sect. Within a short span of time, the Agonshu sect became a traditional instrument propagating Buddhist teachings across the globe. Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera became an iconic figure among the Buddhists who took up the Agonshu tradition, Most Ven. Seia Thera said.
The SLAFF has a number of noble objectives. Foremost among them is to offer a helping hand to Sinhala Buddhist students with financial difficulties. Renovating Buddhist places in remote areas, equipping the youths with vocational education, providing medicines and dry rations to needy patients and improving the infrastructure of temples and Buddhist libraries are the other core activities of the Foundation, the Thera added.The scholarship programme, which marked 25 years, has produced many valuable persons to the society such as doctors, engineers, university lecturers and other scholars. The scholarship, which includes three sets of uniforms, shoes, socks, and exercise books together with a Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary. The scholars receive the scholarship until the holder passes Advanced Level Examination. Medical College Undergraduates continue to receive a voucher. The programme is coordinated by the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation under the supervision of its Director General Somasiri Addarapthirana.
Addressing the gathering SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapthirana said that the foundation is reaping the harvest of the scholarship programme.
The Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation was established under the guidance of Most Ven. Seiyu Kiriyama Thera on January 12, 1994.
It can be considered as a landmark in the history of age-old Japan  Sri Lanka friendship. Under the first phase of the scholarship programme, 50 students with economic hardships selected from various parts of the country were awarded scholarships. When the programme marked the 25th year, more than 15,000 scholarships have been awarded, Addarapthirana said.
Up to this Silver Jubilee Scholarship Award Ceremony, 13,650 educational scholarships have been awarded.
Thirty-four Medical students have also been awarded scholarships. Besides, 1292 youths have been given vocational training enabling them to be self-employed. It is significant that Grade 5 Scholarship candidates, who fall short of a few marks, are awarded scholarships by the foundation.

## Title: Tea vs. Asbestos

Tea vs. Asbestos
If proof was ever needed, the Asbestos for Tea trade- off with Russia has shown us the humbleness of our situation in the most humiliating manner.
Tea was introduced to this country by the British, not because they perceived it as the mainstay of an export oriented economy of an independent Ceylon (as we were known then). For the policymakers of imperial Whitehall it was imperative that their far-flung colonies should not be a charge on the British Exchequer; instead, they should be self-supporting and if possible, an economic asset to the Crown. Our economy at the time was based primarily on subsistence agriculture, save for the trading in cinnamon and other spices along the coastal belt. For colonies with large acreages of unutilized land, plantations were a natural development, a method successfully tried out already in the Caribbean and other colonies, mainly with sugarcane.
The credit for the development of commercial scale plantations and the concomitant infra-structure go to the British, the consummate empire builders, turning the island of spicy fragrance into Liptons Tea Garden; newly introduced plants; tea, coffee, and rubber becoming dominant. The escalating demands of the plantations not only brought about deep going socio-economic changes, including educational facilities, but also resulted in the large scale import of Indian labour to an economically weak country with an abundant human resource availability. Sure, there were reasons for importing labour to a country which already had adequate labour, but they were the reasons of an imperial power looking at its immediate interest, and not that of the indigenous people.
Foreign exchange earnings
After independence, we continued with the model, content by and large with the economy that the three commodities; tea, rubber and coconut provided. Evolving scenarios periodically compelled us to consider other activities like tourism, garments and the export of labour to the Middle-East; but the fundamental dependency on the three commodities, continues. In terms of foreign exchange earnings, employment provided and livelihood dependency, their importance even today is crucial.
While other countries moved from commodity production to significant value adding; from manufacturing to providing of services; we continued in a comfort zone, large scale transformations more talked about than implemented. The limitations of the national psyche, both in ideas and imagination, are such that even the social habits of the planter Raj were copied by their brown skinned successors; only now in the place of the Queen, they toast the Minister in charge. In spirit and attitude, the mimics are obviously not the pioneering types, braving strange cultures and climes. But it is only a parody, in everything else, the quality has dropped; it is said that many of todays Planters demand commissions and kickbacks from the various suppliers to the estate. Like in all other business activities now, what the estate buys, depends on the consideration paid to the Planter; a corruption that runs through the process, right up to the delivery of the tea to the foreign buyer. In such a tainted system it really should be no surprise that the end user, the tea drinker, discovers bugs floating in his morning tea!
In the early days, most of our tea went to England and other European countries. Now our biggest buyers are from the Middle-East and Eastern Europe, including Russia. Whoever we sell it to; it is not acceptable to have insects in the tea. Todays markets, particularly in the developed countries, are extremely quality conscious, imposing stringent checks to ensure the cleanliness of the food released to their consumers. For an established supplier like Sri Lanka to have beetles in the tea is surely unacceptable. An immediate investigation and corrective measures are called for here.
Asbestos or the ban thereof by Sri Lanka, on the other hand, is a story of a relatively weak nation endeavourng to protect its citizens from the ill-effects of a product widely considered injurious and even responsible for terminal diseases. Not being experts in the field, we cannot speak for the validity of the complex arguments brought out by the manufactures to allay our fears on this matter.
Export market
Apparently Russia is a major manufacturer of asbestos in the world. However, no one can deny the right of any country to take steps, in its opinion appropriate, to protect its citizens from a generally recognized hazard. In the case of tea, with a few relatively easy steps, its wholesomeness can be restored. But in the case of Asbestos the effects are said to be terminal and irreversible.
This is perhaps what is meant by the German word Real politik, politics which are coercive, amoral: you buy our asbestos or we will not buy your tea! A weak and poor nation anxious to sell its tea, has no option but succumb, it seems.
Seventy years of our own governments have brought us to a state of pathetic weakness. It is not only in tea that we are vulnerable. Recently a rabid dog attacked a young tourist from a European country. The victim died a few days later. Fearing cancellations of hotel bookings, the entire tourist industry braced for a crisis. Because of the plentiful availability of cheap labour, we were one of the early countries in the South Asian region to get into large scale garment manufacturing (in mid 1970s). Today many new entrants to garments have by-passed us. In order to find an export market we canvassed strenuously to have restored concessionary entry terms to the European market, a concession reserved for the least developed countries in the world. When an Arab country suggests a change of policy with regard to its foreign labour, thousands of Sri Lankan families shudder with fear for the loss of a livelihood.
We export in order to earn precious foreign currency. This hard earned foreign currency is well used. Get on to any Sri Lankan road and you will see some of the most modern and expensive vehicles in the world on them; very many of these swanky vehicles are owned by either the government or public companies; in other words, paid for, with other peoples money. If it is a politician travelling, it will not be just one but a convoy of powerful vehicles whizzing past. In recent times our governments have invested in harbours with no ships, airports with no planes and huge theatres without any performers. In faraway places in the country there are whole cities built for sports and cinema, fields where we have shown only moderate proficiency, waiting for Godot! We also have a national airline that would serve the nation better if it stops flying. Inept actions of our politicians have only diminished vital institutions. Our banking system, overrun with cronyism, conflict of interest situations and influence peddling, has no real credibility.
Russia is the land of towering figures like Lenin, Tolstoy and Solzhenitsyn; men who needed no lessons on social justice. It was said of Lenin that he kept accounts for the working class of the unholy doings of the undesirables. Although much water has flown down the Volga since the heady days of the revolution, Russia has remained a friend to our poor and backward country. Even a pauper can have dignity. But when a nations business methods are questionable and its leadership perceived to be in the grip of scoundrels, that nation has no credit in international eyes. So even the present day Russia of Putin, no paragon of virtue, will turn away with disdain, telling us to buy their asbestos, or else!
Whichever way we turn there is no redemption in sight, a nation in a gulag archipelago (Sri Lanka version!) with no conceivable escape.
That is how far down we have fallen.

Two suspects in Galle abduction case arrested
The main suspect in the abduction of an entrepreneur at Pilana, Habaraduwa, Galle together with another accomplice was arrested by Galle Police. They had taken a Rs. 5 million ransom to release the businessman.
The suspect is an ex-commando combatant, a resident of Habaraduwa, attached to the tourism field in its construction sector, Police said.
The suspect who can speak English fluently had fraudulently sent an invitation to the businessperson for a deceptive opening of a tourist hotel and as he was on his way to the function, the suspect had abducted and led the entrepreneur to a lonely place to take the ransom, police said.
The businessperson is a leading supplier of building materials to mainly foreigners who are setting up tourist villas in the area. He had gone to the function believing that the invitation was from a foreign client, Police investigations revealed.
The businessman had travelled along the Warabokka road near Koggala Oya in Habaraduwa in his luxury car when two persons on a motorcycle had stopped him at an isolated location and got in to the vehicle in the pretence of leading him to the function.
They had later blind-folded the entrepreneur and taken him in a separate vehicle leaving the luxury car in Akmeemana and informed the victims brother, a business person, about the kidnap. They had demanded Rs. 40 million to release his brother.
Following negotiations, the suspects had reduced the ransom to Rs. 5 million. The victims brother withdrew the required sum from a bank at Koggala and kept the cash at a spot as instructed by the suspects. The suspects after receiving the ransom had taken the entrepreneur blind folded on a motorcycle and dropped him near his residence, police said.
Galle Police arrested the main suspect at Welikonda, Habaraduwa with nearly Rs. 2 million, while another was arrested at his residence in Matale with Rs. 1.9 million.
Investigations are on to arrest one more suspect, police said.

THE WAY TO END SUFFERING
The search for a spiritual path is born out of suffering. It does not start with lights and ecstasy, but with the hard tacks of pain, disappointment, and confusion. However, for suffering to give birth to a genuine spiritual search, it must amount to more than something passively received from without. It has to trigger an inner realization, a perception which pierces through the facile complacency of our usual encounter with the world to glimpse the insecurity perpetually gaping underfoot. When this insight dawns, even if only momentarily, it can precipitate a profound personal crisis. It overturns accustomed goals and values, mocks our routine preoccupations, leaves old enjoyments stubbornly unsatisfying.
At first such changes generally are not welcome. We try to deny our vision and to smother our doubts; we struggle to drive away the discontent with new pursuits. But the flame of inquiry, once lit, continues to burn, and if we do not let ourselves be swept away by superficial readjustments or slouch back into a patched up version of our natural optimism, eventually the original glimmering of insight will again flare up, again confront us with our essential plight. It is precisely at that point, with all escape routes blocked, that we are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an end.
No longer can we continue to drift complacently through life, driven blindly by our hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing social norms. A deeper reality beckons us; we have heard the call of a more stable, more authentic happiness, and until we arrive at our destination we cannot rest content.
But it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficulty. Once we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually compatible. When we browse through the shelves of humanitys spiritual heritage, both ancient and contemporary, we do not find a single tidy volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each offering themselves to us as the highest, the fastest, the most powerful, or the most profound solution to our quest for the Ultimate. Confronted with this melange, we fall into confusion trying to size them up  to decide which is truly liberative, a real solution to our needs, and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flaws.
Different practices and techniques
One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic one: to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable to our needs, welding together different practices and techniques into a synthetic whole that is personally satisfying. Thus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu mantra recitation, Christian prayer with Sufi dancing, Jewish Kabbala with Tibetan visualization exercises. Eclecticism, however, though sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly and materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue, eventually wears thin. While it makes a comfortable halfway house, it is not comfortable as a final vehicle.
There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate inadequacy. One is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws upon. The great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines as independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely recombined to enhance the felt quality of our lives. They present them, rather, as parts of an integral whole, of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature of reality and the final goal of the spiritual quest.
A spiritual tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet ones feet and then beat a quick retreat to the shore. It is a mighty, tumultuous river which would rush through the entire landscape of ones life, and if one truly wishes to travel on it, one must be courageous enough to launch ones boat and head out for the depths.
The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first. As spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of reality and the final good, these visions are not mutually compatible. When we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions, we will find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our sight, differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways of saying the same thing. Rather, they point to very different experiences constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that goal.
True enlightenment and liberation
Hence, because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the different spiritual traditions propose, once we decide that we have outgrown eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to one particular path, we find ourselves confronted with the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true enlightenment and liberation. One cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to ourselves our fundamental aim, to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative path.
If we reflect carefully, it will become clear that the prime requirement is a way to the end of suffering. All problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering; thus what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and completely. Both these qualifying words are important. The path has to lead to a complete end of suffering, to an end of suffering in all its forms, and to a final end of suffering, to bring suffering to an irreversible stop.
But here we run up against another question. How are we to find such a path  a path which has the capacity to lead us to the full and final end of suffering Until we actually follow a path to its goal we cannot know with certainty where it leads, and in order to follow a path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy of the path.
The pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit of clothes. To select a new suit one need only try on a number of suits, inspect oneself in the mirror, and select the suit in which one appears most attractive. The choice of a spiritual path is closer to marriage: one wants a partner for life, one whose companionship will prove as trustworthy and durable as the pole star in the night sky.
Faced with this new dilemma, we may think that we have reached a dead end and conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal inclination, if not a flip of the coin. However, our selection need not be as blind and uninformed as we imagine, for we do have a guideline to help us. Since spiritual paths are generally presented in the framework of a total teaching, we can evaluate the effectiveness of any particular path by investigating the teaching which expounds it.
In making this investigation we can look to three criteria as standards for evaluation:
l First, the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering. If the picture of suffering it gives is incomplete or defective, then the path it sets forth will most likely be flawed, unable to yield a satisfactory solution. Just as an ailing patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct diagnosis of his illness, so in seeking release from suffering we need a teaching that presents a reliable account of our condition.
l The second criterion calls for a correct analysis of the causes giving rise to suffering. The teaching cannot stop with a survey of the outward symptoms. It has to penetrate beneath the symptoms to the level of causes, and to describe those causes accurately. If a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis, there is little likelihood that its treatment will succeed.
l The third criterion pertains directly to the path itself. It stipulates that the path which the teaching offers has to remove suffering at its source. This means it must provide a method to cut off suffering by eradicating its causes. If it fails to bring about this root-level solution, its value is ultimately nil. The path it prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that all is well; but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle for cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady continues to thrive.
To sum up, we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to offer a true path to the end of suffering: first, it has to set forth a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering; second, it must present a correct analysis of the causes of suffering; and third, it must give us the means to eradicate the causes of suffering.
Spiritual disciplines
This is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines in terms of these criteria. Our concern is only with the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, and with the solution this teaching offers to the problem of suffering. That the teaching should be relevant to this problem is evident from its very nature; for it is formulated, not as a set of doctrines about the origin and end of things commanding belief, but as a message of deliverance from suffering claiming to be verifiable in our own experience. Along with that message there comes a method of practice, a way leading to the end of suffering. This way is the Noble Eightfold Path (ariya atthangika magga).
The Eightfold Path stands at the very heart of the Buddhas teaching. It was the discovery of the path that gave the Buddhas own enlightenment a universal significance and elevated him from the status of a wise and benevolent sage to that of a world teacher. To his own disciples he was pre-eminently the arouser of the path unarisen before, the producer of the path not produced before, the declarer of the path not declared before, the knower of the path, the seer of the path, the guide along the path (MN 108). And he himself invites the seeker with the promise and challenge: You yourselves must strive. The Buddhas are only teachers. The meditative ones who practice the path are released from the bonds of evil (Dhp. v. 276).
To see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation, we have to check it out against our three criteria: to look at the Buddhas account of the range of suffering, his analysis of its causes, and the programme he offers as a remedy.

Were ready for South Africa - Kohli
CAPE TOWN, Saturday: Indian captain Virat Kohli said on Saturday that his Indian team had the ability to gain a first series win in South Africa.
We have the right kind of bowling attack and the right kind of balance to win Test matches in any conditions we play in, he said at the Indian team's arrival press conference.
The first of the three Test matches starts at Newlands on Friday.
Kohli baulked, though, when it was suggested his team had a chance to make history.
For us it is about winning sessions, being in the present, executing our skills well, not looking at the history of a particular country we are playing in.
With 13 of his 17-man squad veterans of Indias 2013/14 tour, Kohli said there was plenty of experience.
A lot of our players have played here before. But it's about the number of games we had played then and the number we have played now, said Kohli. We all understand our own games so much better. As a team we have confidence in our personal skills set.
Kohli said team spirit was the outstanding feature of the touring party. There's a sense of intelligence and awareness and that provides the excitement. We know exactly what we need to do come game time. We know how to win Test matches.
Kohli said India had made the right decision to cancel a scheduled two-day warm-up match, opting instead for intensive middle-wicket practice at a local club.
There's no point in wasting two days, guys going in and scoring quick fifties, said Kohli. We'd rather have them do two sessions like today.
We can try and prepare the wickets the way we want them. If you are playing a game there is no room to change the wicket.
Here you have the freedom to put more water on the wicket, roll it and make it harder so that tomorrow we have the conditions we want.
Kohli said his players expected to be challenged by South Africa's fast bowlers on pitches with pace and bounce but they were confident in their own ability.
Come the fifth of January we will be ready for it, he said.
Coach Ravi Shastri said: This team is up for the challenge. If you had asked me four years ago I would have said no. But this team has gained in experience.
The beauty of this team is that it doesn't matter which opposition. We look at the pitch and adapt to the conditions. Every game is a home game. It's as simple as that.
Shastri added: This will be a contest. I can sense our players want this Test match to start as soon as possible.

Wolves open 10-point Championship lead after win at Bristol City
LONDON, Saturday - Wolverhampton Wanderers came from behind to beat promotion rivals Bristol City 2-1 at Ashton Gate with Ryan Bennett earning the victory with a stoppage-time header in The Championship (second tier).
Bristol City came into Saturdays late kick off having taken 16 points from their last 18 available, a joint-high in the last six games, alongside Leeds United, with victory over Manchester United in the League Cup adding to the feel-good atmosphere around Ashton Gate.
However, despite taking the lead against Wolves -- who had Danny Batth sent off in the 14th minute -- through Bobby Reid, Wolves stormed back to snatch all three points.
The dismissal of City goalkeeper Frank Fielding was the turning point, with Barry Douglas equalising shortly afterwards, before Bennett headed the last-gasp winner.
Tony Pulis tasted defeat in his first game as Middlesbrough manager after Robert Snodgrass third goal for Aston Villa earned Steve Bruces men a 1-0 victory at the Riverside. Pulis was appointed on Boxing Day before the game against Bolton Wanderers, but watched on from the stands as Middlesbrough earned a second successive win.
They could not build on that momentum on Saturday, though, as Snodgrass second-half header earned Villa the three points.
Sheffield Uniteds promotion bid continued to falter as former Sheffield Wednesday striker Gary Madine earned Bolton a 1-0 win at Bramhall Lane, meaning Chris Wilders side have won just once in their last seven league games.
Boltons win was their first on their travels in the second tier in 999 days since a 3-0 win over Cardiff City in April 2015.
Another promotion hopeful, Leeds suffered a disappointing 1-0 defeat at bottom side Birmingham City, with Jacques Maghomas late goal earning Birmingham a first win in eight at St Andrews. Fourteen of Birminghams last 16 wins in the Championship have been by a one-goal margin.
Hull will also be disappointed with their afternoons work after letting a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 with Fulham at the KCOM Stadium, meaning they have now lost 19 points from leading positions in the Championship this season. Only Brentford (21) have dropped more.
Substitute Aboubakar Kamara was the hero for Fulham after scoring both goals to salvage a point. Sunderland continued their improvement under former Wales coach Chris Coleman as Aiden McGeadys strike secured a 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest, while managerless Sheffield Wednesday suffered a 2-0 defeat at Brentford.
Friday night saw Preston North End win 1-0 at Cardiff City and Millwall beat Queens Park Rangers by the same scoreline.

Judges and their trauma
Wounds unhealable
I am writing today about a subject rarely ever discussed openly. The impact on those hearing cases and making judgements. The Judges in particular, court room staff in general.
Proceedings in Magistrates are ugly at best to hear. It extends at a more leisured pace in High Courts. Its not so bad in a District Court and in Courts of Appeal.
A judge has an air conditioned room. The Court room is an amphitheater of lies, drama, gruesome evidence, violent submissions and deceit. He or she has to maintain a composed demeanour through days of such bedlam every working day. The Judge is called upon to give orders from the Bench or after considering evidence led.
Nobody ever asks the impact of this grueling process on them physically and mentally. Its my assumption, to concede or to admit a problem may affect their careers.
Is it not time for the Judicial Services Commission and the erstwhile Minister of Justice and her team to ask this question and elicit a response from all serving lower court and High Court judges and court staff how they feel, what their nightmares are, how they could be helped, how to help all in the future If not why not
The testimony of one Judge
Karen Adam retired from the bench nearly 18 months ago, after 34 years as a City Court magistrate, Superior Court Commissioner and Superior Court judge in or near Tucson, Arizona.
She says that when she was the presiding judge at the juvenile court she had led a drive to transform the court into one which was trauma-responsive. Everyone who worked at the court was required to learn about a phenomenon called vicarious trauma before being trained on how to handle the trauma which might affect court users.
She continues: So how could I have been so affected by something that had happened two years earlier I did this work for more than three decades without flinching. It wasnt that the work didnt affect me; it profoundly affected me. But I had taught myself how to manage it.
She explains: Vicarious trauma is real. It can affect anyone who encounters those who have suffered trauma of any kind, from auto accidents to child abuse to serious medical conditions. Law enforcement officers, doctors, nurses, child-welfare investigators, firefighters, and other first responders are the most obvious potential victims of vicarious trauma.
What isnt so obvious is what happens when, day after day and case after case, a judge is required to hear about terrible things that happen to people but cannot respond physically or emotionally in a naturally human way.
However horrific the testimony and exhibits, a judge must remain dignified, calm, respectful. Emotions must be buried. The victim in the child-abuse case had such severe injuries that the first doctor who examined her at the emergency room thought she had been born with birth defects. The police officer who found the child, minutes from death, choked up while testifying.
She says that suppressing emotions for days, months, and years carries a heavy toll:
A kind of numbness can develop. Sleeping and eating suffer. Some people develop substance abuse or addictive exercise regimens. By the time I left the bench, I rarely cried or was visibly upset by anything that happened in my personal life.
Vicarious trauma can happen to any judge on any bench. Every day, people come to court to have judges solve problems they cannot or should not solve themselves: landlord-tenant disputes, child-support collection, custody and visitation disputes, elder abuse. When she started her judicial career in 1981, there was no training on how to avoid this kind of burnout. All day, every day, she would listen to cases involving domestic violence, substance abuse, mental health issues, and when she was appointed a judge of the Juvenile Court six years later, no one talked about how to handle the emotionally difficult caseload.
She says she taught herself to maintain her composure in the courtroom, but although she considered she was a good judge; dignified, respectful and focused. She failed to recognise how this was affecting her emotional health.
Taking breaks
Most judges have now learned some basic techniques for managing judicial stress. Leave the courtroom on a regular basis. Take a break. A real break. Step outside, talk to a colleague, have a healthy snack, do yoga. When the sessions end and you return to your chambers, dont let your assistant hand you a stack of phone messages or documents to sign. Very politely say that you are on a break and then take time for yourself. Except for emergencies, whatever needs your attention can wait.
Our Judges quite simply dont have these options.
These basic techniques may not be sufficient if a judge is experiencing vicarious trauma. It may be appropriate to talk with a medical or mental health professional. Vicarious trauma is not just judicial stress writ large.
Of course, judges are not the only ones affected in a courthouse. When she saw that a member of her courtroom team had become very anxious during a case involving significant domestic violence, she asked privately whether there was a problem she could help with. She was told that this woman had grown up in an abusive household and that listening to the testimony was very difficult. The judge lent her a book from her collection of trauma resources.
I now grasp why victims and witnesses sometimes struggle when having to re-live trauma through listening to descriptions or testifying about a traumatic event. I understand why trauma experts urge us to ask what happened to a person rather than whats wrong with that person when evaluating troubling behaviour.
Judges seek help to cope with trauma of hearing serious crime cases
Chief County Court Judge Michael Rozenes has volunteered for a new Judicial Resilience Program'. Though more resilient to stress than the average person, he said judges were largely isolated from the community and unable to discuss their work or respond publicly to criticism. Stress also built up over time: The better you tolerate [stress], the more you put off the results until they only show up much later.
We want judges to be human and that means they're going to feel and connect and if they're not going to be hardened or damaged...then we need to give them an opportunity to heal, he said.
Sentencing offenders was the hardest thing they did: That notion that you're now going to fundamentally affect someone's life...is what keeps you awake at night. It's just as difficult now as it was the first day I started.
