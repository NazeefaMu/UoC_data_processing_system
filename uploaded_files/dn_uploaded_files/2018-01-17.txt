Well water under-utilized
A public well located at Kandubedda off Vevaththa junction on the Ampara-Mahaoya-Mahiyanganaya road is underutilized.
The well, community property in the area of Rideemaaliyadda of the Mahiyanganaya electorate, and built at a cost of Rs.550 000, was to be used by about 150 families.
However, it is currently utilized only by a few families of the neighbouring area, as there is no overhead tank for water storage and no pipes for distributing water. The community urges the government and the Uva Provincial Council to taken action in this regard.
A former pradeshiya sabha member said that a private company once expressed willingness to donate Rs. 1,000,000 for such a project.
D.M. Mutubanda Dissanayaka at Orubendiveva, Araavaththa added that the company had responded to a request by the office of the chief United National Party organizer for Mahiyanganaya (electorate).

What do I do when I receive someone elses mail
Mistakes happen, especially when it comes to the mail. Carriers sometimes misread an address, letters can shift around in the back of the truck, and people move without updating their address. Heres what you do if you get mail that doesnt belong to you. If the Mail Is Delivered to the Wrong Address
If the mail youve received is not only for someone else, but for a different address than yours, do not open it and do not throw it away (both are punishable offenses). To correct the mistake, you have a couple options: Deliver it yourself: If the letter is clearly for a nearby neighbor, and you can physically open their mailbox, feel free to deliver the letter to the correct address yourself. It is not illegal to open someones mailbox (as long as its not locked), and its not illegal to personally forward mail to the correct address as long as the mail has proper postage. You could also knock on their door and hand it to them if you know them. However, be aware that there are laws against placing other thingslike flyers, notes, advertisements without postage, etc.in mailboxes.
Write a note and stick it in the outgoing: If the correct address is far away, or you just dont feel like dealing with delivering it yourself (which is totally fine), simply write a note that says something to the effect of wrong address and stick it in your mailbox or the outgoing box. A mail carrier will pick it up next time around and it will be delivered to the correct address in the next couple days.
A quick note on notes: dont write your note directly on the envelope or article and deface someone elses mail, say mail carriers Tara OSullivan and Julia Bavaro. You might ruin the recipients mail, especially if you use a Sharpie and it bleeds through, and it causes more grief than is necessary. Just write your message on a sticky note and attach it to the article before sticking it in the outgoing.
And if youre worried a sticky note wont stay on, paperclip the note to the letter. If the Mail Is for Someone Who No Longer Lives There
If youre receiving someone elses mail with your correct address, you need to inform the mail carrier and post office.
Again, a sticky note placed on the letter with a message like person no longer lives here will do the trick. Stick it in the outgoing and hope the post office adjusts their records. www.lifehacker.com

What does risk management have to do with Sri Lankan families
While the number of Sri Lankans living under the poverty line has decreased tremendously, many still live right above it and can fall back into extreme poverty if they experience natural disasters.
Imagine there is a small fire in your house: someone forgot to put out a cigarette stub and accidentally set your rubbish bin on fire. You will need just one bucket of water to put it out.
But up the ante and it is no longer possible for an individual to handle it. For instance, if your entire house was on fire, you would need to call your local Fire Brigade for help.
Now, go up one more level. You live in a thickly wooded part of a district like Badulla and a forest fire covering hundreds of acres is threatening homes and businesses, then it would take the resources of the country and maybe even aid and support from international allies, to battle the fire and help people recover.
I am telling you this story to illustrate how there are levels of risks and responses, to consider when discussing a subject like integrated risk management.
As part of our work on the recently released Sri Lanka Development Update, (SLDU) we considered the risks and opportunities facing Sri Lanka, beginning from the smallest unit of the household and building upto the country, as represented by the public sector. There has been a lot of talk about the macro-economy and national level reforms and policy initiatives. However, in this blog I wanted to focus on your families. What does integrated risk management mean for households
The poorest Sri Lankan families are vulnerable to shocks
Unlike some other countries in this region, Sri Lanka does not have a problem with extreme poverty. Rates of extreme poverty have declined; per capita income has increased and preliminary results of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) show a further decline in the national poverty rate from 6.7 percent in 2012/13 to 4.1 percent in 2016.
However, unpack the data and you can see that significant poverty still exists in certain areas; a large share of the population subsists on little more than the extreme poverty line.
Floods and landslides
Consider how such families living in such areas were affected by the floods and landslides in 2017 and the drought of 2016/17. Eleven of the Divisional Secretary (DS) divisions affected by landslides were found to be poorer than the national average. Approximately 12 percent of those affected were poor, nearly twice the national average of 6.7 percent.
It is not just when disaster strikes that these households need attention. We have to think about, for instance, how the proposed reforms will affect the countrys poor. For instance, the removal of VAT, exemptions will raise the cost of living, pushing some households further into poverty, while reforms in trade and business could put pressure on associated businesses and lead to certain households facing income insecurity. At least in the short-term, there will be vulnerable households who need support.
Social protection measures need to be designed and better targeted to support the poor
Like the big forest fire, some risks are too much for people or even families to manage on their own. For instance, the data reveals that social protection measures are needed to mitigate the impacts of drought floods, particularly landslides, on the poor. However, these social safety net programmes need to be better targeted to ensure that those who need it most are the ones who benefit. When it comes to the impact of reforms, we can look at innovative and focused solutions to protect the poor.
Take VAT exemptions: households in the top 60 percent income bracket account for 75 percent of spending benefitting from exemptions, compared to the bottom 40 percent, who account for just 25 percent.
This means that many VAT exemptions are effectively subsidies to the non-poor.
Instead, if VAT exemptions were limited to goods and services primarily consumed by the poor, the latter could actually benefit.
A similar argument goes for fuel price reforms. The top 30 percent of household account for 70 percent of direct consumption of fuel.
This means that, as long as fuel prices are fixed below market prices as they have been most of the time, richer households are the main beneficiaries from low fixed fuel prices, while the state-owned utilities run losses compensated by the budget.
We see these types of implicit or explicit fuel subsidies in many countries and nearly everywhere they are effectively subsidies to the non-poor.
VAT reforms should go hand in hand with strengthening safety net and targeted public expenditure to mitigate the impact on the poor, such as investment in infrastructure in districts with a high poverty incidence, and in the quality of public health and education services, even as we ensure that public funds are used wisely and channelled effectively.
Successful fuel subsidy reforms, such as those in Indonesia, channelled the fiscal savings into social expenditure, such as the expansion of free schooling and social protection programs.
Better risk management will produce positive outcomes for the households:
Since the risks are clear, why should Sri Lanka still pursue reforms As outlined in the ambitious Vision 2025 agenda, the reform agenda is designed to bolster Sri Lankas economy, create a stronger public balance sheet and reduce the likelihood of serious shocks to the public and private sectors. This will be a time of change, and will offer new opportunities for development. For households, trade reforms can mean more and better paying jobs. More business opportunities will become available.
As markets open up, Sri Lankan consumers will benefit as quality improves and prices drop. 
Reforms and projects focused on boosting Sri Lankas physical resilience will help prevent natural disasters, save lives when people are exposed to them and help families recover from losses to their property and livelihoods.
In the meantime, fiscal reforms will increase the governments capacity to support new infrastructure projects, bringing desperately needed roads and health and education facilities to underserved areas.
Most importantly, households will be protected from shocks. By adopting responsible and rigorous measures to manage public debt and drive fiscal consolidation, the Government is protecting the Sri Lankan rupee and insuring that households can benefit from a stable economy.

What If Martin Luther King  Jr. Was Never Assassinated
In weighing the question, historians unravel how Americans construct Kings legacyand how we conceive of civil rights in our own time.
Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot in Memphis on April 4, 1968. But what if the attempt was unsuccessful Or what if there was no attempt at all What if King had lived on Its fascinating to imagine, but theres no way to definitively picture such a world; we cant study history that never happened. Simply posing the question to significant American historians, though, unveils plenty of insight. A Shared Legacy
Kings contemporaries real lives can bridge the gap between reality and fictionespecially the life of Coretta Scott King, his wife and fellow activist.
The scope of her activism and the breadth of the issues she was working on are an indication of where [Martin Luther King] would be, suggests Jeanne Theoharis, a Brooklyn College political science professor and author of A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.
Just four days after her husbands assassination, Coretta Scott King led the Memphis sanitation workers march in his place. But her work wasn't restrained to merely carrying her late husbands torch, says Theoharis, pointing to Kings early opposition to the Vietnam War, her campaigns for economic as well as racial justice, her global peace work and denunciation of South African apartheid, and her agitation for gay rights.
King, if he had lived, would very likely have taken up those same bannersperhaps even marching them into the White House, speculates Komozi Woodard, a professor of history, public policy, and Africana studies at Sarah Lawrence College.
Hopefully, White America would have matured to the point of decriminalizing Dr. King as time went on just as Nelson Mandelas image shifted from terrorist to savior in South Africa, Woodard tells National Geographic. Dr. King may have successfully run for president as Mandela did. A Living King
One difference is a little easier to imagine, though it speaks volumes: we might not celebrate Martin Luther King Day in a world where he wasnt assassinated.
As both Theoharis and Woodard reiterate, King, while loved and admired by many, was vastly unpopular among political leaders and white Americans at the time of his death.
FBI leadership at that time saw Kings stature as a black messiah in criminal terms, Woodard says, describing how King was alienated, isolated and eliminated by the Johnson administration.
But the decades after Kings assassination saw his image flattened into a very different shape.
What a martyred King allows, is to sand off what makes us uncomfortable, have him be the Dream guy, Theoharis says. It places him safely in the distant past.
The real King, who spoke out against police brutality in the early sixties and whose tactics were nonviolent but intentionally disruptive, would challenge the rosy image hes given today.
Woodard describes how Kings views were becoming more aligned with those of the more radical Malcolm X. That doesnt mean that King would have abandoned nonviolent protest, he says, but it means that King was increasingly militant in his anti-poverty agenda.
And as Theoharis points out, there are many ties between civil rights activists of the sixties and current movements like Black Lives Mattera ladder of legacies Woodard traces from King through Stokely Carmichael, to whose youthful Black Power movement Woodard imagines King would have added a core of stability. If King had lived, his presumed connection toor involvement withtodays polarizing racial justice activists would counter, as Theoharis puts it, Americas fable that weve gotten past the race problem.
I think were very uncomfortable with the idea of King intervening in our times, she says. Thats the challenge of a living King.

THE WHEEL OF BRISBANE IN HER WIELDING AMBIENCE
Riding on The Wheel of Brisbane and viewing Brisbane from Mt. Coottha are unquestionably and undoubtedly quotable unforgettable magic memories from the land of kangaroos. Recently, I had the good fortune to experience this rare pleasure and I had my fill. Re-visiting my landscape of magic memories in the land of kangaroos and taking you to my newly widened horizon is naturally a literary pilgrimage for me. Could you be the inquisitive pilgrims on riding the wheel of Brisbane of much fame
The wheel of Brisbane is the most spectacular view to any first traveller to the well-kept planned city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia.
This eye catching metallic structure has been making her magical rounds since its opening to the public in 2008. One would raise his eye brows when I give the weight of this great engineering feat as 365 tons.
The total number of passengers that could ride on one sitting is 336. A rider could enjoy a panoramic view at 360 degrees as it is projected. It touches the city skyline at 60 metres.
The secret of its mesmerizing brightness is its subtle array of 60,000 lights on the structure. A wanderlust visitor could see her sister wheels in Paris, Cape Town, Malaysia and Atlanta.
Broader perspective
Let me salute the ultra-active intelligence and superb imagination of Dutch observation wheel designer Ronald A Bussink for giving mankind an enjoyable edifice to enjoy and treasure. It stands majestically in the land of kangaroos, yet I humbly think that it belongs to the human race on the broader perspective of sharing and caring unless my deliberations hurt Aussie sentiments.
A ride on it is a must experience to relish life. In a nutshell, the Wheel of Brisbane is a true landmark on planet earth.
In order to imbibe the real pleasure of the wheel experience in Brisbane one has to have a stroll in relaxation along the Brisbane River. I did it on your behalf as a writer of this esteemed newspaper. It is the longest river in South East Queensland. The picturesque winding flow of an approximate length of 346km is another piece of poetry for me.
Bridge making acumen of the Australian road engineers is inscribed in the 16 bridges over Brisbane River. It is the home for a massive population of bull sharks and so one has to take his own risk in having a dip. These aggressive creatures would pounce at you from any hidden corner and you would end in a watery grave, beware! I had the good fortune to have a relaxed stroll along the Brisbane River on the well-paved walkway for pedestrians; one has to take care as the cyclists take their rides along towards the new farm park.
It is said that every dark cloud has a silver lining.
Human imagination
The flood havoc that Brisbanehad experienced in 2011 had smashed the original walkway, but they have now rebuilt it to withstand any larger flood. The capacity of the Brisbane flood protection dam is calculated at holding twice the volume of water in the Sydney harbour.
The ravage of the flood havoc had been so catastrophic that it had almost erased the comely city of BRISBANE from the map. Human imagination builds cities and countries. Yet, its aesthetic aspect is injected to them by connoisseurs of every hue.
There lies the fun of Brisbane bridge facts. GO BETWEEN BRIDGE has been named after a local rock group. Merivale is another name of a bridge and its significance is that in the inner city of Brisbane the trains cross the river on it. William Jolly Bridge is another. The Aboriginal name for place for rats is KURILPA I wonder whether my name also has originated from Aborigines as I am so attached to the land of kangaroos. Anyway, Kurilpa Bridge across this long river is a name to reckon. Halfway across the river stands Goodwill Bridge that features a caf.
Brisbane could boast of zero air pollution and it facilitates the viewer atop the wheel to enjoy a land stretch of 28km. Not only the humans, but also our pretty lizards are said to have comfortably climbed the wheel! Why not you
Australias only city beach is situated away from a short stroll from the wheel. The lifesavers are on their routine patrol there to rescue any bather in this huge water mass which could hold twice the amount of water than the Olympic swimming pool. I felt it as the calmest stretch of water to cool ones body in the company of water lovers from around the globe.
Dining galleries
The south bank parklands are the destination of many wanderlust travellers who relax in eco comfort to their utmost fill. In this multifaceted complex dining galleries, avant-garde theatres, museums, shopping arcades are located for the maximum convenience of the visitor. Ever  blooming bougainvillea drape the curled spires in eye catching designs to enchant you. Brisbane ranks as one of the rapidly growing cities in Australia and caters to a huge population of more than 2 million people. Brisbane is to pronounce BRIZ-BUN to sound correct and it is said to be the third largest city of the country and the capital of Queensland. Central Plaza One, Infinity Tower, 1 William St currently under construction enhances the modernity of the city towering towards the blue sky.
The Wheel of Brisbane could also be well enjoyed on a boat ride in the BRISBANE RIVER. It is the city ambience that upholds the fun of the Wheel Ride. A single ride lasts for about twenty-five minutes and approximately six rounds to give the rider a better view. I am longing for a re-visit to refill my waning magic memory.

WIM connecting Sri Lanka and Canada through women professionals
Women in Management (WIM), an organisation committed to empower and recognise Sri Lankan women in careers, businesses and professions has taken a huge step to recognise Canadian women of Sri Lankan origin on January 20, 2018.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr. Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management said, Our objective is to brand Sri Lankan women nationally and internationally. During the last seven years WIM Sri Lanka has recognised more than 400 women who have excelled in their careers and businesses through Professional and Career Women Awards. Last year the awards were extended to the Maldives as well. We have been able to give the rising generation mentors and leaders from our own country. Further, WIM winners have been recognised by their organisations nationally and internationally. Today most of the winners have become mentors to young career and business women.
Dr. Segera added that steered by the advice of Dr Rohantha Athukorala, WIM made the decision to find Sri Lankan women who have excelled in other countries, but have not received any exposure or recognition for their accomplishments. And as a first step, WIM has ventured to confer recognition on Sri Lankan women in Canada.
We are delighted to say that we received nearly 50 applications for the first round of WIM Awards to be held in Canada. We were so proud to read their profiles and it was a privilege for the panel of judges to read how the applicants have excelled in their fields on the international platform.
Subsequent to the selection by the panel of judges, WIM will bestow recognition on 20 women at the Top 20 WIM Canada Awards that will be held on January 20, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.
This event will be graced by the High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Canada along with the Consulate General of Sri Lanka and other diplomats from Sri Lanka and Canada.
This event is co-ordinated by Rienzie Martinesz, Official Representative for WIM Awards Canada. WIM Canada Awards is partnered by Cinnamon Life (member of the John Keells Group) as the Platinum Sponsor, Singer Sri Lanka, Jetwing Hotels and Travels and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The panel of judges are Dr Rohantha Athukorala, Dawn Austin, Kumar Samarasinghe, Kasturi Wilson, Gowri Rajan and Jeevan Thiyagarja.

Woman marries 300-year-old ghost
Amanda Teague had a beautiful fairytale wedding complete with a gorgeous white gown and family and loved to celebrate her special day.
There is just one big difference at this wedding from the usual ones you may have attended. The man Teague married is a 300-year-old ghost named Jack, the Metro reported.
Jack was a Haitian pirate who was executed for his crimes in the 1700s, according to the report. He also has the ability to switch stereos and lights on and off and even move objects.
Despite the unusual circumstances, the 45-year-old from Northern Ireland revealed their relationship started out like any other and was normal. What started as a friendship soon grew into something much more.
We became really close, the more I learnt about him, the more I liked him. One day he said to me We can actually be together you know but I had never heard of an intimate relationship between a spirit and a human before, she is quoted as saying my the Metro.
So Amanda, a female Jack Sparrow impersonator, decided to do her own research into these kind of spiritual relationships and learned there are a lot of people in her situation.
So what is sex like with a ghost Amanda says its similar to that with a human.
The only difference with having a sexual relationship with a spirit is obviously that sense of touch goes a lot deeper, she revealed in the report.
Adding, You can literally feel the physical act of what the spirit is doing to you, and the spirit can feel it too.
She also revealed the connection they have is unlike any other she has ever experienced. As their relationship grew, Amanda expressed to Jack the desire of have something long-lasting. I told him I wasnt really cool with having casual sex with a spirit and I wanted us to make a proper commitment to each other, the Metro reported.
So when Jack proposed to Amanda, who had five children from a previous marriage with a human, she accepted. The wedding took place on a boat and a medium was used for Jack to be able to say I do. A skull and crossbones flag was also used to represent him on their special day.

Govt. servants, State resources cannot be used  for political promotion
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said neither government servants nor State resources could be used to promote political parties at the Local Government election. He added that government servants are not allowed to volunteer their services to candidates.
Deshapriya, speaking to the media, stated that the above has been banned in the Constitution, Elections Ordinance, Establishments Code, and regulations of relevant institutions. In addition, the Election Commission has issued a gazette and circular with regard to it. A government servant, who works at a State institution, corporation, public liability company or a company where the government is a shareholder of 50 percent or more shares, comes under these laws. If caught violating election laws, he/she is liable to a fine of Rs. 100,000 or a one-year imprisonment, or both.
He further said government servants on active duty had no political rights. Whether during office hours or after, they cannot volunteer or use their position to aid election campaigns of friends or relatives. Furthermore, they are not allowed to express political opinion which favours any particular political party, Deshapriya said.

Govt. will expand development ventures after polls victory
It is crucial that the government wins the upcoming Local Government election to expand the development ventures into local government bodies, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
Minister Athukorale pointed out that the government has completed an enormous workload within two years that the previous regime failed to do in 10 years.
She was speaking at a meeting held at Ratnapura, Imbulpe in support of the UNP candidates in the area, yesterday.
Minister Athukorale said the government is committed to developing the country, unlike the Joint Opposition gang of thieves who only wants what is best for them.
The Pohottowa attempts to bring a family into power. Why cant anybody else but them become the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party President Maithripala Sirisena won the election with 6.2 million votes. Pohottuwa is trying to tear the SLFP apart to build the Rajapaksa family. Rajapaksa wants to make his son the President of this country in 10 years, Minister Athukorale pointed out.
She said the government is not at fault for the increase in the coconut price. A large number of coconut trees were destroyed due to natural causes. Approximately 225,000 coconut trees in the Kurunegala district were destroyed due to natural causes. Nobody talks about the government reducing gas, fuel, and medicine prices, she added.
Minister Athukorale said the government took over a country with Rs. 10,000 billion in debt, thanks to the Rajapaksa regime. The Rajapaksa regime made ports and highways but swindled large sums from these development projects, she said. Now they are even trying to take the credit for the Moragahakanda project. This project was initially planned by the UNP governments late Minister Gamini Dissanayake under the leadership of the late President J. R. Jayawardena. When President Sirisena attempted to carry out the project when he was a minister, the previous regime refused to allocate money for it. It is the present government that allocated the funds to finish the Moragahakanda project, Minister Athukorale pointed out.
She added that some make a huge issue out of the fertilizer shortage which surfaced recently. There may be certain delays in receiving stocks, but at least we are distributing quality fertilizers unlike the previous regime that gave people low-quality fertilizers, she said.

Intelligent people will choose UNP
The intelligent people of this country will elect the UNP to power at the forthcoming local government elections and entrust it with the historic responsibility of developing villages and towns disregarding the false propaganda carried out by foolish and dishonest politicians, said the United University Lecturers Association in a press release issued yesterday.
The release said this false propaganda is carried out by politicians who wanted to cover up the serious acts of alleged fraud, corruption and abuse of power and state privileges committed during their period of rule.
The release signed by Association President Prof S W Cyril, Secretary Prof G P S M Gunaratne and National Organiser Prof M O A de Soysa further said people who published distorted ideas and views about Presidential, Parliamentary Provincial Council and Local Government elections were political misfits who displayed their ignorance about elections.
When you examine the political pedigree of those who claim that the countrys Prime Minister could be decided through the results of the local government elections held on February 10, their ignorance was clearly evidenced.
The prime aim of these people who are out on bail by courts following indictments made against them for alleged fraud and corruption during the Rajapaksa regime was to re-establish a dictatorial regime which could control the Judiciary, Police and the Public Service according to their whims and fancies by deceiving the people.
By making statements as if they have been awakened by a Rip Van Winkle sleep, they were only displaying their ignorance about the essence of consensus politics.
What was visible from such statements was that they were more interested in achieving their selfish political objectives rather than rebuilding the country.
The majority of people who gave their mandate at the January 8 and August 17, 2015 elections expected democratic governance, economic development and national reconciliation and their firm wish and resolve was that any party elected through their mandate had no right to move away from these objectives.
No one could exercise influence to deviate from those objectives. The mini-election would decide as to who should be entrusted with the development of villages and towns.
History proved that the UNP was the only party capable of developing the villages and towns and strengthening community life of the people, the release said.

He also said that with the launch of Chinas one belt, one road initiative Sri Lanka has even better chances to attract more FDI. This is because of Sri Lankas unique geographical location.
Xiaoru said that there is rapid development visible in Sri Lanka and a lot of business opportunities emerging in the country and he is looking at investing more in Sri Lanka.
I am also keen in the leisure sector, real estate, energy and also transport and logistics, he said. adding that he is keen to look at unexplored areas with scenic beauty in Sri Lanka to build hotels.
Xiaoru, the Chairman of Shenzen Listed company Tatwah Smartech during his visit to Sri Lanka signed a partnership agreement and committed to invest US$ 30 million into SupremeSAT - Sri Lankan satellite company.

SLFPs services to the country are immense
Speaking at an election propaganda meeting held in Galagedara, Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that the SLFP has rendered a distinguished service to the country and the people of Sri Lanka.
Speaking further Dr. Amunugama said:"No one can forget the distinguished services rendered to our country by SLFP governments. The role played by our party to develop this country and to protect the people's right and public property is immense. The services rendered by the SLFP to strengthen public welfare programmes and to elevate the levels of education and health servicesare tremendous. At the same time it is necessary to mention that the President will not hesitate to get rid of fraud and corruption and to take strong decisions in regard to those who perpetrate fraud and acts of corruption. It is necessary to state that the President will act without discrimination in taking decisions in regard to building a just society and establishing a clean administration, by getting rid of corruption and waste.
Whatever forces may attempt to destroy the SLFP that will not be possible. History clearly shows as to what the fate was of those who broke away from the SLFP. Therefore it is necessary to say that the giant tree that the SLFP is, will not fall down and that the rural peasantry of this country always stands dedicated to protect it. No one can prevent the SLFP becoming victorious in the present election.
Due to the dedication of our party and the decision of the President, it was possible to do away with the proportional system of representation and the preference voting system and introduce the ward system of elections. Through that you have now got the opportunity to elect your own representative. I must remind you that this ward system was established in the teeth of opposition by other parties.
Dr.Amunugama speaking further said:I was able to develop in all spheres, a Galgedara electoral division which was steeped in darkness. That was possible because continuously for 25 years I was elected as MP for Galagedara, through your consent. Elected an MP, I was able, holding various ministerial portfolios, to develop all sectors of this constituency. I improved to a very high level, the educational, highways, cultural, sports, health and such other facilities in this area. I was also able to provide community halls, a weekly fair, a courts complex, bank buildings and other government buildings. You are now making use of those facilities. I was able to prove everything by deed and not by mere talk. I have contributed to the multi faceted development of not only this constituency but of the whole district.At the same time ever one knows that the whole country benefitted by my services in the various powerful ministerial portfolios I have held. I feel a modest pride in that achievement.
"We are always thinking of ways and means of solving the people's problems.The SLFP's and the President's desire is to provide the maximum service possible to the people. We have dedicated ourselves for the people to life's end. The President will not hesitate to punish the robbing of people's money and those who committed such robberies.That is the SLFP policy. Our desire is to sacrifice ourselves for and on behalf of the people,"he said.

ADB provides additional funds to support SME development in SL
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved $75 million in additional financing to continue support toward the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), considered vital for economic growth and job creation in Sri Lanka.
SMEs have the potential to reduce regional inequalities in Sri Lanka given that SMEs are more widespread throughout the country than larger enterprises, which are mainly based in the capital Colombo, said Don Lambert, an ADB Principal Finance Specialist. The additional support will ensure that more SMEs have wider access to credit.
SMEs contribute about 45% of Sri Lankas gross domestic product and provide about half of the countrys jobs.
However, access to finance remains a significant challenge for the SMEs. About 30% of local enterprises cite this issue as a major deterrent to their growth and development, one of the highest percentages among ADB developing member countries after Afghanistan, Mongolia, and Nepal.
Many of these SMEs have no previous experience dealing with formal financial institutions like banks, are led by women, or based in rural areas. The additional financing for the SME Line of Credit Project will increase the available loans for participating banks to $175 million by 2020, from the original loan figure of $100 million approved in February 2016. This additional support will further encourage local partner banks to grow their SME portfolios, particularly to enterprises outside Colombo or are women-led and eventually help Sri Lanka address some of its major development challenges through economic diversification, job creation, women empowerment, and inclusivegrowth.
Apart from providing wider access to finance to SMEs, the project is also developing innovative SME financing schemes, while building capacity of SMEs particularly in information and communications technology, business process outsourcing, fruits and vegetables, as well as processed food and beverage.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members, 48 from the region.

Priests, medicine men, professional politicians and the State:
Agony within
Media headlines in recent months in Sri Lanka have concentrated heavily on the political role of Buddhist monks, agitations of government medical officers against the establishment of a private medical college and the increasing failure of the State to address many pressing social issues. These three matters are by no means unconnected. In fact, all three are products of a process of social and political change that unfolded over the last several decades.
As is well known, despite leftist and liberal misgivings about the continuing connection between the State and the Buddhist establishment, successive governments after independence have tended to accept it, either willingly or unwillingly. In more recent years, not just political leaders, but even senior state officials, having assumed duties of their new positions have routinely visited the high priests of the Buddhist order, tacitly accepting the need to have their counsel and blessings to conduct their official duties.
Yet, Sri Lanka is not a theocracy and the political leaders often have taken decisions that do not always conform to religious precepts. But, on some contentious issues, the influence of the Buddhist establishment has prevented political leaders from taking timely and necessary measures to resolve them. The most important one is the national question. Given the strong link between popular Buddhism and Sinhala nationalism, many Buddhist monks and laity resist any attempt to temper with the existing constitutional provisions dealing with the special status accorded to Buddhism.
This resistance to constitutional reforms is also extended to cover the issues connected with the relative standing of ethnic communities within the political structure of the country. Extensive devolution of power to sub- national units is resisted because it is presumed to be based on the idea of a more inclusive State. Given the fact that Sinhala Buddhist nationalism has been a major factor shaping public policies in post-independence Sri Lanka, it is not difficult to understand the above resistance. What is noteworthy is that many of the post-independence public policies have privileged the dominant ethnic community often at the expense of the others.
On the other hand, turning to the medical doctors who have continued to resist private medical education in the country, through disruptive trade union agitations, the main issue involved is intricately connected to the emergent social class structure and the post-independence State. The state-led development model adopted after independence in Sri Lanka stifled the growth of the private sector, and created an increasing dependence on the part of the upwardly mobile segments of the population on public resources for education, stable employment and other sources of livelihood such as land. So, any attempt to create greater space for private capital in the economy and the social sectors like education has been resisted by the members of the lower middle class dependent on the state for their privileges.
Public health institutions
Political parties, student groups and government medical officers who by and large represent the underprivileged yet upwardly mobile segments of Sri Lankan society have been able to prevent the establishment of a private medical college since the early 1980s. Such a college would have brought to an end the almost monopolistic rights to local medical education that the underprivileged students have enjoyed for decades. This is in spite of the fact that the health care provision in the country is no longer confined to public health institutions and the private health sector has emerged as a highly significant source of healthcare not just for the rich but also for an increasing proportion of the not so rich.
It is against the above background that we need to analyze the dysfunctional nature of the state in managing public affairs in the country today. Sri Lankan state has failed to adopt a rational approach to public policy making due to the persisting or even growing influence of constituencies that have been accommodated by a populist State, and these include politically active Buddhist priests, medical professionals who have originated from dependent lower middle class backgrounds and the diverse aspirants to political office whose only source of subsistence and wealth has been populist politics.
The populist politicians by and large do not see politics as a way of dealing with existential problems of the ordinary masses through rational public policies and effective state institutions. Instead, they see these problems as opportunities for them to get public attention and offer piecemeal solutions. Many examples can be cited here as illustrative examples but poverty alleviation is a classic case in point. Political fortunes of many, self seeking, populist politicians have been built on this issue over several decades.
When state institutions are micro-managed to offer ad hoc solutions to long standing economic and social issues, patron-client politics comes to the fore, making political leaders at all levels the key sources of relief to many ordinary people faced with all sorts of problems. These politicians, instead of discussing long term, durable solutions to diverse economic and social issues in fora as the parliament, Provincial Councils and local bodies, roam around in their jurisdictions offering instant solutions to problems at an individual level such as jobs, transfers, school admissions, food parcels, credit, wheel chairs, roofing sheets and land.
Public service
It is against the above background that we need to understand the chronic failure of the Sri Lankan State to find durable solutions to long standing political, social and economic issues, making the situation in the country almost hopeless, unstable and volatile in recent years.
The continuing deterioration of state institutions and the persisting inertia of the public service have been the result, leading to the worsening of conditions in many sectors such as education, research, environment, public transport, public health and social security. Yet, many populist politicians continue to dominate the media, and many journalists continue to hold their microphones to them so that they can continue to mislead the hapless masses by spreading the myth that they have solutions to the problems that we are faced with.
It seems that there are many gullible people who continue to believe them. On the other hand, the country still has a window of opportunity to lead the country on a more constructive path towards sustainable development, national unity and social justice. This is thanks to the political change that took place about three years ago.
If we could build national consensus among enlightened members of the public, public servants, civil society organisations, professionals, intellectuals, progressive politicians and other groups such as youths and university students on the need to take the country forward on the basis of sound state policies and interventions, it would be possible to prevent a downward slide to a state of sectarian violence, arbitrary rule and anarchy again.

All hail Lilliput!
Cute Lilliput is one little dog who certainly has the bow-wow factor. The Maltese has become a supermodel of the canine world and huge on social media.
Since her talents came to light at a dog show seven years ago, the eight-year-old pooch has amassed more than 100,000 followers on Instagram .
She has a nutritionist, chef, homeopath and trainer on hand to take care of her every need. Lilliput works with top brands such as River Island and celebs including the Pet Shop Boys.
Her owner Marianne, from North London, said: I was searching for a Maltese puppy and was offered one from a top breeder who won the breeds category at Crufts every year.
When I got her as a puppy, little did I know Lills had ideas about making me fit round her vanity and self-promotional needs.
Although the posts are tongue-in-cheek, Lilliput has had hours of careful training.
She can sit, down, stay, come, high-5, gimme-10, raise a paw and kick a ball. She has perfected her head-over-the-shoulder modelling look and can count to 10 in woofs.
Lilliput holds poses to have her picture taken and works happily with humans she doesnt know. Marianne says: Her followers increased when people began to appreciate its all a social media commentary spoof. Lilliput would say her posts are random  moments in her perfect glamorous life which she just happened to capture off the cuff. The reality is she puts in more effort than the Beckhams and Kardashians combined.
Lilliputs followers are mainly women of all ages and are known as Lilliputians. They are mostly American but she also has fans in the UK, Europe, Australia and Singapore.
Marianne says: Most followers understand the humour and enjoy laughing at the parody.
Behind every manufactured moment are hours of filtering, airbrushing, cropping and bribing with fish treats to set unrealistic standards of cuteness for her followers in the artificial world of social media.

The beginning of a new era
Sri Lanka will hope to begin a new era in their cricket history when they open the New Year 2018 with a match against Zimbabwe in the one-day tri-nation series in Dhaka, Bangladesh today. A new coach Chandika Hathurusingha and the reinstalling of Angelo Mathews as the captain of the one-day game in both formats One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals has renewed hopes of a better tomorrow for the Sri Lankan cricket team and its players who have had a rough ride in 2017  a year they would want to forget in a hurry.
Every team goes through a lean period and Sri Lanka should put back 2017 as a bad dream and look to the future, think positive and relive the precious little moments they had in the past year like beating India in the Champions trophy, the 3-0 whitewash of Australia in the Tests, the 2-0 Test win over Pakistan in the UAE - subjecting the opponents to their first series loss in that country which they have made their temporary home venue and, the shock defeat of India in the first ODI at Dharamsala.
A lot would depend on how Sri Lanka commences their campaign in the Bangladesh tri-series. If they can emerge champions it would be a great shot in the arm for the new coach as well as the team to attain greater heights. Its not that Sri Lanka are starved of talent but they were like a ship without a rudder when Graham Ford left them in May soon after the Champions trophy. They were tossed up and down on rough seas without any sense of direction until Sri Lanka Cricket eventually found a captain to steer the team into calmer waters by signing up Hathurusingha.
Hathu Aiyya as players prefer to call him can bring about a calming influence on the team with his no-nonsense approach. Mathews admitted the other day soon after being re-appointed captain that what made him undertake the Sri Lanka captaincy again was the influence of Hathurusingha.
When I stepped down, I thought that I will never take it up again. The SLC president, head coach and the selectors wanted me to reconsider my decision. I thought about it and there are few reasons for me to take it again, said Mathews. We need to have stability leading up to the 2019 World Cup which is less than 18 months away. This is an hour of need and if I don't take it up now, I will feel bad in a few months time,"
Mathews graduated to international cricket in 2009 after some impressive performances with the Sri Lanka 'A' team where Hathurusingha was the coach.
"I have known Hathu Aiyya for a long time. I know how he operates. He is not here to survive. It is very easy to work with him as he has his goals. He played a major part in me making this decision to take up the captaincy again. We have worked a lot together. He was the coach when I was playing in the Sri Lanka A team and shadow coach when I entered international cricket," Mathews said.
Hathurusinghas arrival at a time when the team was looking for someone to guide them is almost as similar to when Dav Whatmore took over the Sri Lanka side in 1995. At the time the team was overflowing with talent but lacked the direction. Whatmore provided that and turned an ordinary side into a team of world beaters by winning the World Cup a year later.
Hathurusingha does not have that kind of talent at his disposal but a group of young and talented cricketers who are prepared to learn from him and are hungry for success that has been denied them in the past year.
The success of any team is the consistency with which you keep winning and that is what this present Sri Lanka side lacks and needs to achieve. By bringing back Mathews as captain for the one-day side and leaving Dinesh Chandimal to handle the Test team the selectors have made the right decision as there is no one as good as these two cricketers to lead the team from the front. Chandimal has already done so on a few occasions during his tenure as captain - prepared to show the rest of his team members that the captain means business. Mathews is a past master of it having led his country to some memorable victories during his first stint as captain - the stand out ones being Sri Lankas maiden Test series triumph in England in 2014 and the 3-0 whitewash of Australia when they were ranked the number one Test side in the world in 2016.
As for Hathurusingha the entire nation is looking upto him to deliver. He can do that only if he is allowed to take decisions that he thinks is best for the team without any outside influence or interference. On the surface it looks as if Sri Lanka Cricket has learnt from its past mistakes if the statement made by its president Thilanga Sumathipala at a recent press conference is to be treated as one of integrity.
"Mr. Hathurusingha had lengthy discussions with us, and we found that if we are to demand a high quality of performance, we have to give him 100% backing. Our thinking is to give the coach that muscle. If you expect one of the top coaches to come and help us out, we must give him the backing," the SLC president said.
It seems SLC has reached a crossroad where the success of the coach and the team is imperative for their own survival and for another term in office.

On January 11, they also issued a gazette allowing retail shops selling liquor to be open from 8am - 10pm.
Both these moves were criticized by the President over the weekend and he requested that the Finance Ministry withdraw their previous gazettes.

In this connection, attention is drawn to the statement issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on January 11, 2018.
The last paragraph therein indicates that a forensic audit would be conducted. The audit will focus on government securities and EPF operations during the period 2008-2014.
This would be conducted by an external party. It is not appropriate to make any statement in this regard prior to the conclusion of the forensic audit, the Central Bank said.

CEB unions protest against revoking of allowance
The Ceylon Electricity Board Joint Trade Union will launch a protest opposite the CEB headquarters today.
This is to protest against the Power and Energy Ministry decision to revoke the allowance paid to the clerical and other staff and the preferential treatment given to technical staff.
Speaking to the Daily News, CEB National Worker's Association Secretary Ajith Devapriya said the engineers are manipulating the authorities and fulfilling their needs while the other staff and clerical staff are being deprived of their dues and penalized unfairly.
Last year we signed an agreement 12/1 with the Labour Commission and CEB officials including the General Manager. Although we had launched a strike, after five days we abandoned the strike having come to an agreement with the authorities. During these negotiations they agreed to add 13 percent of the salary to the basic salary of the technical staff, 8 percent for other technical grades and only 10 percent for the clerical and other allied service staff. However, in spite of the lesser increment, the clerical and allied services increment of 10 percent was added as an allowance and not added to the basic salary. Only the technical staff had the 13 percent increment added to their basic salary, he explained.
However, in January 2018, a letter had been sent to the CEB general manager signed by an Additional secretary of the Power and Energy Ministry, named Kumarihamy, cancelling the 10 percent allowance that was being paid to the clerical and other allied services staff. This is a deliberate act of discrimination. By only paying the technical services employees and cancelling our allowance payment, these authorities are trying to create friction between the unions and the staff grades. We conducted a very successful protest campaign earlier and this is an attempt to break that alliance and divide us, he said.
According to Devapriya the CEB and the Ministry is being manipulated by the engineers who are running a mafia. They are manipulating the officials and somehow getting their demands fulfilled while depriving the others of their payments. For the 5  days that we were on strike, the engineers had been paid extra and while their salaries alone are over Rs 100,000 they were also paid an additional Rs.100,000 just for the five days. But, they did nothing extra and as such why should they be paid extra This is blatant injustice towards the other CEB staff. The engineers are being paid bonuses and other allowances, while the rest of us get nothing, he lamented.
Therefore, Devapriya said they would all surround the CEB Headquarters and launch a protest demanding for their rights which had been deprived to them unfairly be restored.

Central Expressway will create vibrant economy- PM
The Central Expressway which will connect two airports, two ports, industrial zones, tourism zones and main cities, will create a new economy in the country, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, undertaking an inspection tour of the work being done on the Central Expressway.
The Prime Minister conducted his tour at the Kurunegala-Gattuwana and Meerigama-Galdeniya sections of the Expressway under construction.
This Expressway will help this region as well as the country. Through it, the number of tourists visiting Kandy will increase and at the same time we will see many developments from Kandy to Kadawatha, Kadawatha to Colombo and thereafter to Hambantota, he said further.
The Expressway from Colombo to Kandy is being constructed, Kandy city will be developed, former Bogambara prison will be turned into a cultural and tourism centre and we are also looking for land to create another industrial zone in Kandy, the Prime Minister said.
In Mawathagama too we will build an industrial zone, and we have already found the land for that. Ingiriya, Iranawila too will have tourism and industrial zones, the Prime Minister added.
The Central Expressway, he said was started in 2015 to improve the infrastructure in the region.
This is the third road from Colombo to Kandy. During the time of our kings, people used the road from Colombo to Ruwanwella, and then to Kandy via Balana. But today, we use the road built by the British. This Expressway is being built on the road used by our ancestors. This road will not end in Colombo. The government has planned to extend it up to Hambantota, where you have an airport, port and soon industrial zone, the Prime Minister added.
The second phase of this construction would be undertaken by a Sri Lankan company. This is the first time that an Expressway contract has been granted to a local company. Thus far it was only foreign companies from Japan or China undertaking such construction,the Prime Minister said.
But here we have 16 local companies come together, and split the work into four groups to undertake the construction. So we believe that they have the capability to undertake this project and hope that this company in future will also be able to bring in foreign exchange into the country, through construction projects abroad, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Expressway will allow commuters to travel from Colombo to Kandy in one and a half hours.

## Title: Challenges in SLs accession to Mine Ban Treaty
## Supertitle: Landmine Free 2025:

Landmine Free 2025:
Challenges in SLs accession to Mine Ban Treaty
On December 13, 2017, Sri Lanka acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and Their Destruction (also referred to as the Mine Ban Treaty or MBT) becoming its 163rd State Party. Heralding the revival of Sri Lankas role as a champion of humanitarian disarmament, this step was taken by the Government of Sri Lanka under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, towards which The Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) carried out advocacy for many years.
Mine Ban Treaty
The MBT also known as the Ottawa Convention was adopted on December 3, 1997 and came into force in 1999. The purpose of the MBT is to end the suffering and casualties caused by anti-personnel mines through four core aims. The aims are, the universal acceptance of a ban on anti-personnel mines, destruction of stockpiles of anti-personnel mines, clearance of mined areas and assistance to mine victims.
The year 2017 marked the 20th anniversary of the MBT. At the 16th Meeting of the State Parties of the MBT held in Vienna, Austria, from December 18-21, 2017, Sri Lankas decision to accede to the treaty was welcomed by the international humanitarian disarmament community as a fitting birthday gift for the Treaty. The progressive decision by Sri Lanka was commended by the special envoys of the MBT, Princess Astrid of Belgium and Prince Mired of Jordan.
The 34 remaining states that have not acceded to the MBT, including India, Pakistan and Nepal from the South Asian region, were called upon to follow the example of Sri Lanka. In the wake of Sri Lankas accession, Palestine also joined the treaty on December 29, 2017.
1997 Nobel Peace Prize
The MBT is considered as a pioneer disarmament treaty in putting humanitarian concerns above all others. The Nobel Peace Prize for 1997 was awarded jointly to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and its Coordinator Jody Williams for their work in banning and clearing of anti- personnel mines. The ICBL was foremost in mobilizing civil society in order to adopt the MBT. This recognition highlights the success of the MBT in reducing the use of anti-personnel mines, preventing landmine casualties and drawing attention to the plight of landmine survivors.
An inhumane weapon
Anti-personnel mines are considered inhumane because they are victim-activated and therefore indiscriminate. These mines affect anyone who steps on them without distinguishing whether it is a combatant or a civilian. The end result is that innocent children, women and even animals become victims. Furthermore, these mines can cause severe injuries which may lead to death or disability for life in addition to psychological trauma leading to dire socioeconomic circumstances.
Anti-personnel mines are a prohibited weapon in International Humanitarian Law (IHL) since they are indiscriminate and cause unnecessary and superfluous injury. International Human Rights Law (IHRL) recognizes the impact of these mines, especially via the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) which details the rights of survivors of mines and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
The provisions of the Child Rights Convention (CRC) prohibits discrimination of children on the ground of disability and emphasizes a childs right to access comprehensive healthcare thus complementing the MBT. Since Sri Lanka is a signatory to all these conventions except the Refugee Convention, its accession to the MBT will enable the consolidation of the stipulations of these conventions for the betterment of landmine survivors. Even though Sri Lanka signed the CRPD on February 8, 2016, it is yet to pass the corresponding domestic legislation.
Challenges and opportunities for Sri Lanka
Mine action is made up of the five pillars of universalization of the treaty, stockpile destruction, victim assistance, mine risk education and advocacy. Sri Lankas existing mine action program includes demining, victim assistance and mine risk education in line with these elements.
Since the end of the 30-year armed conflict in 2009, Sri Lanka has made good progress in terms of demining. There remains only about 25sqkm of land to be demined. However, as pointed out by the Mines Advisory Group, in order to meet its mine action strategy clearance deadline of 2020, Sri Lanka would need US$ 8 million on top of the funding that it had already received, which stands at US$ 4.6 million. The accession to the MBT will be an impetus for funders to take renewed interest in the Sri Lankan demining process.
Fast forwarding the completion of the demining process is important for the resettlement of the persons who used to live in currently mine-affected areas. The push given to the resettlement process by demining will aid reconciliation, with residents being able to resume their normal lifestyles and livelihoods.
According to the Landmine Monitor, there were up to 22,171 reported landmine victims in Sri Lanka as of 2014. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the state is obliged to extend assistance to the victims whose lives will go on long after even the last landmine is pulled from the earth. Child survivors require special assistance since, among other things, they need new prosthetic limbs with each growth spurt and also psychological support for personality development. Women survivors require special attention as they have to cope with societal and economic constraints in addition to the usual impact of being a victim.
Article 20 of the treaty makes allowances for states to withdraw from the treaty given that they can provide good reasons for doing so. Accordingly, there is no need to assume that membership of the MBT will be detrimental to the national security or state sovereignty of Sri Lanka. It is also widely recognized that anti-personnel mines are an outdated weapon which offer no concrete military advantage and therefore are not indispensable.
The next steps
Now that Sri Lanka is a State Party to the MBT, it is essential to ensure that mine action in Sri Lanka is effective. The trajectory from the accession should be used by the state to make Sri Lanka a secure country for its citizens and reinforce the international communitys belief in Sri Lankas commitment towards humanitarian disarmament.The target should be to make Sri Lanka landmine free prior to the 2025 deadline of the global agenda. Only then can all Sri Lankans tread this soil without fear and be content in the knowledge that no one in this island will fall victim to these horrendous prohibited weapons.

Walk denied!
It is a pity to find a good, well-laid out walking track near Madiwela facing the Parliamentary Complex being subject to regular destruction and environmental pollution by certain elements. I refer to the walking track surrounding paddy fields with scenic beauty and tranquillity facing the Parliamentary Complex, passing Battaramulla.
During one of my recent walks I interviewed one of the workers who were attired the normal way but having a yellow-coloured apron and a pair of gloves on (indicating that he is working for a Cleaning Establishment) and what follows are the startling revelations he made: he has been working in the same capacity for the past nine years and that earlier regular checks were made by the Special Task Force (STF) for any type of environmental pollution or destruction by mischief-makers and this stood as a deterrent.
Now there are no checks, he said, so much so that around 10 in the morning when the people end their walks and no occupants of the concrete seats by about 10 in the morning, the mischief-makers comprising young boys and girls start to occupy the seats until about 4.00 p.m. When I posed the question as to who the girls are, appears to be schoolgirls promptly came his reply!
He then invited me behind the concrete seats nearby where I was surprised to see empty mega and mini bottles, pieces of aluminium foils, matchsticks and cigarette butts, besides pieces of paper strewn all over, generally discarded by drug addicts! He appealed to me to expose these happenings not only to the general public but also to the authorities in particular.

Citronella oil industry in crisis
The citronella oil industry in Hamnbantota district that was a big foreign exchange earner is facing a crisis now. A bottle of citronella oil that fetched Rs.7,500 in the recent past now fetches a only Rs.1,500.
Small-scale citronella growers and citronella oil industrialists said that about 700 kilograms of citronella leaves are necessary to distil about eight bottles of citronella oil.
According to a citronella oil distiller at Katuwana, a loan of Rs one lakh was disbursed to women who engage in the citronellas oil industry when a bottle of citronella oil fetched a price of Rs 7,500. These women are now indebted to banks and other lending institutions due to the crisis in the industry.

A clear mindset,  a novel approach
I like to plan everything ahead. I am not much of a procrastinator. I like to have my work done well before time, so I am not stressed out the day before. This has helped me to lead the school students. I have a plan in my head about what is going to go on. I know what happens at what time. Everyone knows what they are doing, said Rajakarier
In the space of just six years from the time he joined AIS, young Tarish Rajakarier, Head Boy of Asian International School, has grown in character and strength while diligently applying himself to the goals he set for himself which has resulted in the mantle of Head Prefect being entrusted to him. Perfect Prefects features Rajakarier who handles the many facets of his leadership role with faith and dedication.
Though not omniscient, Rajakarier delegates tasks to the prefects under him ahead of time while being well informed about all the details.
I like to plan everything ahead. I am not much of a procrastinator. I like to have my work done well before time, so I am not stressed out the day before. This has helped me to lead the school students. I have a plan in my head about what is going to go on. I know what happens at what time. Everyone knows what they are doing, said Rajakarier.
Agree to disagree
Rajakarier feels that you need to have a clear mindset and plan. Leadership becomes a lot easier when you have a clear vision.
I discuss everything with the Head Girl before implementing a decision. We also talk to the student counsellor and the prefects. We wont always agree but sometimes you have to agree to disagree. It is always for the best because each one puts in his or her opinion. That helps us make a better decision, stated Rajakarier
Rajakarier pointed out that a lot of critical thinking comes into play when confronted with a difficulty or obstacle. When something comes up unexpectedly, it is up to you to rise to the occasion.
You need to stay calm and not get flustered or stressed out. You need to think rationally. You need to work through your problems because everything has a solution. You just need to find the solution. As Head Prefects we have the student council and the prefects. We are not alone because we are backed by so many people, said Rajakarier
Rajakarier also added that being unafraid to express his opinion has actually benefited his leadership.
Through difficulties
When something goes wrong there may be a dispute amongst certain parties. The ability to say what you want about an issue you are faced with is a very important part in getting through difficulties, pointed out Rajakarier.
Rajakarier came to AIS six years ago. He arrived at AIS, a mediocre student but rapidly excelled in studies and sports.
When I look over the last six years, every year has been a milestone for me. I achieved something new at AIS and I believe it is because of the culture at AIS. The students are always there to support you. Unity is a big part of AIS. It is a very productive part  your life at AIS. The teachers take the time to know you as a person. Each student has different capabilities and the teachers apply their methods to suit the student. This has really helped me. I was not great in my academics and sports when I joined AIS. But now look where I am. I have come pretty far. I took a leap of faith and joined the swimming team one day. I have been part of the swimming team for about four years now. The same goes for my Tennis, Drama Competitions and House Captaincy, explained Rajakarier.
He mentioned that at AIS you are motivated to do more for the school. His school house is a big part of him and he has always wanted to help his house. At AIS the students work hard for their houses.
Student population
Being approachable to the students at AIS is very important to me. I think what is important when leading a student population is being fair and discerning between right and wrong. I believe in opening channels of communication amongst students and helping them resolve their conflicts with each other. Helping them work through their issues is beneficial to both parties. Helping two parties reconcile is an admirable quality. Being there for the students is important to me. A lot of trouble can be prevented. As a prefect you have a certain level of power and authority. Sometimes you have to exercise that authority and power. Smaller kids look up to you and idolize you. At times you need to be gentle and at times be strict. Again communication is the key here. They need to understand that there will be help for those you ask for it. Talk to your prefects, teachers and parents if there is a problem, explained Rajakarier.
Rajakarier believes there is something good we can take out of every leader. The world identifies with people who have made an impact upon the world.
Everyone knows who Donald Trump is, but I dont agree with anything he is doing. If I was German in Hitlers day and age, I would think that Hitlers views for his country were brilliant. They brought the economy up and they improved their GDP. Those policies were good for the country. It was the same with Napoleon. Everyone did what was best for their country. They do what they think is right even though it may not be right. But I think you need to understand that what you want should be good for the rest of the world as well, argued Rajakarier.
Rajakarier wants to study psychology and genuinely wants to help people out and do his part for society. What he needs to do should benefit society in some way.
You need to take a leap of faith. Try something new. If I did not try something new like joining the swimming team, I would not be where I am now. You need to take a leap of faith sometimes and have a goal and work towards it. Sometimes you just need to go with the flow. Sometimes along the way you need to improvise and change your goals as you go along, added Rajakarier.
Science and religion
Having studied history as a subject, the area that interests him is the March on Washington by Martin Luther King.
I want to be a part of an event that makes an impact on history. Things that are remembered by people. When it comes to reading I like Angels and Demons, because I love how it combines science and religion. I would like to visit the Vatican because religion is a big part of my life, said Rajakarier.

CSR Projects need new vision and accountability
During seasonal times the corporate sector embark on specific corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects in keeping with their annual budgets and corporate vision. The corporate set aside specific sums based on their budgeted profitability and social commitments.
CSR budgets also depend on type of products and services marketed, specific requests by governmental authorities, environmental hazards, natural disasters, public needs and many other factors. Normally, the corporates which deal in consumer goods and services spend larger sums on CSR projects to assist their marketing drives and boost profitability. Some corporates confine their CSR activities to a specific area or a district based on prevailing conditions. On a smaller scale, some others assist charitable organizations.
On a broader sense the CSR activities should include and inherit the following features amongst others and focus mainly on.
Usefulness and benefits to a vast majority of the general public
Assistance to the good governance measures of the state
Projects should be regular with meaningful appraisal and value addition
Achieving value for money spent
Fostering environmental and green effects
Creation of new employment avenues at least for a few
Assistance to local authorities in serving public utility programmes
Reduction of crime rates, fatalities and indisciplinary behaviour of public
Assistance to other corporates and reap benefits of synergy for similar projects
Beefing of law enforcement authorities in the country
Ensuring social and religious harmony
Enhancing of language skills of the general public
Provision of career guidance to school leavers especially in rural areas
Production of short Documentaries on drugs, narcotics, alcohol usage and smoking.
Tourism assistance and promotional measures
Agricultural output enhancement
Fortifying of marketing centres for agricultural produce for price stability and lower cost of living
Assistance to local authorities in garbage collection and disposal
Conducting of regular community development programmes at village level
Holding regular seminars and workshops on above measures among the members of the corporate, community, lions, rotarians and other service organizations.
Unless and until we educate the youth especially in rural areas in our development drives in a meaningful way the crime rates and social unrest will continue to thrive. Our politicians are not engaging in any meaningful programmes to remedy the situation as they are stuffed with various elections from time to time. Every party is interested only in defeating the other parties and come to power and they are least bothered in achieving the priority goals in the development of the country. Therefore, the corporate sector should push for reforms for a civilized, law abiding. Hard working and a punctual population at all age groups. It is the corporate sector that would suffer ultimately by way of enhanced taxes. With effect from April 2018, the government has introduced various measures to augment the proportion of direct taxation collection in comparison to the indirect taxes.
It is highly praiseworthy that a large number of quoted and unquoted companies carry out their annual CSR activities and depict same in their annual reports. If liquidity of these companies fall due to future higher taxes, they may well find it difficult to continue with the ongoing CSR activities. The richest conglomerates have started their own foundations to serve the masses in diverse projects throughout the world in a very methodical and in a well structured manner. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is an iconic example. In Sri Lanka John Keells Foundation and Foundation of Goodness have shown continuity in their activities with set objectives. Ruling governments are unable to address human resource development programmes in a structured manner due to shortage of expertise and committed staff. The void has to be filled by the local private sector. If not for the large number of employment avenues created by the private sector in this country, economic growth of this country may have even reached negative levels causing the economy to collapse long ago.
Regional development of this country has taken a back seat due to the very limited participation of our Private Sector. Main reason for this is the dominance of politicians both at the main stream and at district and village level. They demand protection money, kickbacks, jobs to their supporters from the investors both local as well as foreign. Some even demand percentages of profits achieved. Due to this both local and foreign investors are reluctant to set up ventures, especially in the manufacturing sector as they run the risk of being harassed by the area politicians. The local corporate sector should seek the assistance and continued support in eradicating this menace, from the state and the law enforcement authorities in creating an environment conducive to private sector investments. In the alternative unruly and corrupt politicians will take over the country. It is high time that we appoint a minister for private sector development from the private sector itself, preferably a strong Administrator and Director of the Corporate Sector. Take the unwanted situation that will arise after the proposed local government elections. The existing 4,000 plus members will double to over 8,000. Who will pay for their salaries, perks, luxury vehicles and security. It is the taxes to be collected from the private sector, private individuals and the indirect taxes to be paid by the general public. Will the tax payers get benefitted A big no. So why did they create this situation
Now we come to the specific meaningful development of CSR initiatives. I wish to present the following methodology for the success of meaningful CSR projects to be initiated by the corporate sector.
Our neighbour India has formulated laws where the corporate sector is mandatorily required to spend 2% of PAT (profit after tax) annually on CSR projects. This was brought in by the companies act of 2013. However, amounts spent on CSR activities have declined due to the lower profits achieved, due to contraction of world economy. The TATA Group, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coca Cola and a few others have been engaging in continuous CSR activities on a larger scale during the past few years. TATA group has a number of companies and the TATA Steel alone spent over Rs.171 crore in financial year 2014/15, which is approximately 2% of average net profit for the last three financial years. Key CSR areas were education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, ethnic harmony, sports promotion.
The proposed methodology for Sri Lanka for value added CSR projects for rapid economic growth is enumerated below:
2% of PAT - contribution from the corporate
Amount equivalent to the contribution of the corporate to be put in by the state
Amount equivalent to the contribution of the corporate to be put in by an international donor agency on a grant basis
All three parties are equal stakeholders. The benefits of this scheme will be:
Formation of a large capital base for the project
Good Governance measures
Undertaking of worthwhile projects benefitting a large number
Creation of direct and indirect employment
Accurate information sourcing
Preparation of accurate and timely accounts
Rapid rural poverty alleviation
Improvement of literacy rates in rural areas
Higher contributions from rural areas and provinces for the national GDP levels
Reduction in rural crime rates
Each project will be jointly managed by the corporate, international donor and the Minister for Private Ssector development.
The state can well afford to cut down on funds allocated to provincial councils and local government authorities as bulk of the funds to be spent by them will be spent for unproductive purposes by the nearly 500 Provincial Councilors plus the 8,000 plus Local Government members.
I also propose the selection of only 50 corporate sector companies for the first year based on highest profitability achieved for the financial year ending March 31, 2017 or ended on December 31 2016, as the case may be. Success measurement could be jointly carried out by all three parties during and after the project.
We should now look at the mega type of a CSR activity which will benefit the country and the masses at large. As we all know Sri Lanka had been at the receiving end of a number of natural disasters and Acts of God in the past. Some of them are:
The Tsunami in 1994
2016 floods including a vast area of Colombo
2016 Salawa blast
2017 floods
Droughts from time to time
Orugodawatta garbage dump collapse
The relief measures provided and compensation provided were late and not adequate according to the victims. They talk to the media to draw attention to their plight and sufferings.
The general public is of the view that a new relief agency be created by the state in collaboration with the private sector and through funds generated from the international donors. This agency should invest their funds in safer investments to earn returns for the agency. In a number of years the relief agency will grow up to be a substantial wealth accumulator and will be able to deal with any type of situation in future. All international aid in monetary and non monetary terms should be channeled through this agency with a monthly internal audit carried out by an international firm of auditors based in Sri Lanka and a report be produced for insertion in the agency website. The number of staff and emoluments be minimized so that a greater part of funds be spent in the provision of aid and relief. The agency can employ a substantial number of volunteers for relief assistance and damage assessment on a daily paid basis. This agency can recommend preventive measures and projects to the government so that these measures and projects be completed early. By this way the disasters will be reduced and will result in lower casualities, business losses and the costs to be incurred. This agency will have credibility in the eyes of international donors and relief providers and the general public as well. An annual report containing the audited accounts and the details of projects attended to and the beneficiaries. Both Electronic and Print Media will also highlight the success of the projects undertaken and relief provided. The board of governors need be appointed by the three promoters, namely, the Private Sector, State and the International donors. This will be an ideal type of a mega CSR initiative which would serve the masses for a very long period of time and will fill in the role of a disaster relief bank.
Another important aspect of disaster management is to create the awareness on the part of the masses and the preparedness. A good example of this is the state backed Tsunami alert programme which is held from time to time. However, a smaller number of public engage in environmental pollution and environmental damage knowingly and unknowingly, triggering many natural disasters. At times the Police are unable to stop this due to political interferences.
CSR activities
CSR activities for corporate and others could arise from their immediate surroundings. A vastly neglected aspect is the Traffic Mmanagement and the safety measures in force for the public by the state. A good example is the non functioning of traffic signal lights at crucial points of the city. A good prevailing example is the non functioning of Traffic Signal Lights from Galle Face Hotel junction upto the Crescat Boulevard. There are three Pedestrian Crossings with Traffic Signal Lights covering the above two points. The Galle Face Hotel Junction Traffic Signal Lights are out of action for a considerable period of time. The other two are not functioning from time to time. The pedestrians who want to cross to the other side of the road are at the mercy of the speeding motorists. There are times that all three Traffic Lights are not functioning. The users are the school children at St. Thomas Prep, hotel guests, office and bank staff, visitors to the Diplomatic Missions, visitors to Galle Face Green and bus passengers. There are many hotels, banks, restaurants, apartments, offices in the immeadiate vicinity. On rainy days, peak hours and especially in the night the crossing are not at all safe. The corporates, hotels and the banks in the area can easily put an end to this by effective co-ordination with the relevant authorities to ensure all three Traffic Signal Lights are working at all times. They can appoint a joint committee to monitor the task. This will give rise to a new concept on CSR initiatives by the launch of CSR At Your Doorstep . This type of initiatives will draw immediate public appreciation and applause. This will be a very fruitful exercise at a very minimal cost benefitting a large number of citizens on a daily basis. Similarly, the monitoring of Traffic Signal Lights at other points of the Colombo City and in the towns of Western Province is also a very worthwhile CSR Project benefitting the masses and will reduce the accidents at road crossings to a very minimal level. The costs involved are minimal, perhaps a few telephone calls to the authorities a month, a few hoardings and time recovery costs for supervision. What is required is the commitment to make the project successful on a continuous basis. We Sri Lankans have the habit of starting projects with controls and loosening the grip on controls after some time. An awareness campaign for all motorists especially the state run and private buses coming to the city and leaving on a daily basis be also initiated through Media and service organizations like lions, rotarians and others to draw more participants to the success of this scheme.
With more and more vehicles coming to the streets of Colombo this project will ensure public safety and may well result in an increase in National Productivity Levels by getting down to the bottom of the problems faced by motorists, pedestrians, school children, office staff and visitors to Colombo on a daily basis.
The State and the Private Sector should form a Public Private Partnership in carrying out the CSR activities in a more development oriented manner with the aim of poverty alleviation and upliftment of the living standards of the public. Our Private Sector should take a leaf out of the CSR initiatives of our neighbour India in formulating new strategies for carrying out CSR activities from the year 2018 onwards. The Private Sector is more capable of designing large scale CSR projects and accomplishment of tasks with rigid supervision. The hard earned profits of the corporate sector should be ventured into long lasting and meaningful projects so that no funds will be spent on the same project later for rectifications and damages or defective work.
The beneficiaries should always endeavour to maintain and safeguard the quality of all CSR projects carried out by the corporate sector as funds are scarce for any repeat work or maintenance. The beneficiaries should form vigilant committees in supervising the successful functioning of the project. They should also carry out Shramadana Campaigns to add value to already completed CSR Projects of the Corporate Sector, so that the same corporate entity will channel more funds for new projects in the same area in an appreciative manner. This is a Win Win situation for both parties. The government is needed to provide more incentives and inducements for the corporate sector to carry out more CSR Projects.

De Grandhomme seals Black Caps win over Pakistan
Hamilton, Tuesday: Big-hitting Colin de Grandhomme blasted New Zealand to a five-wicket win over Pakistan in the fourth one-day international in Hamilton on Tuesday.
De Grandhomme bludgeoned the Pakistan attack with an unbeaten 74 off 40 balls to reinvigorate New Zealands run chase as the hosts were struggling to reach a 263-run target.
Everything just seemed to be hitting the middle tonight, said de Grandhomme, whose innings included five sixes and seven fours.
The result puts New Zealand up 4-0 in the five-match series and sets a new record for the Black Caps of 11 consecutive international victories.
The streak includes convincing wins over the West Indies in all formats of the game and keeps alive the prospects of an ODI series whitewash against Pakistan in Wellington on Friday.
However, it was a much improved performance from Pakistan, who were skittled for just 74 in their previous outing.
They looked set for another heavy defeat after a horror start saw them at 11 for two but Mohammad Hafeez notched 81 to set a competitive target. Others in the mis-firing Pakistani batting line-up also found form, with Fakhar Zaman, Haris Sohail and captain Sarfraz Ahmed all posting half centuries.
Teenage leg-spinner Shadab Khan then claimed three of New Zealands top four batsmen to give Pakistan some hope before de Grandhommes match-turning performance.
Pakistan opted to bat first after winning the toss, promoting hard-hitting allrounder Faheem Ashraf to open in the search for runs.
The gamble backfired when Faheem departed for one and Babar Azam soon followed after a dynamic spell from Black Caps paceman Tim Southee.

Doorsteps of  inspiration
Temples played an important role in the Indian society. These temples were built not only for religious worship but also they were considered as community development centres. The construction of temples of each religion has its own architecture and resembles its own culture, customs, regional and religious influences of different periods.
Besides, the construction pattern of religious temples of each region provided ample evidence of each rulers taste with their involvement in art, culture and religion. According to their involvement in the culture and tradition, they built temples throughout India.
Religious values
Inside the temple courtyard, various religious, cultural and ritual activities were carried out. These activities were directly involved with the moral and spiritual uplift of the people. For these purposes, certain halls were built to hold the kathapira sangaas (sermons). These kathapiara sangaas imparted the religious values and ethics. Similarly, to protect and promote the dance through religious worship, dance halls were built in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala and Manipur.
They were called differently in different regions, such as Nat Mandapa, Natana Salai, Sadir Salai, Nanaveetha Natana Salai, Natya Mandapam, Nirtha Mandapam and Koothampalam. Koothampalam was the oldest model drama based dance hall inside the temple. This is one of the oldest Sanskrit temple drama theatres. (During those times dance and drama were considered as one art form).
The Chakayer were the performers of this art. The performance of the Chakayer was called Chakayikoothu which was an ancient orthodox form of entertainment. Chakayikoothu was an individual (solo) performance, but a group performance of Chakayer and Nangyaramma (female member of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste) was called Koodiyattam. But the Koodiyattam and Chakayerkoothu were performed only at Koothampalam which directly faced the chief presiding deity of the temple.
Spiritual arts
The present Kathakali originated directly from the temple culture, but it evolved out of certain temple arts.
Earlier Kathakali troupes were maintained by the temples to perform during the temple festivals. Beautiful large and small pillars support the top roof. The ground base was filled with earth and rubble and covered with cow dung. Adjoining Koothampalam, a dressing room, was built for the convenience of the artistes.
This was called Niepathya. The Niepathya floor was always lower than the Koothampalam floor. The roof of the Koothampalam was carved with various godsand goddesses figures. According to Bharatha Muni in the Natya Sasthra, various gods were carved in the halls to protect the hall from evil effects.
Koothampalam theatre looked very dull and dim to bring out the real effect of the performances inside the hall. Even while building the hall the chief architect (Sathapi), the master builder took various precautions to prevent the echo on scientific bases to control the vibration of the sound. Small windows were kept to prevent the effect of the crosswind. Koothampalam was a permanent theatre built inside the temples.
Decorated with leaves
In Manipuri, several Rasa Lila dances took place as a form of worship. Each temple had its own dance hall called Nat Mandapa. Even today Nat Mandapas are decorated with leaves, colourful flowers and white cloth. It is a large mandapam which can accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 people. In Orissa Maharis held their dance at Nat Mandapa. There is a reference that at the sun god temple in Konarak dances took place. The temple was built during the 13th century with Nat Mandapa.
The Nat Mandapa was fully and thoroughly decorated with beautifully carved dancing figures. Now it provides an opportunity for dance researchers, art lovers and foreign tourists to enjoy the ancient Indian architecture. The structure of Konarak temple resembles the sun gods chariot driven by seven horses. The Maharis were allowed to perform not only inside the Nat Mandapa but also they were allowed to enter the inner temple under certain circumstances.
In Tamil Nadu, dance halls were built to promote dance and drama inside the temple premises. These dance halls were very well administered and maintained by the temple authorities.Numerous inscriptions contain a wealth of information regarding the dance halls in temples. For instance, Naanaavitha Natana Salai was established in Thiruvadu Thurai Temple. A Nirtha Mandapam was built in Kachi Ekamparanatha Temple in the 15th century A.D. During the reign of the Raja Raja Chola, the ninth year of his rule, a Sadir Salai was installed to promote the art. The Great Chola emperor Raja Raja Cholan who built the Thanchai Bragatheeswara Temple also built a Naanaavitha Natana Salai to promote the art and culture during his reign.
The Nat Mandapa was fully and thoroughly decorated with beautifully carved dancing figures. Now it provides an opportunity for dance researchers, art lovers and foreign tourists to enjoy the ancient Indian architecture.

A Kele-Pattara titled, Premier Stakes:
Dudley subject to slander
Readers generally prefer to share anecdotes on political leaders of yesteryear than listening to sermons by some disgruntled current politicians. Let me share with them a true incident that took place during Dudley Senanayakes first premiership 66 years ago in 1952, involving him and his contemporary and successor, Sir John Kotalawala.
The former is quite well known for his Statesmanship and great qualities even by todays younger generations. In fact, they should read more and more about the two Senanayakes, the father DS and son Dudley. The grand old man, the father of the nation was ailing from undisclosed complications during the latter part of 1951. SWRD Bandaranaike, the Leader of the House and second in command of United National Party has left the party and government over personal and policy matters to form his own political movement styled Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Sir John who held the number three position in hierarchy moved up to second in command of the UNP and Government.
In the end of January 1952, the Prime Ministers health condition declined further. He was diabetic and his heart had been weakened needing hospitalization. The medical team treating DS warned the relatives and his close friends, that he has only a few months to live. His close circle that included the Governor-General decided to make an indirect inquiry about his successor; the Governor volunteered to bell-the-cat. He spoke to DS and skillfully hinted on the topic. From his sick bed, DS said,
Lionel (Sir John, the second in command) cant win elections; Dudley can, but he is my son, so I do not wish to talk anymore.
Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake was then 67 years of age while his son, Dudley, the Minister of Agriculture and the youngest member of the Cabinet was only 41.
A month later he was out of the hospital, and on March 20th morning, as usual, he was taking a ride. The PM suffered a stroke lost control and fell off police mare Chitra. He was riding with IGP Richard Aluvihare on the Galle Face Green. Don Stephan Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of independent Ceylon, who was born on October 20, 1884, at Botale, a village in Halpitigam Korale, passed away on March 22, 1952, a couple of hours before brain specialist, Sir Hugh Cairns was due to take off at Abington to fly to his bedside. The flight was cancelled.
Shortly after DS Senanayakes death, unfolding the devious conniving Sir John was knocked-out from the ring, and Dudley was sworn in to succeed his father.
A slanderous document labelled Premier Stakes was in circulation in the echelons of power immediately after the new Prime Minister, Dudley formed his government in March 1952.
The beginning of the enmity
The Governor-Generals decision to call upon Dudley to take oaths as new PM, raised many eyebrows. This bombshell by Lord Soulbury created an uproar in the governing circles and the UNP. Some suspected it was a conspiracy to deprive the next-in-command Sir John, the premiership. Sir John, a desperate man made several frantic moves to persuade Dudley not to accept it, but the pressure exerted by relatives and senior colleagues including JR Jayewardene was too heavy.
The anonymous kele-pattaraya, Premier Stakes was subsequently leaked out. The responsible national newspapers refrained from publishing it as it contained derogatory and defamatory remarks on a few of top leaders, including Dudley. Adding to the chaos, the LSSPs Tribune, an English tabloid, printed the full script in parts. Sir John being a member of Dudleys new Cabinet, avoided participating in the storm, and he flew to Canada on official businesses.
Dudley loyalists pressed for disciplinary action against Sir John, for it became obvious that he was behind this secret move, though they lacked substantial evidence as proof. The PM was halfheartedly compelled to remove his erstwhile pal from the Cabinet; a letter detailing circumstances was delivered to Kotalawala in Ottawa through Sri Lankas High Commissioner.
An annoyed Sir John, true to himself, crushed the document in the presence of the HC and retorted, I say, tell your Prime Minister that his letter found the place it deserves and threw it into the waste bin and did not even bother to reply.
Sir John later on his return met Dudley and they patched-up, the matter was amicably resolved. Then it was revealed that Sir John hired a scribe to ghostwrite The Premier Stakes and arranged for its distribution himself.
Dudley dissolved Parliament seeking a fresh mandate from people and won comfortably. He became PM for the second time which tenure lasted little over a year when he volunteered to resign handing over the reins to Sir John.
Attygalle murder a century ago
The long-standing hostility between three families, which fashioned the upper layer of the UNP hierarchy, and politics of the island for over five decades, could be attributed to Mudaliyar D C G Attygalles enormous fortune of plantations (over 10,000 acres of coconut and rubber), graphite mines and his three daughters. Each of them was given in marriage with dowries of thousands of acres and shares in Graphite. The Eldest, Ellen to F R Senanayake (Dudley uncle), Alice to John Kothalawala Snr. (Sir Johns father), and Lena to T G Jayewardene (JRs uncle). Kotalawala received 1000 acres less than the other two.
Francis Attygalle, the only brother of Alice, Ellen and Lena was managing the properties; he was the heir apparent to the remaining wealth that included all the mines. The enmity started with the murder of Francis. With his murder, the family fortunes went to the three sisters. -Kumari Jayewardene-2007; Nobodies to Somebodies- pp:194/288
The Senanayakes endeavoured to bring the murder culprits to book, which finally led to John Kotalawala Snr. (Sir Johns father) being indicted for allegedly planning for the murder of his brother-in-law. Kotalawala Snr, a former police officer hired two men, one a former subordinate in the department, to carry out the meticulously planned murder. John committed suicide in jail during the trial, to be precise on the day one of the accomplices confessed.
Close connections of Kotalawalas, Senanayakes, and Jayewardenes through inter-marriages added to the unfortunate predicament of their politics and personal relations that lasted for generations.
In 1965 when Dudley became Prime Minister for the fourth time, Sir John who had been eyeing the position of Governor-General returned to the island and met Dudley: but Dudley didnt oblige and that hit the last nail in the coffin.
Its no secret that Kothalawalas and Jayewardenes had an axe to grind with Senanayakes.

Elect best candidates devoid of corruption - PAFFREL Executive Director
The people have to go to the polling center at the local government election and elect the best candidates devoid of corruption in order to convey the message to the political parties that they cannot win elections with the corrupted politicians, said People's Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi yesterday.
He said that this is a test case and all the voters have to vote at this election and to elect the best candidates to serve their own ward. He made these observations yesterday during a press conference organized by the March 12 Movement held at the CSR, Maradana.
He said that however the people's right to select their own candidate has been deprived from them as the political parties select them.
He added it has to be changed saying although all the parties speak of the clean politics, all have so far failed to submit the criteria that they should have to select the candidates.
Samadani Kiriwandeniya of Sanasa Development Bank speaking at the press conference said that when she spoke to people in Jaffna, Kottawa etc, it seemed that there would be a draw back in the numbers that would go to the polling centre at the local government election. She said that but more people should go to the polling centre this election than the presidential election since this is the one that would elect the politicians that would work directly to the ward itself. She said that this election should be the one that would elect members to protect the environment in the ward, select the best development project to the ward, select projects that would prevent women going abroad for employment and electing capable female representatives rather than those male representatives who would only attend on passing tenders.
Manjula Gajanayake from Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV), Athauda Seneviratne from Organization of Professional Association, Shashee de Mel from Transparency International and Pradeepa from Mothers and Daughters of Lanka also expressed their views at the occasion.

The Election Commission, acting on a complaint it received has written to the University authorities to stop the discussion on the basis that it is likely to benefit certain parties and disadvantageous to others at the upcoming Local Government polls.
The discussion on a new Constitution, organized by the Thamil Makkal Peravai (Tamil Peoples Forum), a civil organisation backed by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran, was to be held yesterday with the participation of the Chief Minister and Jaffna University lecturers.

Elections and media
A gazette extraordinary is to be published setting out a list of 32 guidelines to be followed by the print and electronic media for the duration of the local government elections, according to a report we carried yesterday. The guidelines contain strict instructions to be followed by media institutions in the coverage of news, political events and discourses, with emphasis on neutrality and balanced reportage.
The guidelines direct that every media institution should provide accurate, balanced and impartial information in the broadcasting or televising their news bulletins and any other programme relating to political matters. The neutrality and impartiality of the media would be monitored regularly by the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives of Elections Complaints and the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives on Media Guidelines.
The media guidelines, of course, have been formulated by the Elections Commission to guarantee a free and fair election and will be operative at all future elections. It is hoped that Chairman of the Commission Mahinda Deshapriya, known for his no nonsense attitude, would implement these guidelines to the letter, and, put to an end, once and for all, the blatant abuse of the media by the governments of the day, during elections. We have no doubt that the intrepid Commissioner, who had proved his mettle during the most trying times of the last presidential election, will live up to his reputation and rein in, not only the state media, but also the private media, particularly the all pervasive electronic media, whose owners have now overstepped their bounds and taken for granted the unbridled freedom of expression they now enjoy under the Yahapalanaya government.
The monitoring panel, hopefully, will be composed of those who are adept at detecting the various tricks and deft manipulations in the repertoire of certain private electronic media to circumvent the guidelines in promoting leaders of political parties who are their benefactors. There is one television station which is adept at doctoring crowd attendance at rallies addressed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. An expert eye would detect how the crowds are exaggerated by recourse to technical means. This, naturally, gives an indication to the voting public- at least to the uninitiated -as to which way the wind is blowing, placing other parties at a distinct disadvantage. Hence this aspect too should engage the attention of the Monitors so as to create a level playing field.
There are also TV channels which give their own interpretation on men and matters. This is observed mostly in the case of a TV presenter, hosting a morning programme to convey news items in the daily newspapers. This worthy, practically after each item is readout, offers his own views, often in sarcastic tones, in a way that places the government and government politicians in poor light. The Rajapaksas and stalwarts of the Joint Opposition are practically left alone, but given full play when launching scathing attacks on government leaders. This, needless to state, is unacceptable conduct, during an election and the Commissioner, it is presumed, will look into the whole gamut of news coverage during this crucial period.
The guidelines pertaining to the issuance of opinion polls have been dealt with adequately, one would feel, leaving no room for ambiguity. It states; any electronic media which broadcasts, or, print media that publishes the result of an opinion poll, shall announce, or, publish the name of the organisation which conducted such a poll, the organisation, or, person commissioned and funded such a poll, methodology employed, the size of the sample, margin of error, and the period of fieldwork.
In the recent elections, opinion polls formed one of the biggest distortions and swindles perpetrated on the voters. We saw this during the last presidential election when two leading universities published contrasting opinion polls based on the candidate each university favoured, calling into question the whole exercise, together with the integrity of the professors and academics who conducted such opinion polls. True, opinion polls had been there even in the past and one recalls newspapers supportive of both the UNP and SLFP come out with their own results during the 1977 general election campaign. However, today, with the advent of television, and, the great store laid on opinion polls to gauge the swing in elections in the western countries, this mode of gauging the voters pulse has come to be taken seriously by the public, at least the more sophisticated segments in society. But, as seen in the last US presidential election Donald Trump defied the opinion polls that was heavily stacked in favour of Hillary Clinton and prevailed at the election.
Of course, one could say that all the media and pollsters were Clinton backers and their bias showed in their conclusions. Here, in Sri Lanka too, it could be said that the voters dont always go by opinion polls, if the result of past elections are anything to go by. However, the move by the Commission to keep a check on wild predictions based on opinion polls should be welcomed, given the tendency of crafty politician to prey on the ignorance of some of our voters.

Facial yoga makes women look younger
A fascinating new study has found that facial yoga can make a woman look much younger.
The study suggests puckering the lips and sucking in the cheeks just might be the most age-defying movements, according to a report by the Daily mail.
In a study conducted on women who look 50, are now thought to have the appearance of women two years younger. This is all thanks to performing the facial movements for 20 weeks.
Researchers believe this effect is due to the exercises increasing the size of muscles in the face. Facial attractiveness and youth are associated with a smooth, full facial contour, so even a modest improvement of facial contour is a win for patients, lead author Dr Murad Alam from Northwestern University, told the Daily Mail.
Alam said this type of workout is non-invasive, non-toxic and can be done from anywhere.
The findings were originally published in the journal JAMA Dermatology.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, January 17, 2018 - 01:00
First step of reconciliation
The preceding week, from January 8 to 14, turned out to be a resourceful one for the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry. The objective was promoting reconciliation among different ethnicities and religious groups. How far these objectives will materialise, we are yet to witness.
Sri Lanka underwent a three-decade-long civil war coupled with disharmony and disunity among different communities. The move of the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, we fervently believe, is timely especially in creating a conducive environment for the coexistence of different communities. The unity in diversity is the universal term which integrates the different communities with different cultures and beliefs as one nation at the time of their countrys diversity. People in the past failed to make national reconciliation among the communities in Sri Lanka that paved the way for several conflicts and bitter and unpleasant incidents in the country.
Peace-building programme
Unlike its previous clan, Sri Lankas new generation has nurtured a positive attitude towards ethnic harmony. They are more focused on leading a peaceful and prosperous life. In the aftermath of war, the UNDP initiated a peace-building programme in collaboration with the Education Ministry. The real reconciliation began at this juncture.
The theme of the programme was Community for Peace. I had the privilege to work with the UN officials as the coordinator for Puttalam district. They selected the terror-ridden districts of Jaffna and Mannar from the Northern Province and Trincomalee from the Eastern Province.
These districts were merged with Puttalam district. In every district, five schools were selected for the programme through the assistance of zonal directors of respective districts. Then they arranged cricket matches among the students within the district and made them familiarise with each other. The students made exchange visits to each district.
Different communities
During the visits, the Sinhalese students secured a rare opportunity to mingle with Tamils and Muslims and vice versa. They played cricket matches and witnessed many cultural shows to understand the culture and tradition of particular community. Students exchanged their addresses and they are still maintaining the friendship.
Some teachers and parents, who accompanied the students, had an opportunity with their counterparts. To my knowledge, this is the real reconciliation among different communities to grab the first-hand experience by physically and practically visiting them.
Likewise, the ministry can also arrange some programmes to assemble the different communities at one point in order to make real reconciliation in the country. This is a good idea to arrange special assemblies in schools across the country to stress the importance of national integration and reconciliation. The duty of every principal and teacher is giving a clear picture about this week in every classroom. It helps treat their fellow countrymen as children of one mother. It is also significant to arrange peaceful meetings among religious leaders to create cordial and smooth function of the society.
The womens associations can also play a pivotal role in promoting integration and reconciliation. Above all, we should eradicate the discriminatory mentality secluding people by their caste and creed. To make real reconciliation, every Sri Lankan should make a change in their mind that we all are Sri Lankans. Yet we still believe in different faiths. There are countries like Singapore, Malaysia where different communities live together without major issues. Their unity in diversity really brought them to the higher stage in the social, economic and political aspects.
Moreover, to establish everlasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka we should learn each others language. The language has also been considered one of the influential factors in reconciliation process because the misunderstanding formed through lack of understanding.
The great leader from South Africa, Nelson Mandela, said: If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart. Thus without language, one cannot talk to people and understand them. One cannot share their hopes and aspirations and grasp their history. Other factors such as compromising or give and take policy, flexibility, empathy and pluralism will also confirm stable reconciliation in the country. Hence let us all determine ourselves to work hard to propel the reconciliation process efficiently and effectively to create better Sri Lanka.

Gammanpila faked power of attorney
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday informed Colombo High Court that he or his company had never given a power of attorney to Gammanpila to carry out a share transaction.
Shaddick was yesterday present before Colombo High Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa in connection with an indictment filed against Udaya Gammanpila and another accused for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000.
Witness Shaddick said that he never signed a document executing the power of attorney to Gammanpila and therefore his signature had been fraudulently used as an authentic one in order to carry out this transaction.
In reply to a question raised by defence counsel Shavindra Fernando, Shaddick affirmed that the document presented to him by the defence was a fake one and further said his signature had been fraudulently used on it.
Shaddick is to be further cross-examined today (17) as well.
Two accused Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe are currently out on bail.

The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick.
The AG has listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.

The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) has decided to field Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as its Presidential candidate at the next Presidential Election, Polonnaruwa District Parliamentarian Roshan Ranasinghe said.
This decision was taken by the party following the Supreme Court decision pursuant to a clarification sought by President Maithripala Sirisena regarding his current term of office, he said.
Addressing an election rally held at Palagala on January 15, Parliamentarian Roshan Ranasinghe said the SLPP had also decided to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the government formed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in the event of his victory at the Presidential election.
He said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa pioneered the efforts to win the war and transform Colombo into a clean and beautiful city.
Referring to the alleged statement made by Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne to the effect that there was a Rs. 12 million deposit to cover up the Rs. 11 million loss made in the Central Bank Bond issue, Ranasinghe alleged that Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was indirectly helping people to rob by making such irresponsible statements.
He said youths who cried for justice and fair play were not even in the UNP local government election campaign today.
He alleged that an environment had been created where youthful parliamentarians such as Sujewa Serasinghe, Ranjan Ramanayake and Harin Fernando could not face the public.

How  smartphone  can track you
The little pocket supercomputers we all constantly carry around with us arent just supplying us with useful information, theyre also collecting a host of data on us and our habits, all of the time. Heres a guide to what gets collected by your smartphone and the apps running on it, and how you can take back some control. Sensors, Android, and iOS
Your smartphone is packed with sensors, monitoring where you are in the world, how fast youre moving through space, which way up youre holding your phone, and more. All of this data is used by apps to improve the user experienceso making sure your phone apps switch between landscape and portrait modes, and keeping you on the right route for your commutebut how much of this data is logged and stored is largely up to the choices of the handset manufacturer.
In recent months OnePlus has been at the center of a privacy kerfuffle over the way it was logging personally identifiable information (like device IDs) and transmitting that data back to OnePluss home base, ostensibly to improve the devices user experience. OnePlus has since dialed back some of that data collection, and promises to only use the data it gathers internally, but it shows just how much data your smartphone can reveal, and how tricky it can be to know whats being collected and what isnt.
Googles privacy policy, which affects Android among other services, is here:
You can see that as soon as you sign into Android with your Google account, your device gets linked to your Google credentials, and Google starts logging data such as the length and type of your phone calls, your phones location, the device youre using, and more.
You can also find Apples privacy policy online.
While a lot of the data collected is the same, Apple differs from Google by making much of it anonymized or kept on your iPhone (and not sent back to Apple)so while your location can be tracked on iOS, for example, Apple itself doesnt know where you are, only your phone does.
Face ID is another good example of how Apple differentiates itself on privacy.
The Face ID sensors map and know everything about your face, but that information is then stored privately and securely on your phoneit isnt transferred back to Apple or iCloud, making it very difficult for anyone to get a copy of your face.
However, some of this data is shared with third-party apps. For example, some app might want to stick an AR filter on your face. Apple requires that any app requesting such face-scanning features must present a privacy policy to the user. Smartphone apps
On top of the basic information collected by your smartphone and beamed back (or not beamed back) to the company that made your handset, theres all the information collected by the apps you run toothe data that gets recorded and saved is down to an individual apps privacy policies and the permissions you give it.
If you want to know exactly what an app is allowed to track on your Android phone, open the Settings app then go to Apps & notifications, choose an app, and select Permissions. Over on iOS, launch the Settings app then pick an app to see the permissions it has. Most of these permissions can be revoked with a toggle switch on both Android and iOS.

Judiciary is now impartial: Minister Samarasinghe
Unlike during the previous regime, the judiciary of the country is now impartial. It is so powerful and strong enough to take decisions even against the Executive President, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He added that the independence of the judiciary is evident when considering the Supreme Courts decision on the Presidents term.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters, yesterday.
The Minister added that the judiciary has the freedom now unlike during the previous regime. The Minister recalled how former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike was expel from her post during the previous regime as a result of giving a decision against the then government.
The Supreme Courts decision on the Presidents term symbolizes that there is an independent judiciary in the country, he noted. When asked whether the President wants to extend his term, he said the President is the only person in the history of the country who shed his executive powers through the 19th amendment. Then no person with a good mentality believes that the President wants to extend his term.
Most of the powers of the Executive Presidency were removed through the 19th amendment to the Constitution. It was President Sirisena who implemented the 19th amendment. Is there any other person who is ready to shed the powers vested by the Constitution the Minister questioned.
He added that disciplinary action will be taken against SLFP parliamentarians who work against the party.

Keyt finds  literacy among the illiterate
Over the years, the researchers have told us that it is indeed difficult to define the term folklore which envelops various types of narratives, poems, plays, games, beliefs and allied areas linked to the subject. As one Professor Francis Utley once pointed out, almost everybody who has heard the word folklore knows instinctively what it is, just as everybody who has seriously read poetry knows what it is.
Yet both these words are hard to define with clarity. Though a strict clear definition is unwanted or unanticipated, volumes of folk material come to be printed year after year in all the countries around the globe. It is calculated that the largest number of printed material include folktales and folk poems especially as a learning tradition on the part of the colonial rulers.
Village folktales
As such, even during the postcolonial period of several countries, the indigenous folktales have been written in English which eventually come back in translations. One good example comes from the three-volume English collections of Sinhala folktales compiled by Henry Parker, titled as Folktales of Village Ceylon.
Followed by the trend set by Parker, quite a number of folk materials came to be written down by others. Though our own poet and painter George Keyt had nothing to do with the colonial rulers, he had the chance of compiling a collection o folk stories which came to be printed in 1974. In a short introduction to his collection of 17 Sri Lankan folk stories blended with his fascinating paintings for each creation, Keyt states that he had a sensitive intention in the compilation of the collection. He says: The following selection of folk stories was from those related to me in Sinhala by some rural people, students of village schools and ladies of the gentry in the Kandy district.
According to Keyt, the attempt in itself is a clear-cut creative exercise in communication. His attempt is, to some extent, to put down in English as they were created in Sinhala. Keyt observes some key characteristics of these stories. The local names occur rarely, thus eliminating any indication of caste groups and other social discriminative factors. Keyt too sees that the culture is the same everywhere, and the same polite language is spoken whether there is literacy or not.
His statement of aesthetic judgment is that the illiterate are spiritual literate. What a profound aesthetic sense from a modernistic point of view As such, before the 17 folk stories were written in English, carrying an original painting created by the compiler Keyt. The aspects that cover the folk stories range from the rulers sail as the kings, ministers, noblemen to those who toil the land such as farmers. The very first story titled as The Golden Cucumber which perhaps is a rare tale which presumably is not recorded in any other collection revolved around the nature of cruelty all the way to get rid of it. There are a few folktales which capture the attitudes and behaviour patterns of the local devils and demons, which in the end transport as tales of spiritual value. One good example is the second story titled as The Jewel Bird.
Pandoras legend
The folk stories are sometimes compared in order to gauge the human content as they are passed down the centuries. A story that resembles the world known legend of Pandoras Box is found in the collection titled as The Two Jewel Boxes. But there are apparent similarities as well as dissimilarities. This shows the extent to which folk narratives are culturally and spiritually linked to each other. The story of Amal Biso is one of the well known Sinhala legends. This collection too envelops a version that provides a wide depth.
A reader may feel that the story of Amal Biso is an example of the essential spiritual harmony anticipated by a family, in order to bring about better living. Folk sayings, folk idiom, proverbs that transfer folk wisdom are the main factors one sees in the study of folk narratives. The two folk stories titled as Kalu Hami and The Wicked Daughter in Law as compiled in this anthology have been transformed into modern playlets by Ediriweera Srachchandra titled as Elova Gihin Melova Ava and Rattaran respectively.
The stories of the court jester Andare are known both as tales of wit and wisdom Keyt in his compilation selected four significant Andare tales titled as Stories of a court jester. All in all, it is good to rediscover the collection in the light of new vistas in literary studies.
Each of the stories in the collection is blissfully well illustrated preserving a local visual tradition as seen in the Buddhist village temples. This alone paves the way to feel that George Keyt retains two traditions namely the oral narrative tradition into printed word and a verbal tradition to a visual tradition of his own.

A female accomplice of the LTTE woman suicide bomber who attacked the Kollupitiya Police Station premises to assassinate Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) Leader Douglas Devananda, was yesterday sentenced to suspended-imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
The accused, 43-year-old Selvakumari Sathyaseelan, a resident of Jaffna, was sentenced to two years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) suspended for 15 years, for aiding and abetting charges. The accused was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000 by High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi. She was released from the first count owing to a discrepancy in the indictment.
The High Court Judge said he was compelled to pass a lenient sentence against the accused, since she was kept in remand custody since 2004; a period of 13 years.
It was revealed during the trial that the LTTE had forcibly selected the accused to accompany the woman suicide bomber, as she had access to Minister Devanandas office.
The Attorney General had filed indictments regarding the LTTE suicide bomb attack incident at the Kollupitiya Police Station on July 7, 2004, where four police personnel were killed.

Lanka defends record on child rights before UN
The government is vigorously pursuing programs to protect children in Sri Lanka, Women and Child Affairs Ministry Secretary Chandrani Senaratne said in a speech to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva on Monday.
She was addressing the 77th session of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sri Lanka last appeared before the committee eight years ago.
Secretary Senaratne said since that time, the country has made significant progress both from its enhanced engagement with the UN system, as well as through new domestic policies.
Senaratne cited recent changes to the Education Ordinance, raising the minimum age for compulsory education from 14 to 16 years, and said laws were being drafted to increase the minimum age for employment to 16.
She said the Cabinet of Ministers had approved raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12 years, and draft amendments will be placed before Parliament shortly.
Senaratne added that the implementation of these policies as well as action plans in the fields of health, human rights, and education (enjoy) patronage and commitment at the highest levels of the government.
Senaratne admitted, however, that progress is often not made in straight lines.
A UNICEF and Colombo-based Verite Research study, for example, found that there are over 14,000 children institutionalized in Sri Lanka. The report stated that the law rarely differentiates between alleged child offenders and victims of crime.
We recognize that there are many issues pertaining in our justice services for children and we truly hope that our work in the coming years will bring positive results for children in this regard, Senaratne said.
Representatives from the Attorney Generals Department, the National Child Protection Authority, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry, among others, were present for the review in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday.
The UN committee will now review the countrys testimony and submitted reports to see how well Sri Lanka is upholding the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sri Lanka ratified the convention in 1991.

Village societies will be established to protect new electric fences and radio collars will be fixed to wild elephants under the programmes, Wildlife Department sources said.
In 2016 and 2017, 79 wild elephants and 23 villagers had been killed due to human-elephant conflict. The country boasts around 6,000 wild elephants and of them 150 are tuskers, the sources said.
Wildlife Conservation Minister Gamini Jayawikcrama Perera has submitted a Cabinet paper in consultation with the President proposing to launch a integrated wild elephant protection and preservation programme. It has been proposed to receive the support of the tri-forces, civil society, government institutions and volunteers to carry out the programmes. The Minister said electric fences were first erected in 1950 around reservations to prevent wild elephants from entering villages. Today electric fences are proposed to be erected around a village or a cluster of villages to keep more space for elephants.
He said Hambantota, Kurunegala, Monaragala, and Trincomalee now have fences erected around villages and Anuradhapura will have them in near future.
Villagers will be given responsibility to protect and maintain the fences around their villagers and they will be provided with necessary equipment and know-how in this regard by the department. The Minister said Weta Samithi (Fences Societies) will be formed and they would be paid for their services.
The Wildlife Department receives support and advices from the Centre for Conservation and Research headed by Environmentalist Dr. Pruthiviraj Franando to erect modified protective fences, form Weta Samithi, and fix radio collars to wild elephants.
The Minister said additional civil security men would be recruited to preserve wildlife.Today 70 percent of the wild elephant population live outside reservations and humans and elephants live throughout 40 percent of the land in the country.
New development schemes, private residential constructions and other schemes have limited the extent of land that elephants can take as their habitats. On the other hand, people also do not have much space, he said.
Environment-friendly changes have to be taken such as proposed fence module and fence societies to get rid of this situation. Elephant corridors will be earmarked by inspecting where the wild elephants fixed with radio collars mostly roam and any obstructions for their movements will be removed after considering the respective situations, the Minister said.
The country reportedly has 3,861 km of new fences and 460 km of fences is now under construction in Anuradhapura, Monaragala and Hambantota.

Ngidi pushes India to brink of series defeat
CENTURION: New fast bowling discovery Lungi Ngidi plunged India into deep trouble as they struggled in pursuit of a victory target of 287 on the fourth day of the second Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park on Tuesday.
India were 35 for three at the close, having lost both openers and the key wicket of captain Virat Kohli on a pitch with uneven bounce.
The hosts will head into the final day confident of picking up the seven wickets they need to wrap up an impressive victory in the three-match series, after a 72-run win in the first Test at Cape Town.
Debutant Ngidi, who came on as first change, took a wicket with his first ball of the innings when Lokesh Rahul played a loose forcing shot off the back foot and was caught at backward point.

Parties with Muslim label foster hidden agenda: Faiszer Musthapha
Certain parties with a Muslim label tell one thing to the public while having a hidden agenda and they were trying to mislead the public.
The racist parties were selling the Muslim religion and was involved in a massive fraud on the innocent population and would finally join the government after obtaining money, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He was addressing a meeting in support of Former Pradeshiya Sabha member of Malwana Anwer to assure the victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Local Government elections in Malwana of the Gampaha District yesterday.
Such politics was of no use and religion was purely personal, he said. The Minister said Sinhala people elected him during the last two elections.
If you do not want to vote for us, vote for any other national party other than the racist parties. The Sinhalese Muslims and Tamils are all living together and the Muslims will get destroyed by voting for the racist Muslim parties, the Minister said.
Some people say Biyagama is a UNP stronghold. This was Ranil Wickremasinghes electorate, he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has proved that he was protecting all the races. Your valuable vote will usher in a powerful United Peoples Freedom Alliance, the Minister said.
We can develop the district further. Therefore, I request you to support Anwer in this election, he said.

Professor D C R A Goonetillekes Guide to Poetry
Building on the foundation laid by Guide to Literary Criticism, this book takes literary education a stage further: it concentrates on poetry (originally written in English and in English translation). It is meant to train the reader to get to grips with the range and variety of experience as well as the range and variety of forms and styles displayed in poetry from the age of Elizabeth I to that of Elizabeth II and by poets from diverse regions  Britain, America, Europe, Africa, West Indies, India and Sri Lanka.
It illuminates the processes of poetic change, with distinguishable period characteristics as well as regional differences as poetry spreads globally and its practitioners become more varied. The examples are taken mainly from poems/extracts prescribed in examination syllabuses, especially for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level as well as Advanced Level, and also for university examinations.
Guide to Poetry is essential reading for success-oriented students. It is also addressed to teachers as a means of enabling them to guide the students.
It will also prove rewarding to readers and writers of literature in English, Sinhala and Tamil, and, indeed, to all those interested in the use of words  by sensitizing responses to language and by widening horizons.

SAITM students need international recognition - Parent
An investigation is going on in the Bribery Commission in connection with SAITM.
We have already demanded a Presidential Commission on the same and forwarded a copy of the demand to the CID, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Union Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals' Association auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that his son is in SAITM for seven long years by February 1st this year but the Cabinet Ministers are trying their best to save institutions and not 900 SAITM students.
According to Wijeratne, no SAITM student wants an illegal or fake MBBS. They are willing to sit for any examination. They need an Internationally recognized MBBS which is obtained from a recognized medical faculty that functions under the supervision of the SLMC and UGC.
They do not need a hybrid MBBS offered by a closed private medical faculty or fraudulent and low quality institution.
They need a recognized MBBS. It cannot be granted without drafting all relevant and required rules, regulations and legislatives with the active contribution of all relevant professionals and scholars, he said.
What this Government should do immediately is obtain the active contribution of the GMOA, SLMC and all the other relevant and required professionals and scholars to draft minimum standards of medical education and private medical faculties, he said.

Sharapova and Kerber light up Aussie Open
Melbourne, Tuesday: Former champions Maria Sharapova and Angelique Kerber turned on the style to sweep into the Australian Open second round Tuesday, but it was curtains for lanky Canadian Milos Raonic.
With temperatures heating up in Melbourne, the two Grand Slam winners wasted little time on court. Sharapova, still working her way back from a 15-month ban for taking the performance-enhancing substance meldonium, showed glimpses of the tennis that made her a five-time major winner.
The 2008 Melbourne Park champion, now ranked 48, battled past Germany's Tatjana Maria 6-1, 6-4 and will next play either 14th seed Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia or American Varvara Lepchenko.
"I cherish these moments. I love it here," said the Russian, who returned from her drugs ban in April last year.
"It's been a couple of years and I wanted it to be really meaningful to me."
Fellow former world number one Kerber, who won the tournament in 2016, was also impressive in dismissing Anna-Lena Friedsam 6-0, 6-4. "2017, I have said goodbye already, I am not looking back," she said after a forgettable last season that saw her relinquish the number one spot and slide down the rankings.
She is now on a 10-match win streak after a perfect early season. "I'm just trying to enjoy it again on court," said the German, who turns 30 this week.
Sixth seed Karolina Pliskova and eighth seed Caroline Garcia also progressed, in contrast to the other side of the draw that saw Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens and Coco Vandeweghe crash out on Monday.
American woes continued with Madison Brengle sent packing by British ninth seed Johanna Konta. Auckland Classic champion Fernando Verdasco was among men to make the second round, with a straight-sets win over 20th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.
But Raonic, who has made at least the last eight over the past three years in Melbourne, was bundled out by 86th-ranked Slovakian Lukas Lacko in four sets.
It was his earliest Grand Slam exit in seven years as he fights back from a wrist injury.
Roger Federer, rated as favourite to win his 20th Grand Slam title even at the venerable age of 36, makes his entrance in a night match on Rod Laver Arena.
The second seeded Swiss, who is coming off an extraordinary 2017, when he won a fifth Australian Open title and a record eighth at Wimbledon, faces Slovenia's Aljaz Bedene.
Twelve-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic is also in action, amid reports he is leading a push to create an independent players union to fight for even more prize money.
The Serb, returning from a long break with an elbow injury, plays American Donald Young on Margaret Court Arena.
Fellow injury-plagued star Stan Wawrinka also makes his comeback from injury Tuesday.
World number one Simona Halep takes the court later as she chases a first Grand Slam title, with Wimbledon champion and third seeded Garbine Muguruza making her bow in an evening match. AFP

Snow in Sahara desert
Desert town Ain Sefra, also known as the Gateway to the Sahara, got to experience snow in one of the hottest regions on the planet. Almost 40 cm deep, the Independent reported.
Recently, a photographer captured the stunning scenes as snow covered desert dunes. This has happened only three times in the past 40 years.
It seems like the snowy pictures were taken across the higher areas in the north of the region, towards the Atlas regions, so its not surprising that the area would see some snow if the conditions were right, a spokeswoman for the Met Office told The Independent.
Adding, With the setup over Europe at the moment, which has given us cold weather over the weekend, a push southwards of cold air into that region and some sort of moisture would bring that snow.
It melted away later that same day due to rising temperatures.

Bangladesh tri-series match 2 today :
Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe look to get back on track
Zimbabwe are looking to bounce back after they were beaten comprehensively by hosts Bangladesh in the opening game of the tri-series in Dhaka.
They take on Sri Lanka in match two and will hope the fine form of Sikandar Raza, who made a battling 52 and took two wickets, can help inspire a revival.
Zimbabwe were behind from the start against Bangladesh as their top order failed to fire, with opener Solomon Mire and No.3 Craig Ervine both dismissed for ducks inside the first three deliveries of the day.
From that horror start, they were never really in the contest. At least the only way is up for Graeme Cremers side, who have recently welcomed back Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis after their stints in English county cricket. The pacy Jarvis bowled neatly, going for 15 off his four overs, but conditions favoured the spinners and Zimbabwe might consider opening with one as the tri-series wears on.
They will no doubt be looking forward to matching up against Sri Lanka, the team they shocked with a 3-2 ODI series win last July.
Sri Lanka, placed two places above Zimbabwe in eighth in the ICC ODI team rankings at present, have undergone significant upheaval in recent months.
Angelo Mathews resigned the captaincy in all forms following that series defeat to Zimbabwe, with Dinesh Chandmial replacing him in Tests and Upal Tharanga stepping up in limited-overs cricket. However, a run of 10 consecutive defeats saw Tharanga replaced by Thisara Perera for the series in India last month. Due to injuries, Chamara Kapugedara and Lasith Malinga also captained the ODI side during 2017.
Both Mathews and Chandimal were then said to be in the frame for the captaincy ahead of the Bangladesh tour but 30-year-old Mathews has agreed to take on the role again just a matter a months after his resignation, and will lead the side throughout the tri-series.
It will be familiar ground for Sri Lankas new coach, former Sri Lanka player Chandika Hathurusingha, who took over the job in December after resigning as Bangladesh coach, a role he held from 2014.
The players will be looking to avenge Zimbabwe and the coach will be keen to get one over on his former charges in their backyard. Sri Lanka have plenty of motivation, and just possibly, the makings of a little more stability as teams build towards the 2019 ICC World Cup.
Sri Lanka squad: Angelo Mathews (cap), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera, Asela Gunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera, Shehan Madushanka, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Wanidu Hasaranga
Zimbabwe squad: Graeme Cremer (cap), Hamilton Masakadza, Solomon Mire, Craig Ervine, Brendan Taylor, Sikandar Raza, Peter Moor, Malcolm Waller, Ryan Murray, Tendai Chisoro, Brandon Mavuta, Blessing Muzarabani, Chris Mpofu, Tendai Chatara, Kyle Jarvis

Striving towards a drug free Sri Lanka
Drugs have emerged as a major social problem recently and has crossed the border of caste, class, creed, sex and nation. Drug abuse affects individuals, their families and society as a whole and they are often linked to organised crime and illegal weapons trade and the underworld.
Sri Lanka however, has taken a strong stance on the drug issue and in a warning to the worlds drug operators that it will not tolerate or encourage drugs being brought into the country, nor allow the country to be used as a transitional hub for the distribution of these drugs. 928 kilograms and 229 grams of cocaine, valued at Rs. 16.7 billion was publicly destroyed on Monday (15) under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and several ministers.
The Dangerous Drugs Control Board also issued several recommendations for the disposal of the cocaine. In particular it was strictly recommended that no solvent other than pure water be used for the purpose of dissolution of the sample at the pre-processing stage and for any other purpose, prior to destruction in the cement kiln. Substance residues in the containers that they were transported should be removed by rinsing these containers with water and the emptied containers and the water rinsed, should also be disposed properly using the same disposal method.
Environmentally friendly disposal
Meanwhile, INSEE Ecocycle had volunteered to dispose of the cocaine in an environmentally friendly and responsible manner under the guidance of the Government Analyst Department (GAD), the Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) and the Attorney Generals Department.
Speaking on the occasion, INSEE Cement CEO Nandana Ekanayake said, We are proud to support a national cause of this nature, contributing towards building a drug free Sri Lanka by being a responsible corporate citizen. This drug menace has had a severe impact on our younger generation. Therefore, this stance by the government is highly commendable and we are glad we were able to contribute to this endeavour.
INSEE Ecocycle is the only operational cement kiln co processing facility and it is the only sustainable waste management business in the country having over a decade experience in the industry, which has disposed of over 600,000 tons of waste. However, given the sensitive nature and high security requirement of the narcotic material, ensuring the safe and secure disposal was a challenge for them. But they were able to take on this challenge and it was the first time they have taken on such a responsibility to dispose of a socially harmful substance, thanks to the support and guidance of PNB and NDDCB experts throughout the value chain activities such as sampling, laboratory analysis and transporting up until the final destruction of the narcotic substance ensuring zero harm to society and the environment.
Meanwhile, according to the DIG of the Police Narcotics Bureau Sajeewa Medawatte, the main reason that INSEE Ecocycle was selected for this purpose was they are the only state of the art hazardous waste management facility equipped with geo-membrane floor, fully automated fire-fighting system, CCTV operations and emergency preparedness plan. The facility has also obtained all the required licenses such as the environmental protection license and solid waste management license.
The Chairman of the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, Professor Ravindra Fernando said, Laboratory testing conducted by the National Narcotics Laboratory of the NDDCB as per the order of the Colombo Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, revealed the feasibility of the disposal of the specific court sample with the cement kiln of INSEE Ecocycle by the incineration process.
Drug disposals
Fernando said there was another stock of cocaine and heroin that had been seized and that they were in the process of determining whether other narcotic substances too could be disposed in the same manner. The feasibility study for the destruction of other drugs such as heroin, cannabis and other narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances including new psychoactive substances using the same disposal procedure is under laboratory investigation at the National Narcotics Laboratory (NNL). In addition, the NDDCB has agreed to work on providing scientific recommendations, coordinating, supervising and monitoring of the disposal of court samples along with the Police Narcotic Bureau and other drug law enforcement agencies for fighting against the problem of drug trafficking and abuse in the country.
Meanwhile, the confiscated stock of cocaine was liquefied in an aqueous medium at the processing facility in Katunayake, converting the chemical structure and the physical state of the substance- ensuring zero residual remains. The liquefied cocaine was then transported in a special hazardous waste transporting vehicle to the kiln facility in Puttalam, escorted by the PNB officials. The liquefied cocaine was then destroyed in the cement kiln at a temperature of between 1800 to 2000 C with 4-6 residence time. The INSEE cement kiln in Puttalam is technically proven to have a destruction removal efficiency of 99.999999 percent. Continuous emission monitoring was also carried out during and after the phase of the disposal process to ensure no harmful emissions were exposed to the environment.
Government Policy
Addressing the gathering after the initial stage of the process, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said,
The decision to destroy the drugs that are confiscated by the authorities in a public manner was taken during a Cabinet meeting. Usually the general practice had been to destroy the drugs that are seized at the relevant courts when the cases has been completed and the drugs are no longer needed as evidence. But this is the first time such a haul of seized drugs is being destroyed publicly. During 2015, 2016 and 2017, the total value of drugs seized is Rs. 34 billion. The value of the 928 kilogram and 229 grams is Rs. 16.7 billion. In fact Rs. 34 billion is half the annual expenditure heads of the entire Police Department. This is including the salaries, capital expenditure etc. This is a large amount and this is a clear sign of how powerful this drug business is. Generally it is known that drugs and organized crime goes hand in hand together with the weapons trade and the underworld.
However, our government is determined to break this cycle and the President and Prime Minister thus, gave orders to establish a new unit in the Police Department through a process of restructuring in order to fight drugs and related crimes. As a result the unit is functioning efficiently under the leadership of a Senior DIG.
He noted that this was a warning to all drug smugglers who have made Sri Lanka a transitional hub for the distribution of drugs, that Sri Lanka will not tolerate or support the use or sale of narcotic drugs and would do everything in its power to break this cycle.
Meanwhile, Law and Order State Minister Piyasena Gamage said, Based on a concept of the President to eradicate the drug menace from this country, a huge effort was taken during the recent past empowering the relevant units to make these detections. The drug menace has been affecting the country and a large number of young people have been affected by this drug menace. Although we have heard of seized drugs being destroyed, we have never witnessed such a process. Therefore, this is a very significant occasion for the country in its fight against drugs. Under the good governance government and the commitment of the Police Department, such a huge feat was achieved. Just as we have destroyed this huge stock of cocaine, we must ensure that these dangerous drugs are not allowed into the country in the future too and make this country free from this curse. The Police Department has a big responsibility in this regard and those who have been committed to this cause putting their lives on the line should be commended and the countrys gratitude should be extended.
This stock of cocaine originated from Columbia and it came to Sri Lanka through Ecuador and was destined for India through Saudi Arabia. However, acting on a tip-off the Sri Lanka authorities were able to nab this stock of cocaine which was concealed in a container load of timber.
Speaking on this occasion IGP Pujitha Jayasundara assured that the Police Department was committed to rendering its fullest support to the President and Prime Minister in their endeavour to eradicate the drug menace from this country, completely.
Sri Lanka has been on the map for years as a transitional hub in the distribution network of the narcotic drug trade. As a result, the younger generation of this country too have been lured into it. As Minister Sagala Ratnayake pointed out, the drug trade is closely associated with the underworld and illegal arms trade, which has also caused much damage to the country in the past. Although drugs were seized on several occasions in the past, no one was aware of what happens to the seized narcotics thereafter and the authorities were constantly being questioned and blamed for the lack of transparency. Therefore, based on the recommendation of the President and Prime Minister, the public disposal of these seized narcotics is a positive move for the country and its endeavour in ridding the country of the drug scourge.

Tamil Nadu collects 40,000 books for Jaffna library
The directorate of public libraries in Tamil Nadu has collected nearly 40,000 Tamil books from tge public and educational institutions to replenish the resources of tge Jaffna Public Library in Sri Lanka, which had lost its rare collections of books and manuscripts to a fire in 1981,
The Tamil Nadu government has launched a drive to collect one lakh Tamil books for the Jaffna Public Library in October.
We received books through our readers, general public and educational institutions. The collection of books varies from ancient Tolkappiam to biographies of famous film personalities, S.Kannappan, previous director of public libraries who helmed the project till last week, said.
As the 41st Chennai Book Fair is being held in the city, the officials have requested the publishers to donate new titles for the iconic library in Sri Lanka.
The Jaffna library had over 90,000 rare books and palm-leaf manuscripts. It was burnt by a Sinhalese mob in 1981 and subsequently, it was rebuilt and opened in 2003. Now it has close to 100,000 books. The move of Tamil Nadu is expected to boost the resources of Jaffna library.
The officials were confident they could collect one lakh books within a months time.
The universities and educational institutions are collecting books. We expect at least few thousand books from publishers who have participated in the book fair, officials said.
Since the books are collected for the library, the directorate of public libraries is accepting only new books. Whatever the books collected so far was categorised and packed neatly, sources added
It was planned to send them in two shipments. Now they want to send them in one shipment. The Jaffna library will get the books in February, they said.
The University of Malaya in Malaysia will get some books as part of the announcement, but a majority will be sent to Sri Lanka. - Deccan Chronicle

Three Powerful Techniques
For many who started the year with great aspirations and goals of creating new habits  its coming to the time of year when lots of peopel start to falter on their new habits.
Thats completely normal, but we can do better.
We can figure out how to overcome the difficulties that often plague our habit-changing attempts: We delay starting on the habit.Our minds start to rebel from the tediousness of sticking to a plan.We rationalize not doing the habit.
With those very common obstacles in mind, Im going to share three powerful techniques for overcoming them. They take effort to implement, but you got this!
Focus on just starting
Set a trigger when youre going to do the habit each day  lets say youre going to meditate when you wake up, or work out when you get home, or read during your lunch break. When the time comes to do the habit (the trigger happens), just launch into doing the habit, without delay. Focus on getting good at this skill of starting. When the trigger happens, have a reminder note nearby that says, Just start. Lower the barrier to doing the habit by making it smaller (just meditate for a minute or two), create barriers to doing your usual distractions, and just take the smallest first step. Youre going to practice getting good at starting, every day. If you master this, youll also get a lot better at not procrastinating with other stuff!
Be completely with the habit
When you do start the habit, its very common to focus on getting through the habit, trying to complete the task. This is a mindset that most of us have all day long  we are just rushing through our tasks, trying to finish each one. But actually this is not helpful for habits. We want to be completely present with the habit, really feel the texture of the experience, and imagine there is no end, that this moment is all there is and ever will be. It can transform the habit, turning it into a mindfulness practice, and we can even find gratitude for being able to do it.
We dont have to do it, we get to do it. This is an act of love for ourselves, and we are doing it to not only be compassionate with ourselves, but to enable ourselves to be more present, compassionate and committed to serving others. This moment of doing the habit is an act of love for everyone we know. This is a wonderful cure for the tedium of sticking to a plan.
Pause when you start to rationalize
The problem with rationalizing not doing the habit is that we dont often notice were doing it. We just start moving away from doing the habit. We just think, Its OK, Ill do it later, or Screw it, I dont really need to do this, or Just this one time wont hurt. These are not helpful thoughts. Instead, we should learn to pause. Sit still, take a breath, and remind yourself of why youre committed to this habit. Who are you doing it for Are you devoted to them, and if so, is your devotion larger than your momentary discomfort and rationalizations Take this pause and remember your love, and pour yourself into this habit by just starting and being completely present with it.
I offer these three techniques to you, and I hope youll give them a full-hearted effort.

Trumpism and the diplomatic dragon: Balancing interests in the New Year
Im gonna do whats right,..I want to be unpredictable,The voters want unpredictability - Donald J Trump
Trumpism thrives. It influences decisions with a sense of unpredictability and the effects of Trumpism on policy has affected the entire world. The release of the National Security Strategy articulates and reaffirms his policy of America First. Trumps National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster explained to BBC that all decisions are carefully calibrated and security risks considered.
At the centre of the strategys decisions are the recognition of Jerusalem, the City of David, as the capital of Israel. The city sits on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. Through history, the city has been destroyed, besieged, attacked, captured and recaptured so many times. The city is important for strategic reasons. Geopolitically it sits at the middle of Middle East. The control of the city has been a constant struggle through time. From 2400 BC, it remains the cradle of the three Abrahamic faiths; Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The walls around the Old City, dividing the city into different quarters, were set in place by the Ottoman emperor Suleiman the Magnificent.
Moving into 2018, Trumpism spills deeper through the city walls. The unpredictability unfolds threatening and challenging the entire Middle East. US hegemony was seen by the vetoing of the UN Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It was a move backed by every council member.
As promised during his election campaign, Trumps promise was delivered. This has affected several nations including Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan resistance to this decision came in the form of Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Association and Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine holding joint protests and signing a declaration against Trumps decision.
On the other hand, the US President threatens to cut off aid to countries that support and vote against the US resolution. The unfolding events signal the height of geopolitical tensions unfolding at the dawn of the year. Perhaps, as an indirect consequence, and a new year gift, Sri Lanka will lose the GSP for their largest export market, the USA.
From the politics of the geography of city walls of the Middle East, I now shift my focus to the politics of geology along oceanscapes.
Along the Indian Ocean geopolitical hotspot, Rama Setu, geologists have found the stones along the surface that were older than the sand below it. It indicates avenues to perhaps demystifying the ancient mythological tale of the Ramayan. The bridge was human engineered and built and not natural. If this reveals that the bridge was man-made, the civilizations of Indo-Lanka will be one of the most ancient. The rocks have been dated back 7000 years.
Despite the antiquity of Indo-Lanka relations, the Chinese sphere of influence is seen in the island nation due to the strong strategic relationship built over time and China has already become the largest trading partner beating India. Even prior to the full functioning of the grand OBOR project, the ripple effects are already felt in the island nation. China has acquired 15,000 acres, the largest portion of land ever leased out to a foreign investor for an economic zone in recent times. The economic zone closer to Hambanthota Port, the strategic harbour built by Chinese money, another pearl in the string of pearls theory, speculated to surround India. What China has given to nations like Sri Lanka is connectivity to outside world.
Geopolitically, China has made a significant presence with ports and many other infrastructure projects in the Indian Ocean region including investment in Gwadar Port the crown jewel of CPEC corridor with another $230m grant for a new international airport. Geostrategically, the Chinese have already carved out their access to warm Indian Ocean waters.
Several of these projects are completed from Chinese commercial loans.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, at a recent lecture at CSIS, explained that as predatory loans given by China to developing nations, it is important for the US to strengthen its relationship with India to ensure it does not become a region of disorder, conflict, and predatory economics.
Speaking at the monthly Security Salon of the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS), the security studies think tank, Prof. Patrick Mendis described how there is no stopping China having its military base in Sri Lanka. The present government and ones after will not have the muscle to stop it. Prime Minister of Sri Lanka denies that he will not allow a Chinese base and further pledging to the Indians to lease out the Chinese built new airport known as the 'ghost airport' will be leased out to India for US$300m for 40 years. India is set to take over the airport in Mattala to minimize the Chinese influence.
Out of 2 million tourist arrivals, Chinese tourist arrivals has been about 13% denoting a significant yearly increase and events such as the recent marriage ceremony of 100 Chinese couples shows Sri Lanka has already become a popular destination adding to OBOR cultural relations between the two nations. Chinese ambassador in Colombo had his farewell bid from a traditional Kung Fu show at the Mahinda Rajapaksa theater, this was also to remember the 60 years of diplomatic relationship and 65th anniversary of the historic 1952 Rubber-Rice Pact.
Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang played crucial role in Sino-Lankan relations as he had to face the newly appointed Sri Lankan government in 2015.One month after starting the tenure with an anti-Chinese sentiment highlighting large-scale corruption in Chinese projects initiated during Rajapaksa tenure, eventually the new administration found themselves in a minefield having to reverse decisions and rhetoric a presidential election campaign was based upon.
The dragon cannot be investigated. Its economic might resonates through the island in a deeply interwoven web of infrastructural support. The speculative argument begs the question if the transfer to predatory loans will become military bases. The Pentagon report released in June that China will establish military bases in Indian Ocean resonates this view.
A view from the Chinese built Lotus Tower presents a deepening of the above-mentioned inter-connected global issues. An aerial view of the island surrounded by the Indian Ocean presents one of Chinese soft power and diplomacy sweeping through the island, while global forces contend over the waters that have connected the island through time - the waters of the Indian Ocean.

Unemployment rate for 3Q 2017 reaches 4.2%
The Department of Census and Statistics in their labour survey states that unemployment among females is higher than that of males, in all age groups.
Youth and female unemployment contribute more to the overall unemployment of the country. According to the report the estimated economically active population is about 8.5 million in the third quarter 2017 and 63.1% are males and 36.9% are females. The economically inactive population is about 7.3 million. Out of the economically inactive population 26.2% are males and 73.8% are females.The male participation to the labour force is always higher than that of females.
The highest participation rate for male is reported from the age group 3539 years (96.4%), while that for female is reported from 4044 age group (49.7%). Majority of the workforce are private sector employees followed by own account workers. Highest employment share is in service sector and this is true for both male and female, while the lowest shares are for agriculture sector.
Among employed females 28.5 percent is in agriculture sector while this share is 21.9 percent for females.
The number of unemployed persons is estimated as 358,350 during the third quarter 2017.
The unemployment rate for the third quarter 2017 is 4.2%. The highest unemployment rate is reported from the G.C.E (A/L) and above group which is about 8.5 percent. Corresponding percentages are 4.9 percent and 11.9 percent for males and females respectively.
Female unemployment rates are higher than those of males in all levels of education.
This further shows that the problem of unemployment is more acute in the case of educated females than educated males, which was observed consistently over the results of previous survey rounds as well.

US holds back $65m aid to Palestinians

The US is withholding more than half of a $125m (90m) instalment destined for the UN relief agency for the Palestinians, American officials say.
It will provide $60m in aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) but will hold back a further $65m. A UN official said the move would have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. President Donald Trump said earlier the US could cut aid if Palestinians rejected peace efforts with Israel.
The US funds almost 30% of the UN agency's work overall and gave $370m to UNRWA last year.
The money withheld is part of this year's first instalment. On Sunday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas sharply attacked Trump's Middle East peace efforts, saying he would not accept any peace plan from the US after it recognised Jerusalem last year as Israel's capital. He accused Israel of putting an end to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which began the peace process.
How much aid does the US send to Palestinians 
The US's $370m dwarfs the amount given by other donors - in 2016, the second-largest donor, the EU, gave less than half as much to UNWRA, which runs educational, health and social programmes.
The US also donated $260m in bilateral aid, with much of it going towards projects administered by the US Agency for International Development (USAid).
Those projects are run by non-governmental organisations involved in humanitarian assistance, economic development, democratic reform, improving water access and other infrastructure, healthcare, education, and vocational training. By contrast, Israel receives more than $3bn in military aid per year from the US.
What impact might the aid suspension have 
Jan Egeland, the former UN humanitarian chief who now serves as its humanitarian co-ordinator for Syria, called on other donor nations to cover the shortfall caused by the US move.
The withdrawal of funds would, he said, have "devastating consequences for vulnerable Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, including hundreds of thousands of refugee children in the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria who depend on the agency for their education".
It would also "deny their parents a social safety net that helps them to survive, and undermine the UN agency's ability to respond in the event of another flare up in the conflict".
The Palestine Liberation Organization, an umbrella group for Palestinian factions, tweeted that the Trump administration seemed to be following an Israeli policy of dismantling "the one agency that was established by the international community to protect the rights of the Palestinian refugees".
What is Israel's position Its ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, called for aid to UNRWA to be scrapped completely. He accused the agency of misusing humanitarian aid and supporting "anti-Israel propaganda". "It is time for this absurdity to end and for humanitarian funds to be directed towards their intended purpose - the welfare of refugees," he said.
Why is the status of Jerusalem so contentious 
The president's decision last month to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and begin preparations to move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv were denounced by the Palestinians, who said it showed the US could not be a neutral mediator.
