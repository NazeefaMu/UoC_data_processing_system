USA 1950 World Cup hero Bahr dead at 91
LOS ANGELES, Monday - Former USA international Walter Bahr, the last surviving member of the team which famously shocked England at the 1950 World Cup, has died, it was confirmed Monday. He was 91.
Bahr provided the assist for the goal which handed the USA a 1-0 victory over the English in Belo Horizonte, a result regarded as one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history.
Former United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati confirmed Bahr's passing in a post on Twitter.
"Saddened to learn of the passing of Walter Bahr  a legend as a player, as a coach and most importantly as a caring gentleman. Rest in peace my friend," Gulati wrote.
Bahr made 19 appearances for the USA between 1948 and 1957, and later coached club teams in Pennsylvania while working as a high school physical education teacher.
He later coached the men's soccer team at Pennsylvania State University from 1974 to 1988.
Bahr took over the Penn State men's soccer program in 1974 and led the Nittany Lions to the NCAA tournament 12 times in 14 years, winning 185 games from '74 to '87. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame and the National Soccer Coaches Association Hall of Fame.
Bahr's three sons -- Matt, Casey and Chris -- all played professionally in the North American Soccer League during the 1970s.
Chris and Matt Bahr would later go on to forge successful careers in the National Football League as place kickers, each winning the Super Bowl twice.  AFP

VAT reprieve on channelling fees, operations
Cabinet approval was granted yesterday for the removal of the 15 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on hospital channelling fees, operations, doctors consultancy fees and professional charges in private hospitals. It would be effective from July 1.
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera addressing a media briefing at the Ministry said while the 15 percent VAT on the above were applied in 2016, many middle class and lower income groups sought care in private hospitals and thus the removal will help reduce medical costs.
The request for removal of the tax was made by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and was done so on the advice of the President and the Prime Minister.
At present close to 45 percent of the countrys healthcare system is managed by the private sector.
Private room charges however would still be liable to the 15 percent VAT, We assume that those who can afford in house treatment can pay the tax, the Minister said.
Along with the above change, the Ministry has also acceded to the request of artistes to remove the compulsory 14 percent withholding tax on royalties. Royalties up to Rs 50,000 per month will be exempted from the tax and thereafter a minimal tax would be charged, Samaraweera said
Further the 2.5 percent withholding tax on childrens savings accounts too has been removed. Children up to 18 years will not be liable to any tax on their savings.
The above changes are expected to cost the government a Rs 1.2 billion loss in annual revenue, said Samaraweera but he hoped that those who can pay tax, would pay to allow relief for those who needed it most.

Vince century sees Hampshire into Lords final
LONDON, Monday: Hampshire captain James Vince led from the front with a brilliant century as his side beat Yorkshire on Monday to book their place in the One-Day Cup final at Lords.
Vince may be out of the England reckoning at present, but his 171 in Hampshires semi-final total of 348 for nine at Southampton was a reminder of his talent.
It proved all too much for visitors Yorkshire, who had five players away on England duty for the one-day international series with Australia.
The White Rose could only manage 241 in reply, with Hampshire and England spinner Liam Dawson taking four for 47.
It is very pleasing, said Vince, whose side will play Kent in the June 30 final.
We set a big score and then came out with the ball and set the tone early. It means a lot to get to Lords.
At the start of the tournament I got a couple of fifties but never got a big one, so to get a big one in the last one and this one is nice, he added after his second successive List A century.
Vince, batting at number three, went to a hundred off just 83 balls before his second six, struck over long-on, took him to 150 in style.
He was eventually caught in the deep off Adam Lyth.
Yorkshire suffered a setback in their chase when India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara was undone by a rising delivery from South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn that took the shoulder of the bat before finding it way to Jimmy Adams at second slip.
Vince had the last word in the match when, at mid-off, he caught Ben Coad off Chris Wood.

Vivimaries  borrowed dust
I have known both Lal and Vivamarie since my The Island days. Some decades ago they were budding journalists, now academics.
Vivimarie VanderPoortens newest book of 88 pages is her poems collected together as borrowed dust published by Sarasavi Publishers at Rs 375 a copy. She is a prize winner and an acknowledged poet.
This slim volume has very short epigrammatical and a fairly little longer poems. Between pages 19 and 21 there is a poem like prose writing included.
Next, what I like are:
l I have words like obsession and infatuation, my defence.
I throw them at you- their polysyllabic edges hitting the lens of your eye where tears linger. Waiting to fall
l We go together like a Knife and a Fork. A carving knife, a Pitchfork
l And when robes ere being hand out, the bird who would be called crow said
Give me the black one, so I can forever remind the world of the grief stricken and the dead
n We will truly know that its folly to say there are no winners in war.
n You said we would stick together through Thick and Thin. Alas! It turned out to be a thick wall, a thin line
n Drifting dangerously like a snowflake, wavering aimlessly like hope, moving around the eye balls of human statues standing still in falling snow
n You called me yours. my precious you said. Ever sensitive to speech broken down into their parts. I said: I like your use of the possessive determiner. You said: My knowledge of grammar and now, after all this time with you no longer possessive nondetermined. I think: your knowledge of grammar was fine. It was the usage that was flawed.
l I never know and youll always be the rainbow I found in the grass
l When trapped between the jagged edges of unanswerable questions you can find a way out through the familiar space of signifiers: For example, when asked So where do you want to go from here, you could always say I am searching for directions or better still I would like to stand still, in this place for a while.
l I have loved like a chain smoker lighting new flames with the dying embers of burnt down loves even while my heart lay crushed out like a cigarette butt still smoking in the tray-cage of my ribs.
Should I not then feel the withdrawals of an addict with not even the nicotine patch of a mild flirtation in sight, why do I now not follow my usual habit, look for the sweet tobacco of desire in someones eyes the flash of the flint wheel the butane satisfaction of being inhaled into a heart.
Or have I finally quit
n Swaying rat snakes mate. Two dancers creating life on the dying grass.
 (I too witnessed the jammed traffic stillness in Kolkata streets)
n And hoe long will you wait for me my love Will you wait until the river of my fear a shrunk I the drought of loneliness Will you wait until I begin to rescue my canoe-heart from sinking in the cold sea of common sense. Will you wait until despairs last tear has been wept
n You became indispensable like Google. And YouTube, but unlike the search engines or even Wiki, you cannot stay long. So, I guess I better glued to dictionary and Encyclopaedia Britannica. The Yellow Pages to mi just have to do.
n And I who pride myself on the waves of words that hit the shoreline of the imagination am left empty as the beach when the tide is out.
I enjoyed her poems and was not looking for her content but was fascinated by the fresh coinages that fascinated me.

Voice that remains  ivory
As soon as my ears felt the demise of veteran vocalist, composer, and teacher, Ivor Dennis, something echoed in my auricles. It is none other than the melancholic utterances Sumihiri Suwandethi mal ai metharam hanikata parawanne (why do sweet-scented flowers wither so quickly, composed and sung by late Sunil Santha subsequent to the demise of his friend Suryashankar Molligoda. Apparently, Sunil himself quoted saying it was the sudden impulse that brought in to him after his great comrade left the music arena for good. I wonder what would he be saying by now after seeing his pupil who entertained the music fans over many decades with some scintillating oral delights.
The Sri Lankan Sinhala music culture has been nourished by a handful of great musicians at a time when it was struggling to come out of age in the early part of the twentieth century under the British rule. During these colonial era veteran musicians such as Hubert Rajapaksha, Devar Suryasena(aka Herbert Charles Jacob Pieris), Sunil Santha turned a fresh leaf in bringing Sinhala words to new heights to promote a Sinhala music culture. They were influenced by Western and Raagas from Hindi tunes, yet they consist of the fresh taste of vocals. Sunil Santha emerged as a clear leader in creating a specific original style of music. These were influenced by a blend of church choir music and a touch of orientalism to suit the Sri Lankan Sinhala audience. They consist of both patriotism and romanticism. While Sunil Santha bade farewell in 1981, his legacy remained to continue with Ivor, a humble man with a clear distinctive voice with a plethora of talent and intellect to offer by any stretch of the imagination.
His use of Sinhala words in singing is immaculate and one could easily attribute him to the stratum of Kumaratunga Munidasa, Arisen Ahubudu and of course his guru Sunil Santha, although both Munidasa and Ahubudu did not sing.
Dennis sang plenty of rare finds in many platforms, be it cinema, theatre or on the radio Ceylon studios. One such rarity is Api Sinhalayo a song sung for the movie Veera Puran Appu in 1979, directed by late Dr Lester James Peiris based on the character of the former hero Puran appu who defied the British rule, scripted by late Dr Tissa Abeysekara. The song is rarely heard and aired over the radio these days. It was one of the songs that consist of many facets of a patriotic song. The song is sung by Ivor, TM Jayarathne and the chorus with the music composed by Premasiri Khemadasa. It plays on the way to the launching of the Puran Appus patriotic army defeat of the British. The vocal control of the singing by Dennis proves his prowess as par excellence with some great rippling effect  an oral delight!
Dennis would not sojourn there but would take the helm on to the theatre. Playwright Ranjith Dharmakeerthis 1970s drama based on a Russian creative art, Angara Ganga Gala Basi garnered whole of fame. Dharmakeerthi had the privilege to extract the cream out of the crop in Khemadasas music backed up by Ajantha Ranasinghes lyrics blended with the vocals of Ivor, Edward Jayakody, TM Jayarathne and Sunila Abeysekara. Sunila Abeysekara was known to be of soprano genre that provided the ultimatum to the audience with Dennis oral glee.
I could fondly remember he was walking on the radio Ceylon corridors in the 1980s with a pile of files and some books in his hands aiming to enter the studios for a certain programme. He consistently sang songs related to Sigiri frescoes known as Sigiri kurutu gee. They consisted of local tunes and styles. One key difference in Dennis singing is he would not dwell in one specific panache. He could open up his vocal chords to the likes of Frank Sinatra or become a traditional farmer who would recite pal kawi. This phenomenon is not something common Sri Lanka singers. Dennis had a good knowledge of comprehending the scenario to perform the work of art.
Some of his notable cinematic contributions can be mentioned as follows; Anuraapura Polonnaruwa (From Rekhava, 1956), Negena Watena (From Kawda Hari, 1969), Udumbara Hinehenawa (From Bambaru Ewith, 1982) andRan Devolin (from Adara Hasuna 1987). In addition to this collection, he had sung some memorable songs such as Andura Kutiya Thula and Dakuna Nagenahira (with guru Sunil Santha). The experimental song Poda daham sisile is yet another creation with guru Sunil Santha.
Lastly, it must be said that with the demise of Ivor Dennis, the last of the long list of true Sri Lankan musicians who contributed to the upliftment of Sinhala music culture since the colonial era chapter has gone and for sure his legacy will remain among us for the posterity.

We cannot challenge court verdict - Deputy Minister
As Buddhists, we feel sorry about the imprisonment of Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven.Galagodatte Gnasara Thera, but we cannot challenge the court verdict, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the Deputy Minister said that the verdict has been given considering only the legal facts and not about the individual since the Goddess of Justice is blind.
He further said that the Goddess of Justice with her blindfold symbolizes equal justice under the law.
Ven. Gnanasara TherA can submit an appeal which he has already done, the Deputy Minister said.
As a government which has ensured the independence of the judiciary, we will never interfere with any court case. Everybody must be treated equally under the law regardless of religion, political affiliation, ethnicity or other characteristics, without privilege, discrimination or bias, he added.
Responding to a question by a journalist who inquired about the removal of yellow robes of Ven. Ganasara Thera without any Vinaya Karma, Deputy Minister Bandara said that he is not aware about the prison traditions and Vinaya Karma.
Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said that only the person has been imprisoned and not the yellow robes, which is considered most sacred by Buddhists.

WHITHER SRI LANKA ECONOMY -Part II
Sri Lankas external debt rose in 2017. The total external debt of the country increased by US$. 5.4 Bn to US$.51,824 Mn by end 2017. The Government raised around US$.4.0 Bn in 2017 by issuing an ISB, raising a foreign currency term financing facility and programme and project loans.
With the increase in Government external debt, the total outstanding external debt of the country has a percentage of GDP increased to 59.5% by end 2017 from 56.8% at end of 2016.
Foreign debt service payments which consist of capital repayments and interest payments on Sri Lankas external debt continued to increase in 2017.
Exchange rate movements
The external value of the Sri Lanka rupee remained relatively stable in 2017 under a more market-based exchange policy implemented by the Central Bank limiting Central Bank intervention in the foreign exchange market only to building up international reserves.
Reflecting movements in cross-currency exchange rates against the US$ in international markets, the rupee depreciated markedly against all other major currencies in 2017 in comparison to the previous year.
Financing of the Budget deficit
The overall budget deficit was financed largely through foreign sources in 2017. In terms of the overall budget deficit, 59.9% of the resource requirement (439.2 Bn) was financed through foreign sources compared to 61.2% (Rs.391.9 Mn) in 2016.
Outstanding debt of major public non-financial corporations
The outstanding debt of major public non-financial corporations (including outstanding debt related to Hambantota Port of SLTA), which included debt to the domestic banking sector and project related foreign debt declined as a percentage of GDP in 2017.
Foreign Debt Service payments
Foreign Debt Service payments which consist of capital repayments and interest payments on Sri Lankas external debt continued to increase in 2017. Capital repayments decrease to US$.3,156 Mn in 2017 from US$.3,243 Mn in 2016, of which general Government debt accounted for US$.1,354 Mn.
The bunching of maturities of external sector liabilities maturing in the period from 2019 to 2023 is a serious concern in the external sector over the short to medium term.
Debt trap
In my opinion, which is shared by many others our country is in a serious debt trap with new debt being created to amortize existing debts with the debt liability increasing. Sri Lankas total debt as at the end of 2017 was over US$.10 Bn increasing from around US$.10 Bn when the Yahapalana Government took over. In addition to the debts created by unsolicited projects like Hambantota port and the Mattala airport which have produced a very small return far below what is required to repay interest and capital on these projects the Yahapalana Government has proceeded to once again borrow money to embark upon the Central Expressway which in my opinion is not among the priority needs of the people in this country.
There is no doubt with the increasing taxation both direct and indirect the Governments revenue will increase substantially but the people who are most affected by such policies is the poorest of the poor and also the middle class who are now fighting a continuous battle to make ends meet. I cannot see any change in these policies in the immediate future but of course before elections are held the Government will be compelled to give some relief. The irony is that whether such relief is given or not this coalition Government will not come back to power and the relief given in the form of a reduction in taxes will only further exacerbate the faltering economy.
Bribery and corruption
The other day I picked up an old article which referred to the first anti Bribery and Corruption act promulgated by Parliament in 1954, which indicates that bribery was a cause for concern even in the 50s. However, I believe that bribery was then a small time operation mainly indulged by some Government servants, Customs and the Police Force. However, bribery has now reached unbelievable proportions with contracts being peddled on the basis of which party gives the best commission to the decision maker concerned.
Bribery corruption and earning money from commissions began in the era of the liberalized economy. Late President J R Jayewardena opened the economy which created a tremendous impact on the county. Unfulfilled import demand ballooned. The private sector was given an opportunity to import and market almost anything from a pin to a Rolls Royce. This created considerable new employment opportunities both at unskilled labour levels to clerical and technical jobs.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, he gave the wrong signal when he said: let the robber barons come. However, he was a visionary who embarked on the Mahaweli Development scheme which condensed a project earlier envisaged to be completed in 30 years to a 10 year period. He obtained grants from the UK for the Victoria Dam, I believe from Sweden for the Randenigala Dam and for some of the other Dams in this huge Mahaweli Development concept. This resulted in a large number of foreign funds pouring in. I recall inflation going up to 20% and Fixed Deposit rates being around 18% (still a negative interest rate). This project and other related projects I connection with the open economy threw open the gates for bribery corruption and commissions.
I can recall unconfirmed rumours floating around that a certain Ministers and other decision-makers were indulging in corruption at a high level. However, these were unconfirmed reports.
From 1977 to 1983 the economy grew at a pace of 8 to 10% and then came the unfortunate ethnic conflagration in 1983 which was totally mismanaged by President JR who by not declaring an emergency for three days literally promoting the brutal murder of around 1,000 Tamils in Colombo and destroying their property. This gave rise to the birth of the LTTE and we know how long it took to control this most brutal of all terrorist organisations in the world.
Ironically I have heard it said by some foreign spokesman that in the developing countries without bribery, corruption and commissions no progress is made. In no way do I condone this but judging by the progress made by developing countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and even Taiwan and South Korea this seems to be the case. I can remember the wife of one Indonesian President being called Mrs. 10% as the handouts were being channelled to the President through her. Singapore was supposed to be an exception led by Lee Kwan Yew who was an outstanding leader but certainly dictatorial and did not tolerate bribery and corruption. Development of Singapore is an amazing example for the whole world but what was done in the City State may not be replicated in other emerging economies.
Unfortunately, corruption has come to stay but the corrupt officials and leaders should at least ensure that the best quality projects are initiated so that all projects sponsored by them should produce a return over and above the commissions channelled into their pockets.
Performance of Yahapalana Government
In my opinion, the main achievement of the Yahapalana Government has been the creation of an environment free of threats which the citizenry was exposed to, if and when they criticized the Government. The white van culture which was a well-known strategy of certain authorities to overcome dissension of any form against the Government also prevailed. In fact, this article which I am writing could have resulted in my being subject to some form of retaliation. Unfortunately, the freedom granted has resulted in the freedom of the wild ass. Demonstrations and strikes became the order of the day resulting in disruption of normal life, blocking of roads, crowding of junctions and causing immense hardships to the travelling public.
One of the most apparent negative aspects of Yahapalanism was the open contradictions between Ministers of the two partners in the coalition and even worse contradictory statements being made between Ministers of the same partner in Government. Furthermore, the official Government spokesman credibility was in question as he was found at times to literally shoot from the hip, without proper information and being contradicted soon after by another authority.
The second shortcoming has been the lack of publicity for the work done by the Government with the newspapers only highlighting the negative issues. Fortunately for Sajith Premadasa, the Sirasa TV has given him an almost open license and every evening he gets coverage for opening a new village which has now numbered over 80 villages a significant achievement at that. The number of housing projects concluded in Colombo for the poor has not been properly highlighted when I believe considerable progress has been done.
Another aspect is the lack of proactive interventions by some of the Government Ministers. Very often they give into demands only under the pressure of strike action. The classic incident is the unacceptable increase of kerosene prices to Rs. 175 per litre being reduced to Rs.70 per litre. I wonder why they could not fix it at Rs.70/- without causing undue hardship to the poorest of the poor who use kerosene for cooking and the fisherman to whom kerosene is absolutely essential to earn a livelihood.
In the remaining 18 months or so the Yahapalanites should be more proactive and also publicize the programme that they are talking about to alleviate the suffering of the masses by taking steps to reduce the cost of living.
The Yahapalana Government has been singularly unfortunate in having to face continuous natural disasters like floods, landslides and also droughts within the same small country. Furthermore, there is no doubt that they inherited a debt-ridden economy with huge commitments on unviable projects such as the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport which also includes a network of superhighways on which huge sums of money must have been invested. There is also a large modern convention centre built by the Koreans in the Hambantota which is hardly being used.
There is no doubt that Sri Lanka is in serious economic difficulties with huge repayments of debt due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 far beyond our revenue earning capacity to pay. There are two ways to meet these obligations. One is literally sell the family silver. We have already done so by leasing out the Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease which is in effect an outright sale. Unfortunately, even this transaction appears to have been not properly done as it is now reported that the last tranche US$.585 Mn will not be released until the SLPA agrees to allow the Chinese to have an extent of man-made land to set up an entertainment complex including gambling. This will pose a serious problem for the Government. The present Government is contemplating some sort of similar arrangement for the Mattala Airport. After the withdrawal of the only Airline FlyDubai from the airport, it has become a truly plane-less airport. Considering the investment of over US$.200 Mn on an airport constructed in the middle of elephant country thus depriving the elephants of their homeland and also supposedly in the flight paths of migrant birds which have at times fouled up the turbojet engines of some planes, this creation is, to say the least, a catastrophe.
Perhaps the second way is to reschedule outstanding debts which appear to be too high for rescheduling and can only be perhaps restructured if some of the debt is waived which is unlikely.
The third strategy is to have a rapid increase in export income. This has been supported by the Export development Board the Chairperson of which has targeted US$. 17.9 Bn income from exports in 2017. However, it is very likely that the imports too will increase markedly as some imports will also be required to service the export programme. Furthermore, oil prices at present around US$.80 for Brent Crude will also remain at these levels or increase further due to the global uncertainties caused to an extent by President Trumps incoherent trade policies. It is likely that the imports of motor vehicles also will continue at an increasing trend.
The Central Bank Governor, for whom I have the greatest respect, assures us that economy has improved and is sound. In fact, he claimed that the total reserves of the country which are at around US$.9 Bn will increase to US$.12 Bn by December. The Central Bank also made a statement a few weeks ago to the effect that they cannot understand why the rupee is devaluing further when the economy is sound. However, the rupee continues to depreciate regardless and has now reached an all-time low of around Rs.160 to the dollar.
On June 11, the Governor made a veiled threat that the depreciation could be due to speculative transactions and that the Central Bank will take steps to prevent such speculation. The only practical speculation I can think of is the practice of exporters in delaying remittance of their proceeds back to Sri Lanka and also exchange brokers holding onto dollars as long as it is possible for them to do so. This will be the obvious thing to do when the depreciating trend continues without any change. My suggestion to our respected Governor is that the Central Bank should intervene at least for a short period and raise the value of the rupee. When this is done all the dollars that are being retained overseas will come flowing back. Thereafter he can resume his normal strategy in not intervening in the foreign exchange market.
There is no purpose in preaching to the average citizen of the country of a sound economy and about vision 2025 when the large mass of the population is struggling to make ends meet. Nor is there any purpose in wasting Parliament time by an economist of the UNP, to explain the differences between the social market economy of the UNP and the socialist market economy articulated by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, in his address to his organisation Vithyamaga. It was interesting to notice that he had invited many traditional private sector leaders who are normally strong UNP supporters but were seen prominently seated in the front row.
On the other hand, the newspapers are full of those who benefitted from the largesse of Arjun Aloysius of Perpetual Treasuries, W A Mendis & Co., and Walt & Row, from which companies in this group 118 parliamentarians and altogether 160 individuals are supposed to have received handouts. In my opinion, there is no purpose in deliberating and wasting time on this issue. The Secretary to the President has obviously received instructions not to reveal certain aspects of the report which will incriminate more top leaders. After making certain conflicting statements he has now archived the report at the Government Archives from which it is not legally possible to extract information for the next 30 years.
After the debacle faced by the Yahapalana Government at the local Government elections and the unsuccessful no-confidence motion against the PM, the response from the partners of the Yahapalana Government is, to say the least incredible. The President has quoted from the headlines of one of the newspapers has lambasted the PM and the TRC directly under the President has withdrawn one of the licenses issued to TNL which belongs to the PMs brother. Fortunately, the PMs advice to his followers is not to react thereby not causing another issue for debate.
Sadly although various statements have been made to initiate a special programme of work to elevate the suffering of the people no detailed integrated programme has yet been publicized. Unless this is done and implemented forthwith the country will only deteriorate further with the law and order situation also appearing to be out of control with daily murders and assassinations of so-called drug runners. Where the country is heading is anyones guess.

Why children  need poetry
Poetry is a form of expression that we all seem to love as young children. The rhythms in poetry are exciting to small children who love to dance and move to rhythms and sing rhymes. But, by the time were adults, something has happened to our love of poetry.
Most likely, children are having some negative experiences with poetry in school and are not getting enough positive experiences with poetry anywhere else.
I remember loving poetry when I was young, just like I loved music, but I began to feel stressed about poetry when, in junior high, we had to memorize and recite poetry in front of the class. I dont know where you stand on public speaking, but most people fear it. In fact, a recent survey indicated that Americans number one fear is public speaking. Just to add a little perspective, fear of clowns is number eleven on the list. So, were combining poetry with something we fear more than clowns.
As has happened for others, poetry became associated with the stress of public speaking for me. And since pretty much every time we studied poetry in junior high school, a teacher would make me memorize and recite in front of the class, poetry began to equal stress for me.
This is a common poetry experience for anyone. 
It turns out that there are some important developmental benefits of poetry for children. Poetry helps in language development, creative language skills, creativity, writing skills, self-expression, and in the development of natural rhythms.
Poetry is important for children, and poetry is good for adults as well. As noted in Kavi Mal Uyana authored by W P Somawardana, prescribed for children from Grade I to 13, poetry reading and interpretation demand analysis and critical thinking, important skills for all of us.
Making poetry available and fun for children is an important part of a childs education. As parents, we may know that reading is important but not stop to think about the value of poetry. Children really do benefit from positive experiences with poetry. - Reviewed by Darshana Ratnayake

Dont employ army deserters
The Sri Lanka Army yesterday said the Military Police along with State agencies are arresting army deserters, repeatedly failed to receive general amnesties for legal discharge or report back to their Army formations for discharge procedures.
The Army in a press release reminded the public that to provide employments or harbouring army absentees or deserters is a punishable offence,
The full text:
It has been noted that sections of Army deserters or those absent without leave (AWOL), some of them still in hiding, are reportedly involved in committing criminal acts, robberies and various anti-social acts in different parts of the island.
In many instances, most of those elements operate under the cover or patronage of businessmen, underworld leaders, employers and different other stakeholders and resort to anti-social acts as per Police reports. Furthermore, some of them appear to seek refuge from some politically powerful elements and members of the clergy.
It is pertinent to remind here that provision of employment or harbouring of those Army absentees or deserters amounts to breach of the countrys existing law and is an offence punishable in Court (133 of the Penal Code).
Respective Police stations as well as Sri Lanka Military Policemen with the assistance of state agencies are continuing operations island-wide to arrest those elements since they have repeatedly failed to receive general amnesties for legal discharge or report back to their relevant Army formations for discharge procedures.
The Sri Lanka Army Headquarters therefore appeals all concerned in earnest to desist from aiding or abetting them, harbouring or using them for any anti-social acts since such misdeeds reflect negatively on the Army image, although the Army could not hold any responsibility for such involvements.

Chandimal pleased with Sri Lankan fightback
I was prepared well  for this series - Gabriel
GROS ISLET, St Lucias: The ball-tampering incident might have been the more talked about part of the second Windies v Sri Lanka Test in Gros Islet, but the action in the middle was pretty riveting, and when it ended, the home side were 147/5 in their chase of 296, leaving one wondering what might have happened with a few more hours of cricket.
Sri Lanka, after losing the first of three Tests by 226 runs, came back well, but the star of the Test was Shannon Gabriel. With returns of 5/59 and 8/62, the 30-year-old Trinidad & Tobago paceman had his best innings and match figures, and there were no doubts who the Player of the Match would be at the end of the tense draw. Gabriel also reached the 100-wicket mark in the process in his 34th Test.
Its a great feeling, he said afterwards of reaching the milestone. If someone told me, Shannon, youll play Tests and take 100 wickets, I wouldve told him, youre crazy! Id like to thank family and friends for supporting me.
I was prepared well for this series, getting myself fit. As long as you get wickets, pains and aches go away. I was supported well by Kemar (Roach), he was unlucky. Miguel Cummins kept coming at the batsmen. (Jason) Holder was also very good. Anything other than a loss is good. We can take plenty of positives from this Test.
One of the problems for the Windies was the number of no-balls they bowled, on occasion missing out on wickets as a result too.
Getting wickets off no-balls is a concern, something we need to pay attention to. We were better overall, were a lot more behind the line. But it hasnt gone unnoticed, said Holder, the Windies captain who himself was guilty of the offence on one occasion.
On the whole, though, Holder was happy to hold on to end the game on level terms and carry the 1-0 advantage into the final Test, a day-night affair in Barbados from 23 June.
We played reasonable cricket, probably not at our best, he said. We werent as consistent and disciplined as we should have been. They played well. All in all, a decent effort, I thought we were more clinical in Trinidad.
Sri Lanka, distracted by the events on the third day when the umpires changed the match ball and awarded the Windies five penalty runs and the aftermath of it  captain Dinesh Chandimal has been charged for altering the condition of the ball  battled well and got into a position they could push on for a win from. On the final day, well as Kraigg Brathwaite played in scoring 59 not out, poor weather came to the Windies aid too.
Im really happy with the way we played through the five days, we played outstanding cricket. Weather permitting, there was a chance, but pleased overall, said Chandimal, who scored 119 not out and 39 in a good Test personally.
Credit to the West Indies bowling attack, theyve got some good bowlers. Its hard to score big runs in these conditions. We have to improve a little more as a team. Credit also to Gabriel, his hard work has paid off, he said.

Increasing savings AND investment essential
The rate of investment and domestic savings supplemented with foreign direct investment will be the most pertinent determinants to achieve desired 6 % economic growth in Sri Lanka, said Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Senior Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Emphasising that savings and investment gap to be financed through portfolio investment, increased foreign direct investment and loan and grant inflows to the government, Dr. Nandalal said that in Sri Lanka, investment as a percentage of GDP is hovering around 32%-35% while domestic savings has tendered to hover around 25-28%.
He made these remarks speaking at EU- Sri Lanka Trade related assistance workshop on Investment Negotiations.
So, it is essential to increase domestic savings and attract higher amounts of foreign investment to achieve the desired growth rate.
Underscoring the importance of adopting a rule based transparent system to attract FDI into Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal said, there is a gap between what is available in domestic savings and what is required to attract investment into the country .This where foreign investments come into play. The deputy governor also stressed that those who bring in money to Sri Lanka should be encouraged and given concessions.
Quoting Global Investment Report 2018, Sonali Wijeratne, Director General of Commerce, Department of Commerce speaking at the event said global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 23 per cent in 2017. Cross-border investment in developed and transition economies dropped sharply, while growth was near zero in developing economies.
With only a very modest recovery predicted for 2018, this negative trend is a long-term concern for policymakers worldwide, especially for developing countries, where international investment is indispensable for sustainable industrial development.
Structural impacts of the digital economy on foreign direct investment are posing formidable challenges for developing and least developing countries. Developing countries also need to contain rising challenges such as negative trends in global investment scenario. Developing countries are beset by structural constraints and lack of adequate infrastructure, scarce facilities to finance, strategic issues and domestic labor shortages, she noted. Wijeratne also underscored the need to create a conducive investment environment in the face of troubling global picture characterized by open, transparent and non-discriminatory investment policies.
Dayaratna Silva, National Project Coordinator-EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance program speaking at the workshop noted that free trade negotiations are key components of the governments policy agenda and modern free trade agreements are going beyond trade and goods encompassing a wide range of trade policy issues such as investments.
I believe sound investment policies, aimed at attracting FDI is an important component of the development strategy and Sri Lankas investment policies too should fall in line with industrial policies.
Industrial policy shouldnt be a taboo world. In certain circles, it is a taboo world.
According to the World Investment Report 2018, 101 countries have adopted industrial development strategies during the last decade.
The report also shows that new types of industrial policies have emerged, responding to the opportunities and challenges associated with a new industrial revolution.

IPM NHRC 2018 to Revolutionize HR in a Digital World
IPM Sri Lanka, held its Annual National Human Resource Conference at the BMICH recently which explored the opportunities and challenges for organizations, its people, human resource management and HR professionals in an increasingly digital world.
Transformation of HR in the Digital World was the theme of the Conference which is a much looked forward to event by the HR and business fraternity in Sri Lanka. The IPM NHRC 2018 is considered to be the largest HR conclave in South Asia.
IPM NHRC 2018 organizing committee headed by Priyankara Seneviratne, Chairman and his team put together a compelling agenda over the two days.
The Conference was inaugurated with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp by the Chief Guest Navin Dissanayake, Minister of Plantation Industries, Keynote Speaker Mark. G. Prothero, Chief Executive Officer, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives, IPM President, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, IPM CEO, P. G. Tennakoon, Chairman Organizing Committee IPM NHRC 2018,Priyankara Seneviratne and other invitees.
IPM President, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri said, I have a personal perspective in this years conference theme. Digitization is the current fad, currency and focal point. In my view this is only another phase that we are going through, a phase of change and disruption.
HR leaders, managers and policy makers have a huge challenge ahead of them when formulating national HR goals into the macro picture. I as a policy maker find it rather frustrating that we as a country do not have an HR roadmap of what human resource management, how it can be formulated, how it should be done and could be done, the Minister said.
Several other events including panel dissuasions were held.
The grand finale of the IPM Great HR Debate was held soon after the inauguration of the Conference at which Toyota Lanka emerged as winners while MAS Capital emerged as runners up. Hayleys Plantation Sector which was selected as the organization with the most unique HR initiative in the IPM Great HR Practices competition shared their thoughts on the unique initiative with the audience.

Navy earns Rs. 5,600 mn profit from sea marshalling
The Navy earned Rs. 5,600 million by sea marshalling after the Good Governance Government came into power, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing a press conference held at the Independence Arcade during the public mobile service organized by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to mark the 40th anniversary of the Urban Development Authority.
He said the Avant Garde unduly gained an equivalent profit from the Navy by providing the same service before the government came into power and that money had to be remitted to the Navys Account.
The authorities should investigate the persons that Aloysius gave money as well as those the Avant Garde and Entrust Company paid money illegally, the Minister said.
The Minister said the spokesman for the Avant Garde was a henchman of a former corrupted officer. He said this spokesman said Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Arjuna Ranatunga and he (the Minister) asked money earlier from him. I challenge him to prove it with the telephone numbers, the Minister said. I complained the issue to the CID but they said it was a civil matter, the Minister said.
The Minister said the Avant Garde was caught with illicit floating armouries. The law is not implemented against the rich and powerful, the Minister said.
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana was present.

## Title: Plot by PLOTE to overthrow Gayoom in the Maldives

Plot by PLOTE to overthrow Gayoom in the Maldives
Eighty well-trained PLOTE militant cadres armed with AK-47s, grenades, heavy machine guns and mortars were sailed off the Mulaithivu shores of Eastern Sri Lanka on October 30, 1988. Four stolen fishing boats were used for the voyage which headed to a destination 750 km South-west of the island in the Indian Ocean.
The island of Male, the capital of Maldives, was invaded by Sri Lankas terrorist leader, Uma Maheswaran exactly 30 years ago. The Maldives, Sri Lanka and India are the nations that got involved in that unique event in the history of Coup de 'Tats, which is generally considered a minor episode because coups and conspiracies were so common in the history of the archipelago.
The Maldives, the popular tourist destination is a glamorous sequence of coral islands numbering over 1,000and situated 600 km from Indias West coast and 750 km South-west of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamil terrorist group led by Vasanthi ran out of food and water in mid-sea, as a result of the unusual time taken in spotting the 26 main Atolls. They were arranged in two chains called the Maldives. The sailors, hungry and thirsty, were overjoyed with the sight of lights around midnight of November 2, 1988, ending a four-day ordeal in violent seas of Indian Ocean. The Nothern militants landed in Male, the capital of archipelago on November 3, around 4 am; they did check their arms and ammunition on priority.
The terrorist outfit of Peoples Liberation of Tamil Eelam carried out the assault in the wee hours of 3rd November 1988. A Maldivian businessman hired the outfit converting it to a mercenary army. The intention was to invade Male in a brutal attack and topple its legitimately elected government. President Abdul Gayoom was to be arrested too. However, some political analysts believe, it was Uma himself, who instigated the move for reasons that we intend to discuss here.
In the Maldives, the governments are repetitively under threat. Its a poor tiny nation where in the early 1980s suffered two attempts to overthrow President Gayoom, but he was able to thwart them successfully. On November 3, 1988, the attack went effortlessly as the Maldives didnt possess an army. The 1,400-strong National Security contingent [NSS] was trained in and responsible for policing, firefighting and various other security assignments. The major task assigned to PLOTE cadres was to counteract the NSS. PLOTE did it within a short time by killing a few guards and taking over the complex. They went on to capture the power supply units, harbour, TV and radio stationsall within a few hours. The main installation was brought under them. They took full control of the one and a half square km-island, Male, with a population of 35,000 people, probably the smallest capital city in the world. A walk around the island takes less than an hour. The President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom escaped unhurt in the encounter.
By noon the same day, they held on to the entire Maldives. Next, the unexpected happened; assigned task had been satisfactorily fulfilled, the PLOTE cadres went on rampage looting shops and restaurants for food and valuables.
The conspiracy was hatched in Colombo
Abdullah Luthufi was a Maldivian businessman who ran a poultry farm in Sri Lanka. He met Uma Maheshwaran, a former Land Surveyor who is trained in Guerilla warfare under PLO in Syria and Lebanon. The conspiracy was hatched in Bambalapitiya. What motivated the businessman remains a mystery; it is not clear whether he wanted himself to become the head of Maldives or that he anticipated former President Ibrahim Nasir back as head of state.
Maheshwaran alias Mukudan was the former head of LTTE [1977 to 1980], who was chased away by Prabhakaran in 1980. He formed the new group PLOTE and being fallen on hard times was on the lookout for a base. Prabhakaran began to eliminate his competitors, since the arrival of IPKF [Indian Peace Keeping Force], forcing some smaller groups to seek refuge with IPKF. However, Uma was not in IPKFs good books. Maheshwaran under threat from both sides was desperately looking for options. Maheshwaran wanted Luthufi to accompany his men to the islands on October 30, 1988.
The invaders made two major fatal mistakes by not taking over International Telecommunication facility and failing to capture Gayoom. It cost them heavily. The plan carried-out was only partly successful.
Gayoom appeals for intervention
President Gayoom tactfully contacted a few heads of state including USA, UK and Indian Prime Minister at dawn on November 3, and begged for help. Reagan and Thatcher ignored the requests, Gandhi summoned a conference with military and foreign affairs chiefs; a decision was made to intervene. The operation was code-named, Cactus: a parachute brigade and a commando unit of 1,600 were dispatched to Male. The troops left in massive IL-76 aircraft, while a naval craft accepted men, jeeps, helicopters, and field guns in a display of South East Asias regional military power. The triumph for the invaders was a short-lived one: in their afternoon news, BBC announced a rescue operation in Male by Indian para-troopers and a military contingent of hundreds of army commandos. The fighter jets whiz passed over the islands, the helpless PLOTE cadres minus their leader Vasanthi, heard the deafening noise. Paratroopers of Brigadier Farooq Balsara had begun landing on the airstrip in Hulule. The Indians commenced their counter-attack: PLOTE cadres began to panic.
The duty-free shops were looted by PLOTE at gunpoint before they got away grabbing 27 Maldivian hostages. PLOTE invaders hijacked a ship named Progress Light and sailed away leaving behind the bodies of 19 colleagues. The beleaguered leader desperately contacted Tamil Nadu seeking refuge for his men, which was rudely turned down. Indian navy was hunting for the ship, while the Sri Lankan government announced that their Navy had been ordered to destroy it if it approached its territorial waters.
The mid sea hostage drama
On November 5, Indians had found it, they were ordered to surrender, but the PLOTE men refused, creating a hostage drama as the Progress Light was heading for Sri Lanka. Finally, Indian Navy demonstrated their firepower; but failed to convince the militants. As the insurgents were not ready for surrender, Indians were left with just one option. Maldivian Transport Minister Ahmed Mujutuba and his wife were among the hostages; Indian Commander Gopalachari said the invaders warned him to maintain a distance of six miles to prevent the murder of hostages. By midnight on November 5, endurance on both parties began to exhaust. The terrorist reacted vengefully as Indians reached to a close one mile: two of the 27 hostages, Rehman and Sattar were dragged near the deck, and in a ghastly sight they blew-off their heads.
New Delhi ordered them to act fast. A helicopter pilot flew and remained stationary above and dropped a depth charge on the engine room destroying it. A few panicked invaders jumped into the water; four hostages died. Commandos boarded the ship ending the dramas second episode.
Sing Administration ignored the 2012 Coup in the Maldives. A change of policy following Gandhi assassination by the LTTE.
Uma-Luthufi conspiracy could have succeeded, not for Rajiv Gandhi. They would have created a dictatorship in the Maldives, perhaps under Sri Lankan terrorist, Uma Maheshwaran. The businessman Luthufi told an Indian journalist,
Uma Maheswaran came up to me in my poultry farm near Colombo and requested me to take over the country. Anybody can be the President of a nation like the Maldives. If only blessings had been with us; If only the Indian troops had not come, or at least delayed by a few more hours...

Afghanistan cricket: The new graduates from the school of hard knocks
Keith Miller, Australias flamboyant all-rounder from the 50s, was once asked if he felt any pressure playing cricket. A Royal Australian Fighter Pilot during World War 2, Miller famously replied saying Ill tell you what pressure is. Pressure is a Messerschmitt up youre a---e. Playing cricket is not.
The boys from Afghanistan, the latest entrants to crickets elite test club, can more than relate to the late Hall-of-Famers words. Doused in stories of violence and tragedy, the rise has been incredible, and most heart-warming. Their biggest names have scars that are far more serious than leather ball bruises.
The portly, immensely likable Mohammad Shahzad, who idolizes MS Dhoni and insists on being referred to as MS, was born in a Peshawar refugee camp and spent his first eight years enveloped by barbed wire and stern Pakistani guards. Shapoor Zadran, who took Afghanistan over the line for their first ever world cup win, has been attacked by terrorists more than once.
Mohammad Nabis father has been kidnapped for ransom in the recent past. Their superstar Rashid Khan was playing in the IPL just a few weeks ago when bombs ripped through a local game in his home city of Jalalabad, killing eight and injuring dozens. His teammate Karim Sadiq carried the wounded while Khan appealed for peace and understanding. They have crossed hurdles that most athletes have hardly encountered, and arrived in India wearing smiles that hide more misery than most can handle.
Salim Durrani, Indias yesteryear swashbuckler who flirted with Bollywood and was born in Kabul, was a part of the welcoming committee in Bangalore. It was a nice touch, reminding us of once shared borders, and a common interest in sports, film, music and the arts. If Hollywood was even remotely interested in cricket, this had the potential of a feel-good blockbuster, a tearjerker that goes beyond just being extraordinary in the cricket world, but across all sports.
They deserved a packed stadium, but that seemed wishful thinking on a workday morning in a city filled with people chasing their dreams. A smattering of a few hundred spectators that increased as the day went on and word spread that Indias delightful batting line up was on display, cheered generously.
The rotund Shahzad was applauded every time he touched the ball, and naughty cheers of RCB rang out when the home teams IPL nemesis Rashid Khan began doing his thing. The Afghan flags in the crowd were hard to miss, waved relentlessly by students like Hazrat Umar Shenwari from Nangarhar, who currently studies business administration in Hyderabad and is a part of a community of 1,000-odd Afghan students there. He proudly wears a Pashteen hat right through the day.
This team brings happiness to everyone in Afghanistan he beamed, as he continued to wave that flag, whether Dhawan swatted a four or Rashid Khan beat the bat.
The fact that they are here in the first place is scarcely believable. They are currently the only cricket playing country in the world where the colonials didnt influence the game. Ironically, it took two non-cricketing nations for them to gravitate towards cricket. When the cold war superpowers Russia and the US were settling ego scores on Afghani soil, millions spilled into Pakistan with nothing to lose. Many of them returned, sometimes with hopes of building a new life, and infected by cricket. The border was virtually open for decades, with unaccounted thousands crossing over each day to escape a war that they had little to do with. If that wasnt bad enough, along came the Taliban to rule post-war Afghanistan.
Their imposed excesses stretched from forbidding girls from going to school to banning cricket, burying a million dreams and silencing a generation. The US-led invasion followed, driving the Taliban up the hills but also reducing playing fields to rubble. Large parts of the country reeled under relentless bombing, suicide attacks, and senseless violence, and cricket was the last thing on a young kids mind until even a few years ago. Yet, here they are today, from not having a national team to playing all three formats, all within the last decade.
Over two days in Bengaluru, they played for the joy of sports, sometimes swinging from the hip like an impetuous child as Matthew Hayden said on air. Bred on a fast food cricket diet, they failed to build an innings of substance with the bat, and their spinning stars didnt prise batsmen out via the hard grind that test cricket demands.
They got bowled out twice in two sessions, denying the Chinnaswamy of a potential bumper weekend.
They arent ready yet by far, and its going to be a long, hard road ahead to make a mark in test cricket. But long, hard roads filled with tough battles, scars, losses and heartbreaks have hardly deterred this bunch in the past, have they now  sk

Amendments to KDU (Special Provisions) bill sought: FEMTA
The Dean and the Academic Staff of the Colombo University Medicine Faculty have sent a letter to President Mathripala Sirisena to take immediate action to amend the KDU (Special Provisions) Bill, Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association of Sri Lanka (FFMTA) sources said.
They had requested the President to amend the Bill taking into account the recommendations made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the State Medical Faculties.
They pointed out in the letter the importance of maintaining the highest standards of medical education and competencies of health professionals in Sri Lanka without prejudice and conflict of interest.
The letter says SAITM students with minimum advanced level qualifications of two credit passes (C) and one simple pass stipulated by the SLMC in 2010 are eligible to enter medical schools. Those who have already completed the SAITM study programme should complete an additional mandatory training recommended by the SLMC and must face an examination to access competency.
It was explicitly acknowledged by the SAITM and the Government that the training and clinical exposure of these students were inadequate.
Copies of the letter had been forwarded to the Prime Minister, Health Minister, Higher Education Minister and to all the other relevant authorities, the sources said.

Australia slip to 34-year low in ICC ODI rankings
Defeats in the first two ODIs against England have sent Australia tumbling to a 34-year low in the ICC rankings. They have slipped to sixth place, and will need to win at least one of the three remaining games in the series to climb back above Pakistan to fifth.
According to cricket.com.au, the last time Australia found themselves in sixth position was back in January 1984.
Australias rankings situation reflects their downturn as an ODI side since beating Pakistan in a home series in January 2017. Thereafter, they have lost 13 of their 15 completed ODIs, in which time they have lost three successive bilateral series - to New Zealand, India and England - and exited the Champions Trophy at the group stage.

Avant-Garde corruption case: Gotas revision petition taken on July 2
A revision application filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seeking an order to stay the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court proceedings in the Avant-Garde corruption case was yesterday fixed for support on July 2 by the Court of Appeal.
When the matter came up before two-judge-bench comprising Justice Achala Wengappuli and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, President's Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa requested for a further date to support the application after perusing several documents. Through this petition Gotabaya Rajapaksa is also challenging Colombo Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case. The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury.
In his revision petition, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has challenged Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and Chief Magistrate's decision to fix the matter for trial. At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had also turned down a request made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others that they be released from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission over Avant-Garde incident.
Rajapaksa is also seeking an order to set-aside the Colombo High Court's order dated February 2, 2018.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had raised preliminary objections alleging that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against eight accused including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.

Bangladesh call up 34-year-old Tushar for Sri Lanka A series
The Bangladesh Cricket Board included experienced domestic campaigner Tushar Imran in the 15-member squad for the first of three four-day matches, scheduled to start from June 26 against Sri Lanka A.
The selectors, however, haven't yet named the captain for the series.
Tushar, who is the only batsman from the country, to score over 10,000 runs in first-class cricket, played just five Tests and 41 ODIs in five years since making his international debut in 2002 before being dumped from the set-up. However, after a long time, the veteran batsman has made a comeback into the national reckoning, at the age of 34.
''He is scoring consistently in the domestic tournament, so we wanted to provide him with a chance to see where he stands against international opponents,'' chief selector Minhajul Abedin said.
''If he is able to perform, naturally, we will think of him in a broader perspective but it is also a fact that everyone who scores heavily in the domestic tournament isn't successful in the international arena. Let's see where he stands in the series against the Sri Lanka A team,'' he added. The first of the three four-day matches will start on June 26 at the Sheikh Kamal International Cricket Stadium, while the second game will take place at the same venue from July 3. The third and final match of the series will be played at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium from July 10. The four-day games will be followed by three List A matches, scheduled to be played on July 17, 19 and 22 respectively in Sylhet.

Beware the next Asian debt crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserves latest interest hike this week is an uncomfortable reminder to Asian borrowers about the risks of financial complacency.
Businesses and households in the region have for too long appeared oblivious of the danger of a new debt crisis, despite growing warnings of such risks -- and the fact that even after two hikes already in 2018, the Fed is signaling there are more to come before the year is out.
Can Asian debtors have been lulled into a false sense of security by steps taken after the 1997 Asian crisis to prevent a recurrence, or is it just that debt crises are rarely foreseen until it is too late
Corporate and personal debt has reached record levels around the world, including in Asia, in terms of absolute amounts of money involved. Moreover, in a number of Asian economies (China, South Korea and Japan stand out) the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is well in excess of that in most economies elsewhere.
Multilateral institutions, notably the International Monetary Fund, are sounding the alarm. But clear signs of distress are already evident closer to home.
In India, the government-owned State Bank of India, the largest lender, has just reported its biggest ever quarterly loss of $1.1 billion owing to bad loans. In China, bad loan ratios are low relative to those elsewhere but the government and state-controlled lenders have been cracking down heavily -- and publicly -- on companies seen as over-borrowed, such as property group Dalian Wanda Group.
These developments predate the upward run in U.S. interest rates, which is pushing up borrowing costs across Asia -- notably in Indonesia where the central bank has hiked rates to defend a fragile rupiah. Malaysia and the Philippines raised rates earlier in the year. India followed suit with an increase this month.
Across Asia, corporate borrowers are feeling the squeeze from rising borrowing costs. Investors in Asian companies high-yield bonds are now demanding a 6.8% yield against 5.1% in January and the spread over U.S. high-yield bonds has widened to 0.7 percentage points from negligible levels. Emerging market borrowers, especially in China, South Korea and India, face high refinancing risks this year and next as debts are rolled over.
The Asian crisis should have made this region ultra-sensitive to the danger of debt crises. Instead, there seems to be an unwarranted degree of complacency that all is well, and debt continues to pile up, having surged especially in 2017.

I remember that tour when the Indians led by Contractor came to the Caribbean.
During the first Test a fast moving bouncer bowled by Griffith hit Contractor on the head cracking his skull. He returned to India where he died.
I was watching the second Test where Mendis and Chandimal were facing a battery of fast bowlers each hurling a barrage of bouncers. They were batting from the crease and visibly uncomfortable.
The dynamics of a fast moving projectile can be changed if the batsman bats about two to three feet outside the crease turning an in swinging and out swinging Yorker into a juicy half volley. The wicket keeper will inform the bowler who will change his run-up. Then return to the crease. Otherwise you will be hoisted with your own petard.

Shifting Agriculture Ministry to previous location
Committee to study legal procedure
A six-member expert committee, headed by Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando, has been appointed by the Agriculture Minister to study the legal procedure of shifting the Agriculture Ministry to its previous location.
The committee consists of six members - Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando, Attorney-at-Law Jagath Wickremanayake, Attorney-at-Law Ashoka Weerasuriya, former Assistant Auditor General D. L. P. Dias, Civil Engineer Chandana Edirisuriya and Agriculture Ministry Legal Officer L. G. Hector.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera charged that the use of the DPJ building for the Agriculture Ministry is a national crime.
The DPJ Tower building is not suitable for the Agriculture Ministry and more than Rs. 21 million needs to be paid per month as the building rent, he said.
The lease agreement for the building has been signed for five years and the ministry will have to pay more than Rs. 950 million by then.
Considering these facts, the minister has appointed the expert committee to find out the legal validity of the lease agreement, building rent that has been already spent and other expences, etc.
The minister has instructed the committee to hand over the final report and recommendations within two months.
The minister has handed over a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to give the former building of the Agriculture Ministry - Govijana Mandiraya - back to the ministry.

Corruption High Court opens on July 15
Sri Lankas first special high court to try high-profile bribery and corruption cases will open on July 15, Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said.
Mannapperuma said that the long delays in the resolution of court cases is a main obstacle for the present government to ensure good governance. This special court will hear cases involving money laundering, bribery and large financial crimes, dishonest misappropriation of property, and criminal breach of trust by public servants daily.
Refuting allegations levelled against the government claiming that the government failed to take action against those involved in large scale fraud and corruption cases during the previous regime, the Deputy Minister said the FCID had received around 335 cases so far, out of which 99 reports have been investigated and handed over to the Attorney General. Only 15 cases had been filed in the High Court.
Proper functioning of the court system of the country was not considered as a necessity during the previous regime, because the leaders of the previous regime used to do everything by taking law into their hands, he added.

Over tax evasion charges:
Cristiano Ronaldo accepts 2-year prison sentence
Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly accepted a two-year prison sentence in order to settle his tax evasion court case.
The five-time Ballon dOr winner was taken to task last June after being accused of defrauding the Spanish government of 12.9m by prosecutors. And despite having denied wrongdoing from the onset, he is understood to have accepted a suspended prison sentence as he looks to bring an end to proceedings. According to El Mundo, the player has admitted his guilt and has agreed to the above. He will also pay the sum of 16.4m.The Portugueses first settlement offer was rejected by prosecutors, but they have finally found common ground. And, as a result of the player being a first-time offender, he wont be spending any time behind bars; although that could change if he is taken to task for subsequent infractions within the set, two-year period.
The Madrid mans lawyers had initially claimed that the player didnt break any laws, all he did was follow criteria that the tax inspectors dont like. However, Ronaldo has decided that accepting a sentence and settling financially will be the best way forward. He was firstly ordered to pay the entire sum owed up front but all parties have agreed on Ronaldo paying just 5m in the first instance, with the remainder to be handed over in the form of fines and interests over time.

It is in this context that Cyaniq.Social has stepped into the industry to take a specialized stand in the social media marketing space.
We have been able to rally a lot of interest around our initiatives in the Instagram related industry space and we hope to continue in this area. Weve been successful in being recognized by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority as a project of importance to developing tourism within the country and we are confident that other authorities as well as corporates will embrace The Collaborator Network as a valuable tool in the mass communication aspect. We are able to quickly deliver messages to a wide audience, making us ideal in crisis communication situations as well as in the dissemination of updates and alerts regarding current affairs, stated Dilshan in his comments after the event.
Following the introductory keynote delivered by Dilshan, two senior collaborators in The Network, Sharan Velauthan and Zainab Faizal shared their experiences of working with brands and their peers as collaborators.

## Title: Diaries of  Leonard Woolf
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, June 20, 2018 - 01:00
Diaries of  Leonard Woolf
The Sinhala translation of diaries of the well known colonial administrator cum creative writer Leonard Sydney Woolf (1880  1969) is significant due to several reasons. The Sinhala translation by the translator Chandrasri Ranasinghe is titled as Leonard Woolfge Dinapothe Nila Satahan (Jayakodi 2018) enters the book scene at a time when the Sinhala translation of his well known novel A Village in the Jungle known to the Sinhala reader as Baddegama is prescribed as a text for several local examinations.
The translation of Woolfs novel as well as the original work paved the way for several discussions on the role of the colonial rule as well as its outcome into the postcolonial literary activities on the part of several scholarly administrators such as Henry Parker, Hugh Neville, Emerson Tenant, Codrington and several others. Their profiles, as well as the works, became known not only to the local readers but also to the general English reading world. This resulted in the knowledge of the local culture inclusive of religious susceptibilities and cultural affiliations.
Nuances and patterns
The colonial rulers had much to gain as they gradually embraced the sensitive socio-religious nuances of the patterns of living and attitudes of the local masses. The translators preface to the selected diary entries that cover the period 1908  1911 is resourceful as it underlines various reasons for the genesis of the works.
The preface attempts to overview the arrival of the writer cum administrator Woolf to Ceylon in 1904, commencing his work in Jaffna Katcheriya. This account is followed by a short biography of Woolf presenting his background biographical details pertaining to parentage and academic career. The reader is made to know his intimate links with his wife the well known creative writer Virginia Woolf (1882  1941) and the struggles they encountered as a result of the various social upheavals.
This is followed by Woolfs journey to Hambantota down south assuming more and more day to day work meeting various types of people. This is the starting point of his diary writing that he kept in keeping with fivefold vision.
1. Gauge the exact type of work he was engaged in the daily routine.
2. Keep a record of some of the day to day experiences faced during a day.
3. Third, he was interested in keeping a record of some of the strange experiences of other people whom he encountered. They covered not only the known officials connected to his colonial duties but also others as well.
4. The types of regulations that he had to undergo during the performance of his duties as a chief colonial administrator. This segment includes the types of agreement as well as disagreement that he had to face with his own people as well as the minor officials.
5. He makes notes of his various punishments imposed on his subordinates as well as those who were branded as lawbreakers and tax dodgers.
Self-disciplined visionary
This plays a vital role as a sense of inspiration to write his narrative A Village in the Jungle. By way of a self-disciplined visionary, he held the colonial administrators way of spending the time in the following way:
To be born again in this way at the age of 24 is a strange experience which imprints a permanent mark upon ones character and ones attitude to life. I was learning in England, everyone and everything I know I was going to a place and life in which I really had not the faintest idea of how I should live and what I should be doing. (Growing)
Perhaps out of sheer interest in self-introspection, Woolf detoured from mere conventional diary entries of an administrator and left a brand for himself as a creative writer. This is visualised in some of the personal attitudes as entered in the form of diary notes. As such the result was not a mere official document but a creative process that transcended the seal of an administrator.
Imperialism and colonialism
It looks as if Woolf had a deep sense of perceiving various political concepts as they changed over the years. In his monograph titled as The Journey not that arrival matters, he stated that Imperialism and colonialism are today very dirty words, particularly East of Suez. I hoped if I revisited Ceylon, to be able to go to the places where I had worked as a government servant and see something of how now that Ceylon was a sovereign independent state their administration compared with ours. But to do this, I would need to have some help from the Sinhalese and Tamil administrators of today, and I feared that I might find them not unnaturally, contemptuous if not hostile. Would they not say, or at any rate think: Fifty years ago, you were ruling us here, an insolent, bloody-minded racialist and imperialist. Thank God, we have now got rid of you and really we dont want to be reminded of how you lorded it over us and exploited us.
With the exception of a few, all diary entries of Woolf are paved down to the minimum brevity. This enhances in the quality of readability. A discerning scholarly researcher may find a fund of invaluable resource material to pay heed to such aspects as intercultural and interracial issues. Further, the diary entries include sensitive areas such as poverty, hunting, agrarian factors, love, marriage, sicknesses, punishments, repentances, addictions to drugs and liquor, murder, hatred and ill will and legal disagreements. The clarity of thinking and the equivalent clarity in expression are seemingly the hallmark emblem that captures a certain degree of depth in these diary entries.

Dinesh Chandimal ball-tampering: SL captain banned
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal has been banned for one Test for ball-tampering against West Indies.
The 28-year-old seemed to apply saliva containing the residue of something he had in his mouth to the ball during the second Test in St Lucia.
Chandimal, who pleaded not guilty, has been banned by the International Cricket Council for the final Test in Bridgetown, which starts on Saturday.
Match referee Javagal Srinath said Chandimals defence was unconvincing.
He added: After reviewing the footage of the incident, it is clear that Dinesh applied an artificial substance to the ball.
During the hearing, he admitted to putting something in his mouth but couldnt remember what it was, which I found unconvincing as a defence, and the fact remains it was an artificial substance.
Umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould raised concerns about the condition of the ball on the second day of the second Test in St Lucia.
Sri Lanka players took to the field two hours late on the third day in protest, following lengthy discussions between Srinath and Sri Lankas coaching staff.
Chandimal was also given two suspension points and fined 100% of his match fee.
Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusingha and manager Asanka Gurusinha were also charged with conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game.
West Indies lead 1-0 in the three-Test series following the draw in St Lucia.
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was fined 100% of his match fee for licking his finger and shining the ball while eating a sweet in a Test against Australia in 2016.
In March, Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner were banned for a year and Cameron Bancroft nine months for their part in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.

Co-cabinet Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said today that President Sirisena spoke to the Mahanayaka Thera regarding granting a Presidential pardon for Ven Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara.
He, however, could not confirm whether this would materialize or not.
Addressing the weekly media briefing at the Department of Government Information in Colombo, the Minister was of the view that the government could not go against the law of the country to make an exception for the Bodu Bala Sena leader.
We cannot go against the decision of the courts. This is the legal system of the country. He is not the first monk in this country to be jailed. Ven. Somarama was jailed and sentenced to death for SWRD Bandaranaikes death; he went through the same procedure. S.B. Dissanayake was imprisoned for 2 years for insulting the courts.
He added that 18 religious leaders which included 15 Buddhist monks languished in prison for various crimes today.
When journalists pointed out with regard to Ven Gnanasara being asked to disrobe, the Minister stated that all prisoners under the law had to do so.
No matter what the Sangha laws are, there is a law in the country which has to be adhered to, he said.
We will have to amend the Prisons Ordinance if we are to give them special preference, but under the current law it cant be done.
He also explained that the Attorney Generals Department had not received the notice to appear in court when Ven Gnanasara Theras appeal was taken up in court on Tuesday.
The appeal has been postponed to June 22.

Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the four associations which took part in the discussion with the President are the GMOA, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), Independent Medical Specialists' Association and the University Medical Specialists' Association.
According to Dr. Aluthge, one of the main demands of the associations was imposing a maximum limit of 12 percent for the tax imposed on doctors and professionals. Establishing a system to maintain the transparency of the countrys expences was another demand.
During the discussion, the four organisations pointed out to the President the importance of facilities that should be given for professionals and not degrading them when formulating the tax policy, he said.

World Cup winning cricket captain and presently Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga expressed his gratitude to Roshan Mahanama, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Muthiah Muralitharan for taking a wise decision, not to walk into a trap and fall to gamblers.
The past legends declined the invitation extended by Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha to join SLC in the capacity as consultants to uplift Sri Lanka cricket.
Responding to queries posed by journalists Ranatuga stated that he condemned using senior cricketers to fulfill needs of the administration. He requested the Minister of Sports to establish a new procedure to save cricket.
The current cricket administration is trying to sell the names of senior cricketers for their sake. Even Ex- Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara appointed a committee, but nothing happened. Now, they are trying to put forward a few names of senior cricketers to use them. Im happy these former cricketers did not fall for the trap. All cricketers have to stand together against the cricket administration that has ruined our cricket, Ranatunga continued.
The womens cricket team was defeated by Thailand. Our cricket team had to face difficulties during the series with South Africa. If the government has not learnt a lesson by these defeats ours will be the only government which has ruined cricket in Sri Lanka. I regret to state that even I have fulfilled my responsibilities as a minister, but the President and the Prime Minister have failed to take proper action yet.
We barely upgraded cricket and another group has degraded cricket. I saw in the newspapers that 58 sports unions are urging the Sports Minister to hold the cricket elections. These are the people who have used money. We should investigate them. People should not criticize our cricketers, but at these people who have ruined our cricket, Minister Ranatunga further added.

NOTTINGHAM, Tuesday: England set a new record for the highest total ever scored in a mens one-day international when they went past 444 against Australia at Trent Bridge on Tuesday.
When Alex Hales, who already had a hundred to his name, hoisted Jhye Richardson for six in the 46th over it meant England had broken their own world record in mens one-day internationals. It was also at Trent Bridge where England set the previous record total at this level of 444 for three against Pakistan in 2016.
Hales eventually holed out for 147 on his Nottinghamshire home ground after opener Jonny Bairstow had made 139.
Eoin Morgan, Englands ODI captain, became the countrys highest run-scorer in this format during a 21-ball fifty -- the fastest by any England batsman in terms of balls faced -- on his way to 67.
Hales and Morgan were dismissed off successive deliveries as England finally finished on 481-6 off 50 overs. AFP

The direct requests for Radiological examinations come from Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, Chilaw Hospital and the other state hospitals located in the North Western Province will be rejected. He was addressing media during a press conference held in Colombo.
According to Epa, the transfers of radiological technologists was made in order to cover night duties in state hospitals in the North Western Province while to have a `control' over the membership of the union. This is very unreasonable.
Now 22 days passed since the union members started a work to rule campaign. There is no response from the relevant health authorities. Therefore the token strike and other trade union actions will be taken, he added.

The High Court Judge advised the defence to refrain from writing letters to the judges in this manner since court cannot hear incidents that are happening outside the courts.
Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing for the accused, informed Court that his clients have sent a letter urging Chief Justice to take appropriate action against two witnesses for bringing the Sri Lankan justice system and the legal system to contempt. A copy of the concerned letter had been sent to the Colombo High Court as well.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General questioned as to how the accused in a case directly writes to the judge. "If the said witnesses had expressed their views at a press conference regarding the case, equally the second accused Udaya Gammanpila had also made several statements regarding the case. The letter sent to the Judge had been signed by two accused. Their intention were to prejudice your honors mind".
Janet Shadick the wife Australian businessman Brian Shaddick had told in a press briefing held on May 26 that defence counsel were in an attempt to delay the conclusion of the case by obtaining further dates for cross-examination of witnesses.
During the press briefing, the two witnesses said that they were treated as criminals during the proceedings. Addressing the press briefing, Ms. Shadick said Sri Lankans should be ashamed of their legal system and it would be impossible to get justice for ordinary Sri Lankans. She further advised Sri Lankans not to litigate politicians or wealthy people because they would never win.

ICC apologises to Ireland,  Scotland for Super-Over error
The ICC has said that match referee David Jukes and the on-field umpires Allan Haggo and WPM van Liemt erred on Sunday at the end of the dramatic tie between Ireland and Scotland in Deventer and confirmed that a Super Over should have been played to determine a winner, in accordance with the ICCs playing conditions for T20Is.
The match officials misinterpreted the T20I playing conditions which prevented the Super Over taking place following a tied match, an ICC spokesperson had said on Tuesday.
This was a genuine oversight for which the ICC offers its sincere apologies to both Scotland and Ireland. We have picked up the matter with the officials and will mitigate against this happening in the future.
Irelands Stuart Thompson scampered a two to long-on off the final ball of the match to level the scores in a chase of 186. It was the tenth tied T20I, but instead of contesting a Super Over to decide the winner, both teams shook hands and walked off the field.
Under the ICC playing conditions for T20Is adopted on September 28, 2017, Law 16.3.1 reads: If the scores are equal, the result shall be a tie and no account shall be taken of the number of wickets that have fallen. In the event of a tied match the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine the winner.

Japan sinks 10-man Colombia in historic win for Asia
SARANSK, Russia, Tuesday: Japan beat 10-man Colombia 2-1 in Group H on Tuesday to become the first Asian side to beat a South American one at the World Cup.
Asian teams had managed three draws in 17 matches against South American sides but the four-times Asian champions made their extra man count after Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez became the first player to get a red card in Russia.
His sending-off in the third minute, for a deliberate handball, was the second fastest in World Cup history after Uruguays Jose Batista was dismissed after 55 seconds against Scotland in 1986.
Shinji Kagawa scored from the resulting penalty to give Japan the lead.
Juan Quinteros clever low free kick in the 39th minute brought Colombias equaliser but Yuya Osako leapt above his marker to head a corner into the net for the 73rd-minute winner.
It was sweet revenge for Japan, who were thumped 4-1 by Colombia in Brazil four years ago, but they wasted plenty of chances to kill the game off. Kagawa went close in the 16th minute but his shot rolled past the post and Osako fired against the face of goal from a dangerous position in the box.
With Japan dominating in midfield, Colombias Argentine coach Jose Pekerman opted to sacrifice Juan Cuadrado around the half hour mark to send on defensive midfielder Wilmar Barrios. That gave Colombia extra control and their all-time leading scorer and captain Radamel Falcao came more into the game.
Falcao, making his World Cup debut after missing the last tournament in Brazil due to injury, showed his hunger when he stretched full length to get his foot to an overhead cross but did not have the power to beat the goalkeeper.
Genki Haraguchis foul on Falcao earned Colombia a foul on the edge of the box and Quintero fired a low free kick under the leaping wall. Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima reacted late and by the time he got his hands to the ball, it had crossed the line.
Pekerman introduced James Rodriguez, who did not start due to a calf problem, in the 59th minute but the Golden Boot winner in Brazil was unable to change the course of the match. - Agencies

## Title: The Kandyan  connection
## Supertitle:

## Date: Wednesday, June 20, 2018 - 01:00
The Kandyan  connection
India and Sri Lanka are closely bound by historical, geographical, cultural, and religious ties. Even languages and formation of letters resemble each other to some extent. Second-century Silapathikaram, the Tamil classic, describes Santhi Koothu. Santhi Koothu which consists of four main Koothu forms, namely, Chokam, Mei Koothu, Abinaya, and Nadakam. Chokam is the pure Nirutha dance.
The Mei Koothu consists of three main categories. Desi, Vaduku, and Sinhalam. Desi was a dance form belonging to the Tamil country. Vaduku was a dance form belonging to Telugu Desam, and the word Sinhala was apparently a reference to a dance form belonging to Sinhala country. Unfortunately, apart from the word Sinhala, there is nothing about the dance form in Silapathikaram. Even the great Tamil poet Subramanya Bharathi spoke of constructing a bridge to Sinhala Deepa.
Dance forms
Traditional Kandyan dance is a pure Nirutha dance firmly based on Thala, Laya, and on Thandava stances and based on rhythm. Like Tamil classical dance form Bharatha Natyam, Kandyan dance was also danced in temples, and temple festivals.
But both these dance forms enjoyed the royal patronage. Today Bharatha Natyam has moved to public halls, from temples. Kandyan dance is still danced in temple peraheras (processions), and sometimes in social functions. In ancient times Sathir was performed in temples.
Earlier a dance form called Degge Natuma the dance of Devalaya existed, like Sathir, but today Degge Natuma is no longer in existence, like Sathir. In Bharatha Natyam, many items have disappeared in the course of time, but today all that remains are the references found in literary works.
Most of the Indian classical dance forms are based on Natya Sastra. But these dances developed and were influenced by regional, religious, cultural, and social traditions of each region. Kandyan dance appears to have grown out of Natya Sastra, as there are discernible similarities between the classical dance forms of India.
Hand movement
In Bharatha Natyam the term Adavu (a pure Nirtha) is confined to a step (a footwork), a body movement accompanied with a hand movement, and hand mudras (hastas) based on a particular Thala and laya. In Kandyan dance, the term Adavu is used for a collection of pure Nirutha movements.
According to Dr Raghavan, The most alluring of Kandyan dance is the Ves. Dr Raghavan also points out Among these are features which point to a certain affinity in the Ves dancers costumes, to the highly ornamental and elaborate makeup of the dancer in Kathakali of Kerala. There are many links between Kandyan and Kathakali Dance.
Vannam, one of the Kandyan dance, is the latest inclusion in the dance. There are altogether eighteen Vannams, each Annam is based on a separate theme, The addition of Vannam to Kandyan dance provided a limited scope for some Nirthya movements in Kandyan dance.
Sitting position
Like Bharatha Natyam, female dancers also play a significant role in Kandyan dance. Some of the similarities, between Kandyan dance and Bharatha Natyam are the half sitting position, separation of feet, (the gap between the two legs are wider in Kandyan dance than the gap between the two legs in Bharatha Natyam), knee facing two different directions (right and left), stretching the arms at the shoulder level, neck movements following the hand movements are some of the similarities between the two classical dance forms. In Bharatha Natyam, also certain pure classical pieces, but these pieces are anyhow interwoven with Classical Carnatic music, Thala, and Laya. However, in Kandyan dance, the pure Nirutha is interwoven with Thala, Laya, and Rhythm.
In Kandyan dance Udekki is another important category of dance, which derives its name from the drum, named Udukku. In Bharatha Natyam also this drum plays an important role, because in the division of Sabtha Thandava and in the 108 Thandavas this drum Udekkiis always found in the hands of Thandava Murthi Lord Nataraja, and the drum, is called Udduku. It is believed in Thiru Manthiram that all creations arose out of the sound of Udduku. There is a line which refers to the sound of Udduku saying, Thotram Thudi Thanil. This Uddku also plays an important role in Hindu rituals.
There are a lot of similarities in the terminologies between Bharatha Natyam and Vannam. Some of the Vannams are influenced Hindu mythology. North Indian classical dance form Kathak has a certain similarity with Kandyan dance.
For instance, both the dances are firmly based on Thala, Laya, and firm Niruth A movements. Both these dance forms have fast and circular movements. In Manipuri, the East Indian dance male dancers wear a turban, and they carry drums whilst they dance, as the male dancers in Kandyan dance.

Kane grabs late winner for England, Belgium beat Panama
VOLGOGRAD, Monday - Harry Kane grabbed a dramatic late winner for England on Monday, powering home a header in injury time of their World Cup opener after Belgium had earlier swept past Panama.
Kanes second goal of the game secured a 2-1 victory after it looked as if England had squandered their chance to take all three points after being rocked by a Tunsian equaliser which followed a bright start.
Menaced by flying insects under the floodlights in Volgograd, England raced out of the blocks and took an early lead in the Group G match through Kane.
But Gareth Southgates young English team squandered multiple chances, with Jesse Lingard particularly wasteful, and Tunisia made them pay when Ferjani Sassi scored from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was adjudged to have fouled Fakhreddine Ben Youssef.
Despite enjoying the bulk of the possession in the second half, England created few clear-cut chances and looked as though they would be forced to settle for a share of the spoils.
But captain Kane had the last word, heading in a corner at the back post in the 91st minute.
Its massive, said Kane. Im so proud of the lads. Its tough.
We played so well, especially in the first half, and we could have scored a few more.
We kept going. Its a World Cup, you go to the last second. Im absolutely buzzing.
SOUTHGATE SATISFIED
Southgate meanwhile praised his sides ability to dig out a victory at the death which was Englands first win in a World Cup opener since 2006.
We recovered from a really harsh (penalty) decision and kept our composure, which pleased me, Southgate told reporters.
Even though the clock was running down, we stayed patient.
Good teams score late goals, because if you dominate the ball like that, the opposition tire.
Off the field, England fans were outnumbered by Tunisian supporters in Volgograd after fewer than 2,000 tickets for the match were sold in Britain.
The England supporters were given a warm welcome in the city formerly known as Stalingrad and were largely well-behaved although two fans were charged with public drunkenness after being detained on a train.  AFP

At half time the score read 10-8 in favour of Wesley.
Isipathana staged a spirited performance in the latter stages of the second half scoring a converted try to equal the score 15-all but it was too late for them to turn tables to make it into victory as Wesleys co-winger Mahanandas Paranthirans try was converted successfully by Murshid Doray who also made the first conversion and put over a penalty.
For Isipathana their second row forward Chamod Sandaruwan and centre Manula Ratnayake scored the tries. Captain cum co-centre Manelka Ruberu slotted in the conversion as well as the solitary penalty.

Logistics Performance Index
Lanka ahead of other South Asian countries
South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation countries (SASEC) including Sri Lanka could invest in improving connectivity to reduce transport times and increase reliability to major markets, suggests latest Asian Development Banks study on Trade Costs, Time, and Supply Chain Reliability.
Sri Lanka is ahead of other south Asian countries in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index (LPI), with Colombo among the best connected ports. But Sri Lanka is behind most South East Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia which are part of multinational corporation global supply chains. We consider the reduction in each SASEC countrys trade costs with the US if it were to reduce its international transport time to that country to the same level as the PRCs international transport time to the US.
The results indicate that the gains could be substantial: by just over 5% for Bangladesh, by 2.7% for Bhutan, by 1.5% for Maldives, and by 0.5% for Sri Lanka.
Indias and Nepals international transport times to the US are already lower than what is observed for the PRC; however, we caution that these results do not seem plausible and possibly reflect severe reporting problems in those countries.
These numbers show that potential welfare and efficiency gains from improving international transport times are economically significant.
Although we have not simulated trade effects, existing results in the literature, such as Djankov, Freund, and Pham (2010), suggest that an extra day of transport time tends to reduce bilateral trade by about 1%. Given that the differences we are finding are large in proportional terms, the potential to boost trade significantly by improving international shipment times is substantial.
In policy terms, ADB results suggest that SASEC countries need to concentrate additional
resources on boosting connectivity. This means having infrastructure of sufficient quantity and quality that international shippers have an incentive to put in place a direct linkage. Indirect linkages and the need for transshipment significantly increase time, cost, and uncertainty, and can act as a drag on trade.
Although some international gateways in SASEC countries perform well, none of them are close to the world technological frontier.

Luis Suarez looks for World Cup redemption as he reaches 100 caps
NIZHNIY NOVGOROD, Tuesday - For a player who has made so many headlines at the World Cup, it is appropriate that Luiz Suarez will make his 100th appearance for Uruguay at footballs biggest tournament.
Barring any last minute disasters the Barcelona striker will reach his century of games for the Celeste on Wednesday when they play Saudi Arabia in Rostov-on-Don in Group As second round of matches.
The match should be routine and could secure Uruguays passage to the knockout stage, but with Suarez football fans know that very few things are mundane.
The last two World Cups have seen Suarez exit in ignominy.
In 2010, the forward was sent off after making a last minute save against Ghana, which helped avoid defeat and saw the South Americans progress to the last four.
The incident became so infamous it got its own Wikipedia entry -- Suarez even described it as the best save of the tournament -- but that was nothing to what happened four years later.
In 2014, he was banned from all football for four months and fined after biting Italys Giorgio Chiellini, the third biting incident of his career.
Uruguay players have hit out at the way Suarez was subsequently treated by the footballing authorities, but their protests have garnered little empathy outside the country.
Suarez is a player loved and loathed in equal measure; his on-field behaviour has been questionable but not so his talent. Despite the ever-present controversies, the 31-year-old is Uruguays record goalscorer, scoring 51 times in 99 matches.
Five of those have come in the World Cup and despite a sluggish start in Uruguays 1-0 opening game win against Egypt, the match against a weak Saudi Arabia side may offer him the chance to celebrate his centenary in style. Uruguay may make changes to midfield, bringing in Carlos Sanchez and Cristian Rodriguez ahead of Nahitan Nandez and Giorgian De Arrascaeta on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia still smarting from their opening day 5-0 drubbing by Russia, could make wholesale changes as they desperately try to stay in the tournament. The Saudis preparations were jolted by a mid-air mishap on Monday when the plane carrying them to Rostov suffered a fire in one of its engines.
The aircraft landed safely after what one of the Saudi players called a simple malfunction.
It was a small fire in one of the engines, the right engine, but the plane landed safely, association president Ahmad Al Harbi told Saudi sports TV channel KSA.  AFP

Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs, Minister D.M.Swaminathan who submitted for the third week in a row, a Cabinet Paper which proposed to pay reparations for families of dead LTTE cadres was rejected yesterday.
The Cabinet Paper it is learnt had been deferred over the last two weeks but this time, due to continued protests from ministers, was stopped for good.
The paper had also proposed to compensate those affected by the war, this included civilians, places of religious worship and the families of dead LTTE cadres.
The ministers had pointed out that they had no opposition to compensating civilian families and places of religious worship but they could not compensate dead LTTE cadres. Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne who spoke on the Cabinet Paper last week, said he too opposed it as it would otherwise be equal to condoning terrorism.
Sources also state that they could not amend the Cabinet Paper to only have civilian families included as it would then have to once again be submitted to a Sub-Committee and reviewed, not allowing the minister to re-submit the Cabinet Paper at consecutive Cabinet meetings.
However, at last weeks cabinet meeting, approval was granted to a proposal made by the Prime Minister to set up an Office for Reparations to provide reparations formally and transparently to individuals affected by conflict, political, civil disobedience or enforced disappearances.

It was the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa who overlooked the work and he worked hard, the minister pointed out.
Minister Senaratne said no President from any political party did such a good job than President Premadasa. Some question as to what this good governance government did during the past three years. The workload carried out for the poor by the Health Ministry and the Housing Ministry is adequate to show the work carried out for the poor by this government, he said.

New type of petrol in experimental stage: Minister Ranatunga
A new type of petrol will be introduced to benefit three wheeler drivers and motorists, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
He said experiments are being conducted in this regard.
We reluctantly increased the price of fuel. Im aware of the problems caused to the public by this. We are carrying out new experiments to provide benefits to the public in another way. We decided to introduce a new type of petrol for trishaws and motorists. We hope the experiments would be successful, the minister said.
He was speaking at a ceremony to handover 13 appointment letters to engineers, at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) premises, recently.
The CPC is like the heart of the country. Our country has a 50-year-old refinery. We are still able to maintain it because of the engineers. We are carrying out a cleaning process in the refinery once in every three years. We need everyones co-operation for the betterment of the CPC by using new technology and new thinking, CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said.

NSC appeals to let Gnanasara Thera wear robes in prison
The National Sangha Council (NSC) has appealed to the government to let Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera wear the robe while he serves his sentences.
NSC National Convener Ven. Waga Wijithawansa Thera said the Justice Minister or the Prisons Commissioner has no right to force Ven. Gnanasara Thera to wear the prison jumper.
We urge the Buddha Sasana Minister to intervene and discuss with the President and Maha Sangha to allow Ven. Gnanasara Thera to serve his sentences while wearing the robe, the Thera said.
We do not wish to criticize the judgement of the Homagama Magistrate against Ven. Gnanasara Thera. There is criticism over his behaviour and several harsh statements were made by him on several occasions. However, he has provided a service to society on many issues, the Thera said.
It is wrong to make a convicted Buddhist monk to wear normal prison attire, according to law and that power is vested with the Sasana Sabha to which he belongs. Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabhawa, which represents the Ven. Thera, has also appealed to Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala to let him wear robes.
He added that there should be a clear opinion on the procedure followed by relevant authorities when a Bhikku is sentenced to imprisonment.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera has not committed a grave offence as mentioned in the Buddhist philosophy. So, he cannot be forced to give up the robe. Accordingly, we request in the name of Dhamma, that his robes be returned without destroying the traditional heritage and culture of this country which existed for the last 2500 years, the Thera added.

Over 60% foreigners invest in Serenia Residences Talpe Galle
Sri Lankas luxury beachfront properties are currently riding the crest of a real estate boom from both tourism as well as investment growth.
This has resulted in Sri Lankas Serenia Residences experiencing as much as a 60% investment from foreign nationals. Foreign investors have observed that Sri Lanka is traversing the same development direction as Singapore or Hong Kong, said Sabina Karunanayake, Co-Founder, Serenia Residences.
Traveling from Colombo to Galle now takes as little as an hour and a half from the previous four hour drive, and the extension of the Southern Expressway due to be completed by 2019 is yet another advantage and attraction for potential investors,
Sophisticated foreign investors are now recognizing the appeal of the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka, and are buying primary residences here, as well as seasonal homes and investment units. They appreciate the safety and security of a freehold condominium unit on and above the fourth floor.
Its a beautiful location where individuals, couples and families can find spacious residences at per-square-foot prices that are nearly half those of Bali or Thailand, said Karunanayake .
Italian, German, British, Australian and Singaporean buyers, in particular, are finding that Serenia offers many attractive options both for those seeking primary residences or second homes and investment properties.

Present Govt. hiding countrys debt situation:
Former CB Governor Cabraal deliberately misleading the public:Eran
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne hit out at former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivaard Cabraal in Parliament yesterday, over the latters claim that the Government was hiding the countrys debt situation.
Joining in the Adjournment debate on the reports of the Committee on Public Accounts, the State Minister exposed that the former CB Governors claims were aimed at deliberately misleading the public.
He pointed out that the understatement of debt had actually happened in 2010-2013 as the then Government had removed the loans obtained to construct the Hambantota Port Phase I and II, Norochcholai Power Plant and the Mattala Airport from the State debt in an attempt to window dress the financial statements. Instead those loans had been credited to the Ports Authority, Lanka Coal Company Pvt. Ltd., and Airport and Aviation Services Ltd., respectively.
The Finance Ministry and the Central Bank said the Governments total debt as at the end of 2017, stood at Rs 10,313 billion and it was 77.6 percent of the GDP. The Auditor General in his audit statement correctly said the total debt should be Rs 10,702 billion and it was 80.5 percent of the GDP.
This discrepancy of Rs 389 billion was because the former President and then Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa got Cabinet approval to divert the debt obtained for the above mentioned projects to various subsidiary companies and thereby hide them from State debt. This had been continued by the Finance Ministry. We had no intention of covering up the real debt of the country, Wickramaratne explained.
Former CB Governor Cabraal is suffering from dementia today. These rogues who cheated the country while in office, are now trying to do the same after their retirement. They must be exposed, he added.

BUDDHIKA WINDS UP WITH LAST QUESTION BEFORE NEW POST
UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana told Parliament yesterday that he postponed his swearing in as a Deputy Minister because he wanted to attend Parliament seeking an answer to a question he had placed in the Order Paper.
He said he was asked to be present at the Presidential Secretariat in the morning to take oaths as a Deputy Minister but he got it postponed till evening as he wanted a response to a question he had raised.
The question was related to extorting money from buses at Colombo Central Bus Terminal, Gunasinghepura Private Bus Terminal and the Bastian Mawatha Private Bus Terminal.Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe requested a months time to respond. He also observed that it would be the last question of MP Pathirana because those in Government ranks are not allowed to ask questions for oral answers in Parliament.
Considering the many number of questions MP Pathirana has raised, we heard that he is going to be appointed as the Minister of Parliamentary Questions, Abeysinghe quipped.
MP Pathirana however agitated that he wants an immediate answer to his question as it would be removed from the Order Paper next time. Taking extortion from buses in our area is a serious problem. I came to Parliament today postponing my appointment as a deputy minister because of this question, he said.
The Deputy Minister replied that he would take measures to look in the matter and provide a reply to MP Pathirana.

Do not appoint MPs with Prima facie cases of corruption as COPE members
Dy Minister Ranjan tells Speaker, COPE Chairman, Party Leaders
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday, requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti and Leaders of all Political Parties to avoid appointing MPs with prima facie cases of corruption, as COPE members.
Joining in the Adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday, the Deputy Minister said the officials who are being summoned before the COPE, quip that those appointed to nab rogues are a worse set of rogues.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake also submitted an affidavit, stating that he had not obtained any money, property or benefit directly or indirectly by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., any of its affiliated companies, Arjun Aloysius or any of his agents.
He urged that his prima facie case of contempt of Court be heard properly, adding that such a move would expose that he was speaking truth.
Referring to the refusal of four Supreme Court Judges from the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Defence Secretary, he questioned how the Government could commit to a course of nabbing thieves, when Supreme Court Judges start fleeing when they see Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He charged that the law was only implemented against the poor and innocent, while large scale thieves sought anticipatory bail to prevent their arrest. Is this a fault of the Government he questioned, while stressing that there had been no other Government in the countrys history that was committed to punish wrong doers to the extent this Government had done.
He went on to question how the Government could nab thieves when certain Buddhist monks organize Pindapatha to pay the fine of those rogues and when certain Buddhist monks tie pirith nool to bless them when they come out of Courts.

National Museum CCTV camera system still out of order:Nalinda
No steps have been taken to restore the CCTV camera system of the Colombo National Museum, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.
He pointed out that it had been 5 years since the National Museum was broken into. The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) had conducted an investigation into the break and theft of artifacts that took place in 2012.
He pointed out that the camera system used by the National Museum has still no night vision facility.
Jayatissa further pointed out that it had been revealed that the camera system had not been functioning when the theft took place at the Museum.
Absence of any steps to restore the camera system in the museum was equal to the crime of the theft itself, MP Jayatissa pointed out.
MP Jayatissa questioned what was the purpose of COPA/COPE investigating and providing recommendations if respective authorities disregard them.
COPA or COPE could not take any legal action against persons involved in misappropriations. We could not even hold them accountable. We should at least be able to prevent misfortunes as these happening in the future, MP Jayatissa pointed out.

Ravi complains of inconvenience caused travelling to Parliament
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday, said that MPs should be permitted to enter the Parliament premises without any interference. He pointed out that it took him more than an hour to reach the Parliament premises.
He was referring to a demonstration held on the Parliament road at 1.00 p.m. yesterday.
Is this democracy We were given power to restore this country, not to be shut down by some people holding boards. I could not come to Parliament on time. Many more MPs are blocked by the protest. It is the duty of the Police to ensure that MPs would not be affected on their way to Parliament. The Speaker should call on the IGP and get the Police to clear the roads, Karunanayake said.
Presiding Member UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe assured that the Speaker would be notified of the matter and the IGP would take the necessary steps to see that MPs are not inconvenienced when travelling to Parliament.

Govt has failed to prevent controversial building being rented out to Agriculture Ministry:Dr. Nalinda
COPA has failed in preventing the controversial building rented out to the Agriculture Ministry, JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday said.
Moving an Adjournment Motion on the five reports submitted by COPA, Jayatissa said COPA investigation and recommendations concerning the building rented out to the Agriculture Ministry, had not been taken into consideration by the government.
He pointed out that the Committee on Public Accounts had specifically mentioned that their approval was not granted for the said act in concern. Jayatissa said that COPA had no provision to stop the government from signing the agreement pertaining to the rent of the building.
He also pointed out that COPA was not able to take any legal steps against the misuse of public funds. It is like a toothless mouth. It can frown but cannot bite, Jayatissa said. Jayatissa also pointed out that there had been a misuse of the Employment Provident Fund amounting to Rs. 6,310 million in 2010 against which COPA could not take any action. He also said that COPA could not even hold a person accountable for certain misappropriations.
In 2014, an additional payment of Rs. 833,460 had been done for the Higher Education Minister on electricity and water bills. Three extra vehicles were also used by the same minister. An additional sum of Rs.1 million had been paid as fuel allowance to these vehicles. The Secretary to the Ministry had sent reasons for these additional payments. According to these explanations, the utility bills have gone up because there was a series of discussions held at the official residence of the then Higher Education Minister.

Pet perfect!
This is a tale. A tale of a very obedient dog.
Makeup artist Jasmine Schofield was just minding her own business in the caf of a coupon and online ad agency in Silicon Valley, California, when she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. Something soft. Something small. Something still. There, waiting just outside the cafs perimeter was a dog. A little smiling dog. With its lead on the floor next it. The dog must be able to read, as there was a No dogs allowed sign up on the caf wall, preventing him from entering. So he didnt. And he waited. Like the obedient doggo he is.
After posting the pics to Twitter, people seemed impressed and then concerned for the pooch  how long did he have to wait before someone brought him a puppuccino
Thankfully, dear reader, not long. His owner was right outside of frame, he only had to wait maybe a minute or two, explained Jasmine when a Twitter user raised concern for the dog.
She also dished on the perks of working for her company, when she revealed that everything in the caf is free. Were lucky enough to have lunch provided to us through the company, Jasmine says. It is obviously a #blessing that dogs are allowed in this building but we feel like they should be allowed in the caf too.

Pohottuwa explodes
All three Rajapaksa siblings vying to contest the presidency:Mahinda wont make preference clear:Basil flexes muscles, lays down the law to SLFP-16:
Cracks have appeared within the political front aligned with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, as the battle over the factions presidential candidate heats up.
Although the pro-Rajapaksa faction looks spoilt for choice with regard to its nominee to contest the 2020 Presidential poll, all three Rajapaksa brothers Basil, Gotabhaya and Chamal who held powerful positions in the former regime are now vying for the slot, creating deep divisions within the group.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is reportedly livid at his youngest brother Basil Rajapaksa, for unofficially calling for a boycott of the vote for deputy speaker in Parliament, in which the SLFP 16/JO candidate was badly defeated. Over a dozen JO MPs absented themselves from the Chamber during the vote, but were seen socializing at the Parliament canteen at the same time. The boycotting JO MPs were reportedly following directives from Basil Rajapaksa, highly placed sources said.
Authoritative sources told Daily News that the former President admonished his younger sibling Basil Rajapaksa for derailing the vote and threatened to form his own party if his political decisions were continually undermined by other individuals in the SLPP. Former President Rajapaksa was reportedly also angry about Basil Rajapaksas recent statements which were perceived as being very unwelcoming of the SLFP 16 who recently quit the Government and joined the opposition. The former President believes his saloon door should be open to everyone, while SLPP sources said Basil Rajapaksa favours a more discerning approach. Those who want to join SLPP and the JO should not have one foot in one camp and the other foot in another camp, Basil Rajapaksa publicly said. He told the media that the SLPP would not accept the SLFP MPs who recently quit the Government as long as they continue to hold membership within the SLFP. They must take membership in the SLPP, he demanded.
The comments angered the SLFP 16 who went public with their own criticism of the SLPP frontliner and Rajapaksa sibling.
Meanwhile, the head of a media and advertising conglomerate, well-known to be linked to former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and supports his 2020 election bid, reportedly received a major public dressing down from Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna frontliner and former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa at a social event at a five-star hotel last week, according to highly placed sources.
An irate Basil Rajapaksa warned the media proprietor of dire consequences if he continued to use his popular television station to attack him. The reprimand occurred in former President Rajapaksas presence and in front of dozens witnesses who were shellshocked by Basils outburst.
While the idea of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for candidate from the Rajapaksa faction is gaining ground, sources close to former President say this proposition is not finding favour with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Reports said the recent events of a meeting between the former President and US Ambassador Atul Keshap also stemmed from this disapproval of the Gota 2020 candidacy on the part of the former President. The reports of the dialogue with the US envoy initially published in a Tamil language newspaper, was relayed by sources extremely close to the former President, it is learnt. It is unclear which of his brothers the former President backs for the presidency, since he himself cannot contest the 2019 poll, barring a change of the constitution.
The old left faction of the Joint Opposition has already made it clear that their preferred Rajapaksa candidate is the eldest sibling Chamal, a former Speaker of Parliament and Ports Minister.
Speaking to the media recently, UPFA MP and JO frontliner Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who is known to be a close confidant of the former President, said they preferred Chamal Rajapaksa because he was the type of left of centre candidate that best reflected the kind of Government the JO wanted to form in the future. Hawkish sections of the JO, including Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila have shown a clear preference to have Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contest the presidency. But JO sources say the ultimate decider of the Rajapaksa factions presidential nominee will be Mahinda Rajapaksa himself.
And his decision will be based on which candidate will be best for his own family, in terms of dynastic ambitions as well, said one SLFP MP who did not wish to be named.

Pork  pie wedding cake
A couple ditched the traditional wedding cake for a tower of pork pies instead. Rebekah and Kyle Johnsons wedding took place in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, on 19 May.
The four-tiered pork pie cake was displayed alongside a more traditional wedding dessert made from 100 cupcakes, after it was won in the #NotTheOnlyWedding campaign, where Pork Farms called for pork pie fans to step forward if they were getting married on the same day as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
22-year-old Rebekah, a buyer for a mens gift company, said, I entered a lot of Royal Wedding-themed competitions and when people found out about the pork pie wedding cake they were quite surprised, but they thought it was a good idea. We had already decided to have a tiered cake with 100 cupcakes, so we thought it would be nice to put the two cakes alongside each other. The pork pie cake was fantastic. The second layer from the bottom contained caramelised onion and the rest was traditional pork pie. We got married at St Matthews Church in Sutton Bridge followed by a reception at the Curlew Centre. Kyle is not a huge fan of pork pies but he did like this one. Ive loved pork pies since I was a little girl. This one was distributed among our friends and family and people were still eating pork pie for a week after the wedding.
Kyle, an electrician, added, It was a great cake.
The custom-made pork pie wedding cake was created at Pork Farms Nottingham bakery by Chef Brian Poulson, who cooked the pie in four different sections, then meticulously crafted pastry decorations. Each tier was made using hot water crust pastry, 100 per cent British pork and topped off with seasoned jelly.
Brian then assembled the pie at the wedding venue just hours before the ceremony.
Pork Farms spokesman Kim Burgess said, We were delighted to be a small part of Rebekah and Kyles celebrations, and we hope that this unique take on the traditional wedding cake will be one of the many special memories for them as they look back on their special day. Special thanks has to go to our wonderful chef Brian Poulson, who worked hard to put everything together and assemble the pie for the couple. Were delighted with the finished result, and we hope Bex and Kyle were too.

Postal workers begin fast unto death campaign

A fast unto death campaign was initiated today by the Postal and Telecommunication Officers Association before the Central Mail Exchange.
The postal workers decided to move on to the fast unto death campaign citing that authorities failed to provide adequate solutions to their demands and warned to continue the campaign until relevant authorities provide viable solutions.
The strike is carried out by the postal workers based on two demands, which are to amend the recruitment process of the department and make the profession of the Acting Sub Post Masters permanent.

Professionals duty bound to pay tax - Mangala
Many professionals such as lawyers, doctors, tuition teachers and architects who have benefitted from the countrys free education system do not give back by paying due taxes, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
Many professionals render a great service to the country. Therefore, it is important that they pay tax, the Minister added, addressing a media briefing at the Ministry.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) in the meantime had requested that the Finance Ministry provide doctors with an income tax ceiling of 12 percent along with other concessions.
Minister Samaraweera said having looked into their requests, they had decided to increase the Distress Availability Transport (DAT) for specialist doctors as a special case but they would not grant the tax ceiling for doctors,
On average, a doctor in total makes around Rs.350,000 a month, so it is unfair if they are allowed to pay tax at a lower level.
Two months since the implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act, total government revenue has increased by 8 percent, the Minister said.
He explained that when revenue was compared to June 13,2017 (Rs.256 billion) and June 13,2018 (Rs.276 billion), revenue this year had grown by 8 percent. In addition, in May of 2018, the Department of Inland Revenue had made Rs 5 billion more in income tax revenue than May of last year.
In the last two months, we have had 69,000 new tax files opened.Earlier we only had a total of 400,000 tax files for a population of 22 million, Minister Samaraweera said.
I am happy that people are voluntarily coming forward to open tax files, he added but noted that there were many more, especially professionals who were not paying tax.

Quest for excellence
Choreographer Janadhari Salgado brings a ground-shaking intensity to the odyssey of Sri Lankan dance through her academy Jayamini Janaranga Kala Nikethanaya. A lot of backstories has brought Salgado to this juncture, fragments of which she and her collaborators intermittently reveal. There are stories from the slow, steady and patient expedition.
Those fragments can be hard to piece together. Her academic credentials (Diploma in Dance Choreography from Sri Lanka Training Foundation, First Class Honours in Bharatha Natyam (Bhathkanda) from an Aesthetic Indian University, Bharatha, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri as Higher qualifications from Sri Lanka Forum of Dancing) speak a lot for her forbearance in the mushrooming unqualified fellowship.
Q: You are a much sought after dance teacher. What is your secret formula
A: My childhood was spent with my mothers sister Padmini Dahanayake and uncle Moris Dahanayake. My aunt was a Bharatha Natyam Dancer. She was the first Sri Lankan Bharatha Natyam Dancer who received a diploma. I used to observe her throughout the day as she practised. I joined her too. She willingly trained me in the Bharatha Natyam steps. These steps are so hard even for an adult. But my little feet grasped the rhythm. At eight, I could well manage the difficult poses like my aunt.
Q: How did you fare at school
A: First I was admitted to Our Lady of Victories, Moratuwa. I kept my dancing ability as a secret there. Then I went to Princess of Wales. Like OLV they did not offer Buddhism as a subject. The Dancing teacher, Nelum Mendis, sensed my ability, though I selected oriental music under Aesthetic Studies. I just took part in all dancing concerts on stage. There onwards, whether it was eastern or western, the teachers used to comment on my features. I was selected to perform as well as sing. If that huge stage could speak it would say how it felt my little feet quite often. I could act too. When Dhamma Jagoda and Tissa Gunawardena were in the panel, I was chosen as the best actress of a competition.
Q: Most dancers tend to do away with academic credentials. But you have chosen the alternative path 
A: I studied oriental dancing at the University of Kelaniya. Now I am reading for the PhD. It will be over most probably by the end of this year. I am patient. It offers such a mental relief. The university experience is unique. I remember most undergraduates used to quit the practical lessons. Our batch was 40, but sometimes only three students stayed for the practical sessions. But I had a deep down feeling that I should not follow their path.
Q: There are many dancing academies across the country. How do you assess your own academy
A: We protect. I nurture my students with full might and ambition. Maybe we will have to close down this academy in a few years when my students become veterans in the field and no longer need any coaching. Once they become veterans they open their own academies. And they do well. I will tolerate that competition with a smile. I can actually be happy because they grew up in my shelter.
On the other hand, I never entrust the job of teaching to other instructors. However painful or however tired I am, I would still take pains to train them. I have been the only teacher in my academy for the last 20 years.
I teach them various elements separately. Singing, making notations and stage makeup, all that for a few rupees.
Q: What can dancing do to the humankind
A: Unless it is a serious performance before a general public, I dare not become a media bug. The doors of my dance academy are close to media, especially the television channels. My students learn the value of life quality. They imbibe in the team spirit. They respect each other. My students are not into cruelty. I teach them discipline.
The patience makes them master the dance. I also teach time management. They must leave the stage on time. As for your question, I think any aesthetic art enhances the brain cells. Art balances a persons lifestyle.

Ronaldo seeks encore against battle-hardened Morocco
MOSCOW, Tuesday - Cristiano Ronaldo will attempt to follow up his World Cup opening game heroics for Portugal against a Morocco side licking their wounds after a crushing last-gasp defeat.
A hat-trick from the five-time world player of the year snatched a thrilling 3-3 draw for the European champions against Spain in a heavyweight Group B showdown in Sochi.
It was Ronaldos 51st career hat-trick, and the 51st in the tournaments history, as the Real Madrid star became just the fourth player to score in four World Cups.
I am very happy, its a nice personal record to have, one more in my career, said Ronaldo.
For me the most important thing is to emphasise what the team did against one of the favourites to win this World Cup.
Despite lifting the trophy at Euro 2016, Portugal are not widely viewed as among the favourites in Russia but can take a big step towards the last 16 with victory over Morocco in Moscow on Wednesday.
I think we are stronger than Morocco if we compare the two teams, but Im not saying the game will be easy for us, striker Andre Silva told reporters at Portugals training base.
We cannot underestimate them and must have respect for any opponent. Any game at the World Cup is difficult.
It will be just the second meeting between the two countries, after Morocco beat Portugal 3-1 in the group stage at the 1986 finals.
Morocco did not concede a single goal in the final qualifying round as they sealed a return to the World Cup for the first time in 20 years, but their knockout hopes hang by a thread after a 95th-minute own goal by Aziz Bouhaddouz against Iran.
WERE NOT DEAD
Herve Renards men face a monumental challenge, with games to come against Portugal and Spain, but midfielder Faycal Fajr is adamant all is not lost for the Atlas Lions.
If I said that we dont believe we can qualify it would be a lie, said Fajr, one of 17 players born abroad in Moroccos 23-man squad.
I could throw out some examples, like the Argentina draw (1-1 with Iceland). Where theres a will theres a way. (The Portuguese) have two feet, two legs and they are humans like us.
We lost a battle but we havent lost the war. Were not dead, he added.
Renard lamented that Morocco were crucified by our own errors in the loss to Iran, but the Frenchman is used to defying the odds, having led outsiders Zambia to a surprise triumph at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.
He then became the first coach to win the continental title with two different teams three years later, guiding the Ivory Coast to glory.
Morocco will need Renard to conjure up more magic to prevent an early exit, although Fajr says the mood in the camp remains positive.
Even after the defeat, the atmosphere was terrific, he said.
Weve been waiting for this moment for 20 years, all Moroccans have been waiting for this for 20 years. Were one big family.  AFP

Salaries Commission accepts postal worker demands
Post and Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem said the Salaries Commission had already accepted postal worker demands.
He said there was no justifiable reason to drag trade union action further since necessary action had been taken to address their grievances. The Minister was addressing the media yesterday at the Postal Ministry.
Several Postal Department Trade Unions have been boycotting duty demanding the Government to settle several issues since June 11. The issues were created by the 6/2006 circular. One such issue is cancellation of "Class 3" category from the postal service, the Minister said. The Postal Ministry had submitted a Cabinet paper in this regard and the issue is being looked into by a Cabinet Sub Committee now. The Salaries Commission has agreed to accept a separate salary scale for Postal workers.
Ministry Secretary R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla said the strike is not reasonable but they have several justifiable reasons that has been accepted for adoption. "A Cabinet paper was submitted and evaluated by a Cabinet Sub Committee chaired by Minister Sarath Amunugama.
"The Sub Committee received the Cabinet paper on June 11 and said they need two weeks to resolve the issues. However, the Trade Unions opted for trade union action on June 11 itself without giving time for the Committee to look into the matter. The Secretary said the trade union action cannot be accepted. The unions should have given enough time to the Committee to look into the issues," he said.
He added that he was instructed to prepare a separate salary scale for postal workers with the participation of postal trade unions. But the representative of trade unions are refraining from assisting in preparation of new salary scales for postal service.
Postmaster General Rohana Abeyaratne said every possible measure to bring the service to normal will be taken.
He accepted that there is an issue with the postal service created by the 6/2006 circular. The circular has resulted in keeping a postal service employee at the same post for 40 years before they are promoted to the next position.Therefore, the demand to cancel Class 3 is justifiable, he said. But the trade union action is not justifiable as every possible measure has already been taken to address the issue.
He said the trade union action has caused an immense loss to the Postal Service. Transactions valued around Rs.159 million happen daily. Meegasmulla said the Postal Service incurred an irreparable loss especially to its Airmail and Speed Post Courier Service due to the Trade Union action.

Saudi Arabia World Cup 2018 team plane goes  on fire in mid air
Saudi Arabia's official team plane caught fire in mid air as they travelled to their next World Cup match.
Flames were seen from the engine as the Russian Airlines Airbus was en route to Rostov where they take on Uruguay on Wednesday. An official statement read from the football association read: "The Saudi Football Federation wishes to reassure everyone about the safety of all members of the mission of the national team after a minor technical malfunction in an engine. "The plane landed a few minutes ago at Rostov on Don Airport, and UNOMIG personnel are now safely heading to their residence."
Videos uploaded to twitter show fire shooting from the engines underneath the wings.
The plane was a Russian Airlines Airbus A319-100 and no one was hurt in what must have been a terrifying incident. The aircraft was initially purchased as new by American airline Frontier Airlines, before being bought by Russian-based Donavia in July 2013. Airline Rossiya have leased the plane since April 2016.
The players were then filmed calmly leaving the stricken jet, which is 12 years old. They are now on their way to the team hotel. They next take on Uruguay after a chastening 5-0 loss to hosts Russia last Thursday - their second heaviest defeat at the World Cup.
Their boss Juan Antonio Pizzi, a former Spain international born and bred in Argentina, called that defeat 'shameful'.  Daily Mirror

Searchlight on dpl. service
A special audit report on the performance of Sri Lanka's diplomatic service is to be released shortly, according to Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe. Speaking at an awareness programme for parliament journalists on Monday he said his Department is presently working on the document and Department officials will be sent to Sri Lanka's diplomatic missions overseas to collect the necessary information There is a general opinion in the country that our diplomatic service is highly inefficient. He said in 2017 alone, the country has spent Rs. 8.3 billion to maintain the offices of our diplomatic missions. What have they done to promote the image of the country What have they given to the country in return There has been no such assessment. No statistics are available, he went on to reveal.
This, no doubt, is a welcome move. Going by certain events in the recent past what actually took place in the name of diplomacy was the undiplomatic conduct of certain individuals. It is time our diplomats are made accountable for the huge amounts spent on their upkeep abroad. The public must be made aware of the work carried out by our dpls on behalf of the country. After all, it is the public that pays for the plush lives of these diplomats in world Capitals. Our diplomats, once they leave on their overseas missions, simply vanishes until they are seen receiving our leaders in the host country. Nay, some of these diplomats are left to their own devices at the other end, as is now being revealed in all its stark details.
Far from working to build the country's image, these individuals have been engaged in crooked deals and otherwise busy furthering their business interests. The case of our former Ambassador to Washington and envoy to Russia are glaring examples of how some of our so called diplomats have been conducting themselves, taking cover behind their connections to the powers that be. The former diplomat from Washington had the ignominy of serving a stint at the state run lodge in a case of embezzlement of funds while the ex-dpl. for Russia is presently on the run from an Interpol warrant for his involvement in a mega arms deal. They are both, today, fugitives from justice, in their own country as well as being probed in the countries where they served, a fitting epitaph, indeed, for their service to Mother Lanka, as diplomats. Far from working towards building the image of the country they have only succeeded in blackening the image of their motherland, both here and in the eyes of the international community.
The Auditor General, no doubt, will have to cover a wide area in compiling his report concerning our diplomatic service and he will have to deploy men with full knowledge on all aspects of the subject to obtain a clear picture. Investigations should not be confined to the mundane service of the diplomat. The probe should also extend to other areas such as the competence of the individual holding the diplomatic post. It all boils down to the cost benefit factor. In a milieu where career diplomats are vegetating in the Foreign Ministry while relatives and friends of politicians are given diplomatic postings, the AG, no doubt, will have to tread carefully in trying to ferret out information for his report. Ideally he should get involved from the beginning and ensure the right man/woman is picked for the posting.
This is not to say that non career diplomats should not be given appointments. In the past some of our non career diplomats were able to hold their own against the best of our professional diplomats and performed exceptionally in their missions. Unfortunately, we have had too many square pegs in round holes as our diplomats in recent times, not to mention boorish individuals who brought shame on our foreign service. There was the infamous incident of a so called Monitoring Minister of Foreign Affairs getting himself involved in a much publicized brawl during a dpl. function in Old Blighty where he punched our Ambassador to the Court and St.James.
It appears the investigations into our diplomatic service to check on its efficiency will apply only to the future. Had such a mechanism been in existence, before, billions of rupees could have been saved for the country, (i.e. if Mahinda Rajapaksa permitted such investigations, particularly into the affairs of his nephew posted to Washington). One recalls how an American PR firm was hired to polish the image of Sri Lanka during the war years by the then Governor of the Central Bank spending millions of tax payers money, while we already had a paid Ambassador to perform the task. The AG in his probes should also ascertain the losses incurred by the state from visits made by government ministers to foreign countries for tasks that should rightly be performed by the Ambassador. Even today we see ministers with large entourages making overseas trips to attend seminars or sign agreements, tasks well within the capability of the accredited Ambassador.

Senegal beat Poland for first African win at 2018 World Cup
Moscow, Tuesday: Senegal recorded the first African win at the 2018 World Cup when they beat Poland 2-1 on Tuesday thanks to a deflected Thiago Cionek own goal and a terrible error by Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny.
West Bromwich Albion midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak got Poland back in the game with an 86th-minute header but Senegal hung on at Moscows Spartak Stadium.
In a match billed as a straight fight between super-strikers Robert Lewandowski and Sadio Mane, neither scored but Liverpool striker Mane set up Idrissa Gueye for the shot that took a wicked deflection off Cionek, leaving Szczesny totally wrong-footed in the Polish goal for Senegals opener on 37 minutes.
The west Africans doubled their lead on the 60-minute mark when the experienced Juventus goalkeeper had a moment to forget. Krychowiak put Poland in trouble with a woeful bouncing back pass, but Szczesny opted rashly to charge out of his penalty area. The speedy Mbaye Niang got in front of his defender, nicked the ball away from Szczesny and rolled it into the empty net.
The goal sparked wild celebrations among the Senegalese players and incredulity among Polands.
After a tight first half hour, it was the always-threatening Niang who was at the heart of Senegals opening goal.
The Torino winger won the ball on the halfway line and fed Mane who rolled it sideways to Everton striker Gueye, whose shot skewed off Cioneks leg and into the net.
Senegal, the 2002 quarter-finalists, could have pressed home their advantage two minutes later but Salif Sane failed to connect with a header. Minutes after half-time, Sane was fortunate not to be sent off for a challenge on Lewandowski when he brought down the Polish striker as he charged towards goal. He escaped with a yellow card.
Lewandowski curled the free kick over the Senegal wall but Khadim Ndiaye -- the only African-based player in Senegals squad -- pushed it away. AFP

Soft skills development program on June 22
Having understood the core competency gaps in the corporate sector, 3rdwave Academy has taken the initiative to conduct a special soft skills program
The program will be facilitated by Sulakshana which will be held on the June 22. Sulakshana is a well experienced, certified trainer by City and Guilds and possess a degree in psychology, which has inspired more than 5,000 individuals across Asia.
Whilst hard skills could be developed via academic education, soft skills needed by employees to do their jobs more effectively are not freely taught through schools or universities. In order to take advantage of ones core hard skills, understanding and learning soft skills is essential.
For instance, a sales person will only succeed in his career if he has the right balance between product and market knowledge and the ability to close and retain a sale through effective interpersonal skills.
In Sri Lanka when looking at the corporate sector, more than 50% of the employees lack the core competencies of soft skills. Thus, in order to enable the future generation is geared up and can perform more efficiently it is vital to have the right set of skills. Thus, soft skills will help you create the difference.

South Africa rest Imran Tahir for Sri Lanka ODIs
South Africas top-ranked ODI bowler at No.6 in the world Imran Tahir has been rested from the ODI squad to play Sri Lanka in July-August as the country gears up for Vision 2019.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who has played two ODIs, and left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi have been included in the 15-man squad in Tahirs place.
The series, which will consist of five ODIs and a one-off T20I, is the first of five in South Africas build-up to the 2019 World Cup, and the first since AB de Villiers announced his international retirement. The uncapped Reeza Hendricks, wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram are the three players in contention for de Villiers middle-order spot.
Faf du Plessis returns as captain, after missing five of the six ODIs against India earlier in the year with a broken finger, and Junior Dala, who has played three T20s, comes in as an option in place of the retired Morne Morkel. Wiaan Mulder is the only other addition from the group that played against India, and replaces Chris Morris, who is injured.

Sporty spirit
Be it cricket or studies, Head Boy of Vidura College Colombo Hemal Ratnayake maintains a fighting spirit. Perfect Prefects feature Ratnayake who feels that attitude is key when it comes to the willow or the books.
Common sense, talent and dreams work best when they come together. Drop one and the rest wont really work well.
In life, our mentality and attitude matter a lot. Sometimes because of negative forces created in our mind, we do not believe in ourselves and we think negatively. We think we cant win. We are scared to win. These youth cannot make the best use of their potential. They cannot harness their potential, said Ratnayake
Challenging balance
A canny batsman and an apt pupil, Ratnayake has done the balancing act very well.
I balance both Sports and studies very well. That is perhaps one reason I was selected as the Head Prefect. I am also the cricket captain of school. I must say that balancing both sports and studies is very challenging. I scored 143 runs unbeaten in our big match held last year against I Gate College, stated Ratnayake.
The captaincy of the team was a result of Ratnayakes positive mindset and talent and his commitment.
You can learn a lot to play cricket. You learn how to play as a team, you learn teamwork, you learn how to become a leader, acquiring leadership qualities. I am the school captain and I play for NCC. I am the captain of NCC as well. Playing cricket has really enhanced my personality helping me to lead as a Prefect, pointed out Ratnayake.
Vidura College has not just produced a batsman who can hit centuries regularly and a student who passes with flying colours, it has produced a patriot.
Our school teaches us patriotism, meaning that we need to honour our country and work for the greater good of our country. We need to love our homeland, fulfilling the qualities of a man that any country demands of its sons and daughters, which is integrity, uprightness and decency. Our school, Vidura has provided us with opportunities to become citizens with good character, with moral fibre and for this, we have to be constantly thankful, explained Ratnayake.
Academic path
Ratnayake feels his calling in life other than cricket is to become a doctor. So the academic path he will follow is most likely the science stream.
My ambition is to become a doctor related to sports, dealing with injuries related to sports. I wish to be of service to others in this chosen field. I have also set my sights on being a cricketer in the future, ideally being able to join the national side, added Ratnayake.
Ratnayake was recently in India in 2016, Lucknow, for an International School Cricket Premier League organized by CMS India (City Montessori School Lucknow). International Schools all around the world were called and Vidura was one of them. 18 schools participated and from them, nine were from other countries. Other nine were from India.
It was a great experience for me and it was a live broadcast and my parents were able to watch it on TV. It was one of my best tours. We won a match against the Indian team. Because of Cricket, I have made so friends and formed a meaningful relationship with other people from different walks of life, sharing my experiences and thoughts with them. The exposure I have received is very important and beneficial to my life, pointed out Ratnayake.
Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen to emerge in recent times. A clever batsman he is a genius when it comes to leadership and a man who can handle pressure admirably. When it comes to Leaders in history outside of sports he admires Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Sporting sphere
When it comes to International sports players I admire Virat Kohli. He kept fighting and now he is the cricket captain in India. Both Gandhi and Mandela were leaders outside the sporting sphere. All three of them never gave up on life. These are the main requirements for being a leader, said Ratnayake
Brain Drain is a serious problem in Sri Lanka. Some of our finest minds are seeking employment abroad. You can call it the crme de la crme. Minds that can change and uplift this country and society.
Sri Lanka and many other countries face the problem of Brain Drain. The best brains in the country are going out of the country. Though this is an economic human right of a person it is a problem that Sri Lanka faces. So what we can do is, we can start more private campuses and provide much-needed opportunities. Once these opportunities are there the students can seek the correct stream most suitable for them. A person should identify their own strengths. So they need the avenues for them to pursue their passion. We need our brains in the country to develop our country. They key is supplying them with opportunities for self- advancement, explains Ratnayake
Knowing oneself is of paramount importance. A student needs to understand his/her strengths or weaknesses. Failures are the pillars of success.
To become a leader at school level you need to balance both your studies and sports. My school Vidura College has given me a great foundation in this aspect. That is one reason I have continued at Vidura College because of the opportunities I have received, said Ratnayake.
Great demand
There is a great need for people who can articulate their experiences and who can speak about what made them win in life. Motivational speakers are in great demand in these times.
A role model to young people is someone who has faced lifes challenges. He/she needs to be someone who can speak to the world about his/her life and motivate the students to uplift the standards of the country. He needs to be someone who can prepare the students to face society, so they will be aware of what society requires of them. So they will be able to fulfil their responsibilities. Of course, the students have to have the common sense to follow certain paths, said Ratnayake
When it comes to motivation, you can never have enough of it! Parents need to be understanding and children need to have commons sense. A child who has common sense and who has identified his correct path in life cannot go wrong.
Parents/ teachers should motivate the students to follow their dreams, aspirations and be calling in life. The students should identify their talents and the path they need to follow. I would like to thank my parents and my siblings and all credit should go to my Principal and teachers and cricket coaches, said Ratnayake.

## Title: Sri Lankas cricket hits a rough patch

Sri Lankas cricket hits a rough patch
Cricket which is the nations pride has certainly hit a rough patch or so to say in cricketing parlance when a batsman is out of form, where the sport is riding a storm and trying to extract itself from the rough seas that are battering it from all corners.
Notwithstanding the troubled times Sri Lanka Cricket is currently going through with a court injunction that has prevented the annual elections from being held as scheduled on May 31 and thereby brought the administration under a government appointed Competent Authority coming under the Minister of Sport, came the refusal of former cricketing legends to lend a hand to Sri Lanka cricket as consultants. To top it all comes the icing on the cake with allegation of ball tampering brought against the national Test captain Dinesh Chandimal during the second Test against West Indies at Gros Islet, St Lucias.
How well the present administration of SLC handles the ball tampering issue remains to be seen. For if not handled properly the captain stands a chance to be charged and handed a punishment where he may have to sit out the third and final night (pink ball) Test against West Indies at Bridgetown, Barbados starting on June 23. If that happens Sri Lanka already without two of their most experienced batters Angelo Mathews and Dimuth Karunaratne can ill-afford to lose another top order in-form batsman which would weaken the team further. After Kusal Mendis (238 runs), Chandimal is the next highest leading run-getter for his team with 229 runs. They are the only batsmen to take a century apiece off the Windies bowling so far in the series.
Immediately as the allegation surfaced Sri Lanka Cricket which is under a Competent Authority put out this media release backing its players and team. It read:
SLC advised the team to take the field to ensure the continuity of the match and wish to commend the decision taken by the team to continue with the game under protest to ensure the upholding of the spirit of the game. The team management has informed us that Sri Lankan players have not engaged in any wrongdoing. SLC shall take all necessary steps to defend any player, in the event any unwarranted allegation is brought against a member of the team.
Following the recent Smith-Warner-Bancroft ball tampering affair in March in the third Test between Australia and South Africa at Cape Town the umpires seem to have got jittery over anyone putting their hands in their pockets and taking anything out.
Chandimals offence is that he put his hand into his pocket and took out some sweets which he put into his mouth and then started to apply saliva on the ball which made the umpires suspicious of what he was trying to do. But where the umpires erred was that after that incident the ball was continued to be used for about 30 odd overs before the umpires finally decided to change it. Also, the umpires failed to follow the normal protocol of informing the fielding side of the incident at the end of the day (2nd day) but waited until ten minutes before the start of play on the third day to do so which led to an unnecessary delay by two hours as Sri Lankan officials argued with ICC officials on the charge brought against them. Perhaps the umpires delayed their decision to communicate with the fielding side at the end of the second day as they wanted sufficient evidence on video footage before laying the charge. Whatever it was their timing was not right.
This is not the first time that Sri Lanka are confronted with allegations by the ICC. The most notable one was the Muthiah Muralitharan chucking affair in the Melbourne Test on Boxing Day against Australia in 1996 and three years later involving the same bowler again in Australia at Adelaide in a ODI against England that led to skipper Arjuna Ranatunga putting his career on the line to defend his key bowler and then escaping with a suspended sentence for bringing disrepute to the game by arguing with umpire Ross Emerson on the middle of the pitch and thereby causing undue delay to play.
The third incident concerned dashing batsman Kusal Perera when he was provisionally suspended by ICC for failing an out-of-competition drugs test on October 2015. He was banned in December but the ICC lifted the sanction in May 2016 declaring Pereras results not sustainable.
Had it not been for the diligence of Mr Pereras legal team and the ICCs own desire to uncover the explanation for the reported findings, the consequences could well have been different, and that should be of concern to all involved in the fight against doping, Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive said.
In Ranatungas and Pereras case it was on the legal teams advice that Sri Lanka was able to overturn the accusations leveled against them and Muralitharan then had the full backing of SLC which went to great pains and lengths to clear his name. The key here is that on all three previous occasions there was an elected body in place to defend the accused. In Chandimals case he has a temporary administration to support him. How well they have succeeded the outcome will be known shortly.

Sri Lanka in the global  business platform
The founder of ODEL, Embark and the Otara Foundation, Otara Gunewardene had the opportunity to share her experience and knowledge as an entrepreneur, businesswoman and advocate at three different world forums over the course of the past few months.
Speaking about the forums, Gunewardene explained that she had participated in three forums. The first being the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) which was held in Hyderabad, India under the theme Women First, Prosperity for All, with the participation of over 1500 global entrepreneurs and investors. The summit was hosted by the United States of America and the Republic of India. Therefore, the forum was inaugurated by Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the US delegation was led by Ivanka Trump. It was indeed a privilege to be part of such a prestigious gathering, she commented.
Internationalparticipation
Following that I got an opportunity to speak at the Inaugural Womens Forum The Power of Half a Billion, which was jointly presented by Economic Times and Facebook. This was in Mumbai and had around 50 international speakers and over 500 participants, explained Gunewardene.
The third invitation was from the Ladies Study Group for their conference, Shakti Beyond Borders. The event was a platform to celebrate success stories of women from the 6 SAARC countries who have made significant contributions to their country in different fields.
Overall, the three forums were key to the South Asian region as they created a platform for like-minded advocates to come together, discuss debate and lead innovative initiatives in their focused areas.
It was a privilege to be at these events, especially amidst entrepreneurs who have made their global mark at the GES. It was also a pleasure to represent Sri Lanka together with entrepreneur Merrill J Fernando who also joined the event. The knowledge and experience that was shared in all these forums led to a wider understanding of the kind of opportunities and challenges we have, some are common and others are unique to each country. However, the outlining fact was that change is happening and a lot of focus is being given to encourage more women entrepreneurs across the world, replied Gunewardene when asked to share her feelings at having received invitations to attend such prestigious global events.
EntrepreneurshipSummit
Describing her contribution to each of the events, Gunewardene stated that at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, she had been a part of the discussion named Grassroots Grow: Women in Emerging Markets, in which the participants spoke about how each one of them successfully secured new opportunities in emerging markets, the cultural opportunities and challenges faced by entrepreneurs who are scaling businesses in South Asia. The overall summit was focused on empowering innovators, especially women, to take their ideas to the next level.
The Economic Times Womens Forum focused on over 12 areas such as gender diversity, enhancing womens participation in the workforce, breaking the proverbial glass ceiling, women in sports, start-ups, civic society and performing arts. As a result, it was a gathering of women with achievements in different areas, which included Olympic medallists, Heads of Start-ups, Bollywood directors and combat pilots. The panel Gunewardene spoke in was named Neighbours Beating Gender Bias and on the panel were Sarah Ali from Bangladesh who is the Managing Director of Bitopi Advertising Limited, and Fawzia Koofi  Afghan politician and womens rights activist. It was moderated by Sagarika Ghose, Consulting Editor of the Times of India.
At Shakti Beyond Borders the participants highlighted their experiences and emphasized the fact that the most important thing for women across generations and borders is to stand by each other and help each grow as individuals and professionals. The key focus area was how economic empowerment of more women can build economies, making countries stronger.
Big summit
Reminiscing on the most significant moments of her experience at the forums, Gunewardene said, The GES was one of the biggest summits I have attended. The fact that it was hosted by the governments of India and the USA meant that we were able to meet the Prime Minister of India himself, Narendra Modi. In addition, it was a privilege to meet powerful women like Cherie Blair and Chanda Kochhar  CEO of ICICI Bank and many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders. A few of us were invited for a special dinner with the Prime Minister and Ivanka Trump at the Taj Falaknuma Palace, which was a very special experience. At the ET Womens Forum, I had the opportunity to meet women such as Andrea Jung  the longest tenure female Fortune 500 CEO. These people continue to inspire more and more women to believe in their strengths and encourage others to believe in their dreams.

Sri Lanka Insurance ties up with Medilink to provide cashless card
Sri Lanka Insurance signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Medilink Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. recently which would enable the leading insurance company to provide cashless cards to its insurance policyholders who obtain health cover.
Accordingly, policyholders who have signed up for the SLICs Comprehensive Plan, Overseas Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive D+ plan for diabetics will now receive a card via Medilink.
It would enable them to seek treatment at Medilink-registered private hospitals and get their bills settled at the moment of discharge through the cashless card subject to policy conditions.
The new card system will replace the previous system of reimbursement of medical bills after settlement by customer at the discharge. Hospital admittance can now be done by merely producing the SLIC  Medilink card. This would be a great convenience for the policyholders as its extremely difficult for most of them to settle huge hospital bills when they are being discharged from a hospital even though it maybe reimbursed later.
Sri Lanka Insurance, with over five decades of service to the nation, is the islands largest and strongest insurer. It recently declared a Life Insurance Bonus of Rs. 6.8 billion, the largest in the industry to date and can claim an Assets Base of Rs. 190 billion, again the largest in the insurance industry.
Medilink International is a leading provider of medical support and consultancy services to clients across the world. This strategic tie-up between these two organisations is expected to benefit both parties and ultimately, the health policyholders of SLIC.

Swiss fans book hotel in wrong Russian Rostov
MOSCOW, Monday- A group of Swiss World Cup fans booked a hotel in the wrong Russian city, confusing Rostov-on-Don where Switzerland played Brazil on Sunday, with Rostov Veliky, 1281 km (795 miles) away.
Russian media reported the fans called police when they could not find the hotel, while finding the same street name in the World Cup host city.
Foreign tourists who have come to support Switzerland called us and said they were looking for a hotel, local police said in a statement on Monday.
Our translator told them they were confused in the difficulties of translating Russian geographical names and that they booked a hotel in Rostov Veliky.
Rostovs police press service told Russian media it has employed professional translators and volunteers who speak Spanish, English, Arabic and French for the period of the World Cup.
It added that it helped the confused fans find accommodation.
Earlier Russian and Ukrainian media reported on a group of Swiss fans who travelled to Rostov-on-Don by car through eastern Ukraine, where a four-year conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, apparently unaware that it was a war zone and following their GPS.
Rostov-on-Don sits just 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the frontline in eastern Ukraine. Russia is taking extensive security measures to make sure the fans are safe. The stadium in Rostov-on-Don has a capacity of 45,000 and cost an estimated $320 million. Switzerland drew with Brazil 1-1 in the city on Sunday.  AFP

From crisis to sustenance  Part 29
Tactics alone, without strategic initiatives, wouldnt expand a business exponentially
All companies have plans to grow their business and increase sales and profits. However, there are certain methods companies must use for implementing a growth strategy. The method a company uses to expand its business is largely contingent upon its financial situation, the competition and even government regulation. Some common growth strategies in business include market penetration, market expansion, product expansion, diversification and acquisition.
Market penetration
One growth strategy in business is market penetration. A small company uses a market penetration strategy when it decides to market existing products within the same market it has been using. The only way to grow using existing products and markets is to increase market share, according to small business experts. Market share is the percent of unit and dollar sales a company holds within a certain market vs. all other competitors. One way to increase market share is by lowering prices. For example, in markets where there is little differentiation among products, a lower price may help a company increase its share of the market.
Market expansion
A market expansion growth strategy, often called market development, entails selling current products in a new market. There several reasons why a company may consider a market expansion strategy. First, the competition may be such that there is no room for growth within the current market. If a business does not find new markets for its products, it cannot increase sales or profits. A small company may also use a market expansion strategy if it finds new uses for its product. For example, a small soap distributor that sells to retail stores may discover that factory workers also use its product.
Product expansion
A small company may also expand its product line or add new features to increase its sales and profits. When small companies employ a product expansion strategy, also known as product development, they continue selling within the existing market. A product expansion growth strategy often works well when technology starts to change. A small company may also be forced to add new products as older ones become outmoded.
Diversification Strategies
Growth strategies in business also include diversification, where a small company will sell new products to new markets. This type of strategy can be very risky. A small company will need to plan carefully when using a diversification growth strategy. Marketing research is essential because a company will need to determine if consumers in the new market will potentially like the new products.
Acquisition strategies
Growth strategies in business can also include an acquisition. In acquisition, a company purchases another company to expand its operations. A small company may use this type of strategy to expand its product line and enter new markets. An acquisition growth strategy can be risky, but not as risky as a diversification strategy. One reason is that the products and market are already established. A company must know exactly what it wants to achieve when using an acquisition strategy, mainly because of the significant investment required to implement it.
At this point, it might be profitable for us go through Porters Generic Strategies. Those strategies guide you the route for success, in a different path.
Which do you prefer when you fly: a cheap, no-frills airline, or a more expensive operator with fantastic service levels and maximum comfort And would you ever consider a small company with just a few routes
The choice is up to you, of course. But the point were making here is that when you come to book a flight, there are some very different options available. Why is this so The answer is that each of these airlines has chosen a different way of achieving competitive advantage in a crowded marketplace.
The no-frills operators have opted to cut costs to a minimum and pass their savings on to customers in lower prices. This helps them grab market share and ensure their planes are as full as possible, further driving down cost. The luxury airlines, on the other hand, focus their efforts on making their service as wonderful as possible, and the higher prices they can command as a result make up for their higher costs.
Meanwhile, smaller airlines try to make the most of their detailed knowledge of just a few routes to provide better or cheaper services than their larger, international rivals.
Generic strategies
These three approaches are examples of generic strategies, because they can be applied to products or services in all industries, and to organizations of all sizes. They were first set out by Michael Porter in 1985 in his book, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.
Porter called the generic strategies Cost Leadership (no frills), Differentiation (creating uniquely desirable products and services) and Focus (offering a specialized service in a niche market). He then subdivided the Focus strategy into two parts: Cost Focus and Differentiation Focus.
The cost leadership strategy
Porters generic strategies are ways of gaining competitive advantage  in other words, developing the edge that gets you the sale and takes it away from your competitors. There are two main ways of achieving this within a Cost Leadership strategy:
(1) Increasing profits by reducing costs, while charging industry-average prices. (2) Increasing market share through charging lower prices, while still making a reasonable profit on each sale because youve reduced costs.
The Cost Leadership strategy is exactly that  it involves being the leader in terms of cost in your industry or market. Simply being amongst the lowest-cost producers is not good enough, as you leave yourself wide open to attack by other low-cost producers who may undercut your prices and therefore block your attempts to increase market share.
You therefore need to be confident that you can achieve and maintain the number one position before choosing the Cost Leadership route. Companies that are successful in achieving Cost Leadership usually have: (1) Access to the capital needed to invest in technology that will bring costs down, (2) Very efficient logistics, (3) A low-cost base (labor, materials, facilities), and a way of sustainably cutting costs below those of other competitors.
The greatest risk in pursuing a Cost Leadership strategy is that these sources of cost reduction are not unique to you, and that other competitors copy your cost reduction strategies. This is why its important to continuously find ways of reducing every cost.
The Differentiation Strategy
Differentiation involves making your products or services different from and more attractive than those of your competitors. How you do this depends on the exact nature of your industry and of the products and services themselves, but will typically involve features, functionality, durability, support, and also brand image that your customers value.
To make a success of a Differentiation strategy, organizations need: (1) Good research, development and innovation, (2) The ability to deliver high-quality products or services, (3) Effective sales and marketing, so that the market understands the benefits offered by the differentiated offerings.
Large organizations pursuing a differentiation strategy need to stay agile with their new product development processes. Otherwise, they risk attack on several fronts by competitors pursuing Focus Differentiation strategies in different market segments.
The focus strategy
Companies that use Focus strategies concentrate on particular niche markets and, by understanding the dynamics of that market and the unique needs of customers within it, develop uniquely low-cost or well-specified products for the market. Because they serve customers in their market uniquely well, they tend to build strong brand loyalty amongst their customers. This makes their particular market segment less attractive to competitors.
As with broad market strategies, it is still essential to decide whether you will pursue Cost Leadership or Differentiation once you have selected a Focus strategy as your main approach: Focus is not normally enough on its own.
But whether you use Cost Focus or Differentiation Focus, the key to making a success of a generic Focus strategy is to ensure that you are adding something extra as a result of serving only that market niche. Its simply not enough to focus on only one market segment because your organization is too small to serve a broader market (if you do, you risk competing against better-resourced broad market companies offerings).
The something extra that you add can contribute to reducing costs (perhaps through your knowledge of specialist suppliers) or to increasing differentiation (though your deep understanding of customers needs).
Choosing the right generic strategy
Your choice of which generic strategy to pursue underpins every other strategic decision you make, so its worth spending time to get it right.
But you do need to make a decision: Porter specifically warns against trying to hedge your bets by following more than one strategy. One of the most important reasons why this is wise advice is that the things you need to do to make each type of strategy work appeal to different types of people. Cost Leadership requires a very detailed internal focus on processes. Differentiation, on the other hand, demands an outward-facing, highly creative approach.
So, when you come to choose which of the three generic strategies is for you, its vital that you take your organizations competencies and strengths into account.
Many companies cannot grow and expand their business either because they keep tilling the same infertile ground or did not beef up in markets with great potential. Tactics alone cannot expand a business exponentially; appropriate strategic initiatives are needed to bring the company to the next level of growth and greater potential.

TCHAIKOVSKY'S WINTER DAYDREAMS IN AUTUMN
The greatness in Tchaikovsky is that no one could reach his work to perfection. Try as one would, there will always be a flaw.
His first large-scale compositions began to emerge with Symphony No. 1, Winter's Daydreams among others. By then, he was established as one of the greats of his time, later to become the world's No. 1 composer to date.
Yet, there is no doubt that one thing Brits do brilliantly is to perform their classical music. The rush to get to their seats tonight was one mad scramble in which I too got pushed along until I reached my seat at the Royal Albert Hall, the prestigious, most popular and revered theatre in Britain. The Brits were dressed casually at this formal concert with none of their scruffy overcoats.
Autumn was kind, gentle and soothing tonight.
The vast arena jam-packed rose together as the conductor of Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Vasily Petrenko with a loud round of applause as he entered and stood centre - stage. The occasion, BBC presented the Henry Wood Promenade Concert.
Tonight, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 1 in G minor. WINTER DAYDREAMS took off with no fuss or fervour. A treat to watch the massive orchestra with those talented musicians so very professional, it appeared Petrenko had no problems with his baton.
This Allegro Tranquillo symphony beings as no other symphony of his; more gently or undemonstratively, yet within the next couple of minutes the unassuming flute and bassoon theme and especially the nervous chromatic idea that swiftly accompanies it, have built up an opening to extend a self-sufficient shortest of transitions to the second movement, could have been inappropriate which means that none of Tchaikovsky's symphonic openings was ever to grow more convincingly nor were his second movements to testify more eloquently to his melodic powers. In the neatly proportioned reminder of this first movement, two passages were especially striking they open out impressively and fade away to the end furtively.
Salvaged from an orchestra piece called THE STORM, the hushed string passage that opened and closed the second movement was composed in 1864 as a vacation exercise.
Conductor Petrenko rose to the occasion bringing down his baton between these flanks which is the decorative side of Tchaikovsky's art and elaborate many of the 10 short phrases that make up to the oboe theme followed up by the viola and flute theme that followed and later oboe's fourth phrase.
Perhaps, the pervading gentle melancholy of this lovely Adagio offers some justification for the title given by Tchaikovsky which I find difficult to understand. Yet, it is so alive and clear in character.
But why on earth WINTER DAYDREAMS This symphony No.1 minor, op. 13 composed in 1866 and revived in 1874, explains all in what was played tonight:
01. Daydreams of a Winter Journey; Allegro Tranquillo
02. Land of Desolation, Land of Mists; Adagio cantabile ma non tanto.
03. Scherzo; Allegro scherzando giocoso
04. Finale; Andante lugubre - Alleegro moderato - Allegro maestoso - Allegr vivo.
These four major movements combined in WINTER DAYDREAMS
In particular, in the Finale the Russian folk song is the foundation both in the slow introduction and rough second movement, in the ensuing sonata movement.
WINTER DAYDREAMS, however, is not Tchaikovsky's outstanding scores but he has one little surprise which is the return of the slow introduction after the recapitulation of the first movement followed by a horror passage leading to the second which probably fill out the blueprint of a sonata form with a mixture of melody and counterpoint. I find The Finale lacks that inner growth that makes the opening movement so impressive but provides an effective ending. For me, it was listening experience that ruffled my head. Some of the movements simply bored me.
When finally Petrenko brought down the baton on the last note. I was revived. That is as far as Tchaikovsky's is concerned but he is beyond a single symphony that may not appeal to me and to so many music lovers like me. Apart from that feeling, to me, Tchaikovsky's symphonies are like a tale of two halves. The first half begins with DAYDREAMS ON A WINTRY ROAD which is the maestro's own title for the first movement of his FIRST SYMPHONY which feels like a fairy-tale, albeit minus the bi-tonal Polish and the Finale to his THIRD SYMPHONY. The second half was scored two years later and together what I was listening tonight at the moment along with about one thousand people.
Tchaikovsky himself confirmed what is already unmistakable; that this is a drama of Fate and of Mankind's struggle to evade it. His symphonic career ended barely two months before his death with the tragic slow Finale to his Sixth Symphony ebbing into the abject gloom.
Something tonight's audience felt after the last note died and faded off.
VASLLY PETRENKO Tonight's conductor is the Chief Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and many other famous orchestras. Born and educated in St. Petersburg, he is also the Chief Conductor of State Academy Orchestra of St. Petersburg. Enjoys a firm relationship with the world's leading orchestras. In the USA, he made a successful debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonia and the Boston, Chiage, San Francisco, and St. Louise Symphonic Orchestra.

Three-way tussle for Milo Presidents trophy schools k/o rugby crown
St. Peters College Bambalapitiya who defeated St. Anthonys College Kandy after a one sided affair in their Milo President trophy inter-school rugby knockout championship quarterfinal match at Royal Sports Complex are one step away from qualifying for the finals.
Peters were expected to be given a tough fight by Anthonys but it turned out to be a one sided match as the Peterites came on top against a St. Anthonys outfit, who have failed to live upto expectations.
St. Peters acting captain and nippy scrum half Jason Karunaratne led from the front. He created the openings for many tries in their 39-12 win and he has been playing really well throughout the season. Their two centres the Madushanka brothers Dilshan and Rukshan along with full back Shehan Liyanapathirana, flanker Sunera Fernando and hard working fly half Kenneth Wimaladasa too were in the thick of the game and added their names to the try list.
The Peterites who meet Wesley in Sundays second semi-final are now one of the favourites to win the championship along with defending champions St. Josephs and Kingswood who are scheduled to meet in the first semi-final on Saturday. St. Josephs beat Maliyadeva College Kurunegala by 45 points to 17 in another one-sided quarterfinal at the Sugathadasa Stadium. The Josephians defended with a lot of heart which paid off in the end. Wesley College pulled off a stunning win in their quarterfinal match against much fancied Isipathana College by 22 points to 15 also at the Sugathadasa Stadium.
Wesleys young hero was wing three quarter Kavindana Perera who scored two tries with co-winger Mohandas Paranitharan scoring the match winning try after the scores were deadlocked at 15-all.
Kingswood College Kandy caused the other quarterfinal shock when they beat their home town rivals Trinity College Kandy by 24 points to 15 at Nittawala.

Tomato processing in SL: Is it a viable remedy to manage surplus
Tomato is an important and seasonal cash crop for Sri Lankan farmers. Due to seasonality, there is a considerable surplus of production over consumer demand during the season. At the same time, a wide variety of processed products is also derived from tomato. These include canned tomatoes, paste, sauce, puree, juice and ketch-up. Therefore, policymakers, the media, farmers and even the general public question as to why there are no initiatives to use the excess during the season in any industry making tomato products. The objective of this article is to provide a critical view of tomato production, surplus and feasibility of using the surplus in any industry.
Production, uses and surplus
According to the Department of Census and Statistics, the tomato extent and production in 2000 have increased by 25 percent and 71 percent respectively, by 2010. This indicates there is an increasing trend of cultivating tomato over the years. At the same time, it can also be observed that the farmers were able to increase the production by 71 percent, increasing the extent by only 25 percent, shifting to high-yielding varieties. Of the production, 80 percent is confined to six districts and those major producing districts are Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Matale, Anuradhapura and Ratnapura. In 2010, 7,261ha of land were cultivated and a harvest of 75,335mt of tomatoes was obtained.
Of the total production, the majority is consumed locally. With respect to tomato exports, according to the Department of Customs, only 1,631kg of tomatoes were exported in 2005 and it has increased only up to 10,194kg in 2009. This shows that tomato exports are at a very low level compared to production. In addition, the only local destination for fresh tomatoes is the consumers who purchase tomatoes in the form of a fresh fruit.
The surplus can be calculated with the production, losses and consumption data. Therefore, data for the period 20062010 depict that there was an excess production of 27,894mt of tomatoes annually. The main reason for this surplus is farmers lack of vision. The type of vegetable to be grown is determined by the prices of the previous season. Most of the time, all farmers cultivate the same type which had a good price in the previous season.
This data therefore theoretically shows that annually there is a considerable amount of tomatoes that is not being used at the national level. Further, theoretically, there is potential to use these fresh tomatoes for any project. However, can we use this surplus If so, how can we use it That is the challenge we face and the latter part of this article tries to explore that challenge in detail.
Managing the tomato surplus
One of the remedies for the surplus is to use it in processing. In 2009, with the support of the state sector, a large-scale tomato processing factory was established in the Nalanda Industrial Zone, Matale, by a local investor with an investment of nearly Rs.60 million and the factory commenced its operations to make tomato pulp targeting the local producers of tomato pulp-based products, such as tomato sauce and tomato ketch-up. Even though the local investor commenced operations of the factory with much hope, the factory closed down just after the first trial operation in 2009.
In addition, medium-scale production was also carried out in the same industrial zone by another investor to make tomato sauce targeting the rural market. However, that was also not successful and they also stopped their product line after a few months of operations.
The aim of this article is to present the main factors that led to the closure of the tomato processing factories located in the NalandaIndustrial Zone and it would help identify guidelines for similar interventions in the future. The main factors that acted negatively on the sustainability of tomato processing were identified under six themes and are presented below.
i. Appropriate technology and production process
With regard to tomato processing, the opinion of a technical expert on the above theme is mentioned below.
Normal evaporating machines are not suitable for tomato processing as it lowers the quality of the product specially the colour. Therefore, the suitable technology for tomato processing is vacuum concentration. Earlier, we did not have that technology in the country and recently, that new technology and machines have been imported for the use of that failed factory. However, in general, the capacity of machines of vacuum concentration is comparatively high. (A technical expert in the state sector, 2013)
This indicates that though the technology is available, the operational capacity may not be able to manage easily.
This factor may result in negative impacts.
ii. Availability of raw material
Figure 1 shows the monthly tomato surplus based on the average data for the period of 20072011. This indicates that the surplus is not at a constant level throughout the year. The nature of the surplus has to be considered critically with respect to the tomato requirement of the industry.
Even if the surplus is compatible with the industry requirement, it does not imply that the industry can obtain that surplus easily.
A large number of farmers throughout the districts cultivating tomato and their plot size ranges between a quarter acre to large scale such as 20 acres. All these farmers are contributing to this availability and therefore, a well-established mechanism is required to obtain the surplus of raw material to a focal point which is not an easy task. The unavailability of a proper mechanism to get the surplus to a focal point was one of the reasons for the failure of the large-scale factory.
iii. Technical appropriateness of available raw material
According to technical experts, in tomato processing, the appropriateness of fresh tomatoes for processing mainly depends on the brix value, an important indicator which determines the ability of a tomato variety for processing. In general, almost all the farmers are cultivating imported hybrid varieties these days due to high yield and income. However, the suitability of the imported hybrid varieties for processing has not been tested yet. Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding the technical suitability of the available tomato varieties for processing.
Another quality required for processing is the lycopene content in ripe tomatoes. Lycopene is a pigment and it gives the red colour to the fruit and to the paste. The lycopene content of a fruit is very important to get the accepted colour of the paste as adding artificial colour to the tomato paste is not allowed.
Development of the pigment depends on the variety and the cultivated temperature and the desirable content can be obtained if cultivated in temperatures between 180C - 200C. This factor too, acts as a barrier as the majority of our tomato production does not come from the areas with that desirable temperature.
In addition, another practical issue is the excessive use of chemicals in cultivation. Field observations revealed that most of the farmers are using chemicals exceeding the recommended quantity. Therefore, it can affect the quality of the product of the industry at the end.
iv. Accessibility of raw material
Linkages between production and processing and production and marketing need to be further developed through the establishment and strengthening of supply arrangements with farmers.
Further, a systematic method is required to collect the scattered stocks of raw materials to a focal point. The study found that absence of a systematic and well-developed mechanism to collect the required quantity of tomatoes to the large-scale factory led to a failed project.
v. Affordability of raw material
Strong controls on the purchase price of raw materials need to be observed and strong affordability is one of the key success factors of an industry.
Figure 2 shows the monthly wholesale price of tomato at the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre (DDEC). The average minimum and the maximum monthly wholesale prices of tomato at the DDEC for the period 20002009 was Rs.19.61 and Rs.40.75 respectively. Two seasons had comparatively low prices and the seasons were January to April and August to October. For the period January to April, prices ranged between Rs.23.97 - 30.13 per kg and it was Rs. 19.61 - 24.77 per kg from August to October. The prices offered by the industry to purchase tomato should be compatible with these open market prices. If not, the farmers will not provide the raw material to the industry.
The prices offered by the factories were lower than the market prices and therefore, farmers had not provided tomato to the industry. If the factory increases the price, then it is not competitive to sell their produce as the price of imported tomato paste would be lower than the local product.
vi. Marketing of the product
With regard to tomato products, though there are no local producers, there are considerable numbers of international producers who have access to local buyers. Therefore, the failed factories had to meet the competition with the producers overseas especially with respect to price and quality. The study found that the importers of tomato paste, who would be the potential buyers of the product, were of the view that the imported paste was high in quality and low in price compared to the local paste.
This study indicates that using the tomato surplus in processing is not practical at large and medium scale and it may result in negative impacts than positive impacts. On the other hand, results show that the excess production is not the only criteria to go for processing and a lot of factors have to be considered before investing to have a viable, profitable and sustainable industry, while protecting valuable resources such as money, land, time and efforts.
Therefore, one of the practical recommendations to manage the surplus is to match the production with the demand. Production-oriented cultivation has to be converted into market-oriented cultivation considering the demand at the market. To support that, the production-oriented extension service has to be transformed into a market-oriented extension service.

Trump Wants To Ban German Car Imports To US
President Donald Trump allegedly wants to ban imports of German-made vehicles or at least thats what he is telling foreign leaders. German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche reports that during French President Emmanuel Macron visit to Washington D.C. in April, Trump said he wanted to exclude German models from America. The publication cited several unnamed diplomats from the United States and Europe as the sources for its story.
Germany is the top auto exporter in the European Union. The country sent 657,000 vehicles to North America in 2017, according to Automotive News citing figures from Germanys auto industry association.
Given President Trumps past statements, we cant simply write this ban off as an idle threat. The Germans are bad, very bad. See the millions of cars they are selling to the US. Terrible. We will stop this, Trump said last year. After being elected but before he took office, Trump also pledged to place a 35 percent tax on every German car brought into the U.S.
However, its hard to imagine how Trump could ever implement such massive ban because German automakers have factories all over the world. For example, Mercedes-Benz builds the latest G-Class at Magna-Steyrs plant in Austria and the forthcoming Audi E-Tron Quattro is a product of Belgium. Without singling out imports from specific brands, the Presidents plan wouldnt keep models like this out of the country.
In addition, Mercedes, BMW, and Volkswagen already have plants in the United States. German automakers built 804,000 vehicles in the U.S. last year, according to Automotive News. BBC

U.S. will not be a migrant camp: Trump
US: US President Donald Trump vowed on Monday that the United States would not become a migrant camp as he faced mounting pressure to stop families being separated as a deterrent to illegal immigration.
The United States will not be a migrant camp, and it will not be a refugee holding facility, Trump said in remarks delivered at the White House. It wont be. You look at whats happening in Europe, you look at whats happening in other places, we cant allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch.
About 2,000 children have been separated from their parents or guardians over six weeks, according to US authorities, since the Trump administration announced that all migrants illegally crossing the Mexican border would be arrested, regardless of whether the adults were seeking asylum.
Since children cannot be sent to the facilities where their parents are held, they are separated from them.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants family separations to end, but has refused to take responsibility for them -- instead blaming Democrats, the minority party in Congress, whom he accuses of blocking legislation on the broader issue of illegal immigration.
He doubled down on that claim on Monday in a series of tweets, and again in remarks before a meeting of the National Space Council.
If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing, we could have something done very quickly. Good for the children, good for the country, good for the world, he said.
We have the worst immigration laws in the entire world. Were stuck with these horrible laws. Theyre horrible laws. Whats happening is so sad, is so sad. And it can be taken care of quickly, beautifully, he said.
But just remember, a country without borders is not a country at all. We need borders, we need security. We need safety. We have to take care of our people.  - AFP

US quits 'biased' UN human rights council

The US has pulled out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling it a "cesspool of political bias".
The "hypocritical and self-serving" body "makes a mockery of human rights", said US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley.
Haley last year accused the council of "chronic anti-Israel bias" and said the US was reviewing its membership.
Formed in 2006, the Geneva-based council has been criticised for allowing countries with questionable human rights records to be members.
But activists said the US move could hurt efforts to monitor and address human rights abuses around the world. Haley announced the US's intention to quit the council at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the council "a poor defender of human rights".
UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, in a statement released through his spokesman, responded by saying he would have "much preferred" the US to remain in the council.
The UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, called the US withdrawal "disappointing, if not really surprising, news".
Israel, meanwhile, has praised the decision.
The move comes amid intense criticism over the Trump administration's policy of separating child migrants from their parents at the US-Mexico border.
