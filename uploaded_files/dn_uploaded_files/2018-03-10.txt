In the water youre weightless: the 99-year-old swimmer breaking records
George Corones waited nearly 100 years for a world record, and then two came along at once. The 99-year old Queenslander, who is wary of causing too much fuss, broke his first on Wednesday last week and by Saturday he had two to his name.
He hit the wall at the Gold Coast Aquatic Centre in 56 seconds across 50m, and in two-and-a-half minutes across 100m, smashing the record for his age group  100 to 104. A delirious home crowd watched him become master of a very specific slice of the world.
Corones, who stopped swimming at the start of the second world war and did not start again until he was 80, is sheepish about what he has done. He is doing his best to be unimpressed with himself and is certain his time will be beaten.
All I can say is the public have amazed me, he tells Guardian Australia. Theyve overwhelmed me and theyve been overly generous in their response to what has happened. I certainly didnt anticipate any of this.
Speaking over the phone from his home in Brisbane, Corones is a reluctant worldbeater. Swimming is something he does in private. It lets him exercise without pain. He only ever competes alone, and he is happy if his record encourages other masters-level swimmers to join him. I was a little concerned beforehand because Ive only just come up from a break away from swimming, he says of his recent efforts. I wasnt quite at the top but I was well enough.
It wasnt a great hurdle to beat, but it had to be done. Somehow, by someone. Were on unbroken ground, put it that way. These current figures are waiting for the attack from the burgeoning number of masters swimmers  ladies and men  who are waiting to see what can be done. They will surmount it, thats how it goes.
n many ways, he swims for himself, and lays down records for others.
Its a goad, he says. An encouragement. The achievement of a performer is a goal for someone else to achieve a better figure. You can see there is value in making public what can be done.
Corones turns 100 in April, which puts him in this age category. He smashed the previous 50m record, held by Britains John Harrison, by 30 seconds. Most masters records languish in obscurity. At the time of publication, the official Fina website for masters records had a glitch that meant it didnt show anything.
While I was swimming I was conscious of the rumble of the crowd, says Corones. It as much as anything egged me along.
That constant consciousness is the key to Corones. He is acutely aware of what he has done. He is aware of how few people his age swim, of how the crowd watches and expects, of his own body  its only when he swims that he isnt.
Swimming is the only activity that the human can indulge in that is gravity free, he says. You realise gravity incessantly is putting a strain on us. You cant escape gravity even if youre sitting down  youre probably in a bad posture and your muscles and ligaments are aching because of it  but swimming gives you that opportunity.
In the water youre weightless. While youre there, you can use all the muscles in your body, your sinews and elastic tissues, without that extra weight thats on you. In the water its just yourself and no weight at all.
In the water, Corones is the fastest man in the world (with caveats). For now, he is overwhelmed. He will go back to swimming three laps a week, sleeping well and eating a boiled egg for breakfast.
Im just going to continue to do what Ive been doing in the way Ive been doing it, he says. Which is repetitively and patiently. Im about to go through a stage of recovery, and as soon as I feel Im ready, Ill start again.

Address root causes of conflict in society
Kandy is reportedly calming down. The violence that was seen in many areas, especially Digana, Teldeniya and Katugastota has been largely curbed. The efforts to restore complete peace in the region, and understanding between the Sinhala and Muslim populations will need much more concerted action by the leaders of the communities and government. It will require strong efforts to prevent this crisis moving to further areas of communal unrest and confrontations that cannot be the goal of the Sri Lankan people.
In the field of governance, Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, current Minister of Public Administration and Management, is sworn-in as the Minister of Law and Order, the portfolio temporarily held by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe since the recent half shuffle of the Cabinet. It removes Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka from the running for this office, despite much effort by the UNP; and many objections by the Joint Opposition (JO) and the SLFP group within the government to a possible Fonseka appointment.
Minister Madduma Bandara (UNP) certainly takes over a huge burden both in politics and governance. A Member of Parliament from the Monaragala District since 1989, he was Chairman of the District Development Council from 1981 to 1988, and a Minister of the Uva Provincial Council, too. He takes up this office when the very issue of Law and Order, especially the lack of it, has been pointed out by many as the cause for the recent crisis that took place in Kandy, as well as the earlier situation in Ampara. The communal violence in Kandy is the matter of urgency, with the necessity to prevent it from spreading into a wider and dangerous communal conflict, the like of which is not strange in Sri Lanka, in recent decades.
There is also the need to act with speed and purpose in seriously pursuing the charges of fraud and corruption among the leading members of the Rajapaksa Regime, which was the pledge to the people that saw the election of the current Yahapalanaya coalition of National Unity. It is no secret that the opposition to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to this office by the JO and the SLFP (and SLPP) was largely due to fears as to the possibility of his acting with a strong commitment against these forces of corruption. Both Justice, Law and Order have been with the UNP since August 2015, and the long record of delays and inaction with regard to the corruption of the last regime, has been a strong negative on the government. It has also raised criticism from President Sirisena on more than one occasion. It certainly contributed to the defeat suffered by both the SLFP-UPFA and UNP in the recent local government poll. Therefore, Minister Madduma Bandara certainly has a major task in his performance, in the context both the communal tensions arising from Ampara and Kandy, and the delay in the governments promised fight against corruption.
Ampara and Kandy
The Police now reports that the main suspects in the instigation of violence and pursuit of communal disharmony in the major disturbances in Kandy have been arrested, along with nine others. Until 6 a.m. on Thursday (8th) a further 71 individuals have been arrested by various police stations in the Kandy district in relation to criminal incidents that occurred from the night of March 4, leading to 81 suspects being in custody over the violent incidents in Kandy.
These reports are encouraging, but the question certainly arises as to the cause of the delay in suitable and necessary action being taken to prevent the large scale violence that did take place, and laid the groundwork for a much larger communal confrontation, largely brought under control with the deployment of the military.
This situation requires looking at what took place at Ampara just a week earlier, where too there were serious criticisms of inaction by the Police, and other state institutions. It did see an attack on a Mosque and on property of Muslim citizens. The violence arose over a wholly false claim of sterilization tablets being served in rice sold in a Muslim owned eatery. Such talk has been spreading for some time in this county. There are many who warn the majority Sinhala Buddhists of this danger to the majority community being reduced to a minority by these means.
The government authorities, especially those responsible for ensuring communal harmony, have not taken adequate educational steps to expose this deadly and sinister publicity move. In fact, it was several days after the Ampara violence that the Director of Health Services made a statement that such medicine for male sterility does not exist in the world. It is a fact that could have been given publicity and brought to the knowledge of the wider public, with proper use of the media  both regular and social, and steps taken to prevent manipulation by the forces of communal rivalry and violence, through better social knowledge  among both the clergy and laity.
The situation that led to the violence and aroused communal hatred in Kandy is of a different nature, and in fact was not from any situation of communal violence. It was the result of a motor accident involving lorry driven by a Sinhala person, and others in a three-wheeler. The lorry driver was badly beaten in this assault, and admitted to hospital, on February 20, where he spent several days in the ICU before his death on March 3. There was no evidence of racial enmity in this confrontation.
The alleged assaulters from the three-wheeler were arrested by the Police. But the situation was to change very fast after the drivers death. It is now known that the leader of the Bodu Bala Sena, Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera visited the funeral house, a few hours before the first attacks in Getambe had taken place. The Police did intervene and make several arrests. But there was an overall neglect of official government action to prevent any further violence.
The next morning there had been a mob near the Police Station demanding the release of the suspects, and the Bodu Bala Sena leader and another monk had also been here. There had also been statements about contacting a DIG who would support their demand. This showed a dangerous twist on to communalism, which required quick and determined action by the authorities, but which did not come in time.
The situation that followed is what Kandy and the country faces today. It is one of Ethno-religious hatred that is showing its continued position in the country through all the years of independence.
We have had many years of ethno-religious peace, but hardly any of real understanding. The hatred remains below the surface, ready to come out with violence depending on the support from ethnic or religious extremist forces, and governments that find this suitable for the consolidation of power.
The widow of the driver who was killed in the Getambe post-accident attack, Lalitha Pushpakumari (41) said that fighting cant bring back the life of her husband. There is no point in fighting and claiming more precious lives of the people, and making more widows like me. My husband was so innocent and everyone in the village adored him. She is now helpless with a disabled son, a daughter, his mother and herself. What is the future for her family (Daily Mirror  Feb. 07, 2018). This is a very Buddhist statement, which is certainly not the thinking of the Sinhala Buddhist majoritarian extremists, who certainly stoked the fires that has burned parts of Kandy, and continues to pose a future threat to Sri Lankan society.
Coming after all the Ethno-religious violence on Black July in 1983, and all that followed in the years of LTTE terrorism, this shows the need for responsible forces and institutions of government to take all necessary action to prevent the spread of ethno-religious hatred that can, and will, lead to violence, posing major threats to the unity of Sri Lankan society.
This also calls for rethinking the policies of political parties and organisations of civil society that can influence the proper progress of society. One has to look at the economic and social backwardness of the country, and how this affects the Ethno-religious relations in the country, and how much the constitutional guarantee of the highest place to Buddhism, has helped to promote Buddhist thinking in society, as against the thinking of majoritarian power in every context.
The situation in Kandy and Ampara certainly makes it necessary to look back at what happened in Aluthgama in July 2014, and the forces that led to that major ethno-religious clash and certainly played their part in the tragedies of today. This calls for rethinking of politics to address the needs of the people, without exposing them to the forces of division, and building a majority with an understanding and belief in the rights of all humans. It is a need to address the root causes of ethno-religious conflict, and not evade them.

Allies and rivals hit out at Trump trade tariffs
CHINA: United States trading partners, led by Asian powerhouses China and Japan, lashed out Friday at controversial tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium signed off by President Donald Trump, as fears grew of a global trade war. Close ally Japan warned the tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminium could have a grave impact on the economic relationship between the world's top and third-largest economies.
Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the move could harm the global trading system and the entire world economy and said Tokyo would urge the US to give the country an exemption.
The world's second-biggest economy, China, was also vocal in its opposition, deriding the tariffs as a serious attack on normal international trade order. In a sharp reversal from decades of a US-led drive towards more open trade, Trump declared on Thursday that America had been ravaged by aggressive foreign trade practices.
It's really an assault on our country, he blasted, announcing the tariffs on the metals used in everything from cars to construction, roads to railways. Trump said the tariffs -- which will come into effect after 15 days -- will not initially apply to Canada and Mexico, and that close partners on security and trade could negotiate exemptions.
Canada was the single-largest US source of steel last year, followed by Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Mexico, Japan and Germany.
The US neighbour to the north was also by far the largest supplier of alumina and aluminium, followed by China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump had indicated he would be flexible toward real friends, and during the signing confirmed Canada and Mexico would be exempted permanently if the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement is successful.
But both Mexico and Canada rejected Trump's linkage of the levies to ongoing NAFTA talks.
Canada's foreign affairs minister termed the two things separate issues while Mexico's economy ministry said the negotiation of the NAFTA should not be subject to conditions outside the process. The US leader had also added Australia to a list of likely carve-outs, as a great country and long-term partner.
However, he took aim at Germany, reviving a longstanding gripe that European NATO allies do not pay their fair share.
Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on the military are our allies, as they call them, he complained.
The EU, Brazil and Britain were also quick to launch broadsides against the tariffs, which are worth billions of dollars.
The top European Union trade official Cecilia Malmstroem insisted the entire bloc should be excluded from the tariffs as a close ally, vowing to seek more clarity from Washington. Britain blasted the tariffs as not the right way to tackle the problem of global overcapacity in steel and said it would work with the EU to consider the scope for exemptions. The EU has promised tariffs on items from steel to peanut butter, bourbon and denim -- most of which are produced in states that Trump needs to win re-election.
Major producer Brazil immediately vowed to take all necessary steps in order to protect its rights and interests in response to the US move.
Last week Trump stunned the world -- and his own aides -- with an off-the-cuff announcement of his plan, even before White House lawyers judged the legality of the tariffs.
Trump said he was merely fulfilling a campaign promise, saying he had been talking about perceived trade injustices a long time, a lot longer than my political career. And while the full economic impact remains unknown, the political fallout was swift with the top Republican in Congress Paul Ryan publicly denouncing Trump's move, and vowing to push him to narrow its focus to countries and practices that violate trade law. The move also sparked the resignation of top economic advisor Gary Cohn in protest.
And even as Trump approved the tariffs, 11 partners in the Asia-Pacific were in Santiago, Chile, to sign a multilateral trade deal embraced by president Barack Obama but rejected by Trump.
However, stock markets in Asia rallied as traders said the tariffs could have been worse. Equities were also buoyed by the news that Trump would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.- AFP

Aloysius, Palisenas revision application dismissed
The Colombo High Court yesterday dismissed the revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena arrested and remanded in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue observing that the Colombo Fort Magistrates order of rejecting bail was correct in law.
While dismissing the revision petition, High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne observed that the Colombo Fort Magistrates order of rejecting bail was correct in law.
Through this revision application, Aloysius and Palisena sought an order against the Colombo Fort Magistrates Courts refusal to grant bail on February 16.
The petitioner is also seeking an order to release him on bail.
On February 16, Arjun Aloysius and PTL Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena were ordered to be further remanded till March 2 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
In this application, the petitioner had cited the OIC of CID (Unit 3), the Director of CID and the Attorney General as respondents.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had refused to release two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by defence are not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances since they had been charged under Public Property Act.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Counsel Navin Marapana under the instruction of Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioners.

Australias Women in Work programme to create jobs for females
This years International Womens Day theme Press for Progress is a timely reminder to celebrate achievements to date and renew efforts moving forward. With movements such as #MeToo and, #TimesUp, there is clearly global momentum to press for progress on gender equality, the Australian High Commission stated in a press release.
Australia is supporting a range of initiatives to promote gender equality in Sri Lanka. Through the Women in Work program, we are partnering with the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, to create more and better jobs for women, Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson said.
Last week, I convened a select group of CEOs, political leaders and international organisations to identify opportunities to advocate together for increased female workforce participation, he said.
On 7 March, Australia partnered with the Colombo Stock Exchange, IFC and UN Women to Ring the Bell for Gender Equality. The event was also an opportunity to celebrate the growing number of Sri Lankan women on the boards of listed companies.
Australia is supporting leadership opportunities for women. The introduction of a 25 per cent quota for womens representation in local government was a milestone for Sri Lanka, and it is important that this commitment be met, said Hutchesson. Australia has supported capacity-building of candidates, public awareness campaigns and raised the important issue of violence against women during elections.
Later this month, senior members of the Women Parliamentarians Caucus will travel to Australia through our Women in Local Leadership program. The visit will provide the opportunity to share experiences with fellow women parliamentarians and discuss some of Australias initiatives to promote gender equality.
This week also saw the launch of the Sri Lankan chapter of the Women in Leadership network. This new network of women who have studied in Australian universities provides an important opportunity for women to share experiences, advocate and support other professional women through mentoring.
International Womens Day is an important occasion, but we need to ensure that we keep up the momentum throughout the year, said Hutchesson. It is up to all of us to Press for Progress, he added.

Can De Mazenod win La Sallian Trophy this year
The annual traditional cricket fixture between De Mazenod College and St. Benedicts College will take place today and tomorrow at Kandana.
De Mazenod has not tasted victory since the two schools started to play for the La Sallian Trophy six years ago. St. Benedicts won last in 2016 when De Mazenod hosted them at Kandana.
De Mazenod has played around 13 matches this season and registered a solitary outright victory against Gurukula while going down to St. Josephs and Mahinda.
St. Benedicts who encountered fluctuating fortunes losing four matches and registering three outright victories this season will be eager to retain the trophy. They will rely on seasons consistent performers Mahesh Theekshana, Kaveesha Jayathilaka, wicketkeeper Shehan Fernando and paceman Prithvi Jegarajasingham, who has done well of late.

International Project Management Best Practices for Effective Project Delivery:
'Combined effort will result in success'
Success in projects is not just from strong performance in one activity, but from the combined improvement of the assets, knowledge and institutions that support government efforts, especially when developing resilient infrastructure and resilient communities.
"The UNOPS will continue to support our partners to overcome the inherent challenges in major projects and stay engaged in our positive and long term partnership with Government of Sri Lanka, Charles Callanan (Director, UNOPS Nepal Operational Hub) said.
He was participating in a high-level roundtable meeting on International Project Management Best Practices for Effective Project Delivery organised by the United Nations Office for Project Services(UNOPS) for the key decision-makers in the Government of Sri Lanka on Monday.
The meeting was organised to share best practices and lessons learnt in project management from the UNOPS global and local experiences to improve Sri Lankas project delivery. Secretary to Treasury Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga graced the occasion as its Chief Guest.
I am very aware of the challenges faced by my colleagues in the ERD to ensure that the line ministries and the executing agencies involved in foreign and local funded projects discharge their duties and responsibilities efficiently to ensure that the projects under their management is implemented in a timely and efficient manner, he said.
He noted that the UNOPS as the UNs specialised agency on project management can offer Sri Lanka many insights to help it improve its project delivery capacity.
UNOPS Regional Director for Asia Sanjay Mathur said effective project and programme delivery has become ever so important in the current development context of South Asia and in particular Sri Lanka where many significant development projects are being conceptualised, planned, and implemented. Delivering services and managing projects benefiting the population, with good quality, on time and within budget has become essential for governments across the world.
Sri Lanka being a developing country is at a critical juncture where effective project management has become an integral factor in countrys development. Globally, the losses incurred due to bad project management is approximately 10 percent (of the project budget) and can often be much higher.
With UNOPS implementing approximately 1100 projects at any given time across the world, there are many lessons and best practices that can be shared with the government for improved project delivery, many of which are from UNOPS experience in delivering projects in Sri Lanka and South Asia.
A presentation was delivered by the Department of National Planning about project prioritisation and appraisals moving forward, explaining the challenges and opportunities of the way it is been done in country.
This was followed by an interactive panel discussion that discussed the opportunities and challenges in project delivery in Sri Lanka, amongst others.
Sudhir Muralidharan (Director a.i., UNOPS Sri Lanka and Maldives) said the UNOPS was committed to support the Government of Sri Lanka and would continue the dialogue to support Sri Lanka to plan, develop, and implement projects that would contribute to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Eliminating fake news
Here is the plain truth: Lies travel much faster than the truth ever does. As the saying goes, a Lie can go halfway around the world before the Truth has a chance to put its pants on. This is even more so in this age of instant online communication inclusive of the likes of Skype, Viber, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, Whats App and IMO. Someone in say, Rio de Janeiro can almost instantly know what is apparently happening in Colombo, whether true or false.
It is no secret that lies and fake news (news that appears to be real, but is not) are mostly conveyed through social media sites (ex: Facebook) and instant messaging apps (ex: Whats App). With a reach of billions of people, they have the power to shape opinions and worryingly, create hate and animosity against particular individuals, countries, communities or groups.
Hence the Governments timely decision to temporarily block a number of social media networks and messaging apps in the wake of recent incidents in the Kandy region. It has been clear for some time that extremists on all sides have been spreading lies and fake news online, targeting various communities and religious groups. These have the potential to inflame racial passions that can lead to disastrous consequences, as we have just witnessed. The very nature of the Internet means that anyone can post anything on social media or other websites with hardly any control over the contents therein.
There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. In fact, this has been well demonstrated in recent elections held in several countries where foreign countries or agents had created Facebook posts and Twitter feeds aimed at (successfully) influencing the voters. A new study conducted recently has confirmed what we already know  that social networks are one giant web of lies, deceit and intrigue.
This study, just published in the journal Science, used a data set of rumour cascades on Twitter from 2006 (the year Twitter started) to 2017. About 126,000 rumours were spread by over three million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. By every common metric, falsehood consistently dominated the truth on Twitter, the study found. Fake news and false rumours reach more people, penetrate deeper into the social network, and spread much faster than accurate stories.
A false story is much more likely to go viral than a real story, the authors found. A false story reaches 1,500 people six times quicker, on average, than a true story does. And while false stories outperform the truth on every subjectincluding business, terrorism and war, science and technology, and entertainmentfake news about politics regularly does best. This is basically true of every other social network or messaging platform. And just dont blame the bots as automated response generators are known - from 2006 to 2016, Twitter bots amplified true stories as much as they amplified false ones, the study found. Fake news prospers, the authors wrote, because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it. Besides, robots have no emotions, at least for the moment.
Social media networks know they have a huge problem on their hands. After years of denial, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself admitted last year that fake news and other incendiary material on their site was a real problem that called for urgent solutions. They are now working with various Governments including Sri Lanka to identify hate posts and fake news items and remove them from the platform. It is also redesigning the news feed to filter out fake news where possible. This is an essential exercise, because democracy, pluralism and ethnic harmony will all be affected if falsehoods gain the upper hand.
While social media networks and Governments do their part, we have to do ours. Resist the urge to hit the share or like button on every Facebook post that you see, especially politically or ethnically sensitive ones. Just ask yourself  could this news be true If you know someone mentioned in a post or someone living in an area mentioned just pick up the phone and ask them. There are also fact-checking websites such as Snopes.Com which verify worldwide news and rumours. If you get to know or even think that a post could be false, stop sharing it online and tell others too.
The social media blackout is being seen as a blessing in disguise by many, who are rediscovering the good old ways of socializing. It has been shown that Facebook can actually make you depressed after seeing your friends vacation pictures etc. Here is an opportunity to just switch off, meet your friends in person, chat by conventional phone/SMS and read a normal newspaper. One is more likely to come across the actual truth in this way.

Five defiant, match-saving innings of this decade
There are numerous factors that make Test cricket special. The fact that, at times, a hard-earned draw is more credible than a victory is one of the many reasons for the greatness of the sport.
Test cricket history is full of memorable knocks by batsmen through which they saved their team from defeat and achieved a draw that was probably sweeter than even a win. Some of those great performances have come in this decade.
While most of these efforts come in the fourth innings, sometimes the situation of the game results in the third innings of the game witnessing such heroic exploits.
Here is a list of five magnificent performances from batsmen in this decade that secured a very satisfying draw for their respective teams.

Five instances when cricketers were fined for the most bizarre reasons
The game of cricket requires gentlemanly conduct from all its players. The Code of Conduct is written and enforced by the ICC (International Cricket Council), which is to be followed by all cricketers. On going against the rule, the punishment may vary from a fine, ban of few matches or even a lifetime ban.
The match referee, appointed by the ICC, holds the power to set penalties for the offences. Not just offences pertaining to cricket, there have also been instances when cricketers were fined for surprising off-field offences.
Here we take a look at 5 instances when cricketers were fined (match fee or personal) for reasons both bizarre and funny.
5 GAUTAM GAMBHIR  FOR KICKING A CHAIR
Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Gautam Gambhir was fined 15 percent of his match fee for breaching the Indian Premier League (IPL) Code of Conduct in 2016. Gambhirs offence was kicking a chair in the dugout after his side beat Royal Challengers Bangalore in a league match at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
It was widely assumed that Gambhir, who is always high on emotions on the field, kicked the chair out of the excitement of winning.
Gambhir admitted the Level 1 offence (Article 2.1.8) of abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during a match. For Level 1 breaches of the IPL Code of Conduct, the Match Referees decision is final and binding, a statement from the IPL read.
#4 MATHEW HAYDEN  FOR BREAKING A GLASS DOOR
Former Australian opening batsman Mathew Hayden was reprimanded and fined by the ICC after he smashed a glass panel in his teams dressing room. Haydens rage was a result of his LBW dismissal for just two runs in the fifth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2003.
Match referee Wasim Raja fined Hayden 20 percent of his match fee, around $2200 after the Australian was found guilty of the charges levied upon him.
At the hearing, Matthew Hayden admitted the offence and apologised for his action, Raja had said in a statement.
Like Gambhir, Hayden too was charged with a level one offence of the code of conduct, in abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings.
#3 DALE STEYN FOR SPITTING ON SULIEMAN BENN
South African pacer Dale Steyns entire match fee was fined by the ICC for spitting at West Indian all-rounder Sulieman Benn during the third Test of a three-match series in Barbados.
South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has been fined 100 percent of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during his countrys third Test match against the West Indies, the ICC said in a statement.
On being bowled by Kemar Roach in the 132nd over of South Africas first innings, an agitated Steyn spit in the direction of Benn, a charge which was brought up by on-field umpires Steve Davis and Simon Taufel, third umpire Asad Rauf and fourth official Clyde Duncan.
Dales behaviour was entirely unacceptable and he knows that, said match referee Jeff Crowe.
#2 VIRENDER SEHWAG AND HARBHAJAN SINGH  FOR ENTERING NEW ZEALAND WEARING DIRTY SHOES
Although this fine was not levied for offensive actions pertaining to the 22 yards, it still remains Indian crickets one of the most interesting stories of cricketers being fined. Spinner Harbhajan Singh and batsman Virender Sehwag were fined by New Zealand`s Ministry of Agriculture for arriving in the country with dirty shoes in 2002.
The two were fined 200 NZ dollars ($100) at the airport for their dirty footwear.
New Zealand boasts of bio-security laws which are designed to safeguard the country from several imported diseases like foot and mouth diseases among others. If the two cricketers had declared their shoes, they would have been cleaned at New Zealand taxpayers expense and handed back to them.
#1 RAVINDRA JADEJA  FOR CLICKING SELFIE WITH A LION
Indian cricketer was fined 20,000 rupees for posting photos of him and his wife posing in front of endangered Asiatic lions at the Gir National Park. Officials at the park said they imposed a fine as the cricketer flouted the rules, according to which no visitor in the park is allowed to leave their vehicles and step down.
Coincidentally, Jadeja posted those photos only a few days after Gujarat forestry officials had warned of the dangers that can be caused by taking selfies with lions. The Gir National Park, on the western side of Gujarat, is the only place where Asiatic lions remain in the wild. - SK

## Title: How Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Saturday, March 10, 2018 - 01:00
How Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile
Their rivalry was the stuff of legend.
Sir Roger Bannister, the first athlete to break the four-minute-mile barrier, died on Saturday aged 88. He is being remembered as a trailblazer who made the impossible possible and inspired generations of British people to take up sport.
But Bannisters story is inextricably linked with an Australian, John Landy, the second man to run the mile in under four minutes.
Once deemed impossible, by 1954 it appeared certain the elusive four-minute barrier would be broken. Bannister, Landy and another runner, the American Wes Santee, all appeared close to the mark.
But it was Bannister, then a medical student, who did it first when he ran 3 minutes 59.4 seconds at a sports ground in Oxford on 6 May 1954. Slightly off pace with one lap to go, he managed to run his final 400 metres in just 59 seconds.
The world seemed to stand still, or did not exist, Bannister wrote in his book The First Four Minutes. The only reality was the next 200 yards of track under my feet. The tape meant finality  extinction perhaps.
I felt at that moment that it was my chance to do one thing supremely well. I drove on, impelled by a combination of fear and pride. Though Bannister reached the mark first, the record only stood for about a month. On 21 June, Landy surpassed it with a time of 3 mins 57.9 seconds at a meet in Turku, Finland.
Bannister was helped during his record-breaking Oxford run by pace setters Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher and, while Landy has never questioned the legitimacy of the run, he has also maintained that he wanted to do it differently.
In an interview in 2004, Landy was asked whether he believed Bannisters run was illegitimate and dismissed the suggestion. First of all, youve got to think the thing was done. The four-minute mile had been run. You couldnt undo it, right. The four-minute mile had been run, however it had been run, Landy told the Sunday Telegraph.
But I have never criticised it. My attitude was that if its a bona fide run, and said to be by the authorities, thats it. And thats what happened and I have never ever, nor would I ever, doubt that it was a wonderful effort.
But he did maintain that he was determined to do things differently from Bannister.
My only point is, people say, would you have done it that way he said. The answer is no. I wanted to run the four-minute mile myself. And I never saw it as a team business. Even though I had some very good teammates who wanted to pace me, I wanted to do it myself.
That was not to do with whether it was right to pace or not. It was just simply that I saw it as an individual effort. And I was able to do that. I did have some help on the first lap and a half from a Finnish runner. I didnt ask for it. Probably the good part of that is they stopped me running too fast.
In any case, the first two sub-four minute runs coming so close together set the scene for a dramatic encounter between the two men in August of the same year at the Empire Games in Vancouver.
The race became known as the Miracle Mile, and more than 60 years later is still among the most famous in the history of modern athletics.
Landy lead for most of the race, with Bannister close behind. Then, at the final turn, Landy looked over his left shoulder to check where Bannister was and the British runner overtook the Australian on the right. Both men finished in under four minutes but Bannister was the winner.
A bronze statue of the moment Landy glanced around now stands outside the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, and Landy once joked that while Lots wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back: I am probably the only one ever turned into bronze for looking back. In an interview in 2004 Bannister said he considered winning that race  not the Oxford run  the highlight of his career.
I think that racing in the Olympics and Commonwealths is more important than breaking records, Bannister said.
Vancouver was the pinnacle of my athletics career. It is very difficult to break records during Olympic competition, but winning races was better than holding world records.
Landy, now 87, worked for ICI Australia and at the age of 70 became governor of Victoria. At the opening of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, in his final term as governor, he passed the ceremonial Queens baton to the Queen. - theguardian

Labour TU calls to provide maternity benefits equally
The National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC) Trade Union yesterday urged the government to rectify the discrepancy between the government and private sector on maternity benefits for female employees.
NLAC Trade Union Co-Chairman Anton Marcus, addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, said the discrepancy occurs both ways. He said that several maternity benefits enjoyed by public sector female employees are not entitled to private sector female workers.
Although female employees in the public sector are entitled to maternity leave of 84 days, excluding weekends and public holidays, private sector female workers are entitled only to 84 days, including weekends and public holidays.
This is unfair. The two Acts; the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and Shop and Office Employees Act, which are applicable to woman employees in the private sector, grant 84 days of maternity leave for only the first and second child births while granting only 42 days of maternity leave for the 3rd child birth or subsequent child births, he said.
Furthermore, under the Maternity Benefits Act, a woman worker in the estate sector gets only three fourths of the maternity benefits whereas woman workers in other sectors receive full benefits.
He said only women workers covered by the Maternity Benefits Ordinance are entitled to feeding intervals. Women workers covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act are not entitled to feeding intervals.
Under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, employers should allow women workers feeding intervals of two hours.
He added that the ILO had stipulated that there should be no anomalies or discrepancy in granting maternity benefits.

139th Battle of the Blues :
Manula Perera (5/43) has Thomians in a spin
A brilliant spell of left-arm spin bowling by Manula Perera of Royal College who took five wickets for 43 runs saw S. Thomas College collapse for 166 on the opening day of the three-day 139th Battle of the Blues cricket encounter played at the SSC grounds yesterday.
By the close however the Thomians had somewhat redressed the balance to a certain extent by capturing three Royal wickets for 33 runs with left-arm pacie Kalana Perera claiming all of them for 16 runs.
Royal trail the Thomians by 133 runs with seven first innings wickets in hand and the game is interestingly poised going into the second day today.
Sixteen-year-old off-spinner Kamil Mishara made the first breakthrough for Royal at 27 when he dismissed Thomian left handed opener Dulith Gunaratne caught at covers by Bhagya Dissanayake for a patient 16 runs.
When the total read 38 Manula Perera caught and bowled the dangerous looking left hander Shalin De Mel for 15. S. Thomas went into lunch at 52 for 2.
After lunch Manula spun a web around the Thomian batting claiming the wickets of Kishan Munasinghe lbw for 13 and captain Dellon Peiris caught by Kavindhu Pathiratne for 12. Wicket Keeper Sithara Hapuhinna joined by left hander Manthila Wijeratne with the side struggling at 69 for 4 did a repair job by putting together a stand of 46 to frustrate the Royal bowlers. Sithara made a superb knock of 34 off 51 balls that included four boundaries and with Manthila took the Thomian total to some respectability.
Later when the score was on 115, Sri Lanka under15 right arm fast bowler cum Royal opening bowler Kavindu Pathiratne who bowled with sheer speed touching nearly140/kmph, made the crucial breakthrough when he broke a threatening fifth wicket partnership by getting inform left hander Sithara caught by Gayan Dissanayake off a rising delivery. Soon after another set batsmen Manthila was out bowled by a beauty from left armer Manula for a well made 24 runs inclusive of four fours.
Manula capped a fine match by claiming his fifth wicket when all-rounder Kalana Perera was brilliantly caught at covers by Themal Bandara for 13 reducing the Thomians to 149 for seven.
S. Thomas slumped further to 166 for 9 when right hander Maneesha Rupasinghe was superbly snapped up by skipper Sooriyabanda at first slip of left arm spinner Themal Bandara for 13 and Thevin Eriyagama was run out by Gayan Dissanayake for 5. At this point the Thomians made a surprise declaration closing their innings at 166 for the loss of 9 wickets.
In reply to the S.Thomas score, Royal coming to bat soon were in trouble at two wickets down for 8 runs with openers right hander Bhagya Dissanayake (who played for S. Thomas last year) falling lbw and his partner left hander Gayan Dissanayake brilliantly caught by a diving Shalin de Mel at deep point. Both wickets were snapped up by Sri Lanka under 19 left arm fast bowler Kalana Perera.
Royal fell further into deep trouble when they lost inform left hander Kamil Mishara caught at silly point by vice captain Dulith Gunaratne for 8 going for an ambitious hook shot against Perera.
Royal College vice-captain cum left handed wicket keeper batsmen Kavindu Madarasinghe, who came at the fall of the first wicket; took the responsibility on to his shoulders and put his head down and batted sensibly when wickets were falling around him to be unbeaten on 13 together with his skipper Sooriyabandara on 4 not out at the close.

Media make winners of elections: Amaraweera
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarawera said that they have to dance to the tune of the print and electronic media to win an election.
The Minister said that the print and electronic media enjoyed the most the results of the Local Government elections.
He said that many voted the Pohottuwa party thinking that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would become the Prime Minister. It became a dream, he said.
The present government fulfilled aspirations and expectations of the people, but they were unable to explain what they have achieved for the people at their propaganda rallies.
He said that if they are to win elections in future, they will have to open their own print and electronic media institutions or give media personnel several high ranking posts in the government.
The Minister said the social media and the print and electronic media gave wide publicity to the shortcomings of their regime and never highlighted what they did for the people during the past three years.
He said the country regained the international reputation that was lost during the previous regime.
He said the government regained the GSP plus and succeeded in removing the ban on fish exports.

Milkfish hatchery in Kusala for Rs. 130 m
The National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) had taken measures to establish a milkfish hatchery in Kusala in Bangadeniya at a cost of Rs. 130 million. The construction work will be launched on March 10, under the patronage of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Minister Amaraweera said the Ministry had also initiated a project to raise milkfish (Chanos Chanos) known in Sinhala as Wekkaya as an alternative for fish imported from China to use as bait for longline fishing vessels. According to the Minister, the decision to raise milkfish had been taken as a solution to the price increase of the cuttlefish variety imported from China to be used as bait.

At Local Government polls:
MRs performance sparked new wave of racial violence- Bimal
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas success at the Local Government Elections gave the physical power to the new wave of racial violence in the country, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake charged.
When Parliament took up the Regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act, the MP digressed from the topic to speak on the prevailing communal tensions in the country.
He said it was no coincidence that a wave of anti-Muslim sentiments erupted in the country on the Halal issue just after the 2010 Presidential Election results and the same occurred after the recently concluded Local Government elections.
The vote base of former President Rajapaksa is constituted of hard-core racists, religious extremists and those with a deep-seated war mentality. This is the absolute truth. If not, why did the so called heroes of Sinhala Buddhists not show the concern they had on sterilization pill when a temple in the East which was about to be declared an archaeological site was bulldozed he questioned.
He pointed out the racial extremist groups mushroomed in the country after 2010 with the blessings of the then rulers and an anti-Muslim sentiment was created since 2011.
There is a Muslim extremist faction also that aids this mission. However, Muslim community itself suffers due to Muslim extremism than the other communities, he observed.
He pointed out the fear psychosis created among the Sinhalese on the dangers of country getting divided and the shrinking Sinhala population was a result of continuously feeding such terror into the minds of people over the past five years. Those who make such allegations have got no concrete evidence for their claims, MP Rathnayake added.
He pointed out no youth in Ambala, the village where an individual succumbed to injuries after being a victim of assault, has been arrested for involving in any violent act that ensued. The violent acts happened in Digana which is 20 Kilometres away from Ambala. Racism was fed into the peoples heads. I request the Government to expose the naked truth of racism. The Facebook page titled UPFA for a brighter future posted pictures taken in Tamil Nadu misleading the people as if those were taken in the North. I ask the Government to act against such groups. I also appeal to the Muslim leaders to stand up against Muslim extremism, he noted.

Normalcy returns to Kandy
Public life in Kandy which had been disrupted over the past couple of days due to ethnic tensions is now returning to normalcy.
Businesses which had been shut for the last three days, opened yesterday, after Police curfew was lifted at 6.00am yesterday and transportation services were also seen to be getting back to normal.
Government offices too opened their doors after being shut for the last three days. Only a few Muslim business places however were seen open and security was beefed up around the district with around 6000 Police, STF, Army, Air Force and Naval officers on the ground.
The Police reported that they had arrested 23 persons including a student from the University of Peradeniya from the areas of Peradeniya, Digana and Ambakotte for breaching the curfew.
The Kandy District has been fully secured and I can certify that, Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake said.
He added that the Army together with the Tri Forces and Police are capable of handling any situation.
The Commander expressed his views at a discussion held between Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil Traders Association in Kandy on Thursday (8).
Lt. General Senanayake further said that the people in the Kandy district were getting back to restoring normalcy to their lives and that the Army was committed to helping them in anyway necessary to rebuild their lives.
He observed that these acts committed by a small group of people had brought great disrepute to the country internationally and it would be very hard to erase this blackmark on the countrys image. We have uncovered many details about these organized groups which committed such acts and having arrested the main suspect who instigated all these people over social media, it is going to be easy to arrest the rest, the Army Commander said.
Kandy District Secretariat H.M.P. Hitisekara in the meantime said a team of 24 officers from the Government Valuation Department have arrived in Kandy to assess the total value of all the damages incurred.
The District Secretariat said he had discussed matters with the Divisional Secretariats, Grama Niladharis, government officers and religious leaders on steps which need to be taken to avoid a repetition of such incidents in future.

Poor attendance at Oversight Committees - Speaker
Navy to polish up new building handed over by Cabinet:
Ninety MPs have not attended a single meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committees introduced in December 2015.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday that 40 percent of the members had not taken part in at least a single Oversight Committee meeting. He made this observation when JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa questioned as to why the building which previously housed the Agricultural Ministry is not being used to hold the Oversight Committee meetings.
Parliament took over the building stating that the space is not enough in the Parliamentary Complex to hold those meetings.As a result the Agricultural Ministry has been paying a monthly lease of Rs 24.7 million for a new building for the last 16 months.The Prime Minister presented the cabinet paper to take over the building as an urgent matter. However, oversight committee meetings are still conducted at the Parliamentary complex, the MP complained. The Speaker pointed out that the new building was not asked for by Parliament but was given to it by Cabinet. It took one a half years to hand it over to us and we received its ownership last month only.The Navy is now in the process of repairing it to make it suitable to hold meetings. We can manage to find space somehow, but what matters the most is the attendance of all, the Speaker responded.
The Speaker also said no new furniture would be purchased for the new building, but would manage with the existing furniture in an effort to save the public money.
The Speaker also told the House that the Consultative Committees would also come into operation from April in addition to the Oversight Committees. He made this observation in reply to JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena who demanded to establish those committees as soon as possible.
The Speaker further pointed out that he would make the President and Prime Minister aware that the revised set of Standing Orders of Parliament has made it compulsory for the Ministers to be present in House to reply to oral questions.The Speaker made those comments in reply to the complaints of MPs that their questions were not answered.
Foreign investments have not declined - Minister
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama refuted claims that foreign investments to the country declined over the past three years.Responding to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, the minister said even though the Joint Venture Project of the Hambantota port, from which US$ 292 million FDIs was received was excluded, the country has received Rs 1.7 billion foreign direct investment to the country.
According to the answer tabled by the minister in Parliament, the country has received USD 969.7 million FDIs in 2015, USD 801 million FDIs in 2016 and USD 1,710.3 million FDIs in 2017.
MP Gunawardena questioned from the minister as to whether he admits that the FDIs have rapidly declined and that the Government failed to achieve the stipulated targets on FDIs. Minister Samarawickrama dismissed the claim saying it was not true.
President informs of Emergency proclamation
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday read out a written message received from President Maithripala Sirisena informing Parliament on the proclamation of a State of Emergency throughout the country from March 6.
The President in the message said the proclamation was made under the Section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance. He informed Parliament that the reason to declare a public emergency was to ensure public security, the protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.
The President sent the message in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution.
Government should name hate mongers - Mujibur Rahuman
The government should reveal the names of those who are instigating racial discord in a straightforward manner otherwise the blame falls on the entire government, said UNP MP Mujibur Rahuman in participating in the parliamentary debate yesterday.
It is very clear that these racial clashes were instigated based on certain political agendas. However, the question arises as to what we have done as a government over the past 2  years to stop these racial tensions. During the previous regime, it is a well-known fact that the BBS was taking the law into their own hands due to the backing they had from the former Defence Secretary.
At the time we said that the Rajapaksa regime rendered their support in firing racial disharmony. We came to power on the promise that we would be fair to all racial denominations. However, over the 2  years since coming into power, as a government we should ask ourselves what we have done to defeat racism and prevent such racial tensions. In fact we should be ashamed that we have not made any effort to stop such racial attacks. I have personally brought this issue before the President, Prime Minister, Law and Order Minister and also have made complaints to the police on more than four occasions.
Yet nothing was done to address this issue. I am ashamed to even be part of this government, he said adding that he feels that today he is speaking standing in front of a mirror.
Rahuman said that he has appealed to many parties on many occasions to prevent another clash happening in this country. We have experienced 30 years of bitter war. There are parties trying to ignite racial disharmony and clashes. They have a political agenda to destabilise the country and topple the government. That is clear, but my issue is as a government why are we not doing anything to stop them Why are we not taking action to prevent such situations We failed to stop it and eventually this bomb of racial tensions exploded in Kandy.
He noted that Sri Lanka has a very competent intelligence unit that could find out where Pottu Amman and Prabhakaran was, Yet our intelligence units were not able to spot the actions of Amith Weerasinghe over the past 2  years. Was our intelligence units incapable or did the government not have the desire to prevent it
He said all should refrain from standing on the fence in this instance and speak openly and directly. If anyone is guilty of instigating racial tensions, then they should be dealt with irrespective of whether they are Muslims or Sinhalese.
Responding to MP Bimal Ratnayake, he said people talk about Muslim women covering their faces, but added that people should also be concerned and critical of women over exposing themselves. He said every woman has the right to wear what she pleases and if society accepts that a woman has the right to expose herself, then why should a woman not have the right to cover herself
Thambuttegama farmers attacked by men in civil - Semasinghe
Joint Opposition MP Shehan Semasinghe demanded to know who was behind the organised attack on the Thambuttegama farmers who agitated for their water in the Rajanganaya tank.
He said this moving an adjournment motion in parliament yesterday.
The farmers got onto the streets because their pleas were not taken notice of by the government. It started as a peaceful protest, but we want to know who started attacking protesters in civilian clothing. No one was against providing drinking water, but the farmers were demanding that they also be given adequate water for their cultivation. Recently, a similar project was initiated at the Thuruwila wewa and at the time they signed an MoU with the farmer associations and they provided facilities to provide the people with drinking water while ensuring adequate water for farming.
Yet in this instance, in Thambuttegama, not a single representative of the government volunteered to speak on behalf of these farmers.
They sent state officers to do their work. But the response expected from the government cannot be got from a state officer. Ironically, when the government ministers were hiding in fear, the Divisional Secretary took the initiative to intervene and find a solution to the farmers issue.
He said this may have been an isolated incident but he urged the government to ensure that such incidents do not recur.

Take on Bangladesh today :
Playing it smart is Sri Lankas name of the game
The best person to ask how a new coach is fairing with his protgs is those who work with him. In that aspect Rumesh Ratnayake, the former Sri Lanka fast bowler and presently the fast bowling coach to the national cricket team threw some light on how head coach Chandika Hathurusingha has been gradually changing the mindset of our cricketers in order to give them the confidence to go out and win matches for the country.
Since Hathurusingha took charge of the Sri Lanka team they have been on a roll beating Bangladesh in their own conditions at home across all three formats and starting the ongoing Hero Nidahas T20 tri-series with an emphatic win over India  their tormentors for the past six months.
As I always say talent was aplenty in our team, its just that the mindset of the boys. I think coach Hathuru has come in and taken maximum part in that. He has changed their mindset by letting them do the things on their own, said Ratnayake ahead of Sri Lankas second match of the tournament against Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Its all about smart options, he lets people take smart options, and even if you fail he will say well, that was good enough lets try again next time. For an example, you tell a boy to go and play some shots but if he gets out you cant ask him why did you play that shot So hes a man of his word. We have given the players that confidence and if it has shown in the boys thats good but consistency is what were looking for in the future, he said.
To a great extent the players are playing with confidence now, but at the same time its important that we continue to play smart cricket. What is smart cricket Its about adapting to in-game situations quickly. What Hathuru has done since he came in is he has given the players the freedom to make those decisions, he added.
Ratnayake said the main preparation is to get the right combination for next years cricket World Cup in England and every match that Sri Lanka plays is directed towards that while at the same time they look for consistency.
We have seen a change in the team and were taking each game as it comes. Our ambition is to get the team ready for the World Cup, and that is was what we are working towards, said Ratnayake.
Its not about being ruthless its about playing a smarter game and playing to the best of our abilities. I think people were very fortunate to see some good parts of the game won against India in the last match. Its not about winning one part it was many parts, and your chances are enhanced by making those parts bigger and bigger.
Ratnayake said that he expects Bangladesh to come back after their loss to India on Thursday as they are a strong side. They are a team that has beaten all teams in Bangladesh. They beat us in Sri Lanka. So theyre a strong team that has several guys with potential to do extremely well. You see them as struggling because we have gone and performed well there. Maybe theyre going through a little bit of a rough patch, but we take every match seriously. Im sure they would want to go and show us that theyre something different. But were well prepared and were ready for it.
Sri Lanka has not taken a final decision on their team yet, but Ratnayake said there is room for some changes depending on the conditions and what combination will suit the wicket.

The opening ceremony of the Tissue Culture Lab established in Rambodagalla, Kurunegala to propagate aquatic plants will be held today.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said
the Tissue Culture lab was established to promote aquatic plant breeding in the country and also to increase foreign exchange earnings from the export of aquatic plants.
The country was able to earn Rs 5.6 million through the export of 52 metric tonnes of aquatic plants in 2017.
Following a research recently conducted on aquatic plants, a group of Japanese scientists has recommended that the Southern, Eastern, North Western and North Eastern coastal belts are suitable for aquatic plant breeding. The use of tissue culture technology in propagation of aquatic plants will result in the prevention of indiscriminate harvesting of endangered and indigenous flora from the wild.

Religious leaders denounce violence
The Congress of Religions comprising leaders from the Buddhist, Christian, Islamic and Hindu faiths while denouncing in the strongest terms, all those who resort to intimidation, thuggery and violence, urged the government to take prompt action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The religious leaders in one voice urged the government to enforce the law in a manner that safeguards the security and dignity of each and every citizen of the country without discrimination. Speaking at a press conference at the Mahabodhi Society in Colombo, they reiterated that victims of communal riots in several parts of the Kandy district and elsewhere should be given compensation. The Mahanayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dhamma Sabhawa, Most Ven.Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera made an appeal to each and every citizen to exercise restraint and maintain peace.
He said that almost all citizens of the country do not want to see bloodshed and divisions in the country on sectarian grounds.
All we need to do is to look for all possible ways to lead a happy and peaceful life with religious diversity as its strength, the Thera said.
Speaking on the occasion, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith called for religious unity in the face of violence.
We have been together for centuries: Sinhalese, Muslims, Hindus, and Christians, he said. We have battled out several battles together, including the Independence struggle. We must continue to preserve that unity.
We have to be united in our diversity, especially concerning our religious identity, he said. Referencing the recent mob attacks against Muslims in communities surrounding Kandy, Cardinal Ranjith said religion can never justify violence, as the Buddha himself said, and even our own religious founder, Jesus Christ.
In fact Islam, the word Islam means, for peace, he added. So we are for peace, all of us are for peace.
Sivasiri Vaidheeshwara Kurukkal said that it is vital to find the core issues to communal unrest and rectify them in order to lead a peaceful life.
He noted that Sri Lanka was able to maintain a good image among international communities after the war and took several measures to restore peace and harmony but incidents like these are destabilizing the reconciliation process of the country.
Former Diplomat Javid Yusuf said that co-existence is not a new thing for Sri Lankans. We have lived together in peace all these years.
There is no problem between the neighbours or villagers. Creating a communal issue was a motive of a group of individuals and unfortunately they were very successful in implementing their plan. Sri Lankans irrespective of their religions live a peaceful life. There was humanity even in diversity. We should react as Sri Lankans and not based on our religions, he said.

Sinister forces conspiring for bloodshed to regain power - Ranawaka
The decisive factor of the Presidential Election in 2019 wold be the main parties in the government and not those who conspire bloodshed in communal clashes to gain petty political mileage, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister and Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said the Rajapaksas have initiated an attack on political parties in the government since they have realised that their popularity has reduced than ever before as they have gained only 39% of votes during the last local government election. Hence their dream of the 2019 Presidential election is only a dream, Minister Ranawaka said.So they need bloodshed at this moment to win over the majority of Sinhalese.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the JHU political head office Battaramulla.He said the culprits of incidents that took place recently should be arrested.He also said that cyber terrorism should also be treated severely. The Diyatalawa bus explosion has been proved to be an irresponsible act of a member of the Forces,. But Rajapaksa supporters and some media attempted to say it was an LTTE rejuvenation, solely to tarnish the government.So they should be dealt by the law.
He added that the second incident was the Ampara incident which has been proved by the Government Analyst that it was a lump of flour. Now it should be investigated as to who was involved in those clashes and who sought bail for the those arrested, Minister Ranawaka said. Some attempt to say that the JHU had an involvement in the Maha Sohon Balakaya. But it should be investigated. I have written to the IGP to find it out, he said. He also said that the people need to know as to what extremist groups were fostered with funds of forces secretly by the defence secretary during the previous government.He added that the most serious case was reported from Kandy and the culprits should brought to the book and punished.
Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and Passaramulle Dayawansa also participated at the press conference.

He said false and malicious content was being spread through social media as anything can be said or spread through social media.
Trolls and bots manipulate social media sites to spread false and inflammatory news in an apparent effort to stoke political and ethnic divisions on a large scale.
Hence, it is difficult to control social media as news is spread so fast he added.
Therefore, we were compelled to temporarily block social media to stop the spread of this type malicious and inflammatory news. Now the situation is settling, he said.
Minister de Silva said it is vital to ascertain who these extremist groups are and an independent Presidential Commission should be appointed to investigate this incident. The Commission needs to investigate and determine how these extremist groups that fuelled this incident operate. Information released on social media should be done in a responsible manner.
He said extremists from both the Sinhala and Muslim factions should be identified and punished alike.
We need to determine who is pouring patrol on the flames of racism. We are definitely not prepared to allow racist elements to once again bring doom to the country as we witnessed for 30 years.
Therefore, he said it was vital to establish a special commission to conduct a comprehensive investigations to determine these sinister elements who are engaged in spreading racial tensions. They need to be punished irrespective of whether they are Sinhalese or Muslims. Facebook and other social media sites were temporarily blocked for 72 hours to prevent the youth from being instigated and directed towards violent reactions.
However, State Minister de Silva noted that now that the situation has been brought under control.This blockade would be lifted by Saturday.

United States initiates trade war
President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent hike in taxes on steel imports and a 10 percent hike in tax on Aluminium imports to the United States. This could trigger a trade war among major trading nations of the world.
The United States is the worlds largest steel importer. The European Union which is the biggest steel exporter to the United States is worst affected by the US decision. It vowed to retaliate. It is likely to petition the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevdo has said that the US action could cause a worldwide recession.
Among other countries affected are China, Russia, Canada and South Korea. The latter has already announced its intention to complain to the WTO. The US earlier announced increased tariffs on import of washing machines, solar panels and arrange of intermediate goods. Korea is worried that a trade war between the United States and China to which it exports over 60 percent of its steel, auto-parts and intermediate goods could affect it adversely.
Meanwhile the United Sates energy industry which relies heavily on imported steel has opposed President Trumps decision to increase steel import tariffs since it would affect it by increasing prices of its products.
This decision could also increase the United States isolation in many fields. Earlier it withdrew from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Now 11 nations in America and the Pacific have signed a Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) without the United States. These countries include Canada, Japan, Mexico and Chile among others. They agreed to reduce tariffs by 10 percent.
Inter-Korean relations warm up
In contrast to the highly tense relations between the two Koreas during the time of the expedited development of North Korean nuclear weapons and missile programme, relations between them become warmer since North Koreas participation in the winter Olympics and subsequent exchanges of visits by high level delegations.
The latest visit was that by South Korean National Security Council Chief Chun Eui-yong and National Intelligence Service Chief Suh Hoon to Pyongyang early this week. The delegation was very warmly received and President Kim Jong-Un himself received it within hours of their arrival there.
During the discussions North Korea is supposed to have expressed its agreement to halt its nuclear weapon development programme in exchange for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Official North Korean News Agency reported that It is the consistent principled position of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) to resolve issues in a diplomatic and peaceful way through dialogue and negotiation.
It is also reported that North Korea has agreed to release three US citizens detained there if the planned US-South Korean military drills this month are to be postponed or not held on a grander scale than earlier.
President Moon Jae-in of South Korea is expected to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in the border village of Panmunjam, South Korea at the end of April.
The two South Korean Security and Intelligence Chiefs flew to Washington to brief US National Security Advisor H R McMaster and other officials to brief them on their Northern visit. They are expected to deliver a special message from the DPRK to the United States.
However, the signals from Washington remain mixed. While President Trump has not gone back on his vow to use all options including war, he has also said that he is ready to meet the North Korean Leader. In the meantime the US has imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea.
China has welcomed the thaw in inter-Korean relations and stressed that North Koreas security interests should be addressed in exchange for denuclearization.
A 500-strong cheer group from the North is expected to attend the Winter Olympics in South Korea in addition to 47 athletes. North Korea has also invited a taekwondo team for a demonstration and artistes for a musical show in Pyongyang.
Italian elections show shift to far Right
Parliamentary elections in Italy held on March 4 have produced no outright winner. No single party or an alliance has secured a majority in the 630 member Lower House of Parliament. The 5 Star Movement which has won 222-4 seats obtaining 32 percent of the vote is the largest party in Parliament. The coalition led by the far right The League has won 267 seats obtaining 37 percent of the votes. The Democratic Party (PD) has won only 123-5 seats.
As in France the traditional parties have lost and new emerging parties have come to the forefront. It is clear that anti-immigrant, anti-Establishment and anti-European Union sentiments have risen among the voters. The Brexit vote in the United Kingdom also showed a similar trend which did not augur well for the future of the European Union. Italian voters have also expressed their dislike to the European single currency.
It is not clear whether parties and coalitions would be able to form a government, though various coalition options are available. In case they fail to agree on a government the President will have to call for fresh elections. In post-Second World War history Italy has almost never had a government which lasted its full term of office.

Today no patient dies in Sri Lanka without being able to obtain a stent and no one became blind unable to obtain an eye lens, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the National Conference on Recent Health Development Initiatives held at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday he said that before offering heart stents free, only 50 or 60 heart surgeries were done monthly at the Colombo Cardiology Unit but now these numbers have increased up to 450 to 500.

When civilized politics give in to racial bigotry
To ignore evil is to become an accomplice to it
- Martin Luther King Jr.
As fanatic communal flames burnt alive the humanity, reason, and sanity in a series of violent incidents in Ampara and Kandy, lawmakers of both the Government and Opposition closed ranks in Parliament to condemn and mourn, but all in all it was too little, too late.
Teldeniya and Digana in the central hills were on fire as Parliament commenced its bi-weekly session on Tuesday and most regrettably the situation had gotten out of hand as acts of violence spread fast even before the dust settled on the incident in Ampara, where racists took the gullible for a ride.
Parliament put off its previously scheduled days agenda to take up a full-day adjournment debate on the current situation in the country, where members of both the sides grieved with those who grieved while urging the law enforcement authorities to pull up their socks and tackle the situation head on.
Quelling the madness
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was also the Law and Order Minister briefly before the mantle was passed on to another, announced in Parliament the decision to declare a week-long State of Emergency in the country for the first time since the end of terrorism.
Equipped with first-hand information from trusted sources and intelligence units, the Premier broke his silence on the incidents in Ampara and Teldeniya, laying bare the fact that well-organised gangs were behind the series of violent acts that ensued. Those could not be underplayed as happened out of sudden anger. While the Buddhist monks and Muslim clergy in the area tried to resolve the issues, groups that came from outside created chaos, the PM stressed.
Without trying to make light of the situation, he pledged to implement the law against those who triggered violence and to investigate any shortcoming on the part of Police in maintaining law and order.
We see that certain power hungry groups are all out to disrupt the public life through conspiracies and acts of sabotage. Racism is their only resort. I appeal to the public not to fall prey to those who try to fulfil their petty gains by inciting racism, but to act patiently and rationally, he urged.
The PM was seen worried about the negative impression the rest of the world would harbour on Sri Lanka upon seeing the false and racist propaganda in the social media. This type of madness that drives the potential investors away was no doubt the last thing he wanted to see being saddled with a debt-ridden economy.
End impunity
Ethnic and religious extremism has been a serious and insidious problem that hampered the countrys chances of any economic and social revival since the end of 30 years protracted war, let alone the hopes of national unity and reconciliation. Politicians, may they be in the Government or Opposition, cannot get away from the blame of ignoring the elephant in the room for so long.
From Aluthgama and Beruwala in June 2014, Gintota in November last year to Ampara and Kandy last month, the ruling parties, present and past, failed to take any tangible action against the leaders of the organised mobs which triggered violence.
Not long ago, it was openly accused that those groups mushroomed and functioned with the connivance of the previous regime. The people, not only those belonging to minority communities but also the right-minded majority in the majority community, wanted to see an end to the impunity enjoyed by those marauding gangs, when they came out in large numbers to vote for a change on January 8, 2015.
Expressing similar sentiments as above, JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, in their convincing speeches that reverberated in the House, came down hard on the Government for backtracking on this undertaking as it did with many other important tasks it was entrusted with. They directly spoke to the consciences of the Joint Opposition and the Government, the former for vociferously fanning communalism and the latter for going soft on extremist elements.
Debate saw no SLFP involvement
The JVP Leader in a fiery speech, pleaded not to use racism as a political football, adding that rousing suspicion, mistrust, hatred and anger among different communities would only lead to a divided country where the innocent ordinary people would fall victims. He lamented that the recent trend of racial tensions was indicative that the civilized politics which revolved around building national unity suffered defeat at the hands of tribal, fanatic, racist and ignorant politics of the bankrupt political elements.
Lakshman Kiriella, a senior UNP Minister from Kandy electorate, noted with heavy heart that the Sinhala Buddhists should be ashamed of and apologize for their violent behaviour. He found fault with the intelligence units for failing to alert the political authority sufficiently on the impending danger.
The absence of any speaker from the SLFP side of the Government was felt during the debate, and this was despite that several SLFP stalwarts were present in the House earlier on the day. It was not clear as to whether they deliberately sidestepped the debate due to some reason best known to them.
The violence aimed at Muslim community put the UNP and other Muslim parties allied to it in a very inconvenient position. The feeling of the minority communities that they were not safe even when the UNP was in power did not politically bode well to the Grand-Old Party with multi-ethnic vote base. It was in this backdrop, a group of Muslim MPs representing the Government sat on the floor in the well of Parliament, while the debate was on, urging the Government to provide adequate protection for their community.
About 11 Parliamentarians including Minister Rishad Bathiudeen flocked near the Mace registering their disappointment on the Government, as their colleague Minister Faiszer Musthapha took the floor. They went back to their seats after the assurance of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that the Government was taking all possible measures to protect the people.
PM outsmarts JOs delaying tactics
The Government, while battling the wave of communal tensions in the country, also had to put in considerable time and effort to ensure the safe passage of the bill for protection against enforced disappearances in the House, in keeping with the international obligations it has undertaken.
The piece of legislation had already been deferred twice in Parliament and the Government did not want to see it getting postponed again due to antics of the JO. Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, moving the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill for debate, proposed to amend the Clause on extradition in the Bill for clarity that it does not apply to Sri Lankan citizens. The minister proposed the amendment to dispel the doubts expressed by the JO that the legislation allows foreign states to try Sri Lankans in foreign courts of law.
Being a former Attorney General, Marapana could rebut the claims of the JO on the content of the bill in a more convincing manner. Nothing in the bill is retrospective and its content applies only to the offences committed in the future. Under this legislation, a person guilty of the offence of enforced disappearance can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 20 years, and be liable to pay a fine not exceeding Rs 1 million and compensation not less than Rs 500,000 to a victim, he explained.
The JO, which was all-out to prevent the Government from passing the legislation, was full of sound and fury over trivial matters and the Government had to take extra pain to confront their pressure. In a last-ditch attempt to sabotage Governments work, JO MPs agitated stating that they have not received a copy of the proposed amendment for their perusal and therefore demanded to postpone the passage of the bill to another date.
Outsmarting the JOs tactics at this point, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the House that the Government withdraws the said amendment and puts the bill for vote without amendments. Minister Marapana also observed that the amendment was proposed as per the JOs request and if it does not want it the Government would go ahead without it.
Accordingly, the bill was passed with a majority of 37 votes, obtaining 53 votes in favour and 16 votes against following a division called by JO firebrand Dinesh Gunawardena. The JO members voted against while the JVP members walked out. A total of 156 members were absent.
The main intention of the bill was to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction.
