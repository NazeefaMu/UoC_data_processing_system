All hail the new generation warrior
Sri Lanka will wake this April Saturday with a new sense of rugby perspective..depending on loyalty and ability to understand the fundamental factors ...life is about to step up beyond predictable and conventional.
For those who hesitate...its tough to imagine, but we will try to be as understanding as is legally permissive.
At home its all on Josephs to confront Royal and find a way to brush away their rapidly increasing self belief, and finishing power.
Coach Lewke, quietly nursing his confidence in forward power and solid finishing.
The Reid Avenue force has not been challenged so far this season, and managed to stamp their class, all over the Singer league.
Josephs on the other side of this coin have been growing in performance and look likely contenders for the title.
Friday promises a lung buster....with the alphabet of rugby experience, from start to finish.
Armchair experts within our island shores, will be hard pushed to dangle any scoreline predictions for the two halves
For what its worth, and as a genuine rugby fan ...I think the 1st half will be under 30 points, with both teams itching for a big platform finale in the 2nd half.
Naturally that finish is all on how hard the battle upfront, and how much the Maradana marauders can absorb.
Assuming they front up for 75% of the gameRoyal will bite that bullet and use the last quarter...to maximum gain.
I believe its all down to those vital stats and unforced errors in the dying 15minutes that will decide the billing.
Patana v Peters on Saturday is also at Havies, not under lights, unfortunately...but will set the park stadium alight with furious pace, relentless tackling and an unforgiving attitude, that will grab the oxygen gills Max.
Coach Martis is conscientious about breaking the opposition, before you beat them.
In addition Peters have an uncanny knack of pleasing on these top billboard matchups.
But missing out on home advantage for the Bamba brigade might be a telling factor with the green machine just getting into their stride.... Costas confidence bound to tested to the hilt and a real litmus test of how either side will shape up as real title contenders.
Wonder if there is a means test to gauge the level of nervous energy with both sets of old boys committees
Hope all that pressure is handled...and none imposed on the dressing room pre match protocol
All told ...a fascinating start April weekend to warm the parts and keep us rugby hearts, utterly hooked!
In Australia, the Gold Coast all dressed up to host the 21st Commonwealth Games starting this weekend...4 to 15.
Sri islanders play 7s this weekend...opening our international quest in Australia vs Olympic champions Fiji.
I can only imagine the pressure keg tournament that defending Games champions South Africa will be hard pressed to protect that title.
Fiji England, New Zealand, Wales, Scotland, Canada and hosts Australia shaping up as holier than most, for the hallowed title.
My goodness, my boots what an energy-efficient 7s line up ...its beyond mouth watering and promises those with strong constitutions...pure voltage through their calm brains.
Sri Lanka 7s play Fiji, Wales and Uganda in the league starter ...can Muthuthanthri add magic to these games with Danushka Ranjan, Sooriyabandara, Ratwatte, Ritchie ...build our response and come home with more than the shield....
All told, not an unreasonable or unrealistic expectation, given the quality of this young warriors unit...My mind racing ...years of travelling around the known green earth, playing 7s for my country...around 14 in total, give me an extra sense of belonging and more pain just considering the task and the pressure.
Blessings to our islanders and may the ocean force be with them.Bula Bula Sri Lanka at the Commonwealth Games 7s.
Pride, respect and belief...always!

Bollywood star Salman Khan jailed for killing rare antelopes

The Bollywood superstarSalman Khanhas been jailed for five years for poaching a protected species of Indian antelope.
A court in Rajasthan state on Thursday found Khan, one of the worlds best-paid actors, guilty of illegally hunting the two blackbucks from his car window while filming in Jodhpur in 1998.
Public prosecutors alleged that Khan, 52, and four other actors in the car with him fled the scene when they were spotted, leaving the animals carcasses behind.
The other actors, among them Saif Ali Khan and Sonali Bendre, were acquitted by the court in Jodhpur for lack of evidence.
Indias wildlife protection act bans the hunting of all but a handful of wild animals without a special permit.
As well as the five-year sentence the court also fined Khan 10,000 rupees (109). His lawyers say they will appeal the conviction and apply for bail as soon as possible. Khan will be taken to Jodhpurs central jail after visiting a local hospital for a medical examination.
Hundreds of police surrounded the courtroom in Jodhpur to keep back fans of the actor, who is known for his bad-boy image and macho film roles.
Khan has long maintained that he was framed by forest officials in the case.
At the time of the poaching, blackbucks were regarded as a vulnerable animal, but havesince been reclassifiedas a species of least concern, though they remain protected by Indian wildlife regulations.
Khan has a history of brushes with the law. In 2015, he wasacquitted of killinga homeless man in a hit-and-run incident in 2002, a decision now being challenged in the Supreme Court.
His former girlfriend, the actor Aishwarya Rai, accused Khan of verbal and physical abuse in a 2002 interview  allegations Khan has denied.
Khan was first arrested in the poaching case in October 1998 after reports emerged that he had hunted the two antelopes and at least three other gazelles.
Eight years later, he was convicted of killing the blackbucks and sentenced to five years in prison, a decision he appealed to the Rajasthan high court, which suspended the sentence in August 2007 after the actor had spent two short stints in jail.
The charges were revised and laid again the following year, and have hung over Khan for the past decade, preventing him from obtaining a UK visa in 2013 until the Rajasthan government asked the court to give him leeway to travel.
In 2016, he was acquitted of separate poaching charges relating to the gazelles.
The allegations of poaching against the actor were first made by a member of the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan, a sect that considers blackbucks to be a reincarnation of the 600-year-old guru.
Poonamchand Bishnoi told the court he had heard gunshots and saw headlights the night of the poaching and wrote down the registration of the hunters car as he sped away.
Members of the sect who were gathered outside the court cheered as the verdict was read and Khan was led into a police vehicle.
Cases in Indias overburdened legal system can take years to be processed, but the lingering poaching charges have failed to dampen Khans box-office appeal. He earned $37m (26m) last year, according to Forbes, making him Indias second-highest paid entertainer after Shah Rukh Khan.
His latest film, Tiger Zinda Hai, about a soldier who goes into Iraq to rescue hostages from Islamic State, collected about $85m worldwide.

Breakfast Power
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day; you probably heard it from your own parents many years back. But now you're the one saying it to your sleepy, grumpy kids, who insist to run to school empty stomach as you try to get everyone fed and moving in the morning.
It can be tough to get kids fueled up in time for school. But it's important to try. Here's why breakfast is the most important meal for everyone especially the kids.
Why bother with breakfast 
Nutritionists advise that breakfast should be eaten within two hours of waking. Breakfast is a great way to give the body the refueling it needs. Children who eat breakfast tend to eat healthier overall and are more likely to participate in physical activities  two great ways to help maintain a healthy weight. Children who don't eat breakfast often consume more calories throughout the day and are more likely to be overweight. That's because someone who skips breakfast is likely to get famished before lunchtime and snack on high-calorie foods or overeat at lunch.
Having breakfast kick-starts the body's metabolism, the process by which the body converts the fuel in food to energy. And when the metabolism gets moving, the body starts burning calories.
Apart from providing us with energy, breakfast foods are good sources of important nutrients such as calcium, iron and B vitamins as well as protein and fibre. The body needs these essential nutrients and research shows that if these are missed at breakfast, they are less likely to be compensated for later in the day. Fruit and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals so try to include a banana or a glass of juice as part of your childs daily breakfast.
Skipping breakfast can make children feel tired, restless, or irritable. In the morning, their bodies need to refuel for the day ahead after going without food for 8 to 12 hours during sleep. Their mood and energy can drop by midmorning if they don't eat at least a small morning meal.
Breakfast and brain power 
Just as it is important for children to have breakfast daily, what they eat in the morning is crucial too. Choosing breakfast foods that are rich in whole grains, fiber, and protein while low in added sugar may boost child's attention span, concentration, and memory which they need to learn in school.
Children who have breakfast are more likely to get fiber, calcium, and other important nutrients. They also tend to keep their weight under control, have lower blood cholesterol levels and fewer absences from school, and make fewer trips to the doctor with stomach complaints related to hunger.
Breakfast is also an excellent occasion to eat together as a family when possible. Establishing good breakfast habits in childhood and maintaining them throughout adolescence may be an important factor in reducing the prevalence of breakfast skipping and developing good eating habits that last a lifetime.
So, breakfast really is the most important meal of the day!

Cabinet nod for Public Sector Efficiency Project
A Public Sector Efficiency Project (PSEP) which would identify and speed up under-performing public sector institutions and projects, received cabinet approval this week.
Cabinet also agreed to appoint Sanath J. Ediriweera as the project director.
The project, funded through a World Bank loan facility of USD 60 million, had been designed collectively by the government, World Bank and European Union (EU). The EU has agreed to provide a grant amounting to approximately USD 10 million for the project.
Mentioning that with approximately two more years to go for the government, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said, Sri Lanka has to critically evaluate its binding fiscal and public sector efficiency constraints and focus on institutional strengthening and public sector skills development, while ensuring transparency.
As a result, the PSEP aims to support government policy changes, modernisation of its processes and systems, as well as building skills and capacity of the public sector. They had also identified the Fiscal Policy, National Planning, Project Management and Monitoring, Public Finance, National Budget, External Resources, State Accounts, Treasury Operations, Excise, Government Information, Valuation and Auditor Generals Departments as well as the Right to Information Commission, National Procurement Commission and the Controller Generals Office, as key public institutions which need direct financial support for technical and skills development.
In addition to capacity building, the Cabinet paper also noted that there was a necessity of a more integrated and institutionalised vetting and monitoring function of major public investments of the country.
To solve the issue, the ministry had proposed the establishment of a Public Investment Committee (PIC) to improve coordination between seven core government institutions.
The PIC would be chaired by the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary, with the Ministrys Deputy Treasury Secretary and heads of above institutions. Meanwhile, the government also identified that its capital budget execution was inefficient and numerous local and foreign-funded strategic projects were under-performing.
Despite reports and increasing pressure, a certain number of current project teams do not seem to be in a position to deliver results within the foreseen time-frame and budget. These constraints would hinder the achievements of the macroeconomic targets anticipated by Vision 2025, they further said.
As a result, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry had suggested to establish a Public Investment Delivery Task Force that could assist in identifying issues and potential issues and introduce strategies for under-performing projects. They are expected to give a much-needed push to the public sector reform process.

Cabinet reshuffles after NCM - Rajitha
A substantial cabinet reshuffle is expected to take place based on the voting patterns of the SLFP members in cabinet.
Co-cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the cabinet media briefing amidst the No-confidence Motion (NCM) in Parliament yesterday said SLFP ministers who vote in favour of the NCM would be removed from Cabinet.
They cannot ethically stay on, he said.We have suggested to the President that after this, a new cabinet be appointed with ministries allocated on a scientific basis, said the Minister further. Those who abstain however are not voting against the Prime Minister so we should be able to work together, he added. At the time of writing, the SLFP vote on the NCM had been split with some choosing to abstain whilst others stated that they would vote in favour of it.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Gayantha Karunathilake in the meantime said the Prime Minister, after this will move forward with a stronger government and Parliament.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne also stressed that President Maithripala Sirisena was not backing the NCM against the PM, He simply asked his party to come to a common consensus among themselves, he said.
The President has asked that the SLFP work with the UNP to set up the Local Government councils and we have been doing that all over the country. So I do not think he is against the UNP, clarified Minister Senaratne.
At the last meeting held between the President and the SLFP MPs on Tuesday night, Minister Senaratne said the President had informed them that he could not announce his stance on it. Either way however, changes are expected in government as a consequence of the NCM.

Caning, still in practice even at tuition centres!
It is strange to hear from the parents that some tuition centres in Jaffna and the North or perhaps Sri Lanka in general, are still practising corporal punishments like caning and using abusive words. The surprising event was that even the A/L students both girls and boys get beaten at these centres.
At schools, corporal punishments, which were on the peak before 90s, were banned some years back. However, then and there some village school lower form teachers cane the children. A little girl of nine years from my neighbourhood told that she could not write her homework and the reason revealed was that her class teacher battered her on the knuckles of the fingers and she feels the pain even now. It is really heartbreaking news!
Besides, both the O/L and A/L struggle to compete in these systems of examination in Sri Lanka which are a strange thing in the western world. At this juncture, private educational institutions take this opportunity as a power in their hands. This resulted in verbal abuse, throwing notebooks, dusters and chalks on the students faces and caning particularly the female students in public against our cultural values and they leave many parents to feel painful.
What it is all about is, the students in the G.C.E (A/L) are matured enough to understand the value of education and the purpose for attending the tuition classes, paying their parents hard-earned money. In case, if not, they, definitely, will face the music. Nothing can be achieved by force, a fact. Certain tuition centres want to promote their name and fame in order to accomplish their popularity; they torture the students. Many a student is chicken-hearted to bear the tough and ruthless treatments by the tuition masters or tuition sirs, the pedagogues. Instead of listening and looking for signs of trouble, teachers put the students in trouble and make them asylum seekers.
The mushroomed tuition centres only focus on the production of high results, not of well-rounded persons. They blow their trumpet to increase the number of students by advertising deliberately. In addition, the tuition centres have tough competition with one another in producing the best results in a greater number. As a result, the students are being the scapegoats, unfortunately. Students are in a dilemma either to go to the tuition or discontinue avoiding inconsiderate reprimands. Tuition centres have become the places of rote learning and money making.
Personality differs from person to person, so they should not treat all alike. Many students come from different livelihoods with unfolded misery and poverty. Teachers are meant to disseminate knowledge and streamline discipline and if they derail from the phenomenon and act like bullies and thugs, how can we expect the students to become excellent professionals It is sad to note that so far the products of our schools and tuition centres have rarely produced any significant scientific or technological innovation or discovery or social reforms, except for a very few compared to the products of the developed world. We manufacture routine professionals capable only to practise what is learnt, not to innovate. Therefore, teachers should build a warm stress-free environment by taking the roles as guide, facilitator, mentor, role models to nurture students.

Capturing nature  and wildlife artistically
Wanantharaya, an exhibition of creative works by Prageeth Manohansa will be held at Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41, Horton Place, Colombo 7 starting today and will continue till May 4. The event is free and open to the public daily from 10am to 6pm.
Prageeth Manohansa belongs to a new wave of artists that have emerged from post-war Sri Lanka. This movement follows two specific periods in Sri Lankan art history, namely that of the 43 Group and the 90s movement. The 43 Group introduced modern contemporary art to the island with heavy influences from western art, while the 90s movement changed the face of Sri Lankan art by drawing inspiration from the country's state of civil war and the social and cultural tension that ensued.
Following Manohansas studies in India, he returned to Sri Lanka to study under many of the artists from the 90s movement. But his education in art had in fact begun at home many years earlier under the guidance of his father, and it was during his university years that he began to put theory into practice.
He began exhibiting his work shortly after graduating from university. His works are now part of important private collections both in Sri Lanka and overseas including public installations presented at the Matale Airport and the Maradana junction.
In the artists newest series emerged from a period focused on commissioned works in projects including the Hilton Colombo refurbishment, the Hilton Residency refurbishment and other private commissions for his larger scrap metal sculpture and his much sought-after work on canvas and paper. In this, an evolution in his use of material, the artist continues to explore the base of much of his work, nature and wildlife, while moving in a direction of sculpture composition consisting of wires manipulated and wrapped with scraps of brass. Inspired by these collaborations, he takes a microscopic view at leaves and works with acrylic on paper in his representation of these images as well as in the illustration of unusual and unexpected fauna.
Manohansa has participated in solo and group exhibitions including Saskia Fernando Gallery, Sri Lanka (2014, 2013); Paradise Road Galleries, Sri Lanka (2016, 2013, 2006); Lionel Wendt Art Gallery (2003); Galerie Steph, Singapore (2012); Maldives Institute of Vocational Training, Maldives (2010); Amangalla, Sri Lanka (2011, 2009); Art Dubai, Dubai (2016); Breese Little, UK (2014); Asia House, UK (2011); Colombo Art Biennale, Sri Lanka (2009); XVA Gallery, Dubai (2013); and Museum of Ethnology, Austria (2008).

CB foresees 5% growth in 2018
Sri Lanka would be able to maintain an economic growth close to 5% in 2018, predicted Governor Central Bank, Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at the Central Bank yesterday releasing the Monetary Policy Review he said that in 2017 this was around 3.1% and when the country has a low growth rate the flowing year there has to be an improvement.
The IMF has predicted that the local economy would grow at 3.7% and World Bank at 4.1% last year.
He said that with additional foreign exchange flowing in to the country and also countrys business outlook getting better he was confident of achieving the 5% growth rate. The Governor also said that with food prices dropping, drought subsiding and other positive factors the inflation too would remain around 5%.
Considering the favourable developments in inflation and the inflation outlook lower than expected real GDP growth which further widened the prevailing gap between the actual and potential GDP growth, the Monetary Board, at its meeting decided to reduce the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), which is the upper bound of the policy interest rate corridor of the Central Bank, by 25 basis points.
This decision is also expected to dampen the volatility observed in interest rates in the domestic market during the recent past. While the Central Banks monetary policy easing measure is expected to address the near term tepid growth prospects, it is essential that the planned structural reforms are carried out without delay for the economy to move towards a sustained high growth path in the medium term.
On the external front, in January 2018, export performance improved both in terms of price and volume, which however was outpaced by the increase in imports, thus causing a widening of the trade deficit.
Nevertheless, improved foreign exchange inflows in the form of earnings from tourism as well as workers remittances helped cushion the impact on the current account to some extent.
Improved competitiveness under the flexible exchange rate regime would help reduce the external current account deficit in the future. So far during the year, the Central Bank has been able to purchase over US dollars 400 million from the domestic foreign exchange market to build up international reserves, in addition to the net foreign exchange purchases of US dollars 1,664 million in 2017.
Fiscal slippages in spite of the governments efforts towards consolidation caused the overall fiscal deficit to deviate from its envisaged path in 2017.

CENTURY'S CONQUEST: Dr Lester James Peries  turns 99 today
Immediately following Independence, Ceylon roamed in darkness. The country was at a loss. The country was looking for an identity at least for the sake of its majority ethnic group, Sinhalese. The urge had been brewing for a decade, and the architects were in the making.
A Roman Catholic by birth, S W R D Bandaranaike instituted a political crusade in favour of the majority ethnic group. There was much more to it than racism like it came to be portrayed a few decades later. Bandaranaike was focused on gaining a stretched political mileage through a unique adoption of the Sinhala-only policy. In London, Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy had a one-on-one discourse with Bandaranaike who was treading the Oxford University terrain. Dr Coomaraswamy offered him the tip of a famous five. Back in Ceylon Bandaranaike had the Sinhala-only policy crowd-sourced by this famous five: clergy, physicians, teachers, farmers and labourers. That ploughed Ceylon to welcome a cultural revolution.
All the same, Bandaranaike cannot be considered the high priest of that cultural renaissance. He was one of them. Chitrasena, Sunil Santha, Amaradeva, Lester James Peries and Martin Wickramasinghe came to the forefront to capsize the cultural capsule, while Bandaranaike continued to plough the land. He did not last long, sadly, yet his mission did. The revolution came to pass at a fast pace and we are yet to celebrate its century. All masters of that revolution, but one, are long gone. The master left behind is on the verge of a century.
And that is Dr Lester James Peries who turns 99 today.
That the local cinema initiated its long journey in 1947 with Kadavunu Poronduwa is known to everyone in this country. But the industry was struggling for uniqueness and originality. The industry was too newfangled for the local filmmakers to be original. To this forte, Peries enters like any other good Ceylonese man with a heavy English-influence. He availed himself of his English influence to wipe away the English remains in the country.
Dr Lester James Peries will be revered in Sri Lankan history on account of quality  rather than quantity  of his filmography. Film by film, Dr Peries planted a fresh seed in the industry. Film by film, Dr Peries introduced a new wavelength. He did not deliver art. He delivered a whole generation. That whole generation did not think outside the box. They formed a box for the industry. The likes of Gamini Fonseka, Tissa Abeysekara, Titus Totawatta and Sumitra Peries saw the light of the industry in Dr Lester James Peries cubicle. And that created the tunnel for emerging contemporary filmmakers such as Prasanna Vithanage, Ashoka Handagama and Vimukthi Jayasundara.
Rekhava, officially premiered in 1956 incidentally coinciding with the Bandaranaike revolution, broke the prevailing grounds. The film was shot out of the studio premises and was confined to Ceylon. The dialogues were more natural. The storyline provoked more emotional nuances. Ultimately it went on to be the first feature-length film down the local cinema annals. It gained entry into the Cannes Film Festival in 1957  an international honour denied for the films hitherto produced. Yet, this was not consummation. Dr Peries was still experimenting with the subject.
Peries, still a newbie to the industry, had to face challenges. He sought a local vein for the music. He heard of Sunil Santha while in London through Devar Surya Sena at a concert. Back in Sri Lanka, he wanted to have Sunil Santha on his team, but the latter did not like the idea of contributing to an industry plagued with South Indian influence. Luckily for Peries, Fr Marcelline Jayakody came to rescue.
The second feature film, Sandeshaya, was one step ahead, handling a more intricate plot outline: history. That was 1960. Three years later, Peries took over a new trial: a film based on a novel. Gamperaliya was a few steps ahead with Tissa Abeysekara (known for his natural dialogues, and a revered scriptwriter whose posthumous films continue to emerge), and Reggie Siriwardana entering the scene as writers to the screen. That was a more groundbreaking work with a number of performers such as Tony Ranasinghe, Henry Jayasena and Trilicia Gunawardane later earning a brand name in their own right. It received a widely acclaimed appreciation from the critics such as Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Reviewed Professor Sarachchandra: At last a Sinhalese film has been made which we could show the world without having to hide our heads in shame. I want to say a great film has been made of a great novel.
Gamperaliya was followed by Delovak Athara, Ran Salu, Golu Hadawatha and Akkara Paha. These films show Dr Peries knack as well as a fondness for making films based on fiction. Yet, in 1972, he entered a different plane with the next film, Nidhanaya, originally a short story by G B Senanayake. Dr Peries had the blessings of a powerful script by Dr Tissa Abeysekara, powerful music by Dr Premasiri Khemadasa and an equally powerful, yet small, skill-studded cast.
Ammawarune, the hitherto final movie, made in 2006 cannot be called the culmination of the Lester James Peries filmography. It is the continuation of the culmination he has already attained in the late fifties through seventies.
Dr Lester James Peries deserves the ovation he is honoured with today as he begins to shift to the much-coveted century from the nonagenarian decade. He was the first filmmaker who led the Ceylonese cinema into an international platform. That acclaim made things easier for the subsequent Sri Lankan cinema. Film after film, Dr Peries offered lessons on how indigenousness could be employed in filmmaking. That was a gradual, yet steady, path. Regi Siriwardana cannot be more accurate when he defined Rekhawa as an event of tremendous importance. Though it may not be a masterpiece, it ushered in the tradition Dr Peries wanted to be instilled. With Rekhava, the Ceylonese audience was done with the unoriginality.
Growing up in a Christian home, speaking only in English, Peries only access to the vernacular culture was his grandmother. If Sri Lanka has reached some cultural pinnacle today, her citizens should be thankful to that great lady along the same line of paying tribute to Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy for being the cradle that nurtured revolutionaries.

CHFMA hosts awards ceremony
Certified Hospitality Finance & Management Accountants (CHFMA) professional qualification hosted its certificate awarding ceremony and new class inauguration ceremony recently.
As management accountants, their skills have been harnessed to develop businesses in a variety of industries across the world. Preparation for the specific needs of operating with any given field, however, tends to be a matter of on-the-job learning, and wisdom passed down from predecessors.
Jointly offered by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) and Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), the CHFMA qualification supports Sri Lankan professionals by pre-empting that process, giving them the skills, they need to excel in finance and management accounting in the hospitality sector, even before they have spent years in the workplace.
Chief Guest at the ceremony, Rohan Karr, Executive Vice President, John Keells Holdings, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, stated that the hospitality industry demands a fascination with the sector, and deep and comprehensive knowledge, in order to establish a successful career.
He reminded those present of the value of a professional qualification in Hospitality Finance and Management Accounting to hoteliers.
Speaking on the lack of professional qualifications providing skills to support operations in the hospitality industry, he underscored the importance of obtaining a professional qualification in the specific area of finance and management accounting for the hospitality industry. He noted that it would allow one to promote and endorse oneself, positioning oneself well for employment in an industry which is attractive and in demand.

Confidence confirmed
After months of speculation and procrastination, Parliament last night debated and put to the vote a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in what was only the countrys third vote of no-confidence moved against a sitting Prime Minister.
The no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was defeated last night following a stormy and often heated 12-hour debate. It was history repeating itself: the two previous motions of no confidence against Prime Ministers S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Sirima Bandaranaike were also defeated. This is, therefore, an opportune moment to place in context yesterdays events in relation to the seismic shifts if politics that have taken place over the past three years.
The January 8, 2015, presidential Election swept President Maithripala Sirisena into power, ironically not with the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which he was a member for forty years and general secretary for fourteen years. It was the SLFPs arch-rival, the United National Party (UNP) which propelled President Sirisena to power, an exercise in which only a handful of SLFPers supported him.
Following his election victory, President Sirisena returned the favour to some extent: he called upon the UNP to form a minority government where UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister. That government lasted until the general elections which were held in August 2015.
Key political developments
In that intervening period between January and August 2015, several key political developments took place. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, now the cynosure of all eyes, was introduced and passed in Parliament. In doing so, President Sirisena reached out and obtained the support of his party, the SLFP, as the amendment required a two-thirds majority to ensure its passage through Parliament.
It was also during this period that President Sirisena sought and obtained the leadership of the SLFP, the party he was banished from when he contested the presidential election. This was by virtue of a clause introduced by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa into the SLFP Constitution which stated that if the countrys President was a SLFPer, he would automatically become party leader as well.
Even though President Sirisena had re-entered the SLFP, the lead up to the 2015 general election exposed the rifts within the party. It became evident that the majority of SLFP candidates and sitting MPs were still loyal to Rajapaksa, even though executive power now rested with President Sirisena. In an unprecedented step, President Sirisena made an address to the nation declaring that even if the SLFP won the election, Rajapaksa would not be made Prime Minister.
The outcome of the general election was to shape events to come and was a key factor in yesterdays vote in Parliament: the UNP emerged as the single largest party. However, with only 106 seats, it failed to win a simple majority. The SLFP emerged a strong second, with 95 seats. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 16 seats while the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) won 6 seats.
Joint Opposition
With an eye on introducing more constitutional amendments- particularly those that would address the ethnic question, reform the process of elections and dilute if not abolish the Executive Presidency- President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe decided to form a government of national unity that would ensure that the government retained a two-thirds majority in Parliament enabling it to make constitutional changes.
In doing so, President Sirisena found that he had the support of only about 44 parliamentarians. The other 51 remained loyal to Rajapaksa. Not only were they dissenting, they also took their campaign to the public, launching a series of protest rallies that were as a much a protest against the President as much as it was against the UNP. In Parliament, they banded themselves as the so-called Joint Opposition (JO).
Since then, the JO has been relentless in its campaigns against the government. As a result, some SLFP ministers, wary about their electoral prospects and survival at the next elections, often sided with the JO, opposing key policy issues mooted by the UNP faction of the government. Others, such as Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekera, were openly critical of UNP-led policies in general and of the UNP leadership in particular. The UNP was, however, keen to pursue its own liberal, reformist agenda.
When news of the bond sale issue at the Central Bank broke, President Sirisena probably sensed an opportunity there. That would explain why he chose to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the issue when no such commissions were appointed to inquire into the alleged misdeeds of the previous regime.
It is an understatement to say that the UNP did not cover itself in glory at the Presidential Commission. Even the resignation of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had to be virtually extracted- and to this day, Karunanayake protests his innocence, despite the findings that have come to light at the Commission.
That- and the indecision in acting against Karunanayake- was a crucial blunder by the UNP leadership. Indeed, that was the thrust of the motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe yesterday.
From that point onwards, the JO was waiting for the opportune moment to pounce. On the ground, it had formed the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) because the SLFP remained under the control of President Sirisena and he made it clear he had no intention of letting go of those reins.
With the JO within Parliament and the SLPP outside it, Rajapaksa was gearing for a comeback- and the local government elections last February provided the new party with the ideal opportunity to test the political waters.
The SLPP emerged a clear winner at the election and the UNP came a somewhat distant second. The big loser was the mainstream SLFP headed by President Sirisena.
Therefore, it was no longer expedient for the President to unite with the dissident Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP, it became imperative.
So, when the JO came up with the motion of no-confidence, President Sirisena was hamstrung by the electoral incompetence of his own party- and had no choice but to support it, if not actively, at least tacitly.
Yesterdays vote
The composition of the current Parliament was critical in yesterdays vote. In the end, the motion was never going to succeed without the support of a section of the UNP endorsing it or abstaining from voting. With Prime Minister Wickremesinghe being at the helm of the UNP for twenty-four years, there was bound to be some dissension within the ranks- and this is what the JO planned to capitalise on.
Despite yesterdays events, most UNP parliamentarians felt betrayed by President Sirisena, the man they helped into high office. However, it must come to terms with the fact that President Sirisena will be in office for the next two years. It must also take to heart the stinging rebuke it has received from the voters at the local government elections and now looks towards the next general and presidential elections. Campaigning for the latter is due in one and a half years.
With the vote concluding late last night, at the time of writing it is too early to say what the overall political fallout will be. What is clear though is that the tumultuous relationship between the UNP and the SLFP within the national government will never be the same again and that raises the question as to what shape and form the government would now take.
Despite the outcome of yesterdays vote finally being determined, key questions remain: will the UNP succeed in reforming the party without further delay Will the two factions of the SLFP now unite and present a common front at the next elections And, given yesterdays outcome, what are President Sirisenas options
These are the questions that the nation awaits answers to. They cannot come soon enough as party politics have become an interesting but costly diversion for the masses who want their politicians to get back to the business of running the country instead of bickering among themselves for the spoils of power.

An expert on secrets, a former spy himself, and the author of over two dozen books, virtually all of them best sellers, John le Carr currently lives in a corner of England so remote its known as Lands End. Nestled on a cliff in Cornwall, is his safehouse. He says he loves being in Cornwall because the Cornish dont care about celebrities. If they even know what I do they havent read it. Or if they have read it, they make a point of not being impressed by it. And that is enormously soothing. Not a head turns in the street when I walk by, says Carr in a recent interview. Its here, in the home he fashioned out of three derelict cottages more than 40 years ago, that he weaves together the threads of memory, experience and research into his tales of intrigue. The solitude, no doubt is his stimulation.
Born in Poole, England, on October 19, 1931, le Carre had a gloomy childhood, thanks to the disruptive motions of his father, an erratic businessman who kept the family moving from place to place. I grew up in a completely bookless household. It was my fathers boast that he had never read a book from end to end, le Carr said some years ago in an interview with the Paris Review. I was entirely dependent on my schoolteachers for my early reading with the exception of The Wind in the Willows, which a stepmother read to me when I was in hospital...the big explosion in my reading occurred in my late teens when I was seduced by the German muse. I devoured the whole of German literature alive, as it seems to me now. I have probably read more German literature than I have English. Today my pleasure is with nineteenth-century storytellers: Balzac, Dickens, and the rest.
After attending a series of private English schools, le Carr was called upon for national service and spent several years in Vienna with the Army Intelligence Corps. When the term expired, he returned to England and enrolled at Lincoln College, Oxford. Graduation was followed by a procession of odd jobs, including one year in which he taught at Eton.
In 1960, he resumed his intelligence career with the Foreign Service. During this time he began writing novels, the first entitled Call for the Dead. His second book, A Murder of Quality, appeared in 1962 while le Carr was stationed at the British Embassy in Bonn. Two years later he resigned from the Foreign Service to devote himself entirely to writing. He achieved international fame as the author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. His later books include A Small Town in Germany,Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,Smileys People,The Little Drummer Girl,A Perfect Spy,The Russia House, and Our Game, almost all of which have been adapted for movies and television.
Even today, a sense of loyalty prevents him from talking of his days at the intelligence service. But he recalls how he went to his employers after he wrote his first novel, while working as a foreign servant. They read it and said they had no objections, but even if it were about butterflies, they said, I would have to choose a pseudonym. So then I went to my publisher, Victor Gollancz, who was Polish by origin, and he said, My advice to you, old fellow, is choose a good Anglo-Saxon couple of syllables. Monosyllables. He suggested something like Chunk-Smith. So as is my courteous way, I promised to be Chunk-Smith. After that, memory eludes me and the lie takes over. I was asked so many times why I chose this ridiculous name, then the writers imagination came to my help. I saw myself riding over Battersea Bridge, on top of a bus, looking down at a tailors shop. Funnily enough, it was a tailors shop, because I had a terrible obsession about buying clothes in order to become a diplomat in Bonn. And it was called something of this sortle Carr. That satisfied everybody for years. But lies dont last with age. I find a frightful compulsion towards truth these days. And the truth is, I dont know.
John le Carr, however, is a name he does not answer to. It is an abstraction that exists in his writing studio, and on the cover of his books, like a spys name on a phony passport.
Of his life in the intelligent service he is willing to reveal that for his military service, he went to Austria. One of my jobs was trolling through the displaced-persons camps, looking for people who were fake refugees, or for people whose circumstances were so attractive to us from an intelligence point of view that we might consider returning them, with their consent, to the countries they came from. For a person of, as I was then, barely twenty-one, it was an immense responsibility at an extraordinary moment in history. Afterwards, after teaching at Eton, I went into the cold-war setup properly. In all I dont suppose that I spooked around for more than seven or eight years, and thats forty years ago, but that was my little university for the purposes that I needed later to write. I think that if Id gone to sea at that time I would have written about the sea. If Id gone into advertising or stockbroking, that would have been my stuff. It was from there that I began abstracting and peopling my other world, my alternative, private world.
When asked if there is any space between the real, David Cornwell and the false John le carre, he says, Yes, I think a lot really. David tries to be a good dad and a regular guy with difficulty, many flaws. And John takes off into the ether. Hes the man of imagination. And I can take John for a walk, let him loose on the cliffs. And he has a good time and he populates the empty cliffs with the people of his imagination. And then I come back and help with the washing up.
It was The Spy Who Came in from the Cold that made John le Carr, a famous and much in-demand author back in 1963. The book spent 34 weeks as No. 1 on the bestseller list and was made into an acclaimed motion picture starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom. It is said that both the novel and the film served as grey, gritty antidotes to the fantastical world of James Bond, and were accepted by critics and the public as an authentic portrayal of the scruffy business of espionage.
But for months after the first books were published only British intelligence knew who and where John le Carre was. And then, the Sunday Times blew the whistle. The whole investigation of my person, as you might say, came up. Was I a spook Was I not a spook says le Carre.
In his eyes, he is not a spook. Of course. Theres nothing special at all in what he writes. Everything is so simple. I look around, I collect bits of people. I assemble them. I pitch a story.
Explaining why he has not stopped writing now that he is eighty-six, he laughs, Each book feels like my last book. And then I think, like a dedicated alcoholic, that one more wont do me any harm.

Does anybody care for Kandys football
When will Kandys football get back to where it was This is the question on every football fan's lips. There are plans, by some of the keen football lovers to help kick back football to its former glory days when Kandy produced top class players who went on to sport national colours. If that is to happen then it is essential that a new set of competent promoters should serve in the committee. Today football in Kandy is in the doldrums, from 1988 to 2010 the sport flourished, but sad to say, the sport is now at a low ebb.
Football is a game popular all over the world but it is sad that it is not so in Kandy which has rich history in the Hill Capital when men who mattered ran the game when even Colombo feared them. But sadly the game has received step motherly treatment in the last six years or so, and is out of the big picture. The Kandy Association Football League (KAFL) is 93 years old.
Football in Kandy can be traced back and has a record of over being over 150 years, when white servicemen were there they took a keen interest. Kand AFL was formed in 1925. It is one of the founder members of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) (earlier known as Ceylon Football Association). Kandy had one of biggest leagues with over 40 teams.
At present, the people who are involved administrating Kandy football dont know its history. Only now a knockout tournament is played in Kandy. Last year the AGM and the tournaments was not held and the FFSL has not taken any action.
Kandy won the All Island Senior and junior League championship for the first time under the presidency of B.M. Liyanage. With this win Kandy toured Nepal. It was the first ever Kandy team to go on an overseas tour, that was in early 1990s. What the controlling body should do is to appoint an interim committee and run football in Kandy until it is properly organized. They should obtain the support of those who have done great service to this game in the past. Last years AGM was not held, and a person who is involved with football. a club owner who is into gambling tried to come in as president to promote his gambling.
Holding office for prestige is not what is required now. People must come forward and serve football. Today, most officials holding office are only keen on coaching and refereeing for financial benefits. If football in Kandy is to improve the controlling body must put the leagues on the correct path.
The FFSL is not showing any interest for Kandy football. It is time they woke from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy towards the right direction.

DSS go out firm favourites against Rajans
D.S.Senanayake College will go out as firm favourites when they lock horns against Dharmaraja College Kandy in their first round Singer A division inter-schools league rugby encounter at Navy grounds in Welisara today at 4.00pm.
DSS after their sensational display against Isipathana in their first game of the season, where they narrowly lost 24-25, lost again to Zahira (17-19) and to Wesley College by (0-5) last week.
They were really unlucky not to win all three games due to sheer bad luck going against them. Against Pathana and Zahira they lost due to missing a last minute conversion and a penalty and against Wesley the opponents scored in the dying stages of the game to pull off a win after the scores were deadlock at nil-all.
DSS are packed with some outstanding players in their ranks, such as their captain cum hardy second row forward Chamuka Sheshan, Vishal Wijesiri, Dinusha Hemasiri, Harshula Perera and Kaveesha Rambukwella, all of whom are match winners. But they should get their act together if they are to pull off their first win for the season against an unpredictable Dharmaraja outfit. This year the D.S. Senanayake are coached by veteran rugby coach Mothilal Jayathilake.
Meanwhile the Rajans under the watchful eyes of their head coach Kapila Silva, who is the manager of the Kandy Sports Club at present are captained by experienced player and number eight Bhawantha Udangamuwa (who is also this years Dharmaraja College 1st XI cricket captain and brother of Kandy SC number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa).
The Rajans will know that losing their third game could also mean a setback for them in the league tournament and most probably demotion to the B Division as they had previously lost to Isipathana College (14-42) and St.Peters College by 5 points to 42 in their last outing. Hence they will come out with their best outfit for this game, with players of the calibre of skipper Bawantha Udangamuwa, Supun Wijesiri, Malintha Rajapakse, Harsha Rodrigo, Chanidu Abeyratna, Adeesha Dissanayake, Jatila Kapuwatta and Rahal Wanigasekara.
Rajans will go out with all guns blazing to try and topple D.S.Senanayake and try to avoid demotion.

Fitch affirms Dialog Axiata at AAA(lka)/Stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based telecom company Dialog Axiata PLCs National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
Dialogs standalone credit profile of AAA(lka) is underpinned by its market leadership in the growing mobile and pay-TV industry segments. Fitch believes the company is in a position to gain revenue market share from smaller telcos, with its superior 3G/4G networks capability.
It has a solid financial profile with a revenue growth of 8%-9%, stable operating EBITDAR margin of around 35%-37%, and low Fitch-forecast 2018 FFO adjusted net leverage of 1.2x.
Fitch believes Dialog would receive support from its 83%-parent, Axiata Group Berhad (Axiata) of Malaysia, if its standalone credit profile were to weaken.
Dialog and its parent continue to have moderate linkages, which include sharing key management personnel, a common name and common creditors, which could result in reputational risk to Axiata should Dialog fail.
Dialogs rating is unaffected by the acquisition of Colombo Trust Finance PLC (CTF), a small non-bank financial institution, for Rs1.3 billion completed in November 2017.
Dialog is likely to use it to expand its digital financial services strategy and supplement its payment settlement platform. Dialog is likely to infuse equity of Rs 2.05 billion in CTF during 2018-2020 to meet an enhanced minimum regulatory capital requirement of Rs 2.5 billion by January 1, 2021.
CTFs capital structure should then be strong enough to prevent becoming a cash drain on Dialog over the rating horizon.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Peoples Leasing & Finance PLCs (PLC, B/AA-(lka)/Stable) proposed senior debenture issue of up to Rs 6 billion a final National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka).
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 6 March 2018, and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
The debentures, which will have tenors of four and five years and carry fixed coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. PLC expects to use the proceeds for working capital purposes and to retire some existing debentures. The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
The proposed debentures are rated in line with PLCs National Long-Term Rating as the issue ranks equally with claims from the companys other senior unsecured creditors.
PLCs Issuer Default Rating and National Long-Term Rating reflect Fitchs view that PLCs parent, the state-owned and systemically important Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) (AA+(lka)/Stable) would provide PLC with extraordinary support, if required.

For a fresh start
At the time of writing the Joint Opposition sponsored No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is been debated in earnest in parliament with all fire and brimstone. Some of the more vociferous MPs who were gung ho that Ranil Wickremesinghe would be history come the morning of April 5 had changed tack yesterday only to remind the government that it would soon lose its two thirds majority in the House. Others who spoke of a new dawn after yesterday were tearing their hair and gnashing their teeth about moneybags changing hands and the amounts involved.
Whatever the outcome of this No-Confidence Motion, there is no gainsaying that stability has to return to the government, whatever its composition, from today. The country, perhaps, never in its post independence history had witnessed instability to the extent the current dispensation is caught up in. It was obvious to all except the naive that the unity government was in a state of drift following the results of the February 10 LG elections. It is also no exaggeration to say that the entire state apparatus was in a state of paralysis with the state officials reluctant to take decisions of a compromising nature. The stock exchange continues to be on the slide and the rupee has collapsed vis-a-vis the dollar. Needless to say, foreign investors have given the country a wide berth as a result of the prevailing political instability.
Day-to-day life too has been affected with talk in the market place centred around the No-Confidence Motion and who will be the next Prime Minister. There is dissonance in the entire state apparatus and a feeling that things are not moving. Development appears to be at a standstill and if there is such activity it has not reached the public domain. Amidst it all, the crime rate too is escalating, with daily killings in some corner or other in the country, the law enforcement in knee jerk reaction mode.
Even before the outcome of the LG polls results the ever widening cracks in the unity government was only all too apparent, with different actors saying different things at different places and ministers and MPs both, of the UNP and SLFP/UPFA, pulling in different directions. Finger pointing too was not in short supply between the two factions, sending all the wrong messages to the public vis-a-vis stability.
It is in this context that the No-Confidence Motion could be termed a blessing in disguise. It would prove decisive in charting a steady course for the ship of state, now cast adrift in choppy seas, since the day the marriage between the two arch political rivals came into being. The President, as the Captain should now act with the proper perspective, shedding all indecisiveness which marked the unity government's journey hitherto traversed during the past three years.
Things are also bound to unravel one way or the other and events determined in a way that would finally make the contours clear and the much needed stability restored through whatever form the government would eventually take, starting today.
In all this, President Maithripala Sirisena, no doubt, will be the central figure who would determine the course the country would take out of the ashes of this No-Confidence Motion. He would have to take decisive action in the implementation of policies leaving no room for vacillation. Should the PM prevail, and the UNP decide to form its own administration, sans the SLFP, either as a minority government, or with the support of some SLFP MPs, to obtain a working majority, he should not hinder such a move, though his own party would be in the Opposition, in the name of stability.
Such an eventuality would hark back to the days of the cohabitation between CBK and the 2001 UNP government. Here too it was not without hiccups, but to the credit of the former President she did not interfere with the policies of the UNP government, nor veto its decisions, until its premature end.
Be that as it may, with another two years to go before the next Presidential Election, the country cannot be allowed to remain in a state of suspended animation as a result of political instability. This would not only affect the country domestically but also have its international ramifications. Donors would not come forward to help out countries which are unstable and unable to manage its affairs. Besides, there are various international commitments made, particularly on the reconciliation front. The country which was virtually in the international dog house prior to January 2015 succeeded in emerging from that bad spell with the election of Maithripala Sirisena. This achievement should not be squandered as a result of political instability brought about by infighting in the government. It should not go unmentioned that most of this goodwill accrued to us through the efforts of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. What is needed urgently is a course correction with the joint participation of the President and Premier Wickremesinghe, or, whoever will be the Prime Minister. They owe it to the country.

SLC High performance batting coach and head of womens cricket:
Hashan and Apsari pay tribute to Mega Show
Ex-Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne and his wife Apsari Singhabahu Tillakaratne, who heads Sri Lankas womens cricket, commended the role played by the Lake House to promote school cricket through the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest for the past four decades.
Tillakaratne, who now serves as the high performance batting coach of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and his charming wife Apsari, the head od SLCs womens cricket, were of the view that the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has been a source of encouragement and inspiration to young cricketers to progress beyond school level.
Ex-national captain Tillakaratne, who was adjudged the runner up to Asanka Gurusinha, the present manager of the Sri Lanka national team, for the Best Batsman award in 1986, said they anxiously looked forward to the event during their school days. It was the biggest event for us those days when I was playing school cricket for D.S. Senanayake College. Even now, choolboy cricketers are eagerly looking forward to this event which rewards the most outstanding schoolboy cricketers, he said.
 There is a great feeling when you know that your hard efforts would be rewarded at the end of a school season. You have a hope when you play for your school. Standing at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer victory podium is a great feeling for any schoolboy crickter, Tillakaratne said adding that the organisers the Sunday Observer of Lake House and its present sponsor SLT Mobitel deserves credit for recognizing school talent.
School cricket is the stepping stone for club cricket and to the Sri Lanka national pool thereafter. It is important that we encourage and inspire them to march to the next level, said the veteran Sri Lanka captain who was a member of Arjuna Ranatungas 1996 World champion team.
The sponsor Mobitel is rendering a great service by providing the financial backing for the show which is undoubtedly a great source of encouragement for thousands of schoolboy cricketers in the country who are dreaming of representing their country at some level, added Tillakarate who had represented Sri Lanka in 83 Tests to aggregate 4,545 runs with 11 centuries and 20 fifties at an attractive average of 42.87.
He made his Test debut for Sri Lanka in December 1989 in the second Test against Australia in Hobart. Incidentally, his last Test for Sri Lanka too had been against Australia where he made an unbeaten 74 at the SSC ground in March, 2004.
Tillakaratnes talent was not only confined to the established game but also in ODIs. He was a vital ingredient in the Sri Lanka ODI team, including that of the 1996 champion team which beat Australia by seven wickets in Lahore to win the ICC World Cup 22 years ago. He had represented Sri Lanka in 200 ODIs to aggregate 3789 runs at an average of 29.60 with two centuries and 13 half tons.
Meanwhile, Apsari Singhabahu Tillakaratne stressed the importance of having a similar event to recognize the achievements of schoolgirls playing cricket. Since taking over the role of heading womens cricket at SLC, she has worked hard to popularize the game among girls schools.
Along with the district coaches of SLC, she travels across the country to spot raw talent that could be carefully groomed to fill vacancies in the national womens team. Since taking over the destinies of womens cricket, she has been able to discover rich talent for the national womens pool.
The best way to have a strong Sri Lanka national womens pool is by popularizing the game at school level. When I took over, only a few girls schools were involved in cricket. But now we see more and more girls schools playing cricket. Thats a positive sign, she said.
In a bid to further promote and popularize the game among girls schools, Apsari introduced a series of big matches to make it a passion among the new generation. It has been a great success. We encouraged major schools in selected towns to play big matches, similar to customary annual encounters played among boys schools. We provided technical and logistical support for them to inaugurate a series of big matches so that schoolgirls would come to witness those and generate a passion for the game. Such girls big matches were played in several areas, including Nuwara Eliya, she said.
Apsari said promoting womens cricket among schools enables them to have a strong national development pool, giving better options for the selectors when picking the Sri Lanka womens team. When more and more girls schools play cricket, we have enough talent for the district squads. We are maintaining district squads throughout the island.
The most outstanding girls at those squads will be picked to the national development pool, she said while adding that the Sri Lanka womens team has been training under Hemantha Devapriya, assisted by Oshadee Weerasinghe.
We have introduced the Super Four format in womens cricket too. Dambulla, Galle, Kandy and Colombo teams will compete in the Super Four. Outstanding players from other areas will get a chance to represent these teams and gain experience. They could prove their class at the highest domestic level and make a strong claim for places in the national pool, she added.
The national mobile service provider, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest as the principal sponsor. Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitel, Nalin Perera has made a significant contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade. The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association with the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
Voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, continues under three divisions. The most popular contest is gradually reaching its peak as the season is coming to an end by early next month. Voting coupons for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.
The 40th edition of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest is scheduled to be held in July.
Incidentally, this will be the 11th consecutive year that SLT Mobitel will be sponsoring the Mega Show, which has a rich history of producing legendary cricketers, including Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan and the Chief ICC Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle.
Winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title has been the dream of every schoolboy cricketer as they generally believe that the prestigious title would take them closer to wear the Sri Lanka cap. Most past winners of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the tile had made their Sri Lanka debut in next to no time, some of them just months after winning the Crown.
There are three past Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main award winners in the current Sri Lanka team - Dinesh Chandimal (2009), Niroshan Dickwella (2012) and Kusal Mendis (2013). The trio stepped into the Sri Lanka team just months after their crowning glory to become vital ingredients of the national team.

Almond Scrub
Almonds are an amazing source of Vitamin E which is necessary for improving the general health of the skin and works effectively to lighten dark skin. The skin lightening properties of almonds also help in correcting skin discoloration.
The benefits of almond oil and almond milk for skin are well known.
No doubt, almonds and almond oil is widely used in beauty products and cosmetics.
Take 5 to 8 almonds and grind them to make a thick paste, add one teaspoon of milk powder and 1 teaspoon of honey to it, mix well and apply it on the darkened areas of the neck. Let it infuse for 30 minutes and then remove it by massaging and washing it off with water. Repeat this therapy 3 to 4 times a week. You can also massage pure almond oil on the neck daily in order to improve blood circulation to the area.
Walnut Scrub
Just like almonds, walnuts are also loaded with essential vitamins and minerals that nourish the skin and keep it glowing, moisturized and smooth. Nuts are often included in effective face packs for glowing skin. A scrub made of walnut and sour curd is extremely effective in lightening the skin tone by removing the deposit of dirt and dead cells from the back and sides of the neck. The acids present in sour curd make it one of the most potent home remedies to lighten skin naturally.
Crush 8 to 10 walnuts roughly and add 2 teaspoons of sour curd to to turn it into a dense paste, apply this paste on the sides and back of your neck and scrub by massaging your neck for 10 minutes, then leave it on your skin so that it dries for 30 minutes.

Housing Minister commissions Waya Ulpatha model village
The fifth model village named Waya Ulpatha, which was planned under the Anuradhapura housing development project, was commissioned by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, recently. The said model village is located in the Palugaswewa Divisional Secretariat (DS) Division of the Anuradhapura district. The Waya Ulpatha model village consists of 25 well-equipped new houses and each family had been provided with a low-interest loan facility amounting to Rs. 300,000.
Minister Sajith Premadasa, addressing the public rally following the inauguration of the model village, said the governments mission and vision in housing construction, was not politically motivated and was solely designed for the purpose of providing permanent housing facilities for underprivileged families within the country.
According to recent surveys, it had been found that currently in Sri Lanka, 227,523 houses are only half-done, while 1,340,928 families lack proper housing facilities. The government built 40 model villages during 2015, while 197 such model villages were constructed in 2016, the minister added.
During last year, we commenced construction work for 2,016 model villages and within the period of 2015  2017, 15,656 new houses were built in those model villages. A sum of Rs. 5.998 million was allocated for this purpose. Under the national housing programme during 2015  2017, 256,169 families had become entitled for housing benefits. The government spent Rs. 16.412 million for this programme. This year, the government has allocated Rs. 12 million for housing development activities, Minister Premadasa said.
The minister further said he was pleased to witness that the housing development programmes in the Anuradhapura district had become a success. So far, 43 model villages had been put up and out of them, five model villages had been commissioned. Minister Premadasa added that it was planned to construct 100 model villages within the Anuradhapura district during this year and hence, he requested the support and dedication of relevant officials and stakeholders, to achieve the said target.
At the ceremony, the minister awarded housing loan cheques to 300 families under the kidney patients housing aid project, Wisiri loan scheme and the Sampath Sevana loan facility programme. It was also revealed that within next few weeks, model villages constructed at Kudagama, the Nuwaragam Palatha East DS Division and Ihala Galktiyagama in the Medawachchiya DS Division, would be commissioned as well.
Women and Child Affairs Minister and Member of Parliament Chandrani Bandara, Parliamentarians Chandima Gamage and Ishak Rahuman, along with National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) Chairman Lakwijaya Sagara Palansooriya and Anuradhapura NHDA Senior Manager Devika Wijerathne were also present at the event.

We pioneered many innovative concepts in the industry and initiated concepts such as the scholarship scheme offered to A/L students with the objective of supporting the industry to build capacity. To date, over 300 scholarships have been awarded and it has now become an industry standard.
Considered as one of the legends in the ICT sector being involved with the industry for over three decades he said that he and also the IFS saw this positive trend 20 years ago.
Sri Lanka was one of the first Asian countries to introduce a mobile network in 1986 even before Japan. This along with the introduction of high speed internet set the trend for huge investments for ICT sector.
Today after 20 years the IFS from 25 employees had grown to be 1,050 Employee Company and revenue in the excess of US$ 1 billion. Our target is to be a US$ 5 billion company by 2022.

MAS begins biodiversity battle with  25,000 acre habitat restoration drive
MAS Holdings has covered over 500 acres across 27 locations on its mission to preserve Sri Lankas unique biodiversity and eco systems (Strap)
MAS Holdings mapped its sustainability goals in 2016 and made three clear commitments in its quest to drive sustainable manufacturing in Sri Lanka.
As one of the worlds most recognized design to delivery solution providers in the realm of apparel and textile manufacturing and also the largest apparel and textile manufacturer in South Asia, MAS has pledged to take radical climate action in the renewable energy space, to continuously manage the footprint of its business and to directly support biodiversity by creating habitats in 100 times the area it operates.
Its critical that business intervene to turn the tide of deforestation. The time for action is not even now  it was day before yesterday. We are losing our forests faster than we can replant them. Conservative estimates say Sri Lanka is losing 8,000 hectares of forest cover each year and more critically we are losing our precious endemic species of flora and fauna at alarming rates, said Sarinda Unamboowe, Board Member overseeing environmental sustainability.
This idea began when we asked ourselves How can we help restore the biodiversity we may have either displaced or destroyed by our physical presence This simple question grew into a larger more ambitious vision to attempt to restore and replace 100 times the physical space we occupy. We didnt want to just grow trees but to impact biodiversity, said Sharika Senanayake, the groups Director of Environmental Sustainability.
In 2017 MAS set out to cover 250 acres,equal to the space it occupies in Sri Lanka but thanks to the incredible passion and dedication by its own teams and the continuing support from the Forest Department, Wildlife Department and other stakeholders the group achieved double the impact.
Throughout 2017 sustainability teams from all divisions of MAS collectively made an impact on over 500 acres with a 5 to 7 year commitment to maintain and ensure the projects keep growing.
Knowing that growing trees alone would not help the problem of biodiversity loss MAS picked 6 models to engage and deploy habitat creation from all fronts.
Sharika elaborated We hit our learning curves on the way, the method, the research, the science, the partners all fell into place once we started.

Aruwakkalu Waste-Management Programme:
Ministry requests to expedite locomotive engine procurement
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry had requested the procurement of four locomotive engines to transport garbage from Kelaniya to a sanitary landfill site in Aruwakkalu, Puttlam, to be expedited.
The ministry added that the procurement process would take long under normal procedures and hence, Cabinet should look into approving the procurement decision of the Railways Department as soon as possible.
The transport of garbage to Aruwakkalu is seen as a solution to the garbage disposal problem in Colombo. As public opposition mounts to dumping of garbage in landfill sites in and around Colombo, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) under the Megapolis Ministry had taken responsibility to solve the garbage issue in Colombo.

Munchee, the flagship brand of Ceylon Biscuits Limiteds (CBL), recently supported the Association of Food Science and Technology (AFST) aligned to the Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Sri Jayewardenepura in a novel initiative to bridge the gap between industry and academic research.
CBL as the main sponsor of OPTIMUS 18, a event organised by AFST, highlighted the growing importance of the food industry and university in collaborating, sharing knowledge and building long term relationships which is mutually beneficial for both parties.
One of the main objectives of the event was to recognise and award prizes to the winners of the research competition organised by AFST. Over 50 research proposals were accepted from Graduates and Postgraduates of the department with 20 papers short listed by an eminent University panel.
From among the six finalists, the winner of the Graduate category was Roshima Vithanage for research on the Analysis of Antioxidant capacity, Total Phenolic Content and Physio-chemical properties of raw extract, Pectinase treated extract and cellulose treated extract of pineapple waste.
In the Postgraduate category Ajani Chandrika Wijeratne won for research on the Physiochemical properties of rice based herbal biscuit incorporated with the decoction of syzygiumcumini bark.
The keynote address at OPTIMUS 18 was delivered by Prof. Ajith de Alwis. Looking at the role of industry and university, we need serious industry-university interaction. The research needs to translate into rupees as it is very important going beyond one or two events creating new levels of partnership and importantly a sense of togetherness. The best way is having continuous research projects and trouble-shooting where the industry gives projects to the university and with the university reacting with answers,he said.
CBLs commitment towards enhancing food industry and academia relationships, Nalin Karunaratne, Chief Executive Officer CBL said, Our association with OPTIMUS 18 is part of our ongoing initiatives to bridge the knowledge gap between industry, universities and academic research and not a once-off alliance. As CBL celebrates its 50th anniversary aligned to the theme of Fifty Years of Caring we believe this occasion is fitting to showcase our continued journey with the university as Sri Lankas one of the largest conglomerates in supporting future research and trends.
Isuru Bandara, President of the Association of Food Science and Technology, Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Sri Jpura noted, We have the theoretical knowledge but not the practical knowledge. Munchee has been extremely supportive as the main sponsor and a huge motivation for us.
Shyama Rajapaksha, Quality Assurance Manager, CBL engaged the audience with an interesting presentation highlighting the companys immense expertise and implementation of rigid international quality assurance standards aligned to the food industry.

No Confidence in Mahindas JO
Parliament yesterday reinforced the confidence on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe defeating the Joint Opposition (JO) sponsored No-Confidence Motion against him with a comfortable majority.
At the end of a 12-hour marathon debate, the Premier clinched the vote by a majority of 46 votes with 122 MPs voting against the No-Confidence motion and 76 voting for it at a division taken by name.
The division was called by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The Government members vigorously thumped their desks to express their pleasure as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced the final results at around 10 PM with 16 SLFP MPs voting in favour, while 25 SLFP members were absent at the time of the voting
Contrary to the entrenched position taken by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that the SLFP/UPFA MPs would vote in support of the motion as a single body many members were absent for the debate and during the voting time indicating a clear divide in the SLFP ranks.
Altogether 26 Parliamentarians were absent during the time of the vote including UNF member Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera. Sixteen SLFP MPs in the government voted in favour of the motion
The entirety of the United National Front MPs voted against the motion with the sole exception of the Ven Athuraliye Rathana Thera who was absent.
During a press briefing earlier in the day Ven.Rathana Thera said he had decided to abstain.
UNP member, former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who was stripped of his ministerial portfolio recently also voted against the motion.
The Joint Opposition which was banking on 27 UNP MPs to turn renegade was in for a huge disappointment with all of them throwing in their lot with the Premier.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and Wasantha Senanayake addressing a press briefing earlier in the day stated that they would throw their weight behind the Prime Minister though they were poised to support the Joint Opposition sponsored No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, owing to differences
The JO move to oust Premier Wickremesinghe was dealt a further blow when state minister A.H.M.Fowzie announced just ahead of the debate in Parliament kicking off, that President Maithripala Sirisenas party would abstain during the crucial night time vote. However his position was contradicted by State minister Laksman Yapa Abeywardene
Early in the debate the main opposition Tamil National Alliance, with its 15 seat bloc also announced it would not lend its support to the Joint Opposition motion of no faith against the Premier, pointing to the racist outlook of its signatories and their statements in the House regarding the TNAs participation in the legislative battle.
JO frontliner Udaya Gammanpila virtually acknowledged defeat during the first half of the day, claiming in an interview inside the Parliamentary premises that President Sirisena and the SLFP had let us down.
The minority parties led by Ministers Rauf Hakeem (SLMC), Rishad Bathiudeen (ACMC), Mano Ganesan and P Digambaram (TPA), who are part of the UNF, buttressed their support to the PM by voting against.
The six members of the JVP voted in favour of the motion along with the Joint Opposition MPs.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa turned up as the quorum bell rang and voted for the motion. However, he neither took part in the debate nor entered the main chamber during the entire debate. He left the chamber before the final results were announced.
UPFA MPs Douglas Devananda (EPDP) and Manusha Nanayakkara also voted against. Independent MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathna thera was absent.
The group of the SLFP which voted in favour of the motion included Parliamentarians Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S B Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena, T B Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva did not turn up during the vote but the SLFP group who supported the motion said he was also on the same page with them. However, none of them crossed over to the Opposition benches in Parliament yesterday despite voting in favour of the motion. The UNP members during the course of the debate vowed that they would not allow any SLFP MP who voted in favour of the motion to remain in the Government any longer.Later addressing a media conference several SLFP ministers disputed this position stating that only the President could remove them.
A total of 26 MPs were absent. Among them were Parliamentarians Mahinda Amaraweera, Dr Sarath Amunugama, Nimal Siripala, Duminda Dissanayake, Faiszer Musthapha, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa, Piyasena Gamage, Mohan Lal Grero, Shriyani Wijewickrema, Lakshman Seneviratne, AHM Hisbulla, AHM Fowzie, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Sarathi Dushmantha, Manusha Nanayakkara, Malith Jayathilake, Arumugam Thondaman, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Angajan Ramanathan and notably Kader Masthan who signed the NCM.
The NCM was submitted to the Speaker by the Joint Opposition on March 21 carrying the signatures of 55MPs including four SLFP members in the Government ranks. The defeat of the motion ended 14 days of number game in Parliament during which both the sides of divide clashed head on to secure the simple majority of 113 votes.
This was the 47th NCM in the Sri Lankan Parliaments history and the third against a Prime Minister. Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former Prime Ministers late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1957 and late Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975.
Political analysts were quick to describethis as a set back to the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp who strived hard to win the No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister to mark their presence in the Lankan political arena and thereby creating political history.
This is the third No Confidence Motion against a sitting Prime Minister,the first two being against former Prime Ministers S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Mrs Sirma Bandaranaike. Both those motions were defeated by a comfortable margin. Analysts also point out that such an exercise was necessitated by the Joint Opposition leadership to keep the raucous rank and file in the Joint Opposition intact, fearing that it would go astray owing to the problems facedd by them in selecting office bearers for the newly formed local councils.
The Joint Opposition will now have to re-energise its political strategy after the United National Front emerged unscathed in what is called a political plot to overturn the Peoples mandate of January 8, 2015.

Having come to power on January 8, 2015, the good governance government commenced the process of taking over the Central Bank under the purview of the Prime Minister and a Singaporean national was appointed as the Central Bank Governor.
There is only one Central Bank in the country and it is a known fact that its governor has the power to influence the countrys economy. The Central Bank which is traditionally under the Finance Ministry was taken away from the Finance Ministry and under the Prime Minister and Mahendran was appointed as the Governor knowing that he would not comply with the countrys accepted financial norms. The Prime Minister recommended the appointment of Mahendran and took on the responsibility which he accepted in parliament, said Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena presenting the no-confidence motion on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament yesterday.

Nothing specific against PM - Opposition Leader
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan noted that the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister does not reveal anything specific against the prime minister. The true intentions of the SLPP is shrouded in an environment of prejudice based upon the bond scam.
We cannot fall victim to such acts and allow ourselves to be used to achieve their political objectives,Sampanthan said, adding that in the interest of this country they have to work together in a spirit of cooperation.
With regard to the Central Bank bond scam, consequent to investigations two persons are in custody and a warrant is issued against a third person and investigations are proceeding.no one should be spared and the rule of law should be implemented irrespective of who they are.
The motion of no confidence seeks to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. Statements of actions of a general nature are thought to be used in an attempt to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. The wording of the motion and the timing of the motion are indicative of a pursuit of a political agenda through the motion rather than fixing responsibility with regard to the bond scam. The question must be raised as to why the wording is so weak lacking in any specific charge against the prime minister pertaining to the band scam per say. Why should this motion be brought now he asked.
The Opposition leader said the wording of the NCM is too loose and too general in nature. It could be that the Prime Minister is facing this situation because of the confidence he placed in someone who betrayed him. Where is the evidence or charge against the Prime Minister of involvement in the bond scam per say Is the wording of the NCM so loose and so general because of the lack of specific material against the Prime Minister in regard to the bond scam If that is so, in my submission the motion lacks credibility.
With regard to the timing of the motion, Sampanthan said that this bond scam occurred three years ago and it has been the subject of public focus for a long time and why has this NCM brought against the PM only now

Motion does not reveal anything specific against PM - Opposition Leader
Corruption is the worst disease that has afflicted our country and it needs to be eradicated. The roots of corruption must be eradicated. Politicians probably constitute the roots of corruption and that needs to be addressed and eradicated. Any complaint of corruption should be investigated and those found guilty should be punished.
There can be no compromise whatsoever, said the Leader of the Opposition, R.Sampanthan.
He said this in parliament yesterday joining the debate on the no confidence motion brought in against the Prime Minister.
With regard to the Central Bank bond scam, consequent to investigations two persons are in custody and a warrant is issued against a third person and investigations are proceeding.no one should be spared and the rule of law should be implemented irrespective of who they are.
The motion of no confidence seeks to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. Statements of actions of a general nature are thought to be used in an attempt to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. The wording of the motion and the timing of the motion are indicative of a pursuit of a political agenda through the motion rather than fixing responsibility with regard to the bond scam. The question must be raised as to why the wording is so weak lacking in any specific charge against the prime minister pertaining to the band scam per say.

Where is the evidence or charge against the Prime Minister of involvement in the bond scam per say Is the wording of the NCM so loose and so general because of the lack of specific material against the Prime Minister in regard to the bond scam If that is so, in my submission the motion lacks credibility.
With regard to the timing of the motion, Sampanthan said that this bond scam occurred three years ago and it has been the subject of public focus for a long time and why has this NCM brought against the PM only now
This, he said is a plan to bring down, totally and completely, the present government.
Noting that the SLPP had done better than the SLFP, UPFA, UNF or the UNP, he said it was the result of the dismal performance of the government during the first half of their term.
However if the government performs better during the remaining 2  years public opinion can change. Unfortunately, the SLPP does not want that to happen. They want to first defeat the PM and their next target will be the president and they want the government brought down. We want the government to implement the mandate given to it by the country in January and August 2015. In these circumstances, how can we support the no confidence motion
With regard to the bond scam, Sampanthan noted that the motion does not reveal anything specific against the prime minister. The true intentions of the SLPP is shrouded in an environment of prejudice based upon the bond scam. We cannot fall victim to such acts and allow ourselves to be used to achieve their political objectives, he said, adding that in the interest of this country they have to work together in a spirit of cooperation.

The Central Bank which is traditionally under the Finance Ministry was taken away from the Finance Ministry and under the Prime Minister and Mahendran was appointed as the Governor knowing that he would not comply with the countrys accepted financial norms. The Prime Minister recommended the appointment of Mahendran and took on the responsibility which he accepted in parliament, said Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena presenting the no-confidence motion on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament yesterday.
Parliamentarians representing the Joint Opposition handed over the no-confidence motion, signed by 55 MPs including 4 from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), to the Speaker on March 21, and was taken up for debate yesterday.
Gunawardena noted that by appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor, the faith in the countrys foremost financial institution has been lost.
He said it was a conflict of interest to appoint Mahendran who had close ties with Perpetual Treasuries.
Those responsible cannot escape from their responsibility. Because of this incident, the Finance Minister had to resign from his post.
Those responsible cannot be made innocent. Gunawardena alleged that while Mahendran is wanted by the local courts, but many of the government ministers meet him in Singapore but have not assisted in bringing him back to Sri Lanka.
NCM, a sinister plan to grab power - Navin
The no confidence motion is a sinister islandwide politically motivated plan, not aimed at just the prime minister, but the whole government, said Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake, during the debate on the no confidence motion against the prime minister.
He said a certain SLFP member from the central province had said that the plan was to remove the prime minister and bring in a puppet that they can kick out at any chosen time, to bring in a prime minister of their choice. If there is an issue within the UNP then we should have the opportunity to resolve it ourselves and others trying to remove our partys leader through the NCM is a totally un-democratic exercise. I look at that whole process in repugnance. It is an aberration of parliamentary democracies because the issue of the UNP leadership and this particular NCM should not be conflicted or there should be no relationship between the two issues.
He firmly noted that the United National Front group will stand united in defeating the NCM. He said the parties that have initiated this NCM are those who have cases against them or who are facing serious charges. This is clearly evident. They have brought this NCM as a solution to their problems with the hope that by destabilising the government, they could escape from the charges they face.
Dissanayake questioned as to how anyone who supports or approves of this NCM could remain within the government with a clear conscience. If you look at the substance of the no confidence motion, and the various allegations, it is clearly ridiculous.The allegations have not been even researched and its a joke. Nowhere in the bond report does it implicate the Prime Minister. They have not even read the report properly prior to bringing in the NCM. This is the most ridiculous wordings for an NCM that I have ever seen and its an insult to our intelligence. I am sure the victory of the government will be assured when the votes are counted and I am sure the future course of action that has to be rectified through the prime minister will be done.
JO tainting the self-esteem of Muslim community -Hakeem
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem condemned Joint Opposition for politicising and taking liberties with the pain and shock experienced by the Muslim community from the Kandy incident. Such an attempt taints the self-esteem of the Muslim community, Minister Hakeem pointed out.
The JO is shamelessly trying to exploit the Kandy incident for its own political ends, Minister Hakeem also said. They are trying to snatch Muslim MPs from our parties.
They are using it as a reason to propose a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.They are trying to take fun in using our sorrows. This is outrageous. Minister Hakeem pointed out.
Minister Hakeem also noted that the no confidence motion (NCM) strengthens the present government. He also said that the NCM is only the tip of the iceberg of a larger political conspiracy against the government.
Agreeing with Minister Kiriella, Minister Hakeem said that this NCM has lost its momentum right from the beginning.Minister Hakeem while stating that there are issues that need to be resolved, urged the government to establish the rule of law without protecting culprits.
Hakeem also noted that the NMC against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seems an attempt to remove him from the 2020 Presidential Election race. The SLMC stands with the Prime Minister against the motion and it considers the motion is an attack on the government. The Prime Minister is only a symbol.
They just want to damage the government, he added.
NCM reduced to a joke - Sumanthiran
A no-confidence motion on a Prime Minister in any parliament is a very serious matter. This is the first step in the assault against the government of national unity that has the popular peoples mandate. Perhaps the second would be aimed at the Speakers Chair and the third at impeaching the President himself. Now that design goes against the mandate of the people of this country from all parts and all communities granted mainly to the two main parties of this country, said TNA  MP M.A. Sumanthiran, during the parliamentary debate on the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister yesterday.
Nobody moves a no-confidence motion on a Prime Minister on trivial issues and therefore this debate has to be conducted in a manner that requires the seriousness. It is a matter of regret that the very members who signed the motion has now reduced it to a joke. They themselves present the motion and not even halfway through the debate we find that they have conceded that they cannot pass the motion and they are reducing the debate and the Parliament to a joke, he noted.
Sumanthiran said that when they participate in this debate it was their intention to constructively engage with the issues that have been raised. It is a fact that none of us want to allow corruption to continue in this country. None of us want to allow corruption to continue in this country. This Government has received a mandate in particular from the people to fight corruption. In the January 2015 Presidential election, that was one of the key issues on which people selected a common candidate to fight corruption. There were very serious issues that this country had to face and there were key issues that had to be addressed, resolved and the direction of the country needed to be changed. Persons from varied different political backgrounds joined hands in this exercise. All of us having realised that the direction that the country was taking must be changed, took that decision and a common candidate was agreed upon.
Thereafter, he said the General elections led to the formation of the national unity government. Unfortunately, he said some who were elected from the UPFA decided to go against that mandate and left the Government of national unity that was formed by the leaders of the two parties and chose to sit in the opposition. It was the first challenge posed to the national unity government and the direction the country had to continue in. Today that group of MPs who worked against the mandate received has preferred a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister, he said.
Six SLPP politicians behind Kandy incidents - Kiriella
The police was in possession of information on outsiders flocking into Kandy two days prior to Digana incident, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday alleged. Minister Kiriella also said that he himself telephoned the police informing them about the situation and requested them to be vigilant.
Minister Kiriella also said six Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna politicians are behind the recent tense situation in Kandy. Among them, there are two SLPP parliamentarians as well, he pointed out.
We do accept that there have been lapses from the part of police with regards to this incident. The police had already received information on outsiders coming to Kandy in groups. But the police did not act on these. Some police stations were very much dedicated in curbing the situation, whereas, some were inactive. Minister Kiriella said. Minister Kiriella further said that three of the said Pohottuwa supporters have already being arrested and an investigation is in progress on the rest.
Meanwhile, Minister Kiriella speaking on MP Dinesh Gunawardenas speech on the no confidence motion, he pointed out that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has always intended for a corruption free government.
Both times when PM Wickremesinghe took office, he appointed an MP from the Opposition as the COPE Chairman. In 2002 it was late Jeyaraj Fernandopullei and it is Sunil Handunnetti of the JVP at present. He also established oversight committees and appointed MPs from the Opposition and the ruling party. He did all these to suggest that the government has nothing to hide. Minister Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella pointed out that the accusation against PM Wickremesinghe on appointing Arjun Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank is groundless. Both investigations conducted on the Treasury bond issue have cleared PM Wickremesinghe upon his involvement in the matter.
The Presidential Commission investigating into the Treasury bond issue has clearly stated that the appointment of Arjun Mahendran by PM Wickremesinghe to be legal. PM Wickremesinghe volunteered to give evidence before this commission. Which Prime Minister, which minister have done this ever before Minister Kiriella questioned.
President, PM must establish common agreement - Ven. Rathana Thera
Independent MP Ven.Athuraliye Rathana thera yesterday urged for a one year joint agreement between the government and all the opposition parties to establish political stability in the country.
Ven.Rathana thera said he has already forwarded a list of proposals including what the government should and should not be doing during that time period. He requested all political parties to stand together to find a collective solution to the matters faced by the country.
Ven.Rathana thera also said that he cannot vote in favour of the government at the no confidence motion vote, despite having the same criticisms he once had against the supporters of the Joint Opposition.
This situation has caused a serious political instability in the country. Not only the government but the Opposition also should take the responsibility and move towards a common agreement. We should not allow this country from going towards anarchism. I have forwarded a proposal to both President and the Prime Minister explaining how to establish a common agreement between all the political parties and work for a common goal during a time span of one year. Rathana thero said.
According to Rathana Thero the proposals include matters with regards to the policies on selling state resources, free trade agreements, endangering Sri Lanka security forces, land related laws, executive presidency and more. Rathana thero was also critical of the governments inefficiency in dealing with the farmers issues on fertilizer supply.
Now this government is trying to turn back several good efforts made for the betterment of the public. For example, now some politicians are trying to relax the ban on Glyphosate in fear of the international mafia. We cannot allow that. We need to understand we have failed our people. So it is important that we come to this joint agreement and work for a common goal. Ven.Rathana thera further said.
Hundreds of NCMs could have been presented against MR - Kabir
Hundreds of No Confidence Motions could have been presented against Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa considering the appointments he made while in office, Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
Minister Hashim, who rose to speak immediately after Minister Susil Premajayanthas controversial speech, was critical of him for justifying the No Confidence Motion based on the Prime Ministers appointment of Arjun Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank.
Minister Premajayantha is saying that the NCM was brought in because the Premier appointed Arjun Mahendran. If that is the case, hundreds of NCMs could have been brought against Mahinda Rajapaksa. Who appointed Lalith Weeratunga and P.B.Jayasundara Minister Hashim questioned.
Minister Hashim also said that they consider the no confidence motion as a conspiracy against the government. He pointed out that the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and MPs of the ruling party have a responsibility to defeat the NCM. I wonder whether Minister Susil Premajayantha comprehended the fact that this no confidence motion is against him as well. he said.
Minister Hashim, referring to the new government as a newly made bed with a fresh mattress and a pillow said that they still could not get rid of the spiders, mosquitoes and bed bugs associated with this bed. We shall soon get rid of these bugs after bringing in the anti-corruption high court. he added.
He also said the NCM was a result of certain persons who received ministerial posts without any contribution backed by the said bed bugs.
Is there anything worth in this NCM Is it even ethical What is the rationale behind it Minister Hashim questioned.
Lets look at the list of people who signed this NCM. There are persons who have pick-pocketed beggars, persons who killed journalists like Lasantha and Ekneligoda in broad daylight, individuals who spoke of a bag full of gems given by Daisy Aachchi, persons who killed policemen and Buddhist monks in the Eastern Province and persons who killed Thajudeen. Minister Hashim said.
Minister Hashim also noted that this No Confidence Motion is brought against a Prime Minister who volunteered to give evidence before the Presidential Commission of inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
We established a new political culture. Several government ministers also went and gave evidence before the Commission. But there are people here who said they were bitten by a snake when asked to appear before the court. They had no backbone. They had things to hide. That is why they dodged the court, Minister Hashim further said.
NCM, an attempt to destabilise Govt.- Patali
Through this No-Confidence Motion (NCM) certain parties are attempting to destabilise the government and make way for an early election and this is a political bomb, JHU General Secretary Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Joining the debate on the NCM against the Prime Minister, he said the government had taken serious measures with regard to the Central Bank Bond issue.
We took every possible legal action and conducted an inquiry by appointing a Presidential Commission and released the report with regard to the Central Bank Bond issue. We have also taken measures to punish certain offenders through the Bribery Commission and under the misappropriation of funds. Irrespective of their positions, we will continue to enforce the law and take legal action against anyone who commits such offences,Minister Ranawaka said.
The minister noted that still there are many perpetrators who have committed crimes similar to the Bond issue who are gone scot-free.He said in a country that imprisons people who steal 12 coconuts,we have failed to punish persons who have allegedly stolen Rs.12,000 million of EPF monies through entrust. They only had to serve a day behind bars. There are 1,700 such incidents that needs to be investigated.
He said the government has the responsibility of making laws to deal with and punish anyone who commits such embezzlements of state funds in the future, just as those who have done so in the past should also be punished.
Minister Ranawaka said that if the special Judicature Act is passed with a 2/3rd majority, the first thing that would be done is to investigate the Bond issue and punish those found guilty. No other government in the past has ever been so open and transparent.
He said that the motive in bringing in this NCM was to get the SLFP members within the government to leave the Unity Government and strengthen the SLFP.
JVP faithful to the peoples mandate - Bimal
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake joining in the debate of No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister said they voted in favour of the motion to be faithful to the peoples mandate they received to act against all rogues irrespective whether they belong to the green camp or blue camp.
The MP was deeply critical of the President in his speech that he said the biggest betrayal of the peoples mandate was from President Sirisena. He covered up rogues to the same extent as PM did. The President had received 34 reports of the PRECIFAC long before the Bond Commission report. Some of the PRECIFAC reports came as early as September 2015. What did the President do with them he questioned.
He went on to say that the President was behind the NCM against the PM. The NCM actually has 56 signs with that of the Presidents. The Bond scam occurred three years ago and it is a long time since the COPE report came out. But Mahinda camp did not bring in any NCM. The NCM came soon after the February 10 LG polls. The reason was that the President wanted to pass the responsibility of the election defeat to the UNP. He asked the PM to step down and then tried to oust him by getting the support of 113MPs even including those who are highly corrupted. When all those attempts failed, the NCM was presented with the help of some JO MPs supportive of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he stated.
Former President Rajapaksa had no real interest on the NCM. He did not even sign it. Some JO front runners were touring in Italy when the NCM had been presented. The JOs interest to the NCM was lesser than their interest to secure the ruling power of a local council. Not a single cut-out or banner by the SLPP. The number of JO MPs who were present when the NCM was moved showed their lackluster attitude to the NCM. The biggest deal in our country today is the deal between the PM and former President Rajapaksa. The PM clearly protects the Rajapaksa family members. A lot of young UNP MPs came to Parliament with hopes of taking a hard line on corruption, Wickremesinghe even betrayed them, he said.
Only President can remove SLFPers from Govt. - SLFP Ministers
The Prime Minister or the UNP has no authority to oust the SLFP ministers from the government despite their claims that if the SLFP ministers vote in favour of the No Confidence Motion, they would be removed from the government. This government comprises of both parties, but the President is the head of the government. The Prime Minister can remove any UNP member, but he has absolutely no authority over the SLFP ministers, said a group of SLFP ministers yesterday.
The SLFP has firmly decided to support the NCM, but some are working against it and they dont even have the strength to come forward and openly disclose their stand, said a group of SLFP members during a special media briefing held at the parliament committee room yesterday.
Prior to the no confidence vote being taken, 14 SLFP members addressing a press briefing said that the UNP has no authority to oust them from the government as the President is the head of the government and not the Prime Minister.
Only the President has the power to remove anyone from the government and not the prime minister, Minister John Seneviratne said.
They said that the SLFP had unanimously made a decision to support the No Confidence Motion.
The unanimous stance of the SLFP is that the Prime Minister should resign from his post. All 41 of the SLFP ministers decided and if anyone within the party acts outside of that decision, then they are betraying the party, Minister Dilan Perera said.
They said that the SLFP group had met at Minister Mahinda Amaraweeras residence last morning including the SLFP and UPFA General Secretaries and had unanimously decided to support the NCM. The two General Secretaries had notified this decision to the President. This is not something we did secretly and we expressed our stand openly, Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Responding to media queries as to why Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was not present in Parliament, they said that he was expected to attend the vote, but in the event he does not attend the vote, he would make a separate statement the next day. However, this group of ministers assured that he too was supportive of the NCM.
The UNP leader can decide on who he appoints from that party as ministers, deputy ministers or so on. But it is the countrys President who decides on the SLFP ministers or deputies and their appointment or removal. This is a presidential governing system and he is the head of the cabinet. The Prime Minister is just another member of the Cabinet. Only the President has the power to remove anyone from the Cabinet.
The UNP had only 106 seats and although 113 seats were required to establish a government, no party had that number of seats. That was why the President formed this government. It is true that they brought in the President, but after he became the party leader, he is the leader of the SLFP. However, the President decided to form this Unity Government and it is only he who has the authority to decide on our fate, and not the PM, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Premajayantha for a single party Government
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha in a tirade against the Government yesterday in Parliament threw a challenge to form a single party Government if possible following their defection.
He made this comment joining in the debate of No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, where he spoke for about half an hour receiving cheers of the Joint Opposition MPs and jeers of the UNP backbenchers.
Premajayantha was critical of the Presidents act of removing him from the post of UPFA General Secretary with a few days to go for the Parliamentary Elections in 2015.
Had the President not sacked the UPFA and SLFP General Secretaries before August 2015 elections, the results could have been different and you would not have made it to the Government. The President himself admitted so, he told the UNP members.
The August 2015 election result was misrepresented. The Bond issue happened as a result of that. The last Local Government polls reflected the real mandate of the people. If you apply its results to that of a General Election, the SLPP would have received 102 seats, the UNP 65 and the SLFP 30. The SLFPs dissenting MPs will support to form a broad alliance to represent the real mandate of the people as reflected in the last Local Government polls. The people will aptly respond to you in the near future, he added stating that he was no craving for ministerial positions.
The minister, hitting hard at the Government and the Prime Minister over the Bond issue and protecting former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, argued that the SLFP members could not take any responsibility for the Bond transaction as it happened during the period of 100-day interim Government.
We pinpointed the faults of the Government, but our voices were subdued in the Cabinet. We can no longer continue in it if the same mistakes are repeated. I received 175,000 votes and I am bound to safe guard the mandate given to me, he stated.
The minister also vowed to hamper the attempts to bring in a new Constitution, stating it was aimed at dividing the country. He said the UPFA election manifesto at nowhere said that it would bring in a new Constitution. I made the final draft of the manifesto and I know its content than any of you, he said.
Premajayantha went on to say that when the SLFPs old hands such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, Anura Yapa, Dilan Perera and himself leave the Government, there would not be a Unity Government anymore, adding that the SLFP General Secretary alone cannot represent the SLFP.
The minister pointed out the officers of Taisei Company, to whom the Government had offered the contract of Phase 3 of the Central Expressway project, have been imprisoned in Japan. This was not said by me but the President. You offered contracts for those who serve jail sentence, he added.
Premajayantha stating that he had never robbed public money, asked to check his bank accounts if there is any doubt. I live in my old house and I built it by obtaining a loan. I have no other properties, he added.
No Confidence Motion a politically motivated one - Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said that they are in favour of the No Confidence Motion despite that it is a politically motivated one that will rejuvenate Rajapaksa camp.
Quoting the Police report on suspects involved in the recent unrest in Kandy, Dissanayake said that there are six politicians representing Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) who are directly involved with the unrest.
Dissanayake also held the government responsible for allowing racism to escalate into clashes among the community.
One SLPP Local Government Councilor Thennegedara Gamini Rajapaksa is accused of been involved in the clashes at Kandy and for the shooting incident at the Menikhinna mosque.
Then there is another SLPP LG Councilor Kumara Mohottilage Samantha Perera who was arrested for the same reason. A. Samantha who is another SLPP supporter is being sought by the police for involving in an incident at Digana. One Deepthi, another SLPP supporter who competed in the LG election, is sought out by the police for attacking Muslim owned shops at Pallekele. Then there are two SLPP LG councillors, who are Buddhist monks who are allegedly involved in attacking a Mosque in Digana, MP Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake also held the government responsible for forgetting its mandate and letting the public down.
Speaking further, Dissanayake said, Our standpoint on this motions vote is being questioned by many. Some even and made phone calls and asked whether our vote for the motion against the Prime Minister would not make us complicit for the crime of strengthening the hands of Rajapaksa camp. Some others demanded to know from us if we would vote against the motion by backing the Prime Ministers camp and wouldnt it amount to approving the Bond issue.
We took a decision to vote for the motion against the Prime Minister. We took that decision after considering the current political situation and its dynamicsM,MP Dissanayake said.
This motion is against corruption and racism. The JVP is always against corruption and racism. From that perspective, too the JVP has made the right decision, he said.

PM introduces concept paper on Monetary Law Act amendments
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this week submitting his final Cabinet Paper as the Minister in charge of the Central Bank, introduced a concept paper on the amendments needed to the Monetary Law Act in keeping with the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Bond issue and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the IMF.
The Central Bank now functions under Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Cabinet approval was sort to, To improve governance of the Central Bank, to strengthen Central Bank independence and facilitate the adoption of Flexible Inflation Targeting as the monetary policy framework in order to ensure sustained price stability in Sri Lanka and to strengthen financial sector oversight.
This would thus require amendments to Monetary Law Act No 58 of 1949 in line with international best practices in central banking.
Cabinet approval was granted to prepare a comprehensive draft of the amendments with the technical assistance from the IMF and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for the approval by end of 2018.
As proposed by the Bond Commission, the PM has proposed that amendments seek to subject the appointment and the removal of the Governor of the Central Bank to a constitutional process. In addition amendments will introduce codes of conduct for the Governor, members of the Monetary Board, senior management and all other officers of the Central Bank with appropriate approval authorities and review processes for such codes.
Further the corporate governance principles applicable to the position of the Governor, members of the Monetary Board and senior management of the Bank including fitness and propriety of such persons to hold position in the Bank, enhanced disqualification criteria based on such fitness and propriety, management of conflict of interests and disclosure of interests in transactions with the bank, etc.. will be introduced.
Amendments will also be introduced to strengthen Central Bank independence and facilitate the adoption of flexible inflation targeting as the Monetary Policy framework to ensure sustained price stability.
The Prime Minister further asked that the prime objective of the Central Bank be price stability while financial system stability could be recognized as its core objective.
To introduce transparency into the Monetary Policy formulation process, the workings of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which recommends monetary policy stance to the Monetary Board has been looked into.
Accordingly, the PM pointed out that this approach was not keeping with international practices and it also suffered from a serious shortcoming; that the members of the Monetary Board are detached from detailed internal policy deliberations at early stages of the monetary policy formulation.
He proposed to strengthen MPC and to establish the Governor, Deputy Governors and appointed external members as well as international members as deemed necessary as member members of the MPC. Further the voting right of the Secretary to the Treasury be removed to address conflict of interest in monetary policy decisions.
Amendments have also been proposed to define the authority to set inflation targets, the agreed time horizon to achieve stipulated targets, reporting requirements with regard to the performance of achieving inflation targets and possible deviations, public communication and the accountability procedures in case of missed targets.
The paper finally also asked to introduce a broader legal framework to the Monetary Law Act that facilitates macro prudential surveillance while strengthening the Central Banks powers on regulation and supervision of financial institutions.

PM resolute on reforms, transitional justice - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday in Parliament pledged to show clear progress on Constitutional reforms and the transitional justice process within this year. Taking part in the debate of
the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday, Samaraweera said Wickremesinghe personally gave leadership to Constitutional reforms and transitional justice process with vigour and dedication.
The initial drafts of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) are now with the Prime Minister. We will present them to the Cabinet and Parliament this year. The legislation pertaining to the Reparation Unit is also being finalized now. The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has been established and our Ministry allocated Rs 1.3 billion to operationalise it, the minister said.
The minister, observing that PM Wickremesinghe gave leadership to Constitutional reforms following the setting up of Constitutional Assembly on January 8, 2016, made an appeal to him to expedite the process and table the draft Constitutional Bill as early as possible this year.
Commenting on the content of the NCM of the Joint Opposition, the minister said new laws would be brought in soon to take over the frozen Perpetual Treasuries assets to the State. We will not let the bond issue cause any loss to the Government. Unlike in this case, nobody has been held accountable for the Trillions of Rupees that had gone missing when Ajith Nivard Cabraal was the Central Bank Governor and when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Finance Minister, he stressed.
Soon after the August 2015 election, Wickremesinghe told Malik Samarawickrama and me that the JVP MPs must be appointed as Chairmen of Parliamentary Watchdog Committees. Had we come to power with the intent of cheating public money, this would not have been done, the minister commented stating that the NCM was an attempt to drive the country backwards.
The minister at the onset of his speech reminded how posters were pasted all over the country ahead of the Presidential Elections in 1999 carrying the slogan Ranilta be (Ranil cant). We did this poster campaign knowing that the biggest challenge to our candidate Chandrika Kumaratunga was Ranil Wickremesinghe. If we actually believed that he cant we would not have had to spend millions of Rupees for such a poster campaign. Now about 20 years down the line, an NCM has been presented against him because he is the biggest political challenge for the Opposition, he added.
The minister said the NCM was the first step of a sinister political conspiracy, adding that it has been a flop even from the start. The minister also reminded the House how PM Wickremesinghe was selfless in agreeing to make Maithripala Sirisena the common candidate at the January 8, 2015 elections. Becoming a Presidential Candidate from either of the two main parties is a significant gain. This was said to me by none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa prior to the 2005 Presidential polls. He was referring to the money one receives from various donors when contesting the Presidential elections. Win or lose the elections, you will still be a winner, he told me, Samaraweera recollected quoting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

PM says Thank You
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe having defeated the No Confidence Motion brought against him by the Joint Opposition led group, thanked all those who stood by him with unwavering faith and support and vowed that during the next year the government will carry its development endeavours that would be felt by the country.
Addressing the UNP and other parties that supported him during the NCM, at the Committee Room in Parliament, the Prime Minister said, We need to empower our ministers and MPs by providing them the power and assistance in order to carry out their duties.
We did not face this NCM to protect an individual but to protect the government and the peoples right,the Premier said.
He said that he intends to create a complete change within the party and will bring out new groups and that they must strengthen the UNF even further. We must win the cooperation of the majority of the people and move forward. I have faith that within the next year, we will be able to accomplish the targets we have set out to achieve. There are drawbacks and shortcomings but this government has a responsibility to fulfil the promises made to the people in January 2015, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister noted that some factions have distanced themselves from the party,but he said they intend to forge forward with those groups that are with the party.
I will be meeting the President today (05) and we will protect the victory of the party and proceed while protecting the core values of the party, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

Recreating iconic  song with a modern twist
Among all iconic Salman Khan songs, his fans consider Oh Oh Jane Jaana the best till date because they could see him shirtless for the first time.
The song was a rage at that time, so much that boys got obsessed to guitars and tried to recreate the song by going shirtless, wearing only ripped jeans. But of course, nobody could ever match Salman himself.
Now the much-loved song is all set to get a modern twist in Time To Dance. The actor will dance on the song in a special appearance with Isabelle Kaif, who plays a competitive ballroom and Latin dancer, and Hero actor Sooraj Pancholi, a street dancer in the movie.
The original song was composed by musical duo Jatin-Lalit. Produced by Bhushan Kumar and Remo DSouza, it is a dance-based film with a love story woven in, featuring a range of styles, from Salsa, Zumba and Bachata to a mix of ballroom dancing like Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot and Quickstep. There will also be Latin dance forms like Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso Doble and Jive.

ROYAL INVITEES!
The royal wedding is in just two months, and is set to be one of the most famous events of 2018 - but who exactly will be attending Windsor Castle in May
Without a shadow of doubt, Britains Prince Harrys wedding to Meghan Markle will be one of the major news events of the year  but whos going to be on the guest list
The forthcoming royal nuptials are sure to be a star-studded affair, with the couple boasting a host of high-profile pals. Heres what we know so far about who could be attending the big day.
The couple released their official engagement photos shortly before Christmas
The couple have been keeping tight lipped about the guest list  so beyond knowing that the likes of The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William will be invited, there havent been many confirmed names.
The invitations were printed on March 22, suggesting that the guest list has now been finalised.
One thing seems certain, though  there wont be as many wedding guests as when Harrys big brother tied the knot in 2011.
This is because Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests  St Georges chapel, Harry and Meghans venue, has a capacity of 800 people.
They will also invite 2,640 members of the public on the day including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities.
Around 600 people have been invited to the actual service which takes place at St Georges Chapel on May 19.
Kate and Wills had their fair share of celebrity guests, such as the Beckhams, Sir Elton John and the late Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.
Also likely to be on Harrys invite list are Tom Inskip and Guy Pelley. Harry may also want to invite Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan.
According to the Daily Star, Meghans older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, will not be invited on the big day.
Her nephew, Thomas Jrs son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list.
Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, is said to be attending as is her father, Thomas Markle Sr.
The shy 73-year-old, who lives a reclusive life in Mexico, is rumoured to be walking Meghan down the aisle.
This is despite reports that he is extremely shy and shuns the limelight, but is said to be willing to persevere as he and Meghan have a close relationship.
Princess Diana with Prince Harry.
While we previously revealed that a fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelseas Millie Mackintosh could be among Meghans bridesmaids.
Protocol normally means that royal brides only have adult bridesmaids, although Kates sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule.
At the very least, wed expect to see a few of Meghans mates as guests at the wedding  as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, whos thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.
Its inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals, as well as significant political figures from across the Commonwealth.
And with an American marrying into the British royal family for the first time, there has been speculation over whether Donald Trump will receive an invite.
One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harrys guests during his special Radio 4 appearance  and he wants a starring role.
It has also been reported that two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.
The Sun has revealed that Elton John would be attending the Royal wedding.
The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the Royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.
The singer was a close friend of Harrys mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.
It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Dianas funeral in 1997.
Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.
Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.
Mel sternly said: Im not saying any more, but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.
As the audience clapped Mel laughed and said: Im going to be fired!
It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.
The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Barack Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.
But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sunk to their lowest ebb since his election last year.
And it seems they have had a rethink, as a source told the Daily Mail: President Trump will not be invited because the wedding will be for friends and family only.
It wont be a state occasion. If Mr Obama was invited, the invitation could look like a snub to Mr Trump, and His Royal Highness would not wish to cause a diplomatic row.
The Sun revealed that the Government was urging the prince not to invite the Obamas, at risk of worsening tensions with the current administration.
The prince was quizzed on the possibility of inviting the Obamas when he guest-edited BBC Radio 4s Today programme just after Christmas.
However, he refused to be drawn on the matter, insisting: I dont know about that, we havent even put the invites or the guest list together yet.

S.Africa heaps praise on heroine Winnie Mandela
SOUTH AFRICA: South Africa on Tuesday paid emotional tributes to Winnie Mandela, who died aged 81, as politicians hailed her as an inspirational anti-apartheid campaigner and defended her often controversial record.
The former wife of Nelson Mandela died in a Johannesburg hospital on Monday, mourned by many who praised her as one of the most charismatic and energetic activists who fought white-minority rule.
Her convictions for kidnapping and fraud, and her reputation for overseeing brutal gang violence in black townships, were largely brushed aside by eulogies of her bravery, independence and integrity.
President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed a memorial service on April 11 and an official funeral on April 14 in honour of a patriot and citizen who served our nation and humanity at large with distinction during our liberation struggle.
He said the funeral would include military ceremonial honours and he ordered national flags to be flown at half-mast during a period of official mourning until after her burial.
Zweli Mkhize, a senior minister in the African National Congress (ANC) party government, said Winnie Mandela's death marked the end of an era as she was a leading stalwart from the darkest days of the anti-apartheid campaign. The outspoken leader of the radical opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party Julius Malema, who became a confidant of Winnie Mandela in recent years, was also among mourners at her modest two-storey red brick home on Tuesday.
Because (she) was living among her people, and never betrayed her people, they gave her the title of the Mother of the nation,' he said.
We are here to celebrate the life of a person who has never looked down on black people and the poor masses.- AFP

Skin sans scars


Scars often have interesting stories to tell but some can also make you self-conscious enough to want to do away with them. However the hard truth is that no over-the-counter medications will be effective in permanently deep-seated scarring. Give these homemade skin care products to fade those blisters faster.
Defining scars 
A scar is an area of fibrous tissue that replaces normal skin after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of wound repair in the skin, as well as in other organs and tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing process.

Types of scars Hypertrophic scars 
These scars are more common in the young, following burns and in people with darker skin. These scars are usually red, thick and elevated and can be itchy or painful, but their growth is confined within the boundaries of the original wound. Hypertrophic scars usually start to develop within weeks after the injury and may improve naturally, although this process can take up to a year or more.

Keloid scars 
Keloids may occur at any age, but tend to develop more readily in younger individuals and in darker-skinned people. These are thick, rounded, irregular clusters of scar tissue that extend beyond the original wound. They often appear red or darker in colour compared with the surrounding skin. Keloids may not develop for many months after injury, and may also worsen during pregnancy.

Atrophic scars 
These scars are generally small, round depressions that lie below the surface of the surrounding skin. They are formed when the healing process is disrupted and insufficient new connective fibers are formed following acne or chickenpox.

Permanent or not 
Although scars are permanent, they can fade over a period of up to two years. After this time, it is unlikely they will fade any more.
Steps to avoid getting
stretch marks
1 Control your weight.
2 Stay hydrated.
3 Eat a nutrient-rich diet.
4 Include vitamin C in your diet.
5. Soak up some vitamin D.
6. Eat food rich in zinc.
7. Treat fresh stretch marks when they appear fast.
Scar removal treatments 
Scar removal treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar. Smaller keloids can be treated using cryotherapy (freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen). You can also prevent keloid formation by using pressure treatment or gel pads with silicone when you are injured.
Before and aftersteps to follow 
In preparation for the surgery, you may be asked to get a physical evaluation and lab testing. Medication may be prescribed or your current medication may be altered.
After the scar is removed, the wound is closed with stitches and wrapped in a light dressing. Avoid sun exposure for several months after the treatment. It may take several months to get your desired results, as the new scar heals and fades. However, the results will be permanent.
Results after treatment 
Different types of scars respond to different plastic surgery techniques. A person considering facial scar revision must understand that there is no way to remove scars completely.
The timing of surgery is another important choice. Some surgeons advise against any scar revision in cases of injury for a period that might extend up to a year after the injury. This interval allows the body enough time to heal fully.
Risks or side effects 
In a small number of cases, your cosmetic specialist may be able to hide the appearance of scarring entirely. However, before you undergo the treatment, you should be aware of the potential side effects of scar revision.

Worse scarring 
In a small number of cases, the scar revision treatment can actually make scarring more visible.

Hyper- or Hypopigmentation 
While not always a risk, hyper- and hypopigmentation can pose as a cosmetic threat, especially to patients with dark skin tones. Hyperpigmentation (temporary or permanent darkening of treated areas of the skin) and hypopigmentation (temporary or permanent lightening of treated areas of the skin) can make your skin appear uneven and make scarred tissue even more noticeable.

Infection 
Infection is most often a risk with surgical scar revision procedures, but potentially a risk for noninvasive procedures as well.
Sessions
How many sessions a person has to undergo for a laser scar removal will depend on how deep or huge his or her scar is. However, the average session count people require before their scar gets completely removed is three to seven sessions. There are instances where you might need more sessions to get the desired results.
Instructions tofollow after the treatment 
r Take pain medication as prescribed in the after care instructions by your doctor. Do not take aspirin or any products containing aspirin.
r Do not drink alcohol for three weeks after the surgery as it can lead to excess blood flow.
r Do not smoke, as smoking delays the stages of healing and increases the risk of complications.
r Start walking as soon as possible, as this helps to reduce swelling and lowers the chance of blood clots.
r Avoid exposing scars to sun for at least 12 months.
Keep incisions clean and inspect daily for signs of infection during the recovery time of the scar surgery.

US-China trade: Beijing responds with tariffs of its own
Trade tensions between China and the US have been ramped up after Beijing responded to US plans for putting new taxes on hundreds of Chinese imports.
China said it would place 25% trade tariffs on 106 US goods, including soybeans, cars and orange juice.
The tit-for-tat action comes hours after Washington detailed about 1,300 Chinese products it intended to hit with tariffs - also set at 25%.
US-targeted items include Chinese-made televisions and motorcycles.
The White House said its proposals were a response to unfair Chinese intellectual property practices.
Stock markets in Europe fell, with investors taken aback by the speed of Chinas response. In New York, the Dow Jones is expected to open about 550 points lower.
Earlier, Beijing said it strongly condemns and firmly opposes the proposed US tariffs, calling them unilateralistic and protectionist, and vowing to retaliate.
The products targeted by the Chinese tariffs were worth $50bn (35.5bn) in 2017, according to the Chinese commerce ministry.
US chemicals, some types of aircraft and corn products are among the goods facing the taxes, the finance ministry said.
Extra tariffs will also be placed on whiskey, cigars and tobacco, some types of beef, lubricants, and propane and other plastic products.
US orange juice, certain sorghum products, cotton and some types of wheat, as well as trucks, some SUVs and certain electric vehicles, will also be subject to the new duties, the ministry added. Economists had previously warned the Trump administrations move to penalise China with the tariffs could prompt Beijing to retaliate and lead to higher prices for US consumers.
The planned US tariffs are the result of an investigation ordered by US President Donald Trump into Chinas intellectual property practices.
Last month, he said the inquiry had found evidence of problems, such as practices that pressure US companies to share technology with Chinese firms
The office of the US Trade Representative, which handles trade negotiations, said that its tariffs would apply to about $50bn of Chinese imports.
That was an amount which was appropriate both in light of the estimated harm to the US economy and to obtain elimination of Chinas harmful acts, policies and practices, it said.
The list includes parts of communication satellites, semiconductors, aviation equipment and brewery machinery, as well as more niche products such as bakery ovens and rocket launchers.
A final list will be determined after a public comment period and review, expected to
last about two months.
Beijing has been adamant that it did not want a trade war, but that it would not not back down under US pressure.
Any attempt to bring China to its knees through threats and intimidation will never succeed, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.
There is no winner in a trade war, and an initiator will harm itself as well as others. BBC News

International Mine Action Day was yesterday:
WAR will be history by 2025
The 2018 International Mine Action Day is a special day for Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT) known as the Ottawa Treaty on December 13, 2017. This will be the first International Mine Action Day that Sri Lanka celebrates as a State Party to the MBT. Sri Lanka may be the first country to accede to the MBT and Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) on March 1, 2018 and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) on February 8, 2016, in a row in three consecutive years not only in the South Asian region but also in the Asian region and perhaps in the world. Last year the MBT celebrated its 20th Anniversary and this year the CCM celebrates its 10th anniversary. Sri Lanka gave fitting birthday gifts with accession to both the Conventions on their 20th and 10th anniversaries.
Five pillars of Sri Lankas National Mine Action Programme
Sri Lanka now as a State Party to the MBT will have several obligations to meet timelines under the Treaty implementation in the country. The National Mine Action Center which comes under the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs coordinates mine-action in Sri Lanka. Mine-action has five pillars which are universal to any mine-action programme in the world. They are; 1) Demining 2); Mine Risk Education;3)Victim Assistance; 4) Stockpile Destruction and 5) Advocacy.
1. Demining
With regard to Demining, Sri Lanka has yet to demine around 23sqkm in the north and east regions and this includes the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Ampara districts. The National Mine Action Center has mentioned that Sri Lanka will be able to achieve mine threat-free status before 2020. We see this as a daunting task in terms of resource availability, political will and other factors. The international mine action communitys global agenda is set fora mine-free world by 2025. If Sri Lanka is able to achieve mine threat-free status before 2020 it will be a remarkable achievement and an example of the mine-action programmes of other mine-affected countries. Currently, Sri Lankas demining work is carried out by the Army Humanitarian Demining Unit, HALO Trust, MAG, DASH and SHARP with the support of the Government and the international donor community.
2. Mine Risk Education (MRE)
There is no doubt that Sri Lanka is at the top of the list in the world with regard to the least number of landmine victims reported in recent years. In 2017, there were only 2 mine-related incidents reported in Sri Lanka which compared to other mine-affected countries with hundreds of casualties reported every month. This is mainly due to the fact that better integrated Mine-Risk Education has been carried out by the local NGOs supported by the UNICEF and the Humanitarian Demining Unit of the Sri Lanka Army. They conducted various mine-risk education activities for people living near mine-affected land areas. Further, the Ministry of Education has incorporated Mine-Risk Education into the school curriculum in schools in the North and East.
3. Victim Assistance (VA)
Victim Assistance is not satisfactory in Sri Lanka. Not only the mine-victims but also the entire disabled communities in Sri Lanka are facing severe difficulties with regard to their socioeconomic and political rights. Even though Sri Lanka ratified the UNCRPD more than two years ago, it is still struggling to have the UNCRPD principles incorporated into local legislation to implement accepted Convention norms and provisions to promote and protect disability rights. This we can further elaborate as justice delayed is justice denied.
4. Stockpile Destruction
Sri Lankas accession to the MBT showed its commitment towards the Treatys obligations and its implementation. Now Sri Lanka as a State Party needs to destroy all stockpiles of landmines in their stocks within four years. Sri Lanka should be able to achieve this target well before the set target of a four-year time period.
5. Advocacy
After several years relentless campaigning, the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) achieved and successfully completed the first phase of its mission. Sri Lanka ratified the UN CRPD in 2016, acceded to the MBT in 2017 and CCM in 2018. The second phase of SLCBL will be closely monitored and supportive of the implementation of the MBT, CCM and UN CRPD in Sri Lanka. The SLCBL vision will be a mine-free, peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka, which fulfils all requirements of the disabled community.
HRH Prince Mired visit to Sri Lanka
The MBT Special Envoy His Royal Highness Prince Mired of Jordan visited Sri Lanka from 5th to 7th March this year. His visit was historical not only for Sri Lanka but also for the South Asian region as it was the Special Envoy to the MBTs first visit to the region. He mentioned in his speech in Colombo that Sri Lanka now stands strongly in the region and should become the universalization ambassador for the Treaty in the region. Prince Mireds visit to Sri Lanka gave a huge boost to Sri Lankas National Mine-Action Programme. He encouraged international donors to support the ongoing mine-action programme in Sri Lanka and he emphasized that Sri Lanka should have a comprehensive victim assistance programme.
The way forward
With the National Mine-Action Strategy (2016-2020) Mid-Term Strategy (will be discussed and finalized soon) Sri Lanka should be able to achieve its set targets well before its deadlines. It is of paramount importance that all the relevant stakeholders (relevant Government institutes, NGOs, INGOs, Donor community and International organizations) need to be consulted before it is finalized. The Corporate sector can be consulted as a new donor for the mine-action programme. The National Mine-Action Programme should become a matter of high priority in the Governments development agenda. The National Mine Action Strategy should be available in local languages of Sinhala and Tamil due to various good reasons.
Under the new Mid-term Mine Action Strategy the SLCBL encourages the GoSL to ratify Protocol (V) of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) on Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) without delay. This will complement the last years accession to the MBT by Sri Lanka. The CCW Protocol (V) is the first multilateral agreement to deal with the range of unexploded and abandoned ordnance (UXO) that regularly threatens civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian workers after the end of an armed conflict. Sri Lanka has already ratified its Protocols I to IV in 2004.
Sri Lanka should be able to host the next available Meeting of the State Parties (MSP) of either MBT or CCM. Sri Lankas mine-action achievements should be shared with other mine-affected nations without delay. Hosting an MSP is one way to invite the international mine- action community to Sri Lanka and share with them its success story.
The SLCBL would like to encourage Sri Lanka to bring back the past glory of being a champion of disarmament at the same time to become a regional hub for disarmament discussions in South Asia. Sri Lanka is yet to accede to the CCW Protocol (V), Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Nuclear Ban Treaty (NBT). Sri Lanka should be the leader of the disarmament in the region and is the only country that has the necessary background to be the leader. This will bring many opportunities for Sri Lanka in terms of political, socio-economic, environmental and other factors.

## Title: Winston Churchill exposed as being a White Supremacist

Winston Churchill exposed as being a White Supremacist
History, Winston Churchill said, will be kind to me, for I intend to write it myself. He neednt have bothered. He was one of the great mass murderers of the 20th century, yet is the only one, unlike Hitler and Stalin, to have escaped historical odium in the West. He has been crowned with a Nobel Prize (for literature, no less), and now, an actor portraying him (Gary Oldman) has been awarded an Oscar.
As Hollywood confirms, Churchills reputation (as what Harold Evans has called the British Lionheart on the ramparts of civilization) rests almost entirely on his stirring rhetoric and his talent for a fine phrase during World War II. We shall not flag nor fail. We shall go on to the end.  We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets.  We shall never surrender. (The revisionist British historian John Charmley dismissed this as sublime nonsense.)
Words, in the end, are all that Churchill admirers can point to. His actions are another matter altogether.
During World War II, Churchill declared himself in favour of terror bombing. He wrote that he wanted absolutely devastating, exterminating attacks by very heavy bombers. Horrors such as the firebombing of Dresden were the result.
In the fight for Irish independence, Churchill, in his capacity as secretary of state for war and air, was one of the few British officials in favor of bombing Irish protesters, suggesting in 1920 that airplanes should use machine-gun fire or bombs to scatter them.
War criminal
Dealing with unrest in Mesopotamia in 1921, as Secretary of State for the colonies, Churchill acted as a war criminal: I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against the uncivilised tribes; it would spread a lively terror. He ordered large-scale bombing of Mesopotamia, with an entire village wiped out in 45 minutes. In Afghanistan, Churchill declared that the Pashtuns needed to recognise the superiority of [the British] race and that all who resist will be killed without quarter. He wrote: We proceeded systematically, village by village, and we destroyed the houses, filled up the wells, blew down the towers, cut down the great shady trees, burned the crops and broke the reservoirs in punitive devastation.  Every tribesman caught was speared or cut down at once.
In Kenya, Churchill either directed or was complicit in policies involving the forced relocation of local people from the fertile highlands to make way for white colonial settlers and the forcing of more than 150,000 people into concentration camps. Rape, castration, lit cigarettes on tender spots, and electric shocks were all used by the British authorities to torture Kenyans under Churchills rule.
But the principal victims of Winston Churchill were the Indians  a beastly people with a beastly religion, as he charmingly called them. He wanted to use chemical weapons in India but was shot down by his Cabinet colleagues, whom he criticized for their squeamishness, declaring that the objections of the India Office to the use of gas against natives are unreasonable.
Churchills beatification as an apostle of freedom seems all the more preposterous given his 1941 declaration that the Atlantic Charters principles would not apply to India and the coloured colonies. He refused to see people of colour as entitled to the same rights as himself. Gandhi-ism and all it stands for, he declared, will, sooner or later, have to be grappled with and finally crushed.
In such matters, Churchill was the most reactionary of Englishmen, with views so extreme they cannot be excused as being reflective of their times. Even his own Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery, confessed that he could see very little difference between Churchills attitude and Adolf Hitlers.
Indian victims
Thanks to Churchill, some 4 million Bengalis starved to death in a 1943 famine. Churchill ordered the diversion of food from starving Indian civilians to well-supplied British soldiers and even to top up European stockpiles in Greece and elsewhere. When reminded of the suffering of his Indian victims, his response was that the famine was their own fault, he said, for breeding like rabbits.
Madhusree Mukerjees searing account of Churchills role in the Bengal famine, Churchills Secret War, documents that while Indians starved, prices for foodgrains were inflated by British purchases and Indias own surplus grains were exported, while Australian ships laden with wheat were not allowed to unload their cargo at Calcutta (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets). Instead, Churchill ordered that grain be shipped to storage depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans to increase the buffer stocks for a possible future invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. European warehouses filled up as Bengalis died.
This weeks Oscar rewards yet another hagiography of this odious man. To the Iraqis whom Churchill advocated gassing, the Greek protesters on the streets of Athens who were mowed down on Churchills orders in 1944, sundry Pashtuns and Irish, as well as to Indians like myself, it will always be a mystery why a few bombastic speeches have been enough to wash the bloodstains off Churchills racist hands.
Many of us will remember Churchill as a war criminal and an enemy of decency and humanity, a blinkered imperialist untroubled by the oppression of non-white peoples. Ultimately, his great failure  his long darkest hour  was his constant effort to deny us freedom.
