Blessing to little hearts in Sri Lanka
Dr. Conal Austin FRCS Paediatric Cardiothoracic Surgeon and John Simpson MD, FRCP, Paediatric Cardiologist, both originally from Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals in London, decided in 2002 that they would like to assist in the development of cardiology and cardiac surgery for needy children in Sri Lanka by making annual visits with a team of 14 medics. Jai Lameer who had undergone cardiac surgery performed on him by Dr. Conal Ausin was the coordinator of the team. Jai passed away in 2011.
But fortunately for the team, Paul Scally, owner of the Gillingham Foot Ball Club, U.K. Whom they had known for several years, came to their rescue and the charity was started with new drive and a new name: "Take heart mercy mission". The Chairman of the Mission is Paul Scally and the Trustees are Dr. Conal Austin and Dr. John Simpson. They have been on such missions for the past 12 years. They have performed 200 heart operations in Sri Lanka. The day after they arrive, they start work early morning and continue working at a stretch for one week. Surgery goes on from 7 am to 12.00 midnight. They are a dedicated and united team.
I became involved in this mission as I came to know Dr. Conal Austin and Dr. John Simpson through the Association of British Residents of which I am a member, having lived and worked in London as a Higher Executive officer in the British Department of Trade and Industry.
During the past five years, I have been visiting Karapitiya Hospital, Galle, to support patients and give them an annual donation and take gift parcels for children undergoing operations.
I stay one night at Light House Hotel, Galle and have Fellowship together with the team and discuss plans for the future regarding how we as Sri Lankans can help them in their mission. After all, their help to Sri Lanka is magnanimous. We, Sri Lankans, should be humbled by what they do and appreciate their work and help them in whatever way we can. They not only perform heart scanning and surgery but also manage a post operative intensive care unit until the operated children are fit and stable enough to be discharged to general wards.
They have also donated to Karapitiya Hospital, Cardiac Scanning and theatre equipment worth millions of rupees during their annual visits. They also fund maintenance and operational cost of theatre and cardiological equipment and educational and training programmes in cardiac surgery and after care. Operations they perform are complicated cases.
Tony Blair when he was Prime Minister of the U.K. presented an award to D Conal Austin for the best charity in Asia. The award was made at a dinner, to which a Sri Lankan child whom Dr. Conal Austin operated, and her parents were invited.
Chairman Paul Scally has in the past two years brought three male football coaches and one female football coach. They coached hundreds of schoolchildren who live in Galle and the suburbs.
Funds for their work is collected in the U.K where they hold fund-raisers.

'Each household to be provided with electricity'
A rapid programme would be carried out to provide every household with electricity without taking into consideration house ownership, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said it was identified that around 200,000 families are lagging behind in getting electricity connections due to financial difficulties. Therefore, a joint programme would be carried out by the Power and Energy Ministry and the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry to assist those householders who were financially in difficulty in obtaining electricity connections.
"It was reported that due to financial difficulties the 200,000 house owners have not got their electricity connections even though the national grid is available nearby," he said.
Considering this situation, a soft loan of Rs. 40,000 would be granted to those families so that they could obtain their electricity connections. The loan installment could be settled with the monthly electricity bill, he said.
The minister said those people who were unable prove their house ownership could be able to get their electricity connections unlike other days.
"It is significant that temporary houses such as cadjan or Iluk thatched houses are also provided with electricity connections now using especial safety and precautionary measures," Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

Every sport will be developed, says Minister
We want to amend the sports act to achieve common goals by developing every sport in the country and there are no personal gains at all, said the Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara on Wednesday.
Although there were instances of direct involvement of politicians in sports in the past I would not intervene in the matters of sports associations particularly in AGMs, he added.
Speaking at a press conference held at CR and FC auditorium regarding the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) sponsorship for the women's national rugby team the minister also highlighted that all sports associations will be functioning independently in the future keeping their goal as the development of sports.
I will appoint a tribunal consisting of retired judges to solve problems of sports associations, issues regarding AGMs and problems of athletes so that any party do not want to go to courts, he added.
The minister also said it is best that each sports association form an independent committee to hold elections.
The minister also added that there will be amendments in the sports act regarding the period of terms of officials in sports associations in order to get the service of experienced officials and also to give opportunity for new comers. SAGT's sponsorship ensures Sri Lankan Women's rugby team will secure its opportunity to compete in Japan and Hong Kong later this year as part of the Olympic qualifiers for Brazil 2016 where women's rugby will be included as an Olympic sport for the first time.
Women's rugby in Sri Lanka started in the early 1970s and the first international competitions was held in 2000 against visiting Griffins from the USA. Sri Lankan women won both encounters.
Since then Sri Lankan women's 7's team has been a regular participant in the Asian 7s circuit and continues to emerge as a regional powerhouse successively winning the plate championship in 2013 and 2014.
The current women's rugby national team primarily consists of representatives from the forces. Furthermore over 20 schools teams and 12 clubs with registered women's rugby teams, the sport continues to draw grass roots interest in a game traditionally belonging to male domain.
World Rugby (WR) views the development of women's rugby as a priority with an edict to rugby administrations around the globe to promote it as part of the overall growth of rugby in their country.
The Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) has already secured the services of a full time international women's rugby development manager with a mandate to build a sustainable development structure to promote the game islandwide.
Commenting on the partnership SAGT's Chief Commercial Officer Ted Muttiah said women in rugby just as women in our industry, the maritime industry have been trailblazers in a traditionally male dominant arena. Gender diversity continues to present enormous unrealized potential for just about any industry and indeed sport.
He further said team SAGT is very pleased to partner with the SLRFU in taking Sri Lanka's best women rugby players onto the international stage. Sri Lanka women's rugby at the Olympics will be a proud occasion for all.
SLRFU president Asanga Seneviratne commented that Women's team has not lived upto expectations in the past so they decided to get the support of SAGT and work according to a plan to reach higher standards.
He also stressed the importance of finding rural talent and bring them to the national pool to strengthen national squad.
Sri Lanka Women's rugby coach Miss Kat Merchant, SAGT Commercial and Marketing Manager Ms Dashma Karunaratne were also present.

Former IAAF chief Diack charged over doping corruption
Monaco, Wednesday: French police have charged former world athletics president Lamine Diack with corruption over suspicions he took bribes to cover up doping cases, investigators said Wednesday.
The 82-year-old Diack was charged after police had arrived at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) headquarters in Monaco.
Diack stood down from his post in August when Britain's Sebastian Coe was elected to head the scandal-tainted federation.
Coe asked to be questioned by investigators over the case during the police visit on Tuesday, IAAF spokesman Chris Turner told AFP.
The sensational charges were laid ahead of the release this month of a report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commission into allegations of widespread substance abuse in Russia, Kenya and among world champions.
The veteran Senegalese official and his legal advisor, Habib Cisse, were charged with corruption, money laundering and conspiracy, French prosecutors said in a statement.
Later Wednesday, a judicial source told AFP that the IAAF's former anti-doping doctor, Gabriel Dolle, was also charged with corruption.
All three individuals have been released on bail.
"Emanating from separate ongoing investigations by WADA's independent commission and the IAAF's own independent ethics commission into allegations surrounding its anti-doping rules and regulations, a French police investigation has now commenced," said an IAAF statement.
"The IAAF is fully cooperating with all investigations as it has been from the beginning of the process."
The statement added that "police visited the IAAF HQ offices yesterday to carry out interviews and to access documentation."
A source close to the investigation told AFP that the case was focusing on two or three doping tests by Russian athletes.
But the inquiry could be spread to other cases involving other nationalities, the source added.
Diack was the IAAF president from 1999 until this year, a period when international athletics was hit with repeated doping scandals.
- Son forced to quit -His son, Pape Massata Diack, was forced to resign last December as an IAAF marketing executive over accusations that he organised doping cover-ups for Russian athletes.
Valentin Balakhnishev, president of the Russian athletics federation, also stood down as IAAF treasurer.
The International Olympic Committee's ethics commission announced later Wednesday it was launching its own investigation into Diack as a result of the criminal charges. Diack is an IOC honorary member.
An IOC spokesman said they were following developments at the heart of athletics' ruling body "very closely". He added the IOC had "full confidence" in Coe and the IAAF's new leadership.
The accusations meanwhileADDcome at a critical time for the IAAF as the World Anti-Doping Agency will this month release a report on allegations of widespread use of banned substances in Russia and other countries.
WADA has spent this year investigating allegations by the Sunday Times newspaper and German ARD broadcaster of widespread doping by Russian and Kenyan athletes.
This was extended in August to look into allegations that the IAAF had failed to follow up suspicious tests by hundreds of athletes including world champions and Olympic medal winners.
WADA appointed its former leader Dick Pound to head an independent commission of inquiry.
"We expect the independent commission to deliver the findings of its report this month," WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told AFP.
The WADA board is to hold a meeting in mid-November.
About 50 Russian athletes are currently banned by the IAAF, the highest number of any country, and Coe addressed Russian coaches during his two-day visit to Russia this week to meet Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko and Olympic leaders, an IAAF statement said.
"I expressed my uncompromising position on the issue of doping in athletics and the importance for the sport to build trust and defend clean athletes at all times," Coe said.
But he added: "I was able to meet and interact directly with Russian athletes, coaches and officials, and I appreciated their openness, passion for our sport and noted a real appetite for change." Russian sports leaders have denied they have higher levels of doping than in other countries. -AFP

Historic Jaffna fort slowly being restored
As an Army of labourers churns out limestone bricks, archaeologist Prashantha Mandawala reflects on the ambitious task of restoring Sri Lanka's centuries-old Jaffna fort, which was destroyed by ethnic war.
The project has so far included the dangerous task of clearing unexploded mines and shells from the seafront site and scouring the Jaffna peninsula for scarce limestone bricks for the rebuilding.
The LTTE laid siege to the European-built fort, branded a symbol of colonial oppression, during the conflict that raged on the island until 2009.
"There was damage due to the war. Artillery fire and things like that," said Professor Mandawala, who is heading the mammoth restoration of the 17th-century complex.
When the Dutch and British ruled Sri Lanka in the 1600s and 1700s, the fortress was a sign of European military might in the Indian Ocean region, a star-shaped structure with moats and draw bridges.
Hundreds of years later, after Sri Lanka gained independence, the fort came under attack from the LTTE.
They successfully recaptured the fort from Sri Lankan troops, then set about destroying the strategically important site's features.
"They wanted to prevent the Sri Lankan military from getting control of the fort, which was a staging post for attacks in the past," a Tamil legislator from Jaffna, Dharmalingam Sithadthan said.
After the LTTE was crushed in 2009, the authorities began the painstaking task of restoration, with financial help from the Dutch government.
About 150 labourers are now holed up inside, making artificial limestone bricks by mixing cement, crushed limestone and sand. They churn out 300 bricks a day, although thousands are needed to finish the job.
"The biggest challenge we face in carrying out the restoration is finding coral stone," Prof Mandawala said. "Environmental laws prevent us from quarrying limestone, so we have to improvise."
Prof Mandawala, an archaeology academic at the University of Sri Jayewadenepura, said progress is slow, with care taken to preserve what is left of the original structures.
The next stage is to restore the bombed Dutch church and the governor's residence, with the entire project set to be completed by 2018. The Sri Lankan government has earmarked 28 million rupees annually for the next three years, but experts say that may not be enough, given the size of the project.
Since the end of the war, local and foreign tourists have flocked to Jaffna, visiting what was, until recently, the scene of bitter battles.
Another fort nearby on a small island, used as a jail until the 1970s, has been transformed into a boutique hotel run by the navy and offering guests a unique "prison experience". - AFP

How long have you been at your present work place
What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen
From the time I was in College I was a very notorious person and always out of the house. I had no choice but to join the Ceylon Hotel School. But now cooking has become my hobby. Those days I really did not have a choice but to cook. But now I love cooking and its a part of my life now. I like to be creative. And this is the only trade that helped me to come up. I started working in the kitchen and later I got a scholarship as I was awarded Employee of the Month. Joined the hotel school, did the basics and then flew to Dubai for the cost training in Berlin and France. I worked with many reputed European chefs  this is where my career changed for the better.
Who is your biggest critic
My wife (chef has a straight face). But actually the biggest critic is Me. Now I am a calm and quiet chef. Few years ago, I was the opposite  like Gordon Ramsey! I was appointed as an Executive Chef when I was just 26 years old. At that time with the age my position was higher and I believe I was not in control and could not cope up with the pressure. But now, I am matured enoughlearnt from my mistakes.
How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen
First thing I will do is go speak to the guest and see what went wrong. And then make sure the guest is treated well. And then I will see who was in charge of the kitchen. If its someone small in the kitchen I will go see whats wrong but if its someone in the higher position like a Sous Chef then it will be a different way of handling the situation  (Gordon Ramsey way).
When at homedo you cook or do you let your partner take control
My wife. I never used to cook at home unless she requests me to do so. And I believe she is the better cook and I like her cooking too.
If you were not a chef
what would you
be today
I really dont know. But I do like accounting and I did commerce for my Advance Levels.
Of all the places you worked, at what are your greatest memories of them
All the hardest part I still remember. I did many openings. When I worked for Inter Continental we opened a restaurant. We had to wake up at 5am and work till midnight every single day. We only had one off day for a week. The other property I worked for had 900 rooms and we used to sleep for maximum 6 to 7 hours and during the pre-opening we didnt have a day off for two months. It was the same for Kuwait Meridien and that was also a pre-opening. My closest memory still is working at Centara Passikudah as at that time there was no property like that in that area. I started working there during the time it was still in bricks. During the rainy season it would get flooded and still we had to work in our shorts and brave the storm  those were some good memories.

I always stood by the SLFP - MR
Kurunegala district Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the SLFP was his lifeblood because he is a born SLFPer who had stood by the party through thick and thin without abandoning or betraying it during various upheavals which occurred through its history.
Rajapaksa said as such he never contemplated on leaving or betraying the party which carried him to the highest pedestal in the country.
However, if the SLFP hoped to go it alone at the forthcoming local government elections he would be compelled to rethink his position because he was always on the side of the common opposition.
Speaking to the Daily News, Rajapaksa said he was fully aware and certain that the SLFP could not win elections by contesting single handed.
He said that was why he believed the SLFP should contest in coalition with the common opposition. "It was only by going to the hustings in coalition with other parties in the common position that the SLFP would win elections convincingly," the former President said.

Kurunegala district MP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said some SLFP ministers in the government are requesting him to leave the SLFP while the people and the party supporters are asking him to remain in the party. "As a patron of the SLFP I am now in a dilemma," he said.
Rajapaksa said this participating in a public dialogue held at the residence of former Ambalantota Pradeshiya Sabha Vice Chairman P L Piyasena at Ridiyagama on November 4. The former President who declined to make a speech at the gathering asked the people to express their views saying he wished to sound public opinion.
The people present said they would not work for the SLFP to ensure its victory at the local elections and asked the former President the stand they should take at the forthcoming elections.
Rajapaksa in reply said President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to ensure a SLFP victory at the local elections.
The people said they did not agree with this view. Rajapaksa said when he lost the Presidential election, his ambition was to retire from politics and attend social functions of people. But, he was compelled to contest the general election at the behest of party activists.
He said the SLFP should contest elections together with its coalition parties. If not the SLFP was bound to face defeat if it went it alone history had proved it. Rajapaksa said "Today, I have become the common enemy of the UNP and the SLFP.

Set of guidelines for teaching hospitals in the pipeline - Rajitha
A set of guidelines that applies to teaching hospitals is being formulated, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the Standing Order 23 (2) asking the government to explain its stance on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
Dissanayake observed that the SAITM is being operated without a proper legal approval and added that it is not accredited by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.
"The SAITM was recognised as a degree awarding institute by the gazettes issued by the former Higher Education Minister in 2011 and 2013.
This was an arbitrary decision.
The SAITM claims Nevil Fernando hospital as a teaching hospital, but it is not properly recognised.
Over 1,000 students have enrolled at this institute so far. Each student pays about Rs. 12 million for an MBBS. The SAITM is deceiving the parents and students," he pointed out.
The minister responding to the statement said neither the UGC nor the Higher Education Ministry has so far developed any laws pertaining to teaching hospitals.
"Therefore we are now in the process of forming regulations pertaining to them. This is done to maintain the standards in them. Even though the SAITM claims its hospital as a teaching hospital, it is not registered in the Private Hospital Registration Act as a teaching hospital.
The Medical Council has pointed out the shortcomings in the Clinical services relating to the SAITM, and it must rectify them to be qualified.
We will support it to improve its standards on the forensic medical and public health aspects as those areas need the government's help," he commented.
Government aims third generation economic plan - Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wcirkemesinghe told Parliament yesterday that the new government's aim is to present third generation economic plan to rescue the country from an economic abyss and develop it further.
"Our economy is in bad shape today due to economic mismanagement of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government.
Therefore, we must implement a long term programme to make Sri Lanka an import and export hub like in the early days," he said.
The Prime Minister was speaking during the presentation of the government's medium plan economic policy in parliament yesterday.
He said former President J. R. Jayewardene introduced social and economic reforms under the first generation economic plan to develop the country while many social and economic reforms were introduced under the second generation economic plan by former President R. Premadasa.
"In presenting the third generation economic plan, under the President Maithripala Sirisena's regime we will look at increasing the income level of people, creating 100,000 new job opportunities, improving rural economy while creating strong and wide middle class in the country. We will also pay attention to create a competitive trade economy based on the knowledge based society and extending investment opportunities looking at global economic conditions.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made one hour presentation on the present government's medium plan economic policy from 1.55 p.m. to 2.55 p.m.
Dinesh leaves Chamber protesting against Finance Minister
MEP Leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena left the Chamber yesterday protesting against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka's move to present an order under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act and several resolutions under the Customs Ordinance and Excise Ordinance in Parliament.
Along with MP Gunawardene, MP Bandula Gunawardena and MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera and several UPFA backbenchers followed suit and abstained from participating in the debate.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena, and Dinesh Gunawardena when the time came for the notice of motions and orders of the day spoke against the government taking up the Order and Resolutions for debate pointing out that more than three months had lapsed since their introduction to parliament. The Order and Resolutions should have been taken for debate within four months, they pointed out citing Standing Orders and presenting them now is unlawful. The wrong procedure has been followed in presenting these orders and resolutions.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he also realised there is something wrong with this arrangement. "That is why I asked the opinions of the Attorney General in this regard.
Then, Speaker informed the House that the Attorney General had informed him that the Order and Resolutions could be taken up for debate and there was no legal barrier. However, MP Gunawardena said that it was illegal to take the Order and Resolutions for debate and walked out of the Chamber.

Significant outcome of President's visit to Thailand
The Buddha statue presented by President Maithripala Sirisena as a special gift to the people of Thailand has been placed in the historic Dharmarama Temple in Ayutthaya city or Ajodhya of Thailand where Ven. Upali Mahathera who brought higher ordination (Upasampada) to Sri Lanka from Siam (then Thailand) in 1735 had lived.
Stating this as a significant outcome of the President's recently concluded state visit to Thailand, Foreign Affairs Ministry's East Asia and Pacific Acting Director General O.L.Ameer Ajwad yesterday said: "President Sirisena presented the Buddha statue as a gift from Sri Lanka to the people and the government of Thailand during his state visit to the Kingdom of Thailand from November 1 to 4, 2015.
"The government of Thailand has taken steps to enshrine it in the temple where Ven Upali Mahathera had lived before he brought higher ordination to Sri Lanka from Siam."
Ajwad was summarising the outcome of the President's official visit to Thailand at a press conference at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. He said President Sirisena undertook a state visit to Thailand at the invitation of Thailand's Prime Minister to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Thailand - Sri Lanka diplomatic relations.
The President inaugurated the exposition of the Buddha's Sacred Relics from the Mahiyangana Rajamaha Vihara at Buddhamanthan in Thailand.
Thailand's Prime Minister General Prayut Chan -o- cha participated in this ceremony. Sixty Sri Lankan Buddhist monks chanted pirith at the inauguration.
Ajwad said: "President Sirisena had bilateral discussions with the President and the Prime Minister of Thailand on a wide range of matters covering economic, cultural, religious and and political cooperation. "During high level discussions it was agreed to hold the joint commission between the two countries in Bangkok in the first quarter of 2016. The last meeting of the commission was held in Colombo. The leaders agreed to hold the meeting to enhance cooperation between the two countries in the areas of economic cooperation including technical cooperation, agriculture, security, fisheries and tourism sectors." Ajwad said the President also held discussions with representatives of top business companies and industries in Thailand. "The talks were to lead business participation in tourism, hospitality, food processing, manufacturing of electric and electronic appliances, auto spare parts among other things. The heads of leading business companies in Thailand voiced their keen interest to invest
in Sri Lanka in view of the current favourable business environment in the country," he said.
"President Sirisena asked them to arrange a programme to implement their business initiatives in Sri Lanka with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and other agencies," he said.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand agreed to pay a visit to Sri Lanka particularly to observe religious places of historic significance in the country early next year with a view to promote tourism between the two countries. He will be here with a media team to ensure coverage of places of worship in Sri Lanka to educate the public in Thailand about them.
The government of Thailand also agreed to increase the number of scholarships provided by them to Sri Lanka, especially in the areas of agriculture, public health, renewable energy and rural energy.
The discussions also saw a proposal to establish a hospital dedicated to the Maha Sangha in Sri Lanka with the assistance of Thai government. On the sidelines of this visit, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera met his Thailand counterpart.

Some shedding crocodile tears for HNDA students - Minister
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said those responsible for assaulting the Rathupaswala people when asking for water and those who removed the degree status of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) are now shedding crocodile tears for HNDA students.
He said so while handing over letters of employment as development officers to 780 youth.
The ceremony was held at the Public Administration and Management Ministry. The minister added that the then UNP government offered the degree status for HNDA as an alternative for the Accountancy Degree in 1990.
"The previous UPFA government removed the degree status in March 2014 issuing circular Number 10 of 2014," the minister said.
The HNDA students did not come on to the streets shouting slogans or hold protest marches in 2014 against the act of the UPFA government. But the HNDA students launched a protest march this year, he said.
However, we do not condone the behaviour of the police during the protest," he said.
The people responsible for killing Ratupaswala children and approved the removal of degree status of the HNDA at the Cabinet meeting are now shedding crocodile tears over the HNDA issue, he said.
