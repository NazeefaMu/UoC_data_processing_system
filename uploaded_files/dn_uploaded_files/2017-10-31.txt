Japan-Sri Lanka discuss matters of integration, reconciliation
As part of the Japanese Governments initiative to assist the Sri Lankan Government to implement its reconciliation agenda, Japanese Prosecutor Dr. Motoo Noguchi visited the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry on October 27.
His objectives were to share knowledge, expertise and experiences on reconciliation efforts of the other countries and to obtain firsthand information on the national integration and reconciliation programmes of the Government.
Dr. Noguchi shared the experiences of Congo, Uganda, South Africa and other countries and shared the best international practices. He explained that the conflict-affected areas need to be provided with basic economic and social infrastructure including resettlement and rehabilitation, livelihood and economic empowerment to address disparities and need reparation support. The priority is also to provide physical rehabilitation for the disabled persons and extend psycho-social support to affected persons including families of missing persons, to overcome trauma.
Further, sustainable social reintegration of ex-combatants into communities and providing economic opportunities to prevent future recurrences is vital.
Dr. Noguchi also said the peace education programme for children has tremendous potential for success in terms of establishing sustainable peace.
In the African region, a concept of Peace Caravan was launched to get active involvement of children in the peace-building process. The war widows and those who underwent gender-based violence were supported with psycho-social support programmes and small businesses, livelihood and entrepreneurship programmes.
The transitional justice mechanisms of truth seeking, Office on Missing Persons (OMP), reparation, justice and accountability and non-recurrence are not only important for a particular group of affected people, but should widely benefit the entire population, Dr. Motoo Noguchi added.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy presented the national reconciliation and integration strategy which included an integration-friendly schools programme, reconciliation-friendly media, integration-friendly university and Youth Corps, inculcating integration concepts into Sunday religious school teachings, curriculum development in school education incorporating ethics, values, virtues, and comparative religious studies.
Further, the Reconciliation Focused Economic Empowerment Project (REEP), 50,000 housing programme, roads project, social and economic infrastructure projects will help to reduce economic disparities and enhance trust.
The Ministry Secretary also said that the District Reconciliation Committees (DRC) has been established to address ethnic and religious tensions in pockets and hotspots.
Considerable progress has now been made in operationalization of the OMP, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation. Dr. Noguchi commended the national integration and reconciliation initiatives undertaken by the Ministry as appropriate and relevant in the peacebuilding context.

Japanese man arrested after body parts found in cooler

Police in Japan have arrested a 27-year-old man after he admitted to killing an unidentified person and dismembering the body.
Japanese media reported parts of as many as nine bodies were found in the apartment of Takahiro Shiraishi in Zama City, Kanagawa Prefecture, southwest of Tokyo.

Shiraishi has been arrested on the charge of abandoning a corpse, police told CNN, and investigation is still ongoing. The names, ages and genders of the alleged victims have not been revealed.

"I killed (a person) and dismembered the body and put them into a cooler box with cat litter in order to hide the evidence," Shiraishi said, according to police.

A police officer would not comment on the eight other bodies reportedly found in Shiraishi's apartment.

According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, police searched Shiraishi's home as part of an investigation into the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman from Hachioji City, in the Tokyo suburbs.

Media gather in front of an apartment (partialy covered with a blue sheet) where Japanese police found body parts in a suburb of Tokyo.

Investigators told NHK the woman was reported missing last Tuesday after she posted a message online saying she was looking for someone to join her in committing suicide. Surveillance footage showed her walking with the suspect near the man's apartment.

When they searched Shiraishi's apartment, police found the dismembered body parts of nine people, hidden around the apartment, NHK reported.

Citing police sources, TV Asahi reported three cooler boxes and five containers were found in Shiraishi's room containing human heads and bones with the flesh scraped off.

Keeping young flyers engaged
Young flyers will take just 49 minutes and 47 seconds to ask the dreaded, are we nearly there yet so with parents battling the boredom threshold, Emirates has teamed up with Dr Sandi Mann, a psychologist and boredom specialist at the University of Central Lancashire to find a solution. Dr Mann has worked with the airline to create the Child Boredom Quotient (CBQ), helping parents identify the exact moment their kids will get bored so they can enjoy stress-free travel.
The study of more than 2,000 UK parents of under 12s alongside observations of children during their playtime helped Dr Sandi Mann categorise activities into Active (A), Passive (P), Interactive (I), Creative (C) or Sensory (S) to formulate the CBQ, and ultimately help parents mix the perfect blend of activities to catch boredom before it sets in.
The findings which also saw two thirds of parents (64 percent) worry about entertaining their children and 43 percent expressing concern about their children disturbing other passengers, found little travellers aged 3  4 to be the most volatile. Bribery techniques such as giving out snacks (41 percent) in exchange for good behaviour were often used just to keep the peace. Other tried and tested methods of distraction for parents include employing electronic devices (33 percent) even if theyre not allowed at home, handing out new toys (27 percent) to keep their tots happy or trying to tire out their children by running around the airport before boarding (16 percent).
Dr Sandi Mann, psychologist and boredom specialist, University of Central Lancashire comments: Parents of children aged 3 to 4 will start to find that this is when their children are physically very active, gaining independence and when they need more sophisticated things to entertain them than they did when they were younger.
When engaging in an activity on board, films are the most popular for keeping children occupied from around 40 minutes for the youngest age group (0 to 2) to 1 hour 45 minutes for the oldest (11 to12).
This is followed by games either on a smart device or on the inflight entertainment system (keeping kids occupied from 30 minutes for the youngest to 1.5 hours for the oldest).
Meanwhile, creative pursuits such as drawing was the most popular until age 9 when quizzes and puzzles become more engaging. Colouring and sticker books have most appeal to the younger ages.
Dr Sandi Mann further comments: Very young children dont need very sophisticated toys for a plane journey and will be most amused by things in the environment  including people and of course their parents. For example, this could be I Spy whilst, regular walks up the aisle are good for toddlers for exercise and for pre-toddles to change the visual environment. Dont forget singing and interactive games like peekaboo are also great.
Older children can be given simple materials like notebooks and pens, puzzle books and comics. Ensure that they take breaks every so often to walk up and down the plane and try to restrict the passive viewing just like you might at home.
Dont be afraid of them being bored as left to their own devices with a few basic materials, they will find creative ways to engage their brains.

Low priced DVDs, a hindrance to film importers
Tamil blackbuster movie Mersal which stars actor Vijay in triple roles is creating waves among the audiences and setting a record run in the box office. However a few days after the film hit the local theaters copies of the film in DVD format and sub titled in Sinhala have been released. Apart from being not up to quality the release of such DVDs are disheartening for importers who are looking to import some of the most hyped about and quality productions to Sri Lanka to give the chance to movie buffs to experience the best of what global cinema has to offer today.
These DVDs may seem like a cheap way for families to get together and watch a modern day movie but only those who have experienced the real taste of cinema can recognize the difference between watching such a production on such a DVD and on the cinema screen. The authorities should take up this matter seriously because it is only a hindrance to the local cinema culture of this country. Mersal also stars Samantha, Nithya Menon and Kajal Aggarwal in the female lead roles. The film is directed by Atlee and co-written by K.V.

Of men and harmony
Their music is like Cupids well directed arrow! C Plus is one of the most in demand bands when it comes to weddings. C Plus cover all types of weddings with music ranging from classical to pop. Their umbrella covers Jazz and the blues, 70s and 80s and old country stuff. Their music is full of good feelings and positivity.
They do rock as well, but are known mostly as a band that specializes in weddings. Melodies features C Plus the quintessential wedding band and speaks to band leader Chandumal Fernando.
Maintaining a good level of music is definitely on the top of our priority list in addition to making a good income. Both are equally important since obviously we need to support ourselves in life. So we do events, weddings, dinner dances and parties, said Fernando.
Fernando started his career in the choir being a catholic. He spent 25 years in hallowed surroundings. From a very young age he loved music. It is food for his soul. It is the most important part of his life and gives his life powerful meaning. By profession he is an engineer.
Our originals definitely contain a message. When it comes to love, physical appearances are not important. Love is love. It is a feeling. So let it be a feeling. Music is an international language that people understand. It is universal. It is the melody and the words combined, that gives a very different meaning than words simply spoken, stated Fernando.
Though they do cover versions of Western Music, C Plus have put out three original singles  Kelle, "Oba Ha Ya wela" and "Mal Dunen" and are planning to release a Christmas Song at the end of this year. When the band started out, it was not very easy, but 2014, 2015 and 2016 were very good years. This year too was a good year.
The predominant theme of C Plus is love. But the love they speak about cannot be fully expressed by words no matter how wonderful words can be! Which is why music can be a different medium to convey this concept of love. They have been influenced by the 70s and 80s bands like Queen. That music inspires them. They love Bruno Mars and Michael Buble.
As a band even though we do a lot of English songs we understand the value of doing Sinhala songs as well. Then we can connect with the people. We have a plan to do one English original next year. When we talk about love we often think that the lady is pursued because of her physical beauty. That is the general idea. But the message we want to give is, to look at love as something that runs deeper. That is a connection between two souls. It has a deeper meaning. Music is the perfect medium to express this love, explained Fernando.
Fernando loves artistes such as Rookantha Gunathilake, Sunil Shantha, Sunil Perera, Lionel Richie, Elton John and Enrique Iglesias.
I would advise a guy or a girl who wants to enter the music industry, to do quality music and listen to good music. You have to study music. A proper study of music is important. You have to understand music and do it in a proper way. Music always gives my life meaning. Because of music I understand so many things about life. I learnt of men and of harmony. It is a part of our lives. I dont think we can live without music, I and my band members. Music keeps us going and the last three years have been amazing, pointed out Fernando.
Fernando pointed out that 31st night is always a big day! Foreigners dance to their music even though they do not know the words! They understand the melody, even though they do not understand the language.
They enjoy every bit of it.
Music speaks to each and every person. Everybody loves it. People all get together. When we play at 31st night, all the people local and foreign come together and enjoy it, summed up Fernando.

More homicidal pranks by pen-pushing cranks!
My last column about old newsroom contretemps appears to have amused certain readers who have requested more of the same. One of them, however, doubts the authenticity of the story regarding the aborted steak-knife duel at the then Press Club venue. A reader who signed a missive to me as Solomon Vincent Silva, says he is sceptical over my description of the riotous and raucous newsrooms of old.
He says that there are all sorts of things that regularly happen in movies but rarely take place in real life. Let me remind Mr. Solomon V. Silva that the journos I mentioned were real life people who indulged in actual outrageous antics, far more dangerously exciting than any make-believe movie. Its a question of credibility. Often the crazy stuff is true and the ordinary stuff is not, because the humdrum normal stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness. Real life can be more astonishing and difficult to believe than made-up stories.
Many surviving journalists of that era look back fondly on the days of high spirits and remember the passion, the brawling and bawling and most of all the unbridled laughter that echoed through those hallowed halls. Yet, it was also laughter that came with unconscious gratitude that how darned lucky you were to be allowed to work in a place such as this.
Among them were rogues and rascals who tested your patience. In those days journos still drank, swore, and smoked on the job. And yes, we over-drank. We smoked too much. No one was perfect. We were a tribe of rapscallions and reformists let loose on chronicling an imperfect world. Most of us were bewitched by our craft.
Yes, the newspapers mentioned were peopled by a bunch of bizarre denizens, who would not have been offended if you pigeonholed them as misfits. Because the environment fitted them admirably and they would never have fitted in or survived in any other mundane profession. Indeed, many of us would have languished like caged wild animals in any other well-ordered or regimented milieu. Yet one must concede that some of the larrikin at times bordered on the downright dangerous horseplay ever encountered anywhere. There were all sorts of stunts that are regularly observed in the movies but are seldom seen in real life.
To be perfectly honest some of the escapades were not far divorced from being homicidal pranks. Imagine the utterly terrifying prospect of being dangled out of a building as one drink-fuelled colleague holds you by your feet. It really did occur in reality at some point when an old drunk was subjected to the same hazardous and humiliating high-jinks that silver-screen miscreants are treated to as a means of extracting information.
There was old man Don Peter who had served the publishing firm for a good three decades and later held the enviable position as the Managing Directors personal factotum. Even after retirement he was not put out to pasture but allowed the privilege of remaining in the company geriatric paddock. He had always been a loyal employee but at times became an irritant to the editorial staff delaying or expediting their petty cash chits depending on how well the recipient would treat him at the pub.
Strongman Willie, who was later to serve as a news editor, had a long running grudge with Don Peter. Willie was good natured when sober but could turn violently disruptive when sloshed to a point of no-return. He was usually taciturn with his hallmark brier pipe clenched between his teeth and was capable of scrunching a glass to smithereens with his bare palm. Naturally, his hand became bloodied as a result. His strength may have been phenomenal but he was as mortal as the rest of us. His colleagues gave him a wide berth at drinking sessions, for the particular reason that he would leave an impression of his bloody palm marks on the back of your shirt.
But that was only the soft part of his aggression when in his cups. One besotted evening he caught the equally sloshed Don Peter on the wrong foot, or to be truthful by both feet. Before anyone could move Willie lifted him, carried him upside down toward a widow and held him dangling by his feet while the late night traffic swooshed past some 60 odd feet on the road below.
Film buffs may be familiar with this particular moment you often see in action flicks and cop movies. Its the kind of drama where the hero is attempting to extract some information from a miscreant of one sort or another. He does so by dangling said villain by his feet from the roof of a tall building. But this, dear reader, was true life drama while a whimpering Don Peter was left teetering on the brink of doom, with only the strong hands of Willie standing between him and oblivion.
The worst was to come when horrified colleagues rallied round the stuntmen and exhorted Willie to draw old Don Peter back to safety. Willy stubbornly refused saying that he was susceptible to tickling and if anyone got too close he would be forced to relinquish his grip on old Dons feet. To prove his point he released his hold on one of the victims legs while adjusting the angle of his pipe between his teeth. Imagining the loosened grip on his leg was a prelude to his death plunge Don Peter gave an unearthly shriek that summoned every tippler to the window.
Willie was promised the grand-daddy of all cocktails if he would only pull the endangered Don back through the window. Eventually after much persuasion he did while drinks were called for all round. But poor old petrified Don Peter was weeping and whimpering in a corner and seemingly cold sober after his harrowing near-death experience. He was an emotional mess and judging by the acidic aroma emanating from his person it seemed obvious that he had wet his pants.
Journalists are the watchdogs of the nation. One of my favourite quotes on that role came from Wilbur F. Storey, editor of the Chicago Times: It is a newspapers duty, he said, to print the news, and raise hell. Chicago Evening Post journalist and humorist Finley Peter Dunne gets at least partial credit for another old saying, that a newspapers job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.
So if Mr. Solomon Vincent Silva, - which I doubt is his real name - in his comfort zone imagines that old newsrooms were not what I painted them out to be, he is welcome to join us in one of our regular dining and wining sessions. But be warned that we wordsmiths are honourable men of our word. Any contradictory doubts expressed over our credibility will be settled as a point of honour in a deadly duel. Over to you Mr Solomon Silva. Choose your weapons!

Paris: Rafael Nadal will be crowned as the year-end world number one if he wins his first match at this weeks Paris Masters, after Roger Federer withdrew from the tournament.
The two old rivals have both had stunning seasons, returning to form and fitness with two Grand Slam titles each.
But Federer, who could have still usurped Nadal at the top of the rankings with titles in the French capital and at the World Tour Finals in London, pulled out of the final event of the regular season to protect a back problem.
The 36-year-old said winning his eighth Swiss Indoors title on Sunday against Juan Martin del Potro left him unfit to play at the Bercy Arena.
I am very sorry to have to pull out of the Paris Masters but my body needs a rest after Basel, said the Swiss legend.
Ive played a lot of tennis this year and need to make sure I look after my physical wellbeing if I want to continue to compete at the highest level for years to come.
I love to play at Bercy, its a few times now that Ive not played there. Its a tough one but they have to understand that its for the cause of staying injury-free and healthy.
Id like to be fully fit for London and for 2018.
Top seed Nadal, who has a bye for the first round in Paris, just needs to win his opening second-round clash to secure the top ranking heading into next year.
The Spaniard, who claimed his 10th French Open title and the US Open crown to take his Grand Slam tally to 16 major titles this season, will start his campaign against either German serve-and-volleyer Mischa Zverev or promising South Korean Hyeon Chung.
Despite his love affair with the clay of Roland Garros, Nadal has never won the Paris Masters in five previous attempts at the indoor tournament.
The 31-year-olds best effort came with a final defeat by David Nalbandian in 2007. AFP

Over 270 graduate from Swinburne University - Nawaloka College
Having over 270 young men and women conferred with qualifications from one of Australias most prestigious universities is surely a cause for celebration for Nawaloka College of Higher Studies, which held its third graduation recently.
Under the aegis of Minister of the State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne who was Chief the Guest, Special Guest Acting Australian High Commissioner Tim Huggins and the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Swinburne University of Science & Technology David Coltman, graduates following the Business and Science Engineering Foundation courses, as well as Business, IT and Engineering Diploma graduates proudly accepted their qualifications at a gala ceremony recent.
By February, they will all commence their second year of studies at the SUT at the campuses in Australia or Malaysia. 18 scholarships were awarded to high performing students to attend SUT, while 15 were felicitated with Top Awards, in recognition of their academic prowess. Its a double celebration for NCHS given the record number of 270 graduates being conferred with their qualifications, the highest since inception.
Minister Wickramaratne said, Private tertiary education has a vital role to play in educating Sri Lankas youth. It provides a variety of qualifications that would otherwise be unavailable to many Sri Lankans. Higher education is no longer optional for young people and meeting its growing demand is a challenge. He congratulated NCHS for making a good quality education available to more young people saying it was a great service to this country.
Chairman of NCHS, Jayantha Dharmadasa augmented the Ministers words by stating that NCHS has always endeavoured to support the government in developing bright young people who will take the mantle of development forward. We are proud to have been an active contributor to the countrys knowledge based economic growth through our education system. At a time when there is a great demand for higher quality education which meets challenging global competition NCHS has taken many steps in fulfilling this macro national agenda.
Commending both SUT and NCHS for successfully delivering a world class qualification from Australia, Tim Huggins reflected on the young peoples commitment to academics, saying, You have demonstrated ability and readiness to acquire the knowledge and skills that will enhance your career prospects and prepare you for new challenges. David Coltman added to the Special Guests thoughts, stating, At Swinburne we encourage our students to embrace the notion that we are all learners for life. Your graduation will not represent an end-point to your educational adventures.
NCHS is a venture of the highly reputed diversified conglomerate Nawaloka Holdings, which has a strong presence in the Hospital, construction, manufacturing, trading, lubricant and aviation sectors. Focusing on delivering excellence in education with the highest international standards, reflected in the prestigious university qualifications offered via a distinguished faculty via a modern state-of-the-art learning facility with a supportive study environment, NCHS has inked partnerships with Swinburne University Australia and California State University Monterrey Bey, USA and due to high demand, has a regional office in Kandy to facilitate central province inquiries from the central province. Collaborating with SUT, NCHS offers diplomas in Business, IT, Engineering and Health Science and Foundation programmes in Business Engineering.

Over 50,000 lives improved through Fonterras grass roots sustainability projects
Ensuring that every person has access to basic resources such as clean water and quality education will provide rural communities with a greater opportunity to reach their full potential, according to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.
However, a number of areas across the island lack access to clean water supply, sanitation and other infrastructure which naturally poses a threat to education and quality of life. The ensuing issue becomes one of national importance in helping to shape the futures of rural communities.
This has been an area of central focus for Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, the company behind Anchor  who has aligned its social value generation efforts around creating happier and prosperous dairy communities.
Since 2014, Fonterra has completed over 82 projects in line with these goals. Through these projects, Fonterra has to date created a lasting positive impact for more than 50,000 people in rural dairy farmer communities, marked by its most recent water and sanitation project hand-over recently in Horana.
The new facility provided a sustainable solution for 1,512 students and 64 teachers of the Moragahahena Maha Vidyalaya, who previously had no access to clean water during the drought months of the year.
Director of Corporate Affairs at Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage, said that the co-operative was committed to strengthening dairy farming communities.
Ensuring our communities have reliable access to safe and affordable drinking water helps prevent waterborne and kidney diseases. In the long-term, clean water and sanitation will improve health, help the children of our farmers stay in school and provide better economic opportunities for their families.
This is why we work in close collaboration with our partners Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, Kansarmen Foundation and the community to identify initiatives that make a real difference today, and for generations to come, said Dr. Kahandaliyanage.
Working in partnership with the Kansarmen Foundation, the School Development Society and the Past Pupils Association, Fonterra equipped the Moragahahena Maha Vidyalaya with a sustainable solution with an upgraded well, underground pipelines and pumps, and a brand new set of sinks.
Pathmasiri Jayasinghe, Zonal Education Director, who was present at the hand-over, said that clean water scarcity and inadequate sanitation negatively impacts farmer families in these areas, and this has been worsened by drought.
Speaking at the handover event, School Principal, S.C. Jayantha said, It is with immense relief and joy that I convey my gratitude to Fonterra for taking on this project and providing our school with functioning water and sanitation facilities for our students and teachers.
The new facilities enable us to keep our commitment to make this school a second home for our students, where we can provide them with access to resources for a bright and healthy future.

Pan Asia Bank posts Rs 1.8 bn PBT for 9 months
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC recorded modest performance during its third quarter as well as for the first nine months amid challenging macroeconomic factors including higher interest rates and slowdown in demand for new loans.
The bank posted a Rs. 1.8 billion before tax profits which translated in to Rs. 918.1 million after tax profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 or Rs. 2.91 a share in comparison to the Rs. 905.8 million reported for the corresponding period in 2016.
For the July - September quarter, the profit remained almost unchanged at Rs. 301.3 million from the same period last year as the higher credit costs pared the potential gains.
The interim results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed the other income led by fees and commissions cushioning much of the earnings as the core banking performance moderated amid rising cost of funds and relatively slow demand for new loans.
The net interest income for the nine months rose by 8.0% to Rs. 3.67 billion from a year earlier as the rise in interest cost beat the rise in interest income.
The net interest margin or the gap between the cost of its deposits and other funds and the yield of its loans and other investments was tad weaker at 3.81% against 3.87% at the beginning of the year, albeit remaining above the industry average.
The bank gave Rs. 4.8 billion in new loans and receivables during the period nudging the banks total loans and receivables book to surpass Rs. 100 billion to end the period with a total book of Rs. 103.3 billion.
The growth in loans almost corresponded with the rise in deposits as the new deposits too rose by Rs.4.1 billion.
The banks total deposits which was at Rs. 95.63 billion by the end of September is now flirting the Rs.100 billion mark, another key milestone for the bank which is within the reach of the bank before the end of the financial year.
Meanwhile the total capital adequacy ratio or the Tier II ratio was 13.1% whereas the minimum required is 11.25%.
Speaking on the performance, banks Director/Chief Executive, Nimal Tillekeratnegave a more sanguine outlook for the bank albeit the recent modest performance, as the bank is currently reviewing its strategies and consolidating almost all areas of the bank which is expected to yield stronger results.

Paris Accord: Nature gives wake-up calls through hurricanes to drop it
There was an interesting article by David Andelman in global media suggesting that President Donald Trump should consider recent hurricane victims as a wake-up call on climate change.
He also suggested that President Trump should get back on board with the Paris Accord. In this respect, I would like to indicate how I see Paris Accord going to put the entire mankinds future in jeopardy. The day somebody shows me how Paris Accord would direct mankind to handle water-related disasters  there are enough and more reports by international agencies to depict their magnitudes and hurricanes happen to be a continuous reminder  I would support it wholeheartedly. What I see today is exactly the opposite; Paris Accord will bring us more hurricanes and enormous misery to mankind. There would be too many Puerto Ricos than others could handle.
Andelman has, of course, quoted from an article by MITs Prof. Kerry Emanuel in the Nature magazine which says that climate change potentially affects the frequency, intensity and tracks of tropical cyclones.
Nobody would challenge this generic statement about climate change; but what is not clear is how Paris Accord would reduce (i) climate change and (ii) more water vapour getting into the atmosphere.
In the Paris Accord, there are a few statements about global temperature increasing and greenhouse gases contributing towards this. So Paris Accord wants us to reduce emitting greenhouse gases and in that process, it wants us to generate more immediate rain.
In order to ensure my own bearings are right, I quote from two interesting articles about these. One is Prof. Emanuels recent article in the Nature magazine on Will Global warming make hurricane forecasting more difficult and the other is a document about the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project called CMIP5 by climate scientists and researchers. First, I will talk about CMIP5 as Prof. Emanuels article also refers to this.
CMIP5
These models are simple in appearance when expressed as the platform, but once you identify the model, the detailed workings, whether with CMIP5 or previous versions CMIP3 etc., using computer software packages etc. are complicated and sophisticated. What I want to emphasize is that there seems to be an issue with the basic platforms shown below. Let us look at platform C which deals with interactions of carbon and CO2 system with the physical models on the right side of the sketch and how the whole set up is influenced by natural and anthropogenic perturbations. The major issue with this platform is the anthropogenic perturbations considered.
As to be expected, CO2 emissions are included in the anthropogenic perturbations; but the other gases considered appear to be incomplete. Biogeochemistry models look at Carbon and CO2 interactions and how different interactions would take place in association with the physical models. When it comes to the other greenhouse gases, the related section 3.6 talks about CH4, N2O, fluorinated gases, etc. But water vapour is not included. This is most probably due to the fact that generation of Newly Formed Water (NFW as I call it),in much larger quantities than N2O, CH4, etc., from combustion of hydrocarbons in oil and gas to obtain energy for anthropogenic activities has been overlooked. The impact of this NFW on the biogeochemistry models as well as on the physical models is enormous for the following reasons.
Four Platforms a,b,c,d of CMIP 5 Model
Please note that whenever you generate energy by the combustion of oil or gas you always generate NFW along with CO2 and in that sense they are inseparable or they are born together.
How this NFW influences the Biogeochemistry Models (BM) and Physical Models are given below.
(i) It could have a significant impact on BM because unlike in the case of carbon and CO2 processes, there are no hydrogen/oxygen and H2O processes and oxygen in the atmosphere been depleted will not be regenerated at a reasonable rate and oxygen depletion in the atmosphere continues influencing all BM processes.
(ii) Due to its significant greenhouse gas effect  when you talk about a 2.80C rise in temperature for doubling of CO2 concentration, only 1.20C out of that 2.80C is due to 2094 Gt of CO2 and the balance 1.60C is due to 1302Gt of H2O  atmospheric temperature goes up and its impact will be felt in respect of both draughts, etc. and precipitation as well. It will also influence the physical models as well.
(iii) NFW (a) increases temperature and (b) brings water vapour to maintain constant relative humidity in atmosphere at a rate 33% more than CO2 for the same amount of energy provided.
(iv) All current computations of temperature increase and precipitation are underestimated at least by 50%.
(v) When oil is combusted and exhaust gets cooled to room temperature and NFW is condensed, the enthalpy released to the atmosphere by NFW is more than 7 times that released by CO2.
(vi) NFW has a dynamic viscosity which is much less than those of N2, O2 and CO2 and hence could influence airflow/wind related disasters.
As such, it is imperative that we identify way forward in respect of climate change only after we incorporate NFW and related changes to CMIP5 platform and only then our mitigation actions in respect of climate change would yield positive outcomes.
Prof. Kerry Emanuels article
I also studied the article written by Prof. Kerry Emanual and found it extremely interesting. In this article, Prof. Emanuel has attempted to address different parameters of cyclones and explained how these parameters would be impacted by changes arising from climate change.
Prof. Emanuel is concerned about CMIP5 not capturing spatial and temporal variability of upper ocean thermal structure properly and what we mentioned about NFW will only aggravate that concern as the Gulf of Mexico is full of gas and oil wells, processing plants, etc which will throw out NFW much in excess over the normal situation.
Then Prof. Emanual addresses the issue of intensity increases of 60knots or greater just prior to landfall and indicates the locations which has seen this in actual practice. The top 15 events with the highest increases in intensity in 24hours prior to land fall has been identified and they have happened at Houston, New Orleans, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. If one looks at these, you will notice that these are the areas where they burn most of the oil and gas in that vicinity for road transportation. Recently it was mentioned that in Houston, 94% of households do have vehicles. So when road transportation uses more oil and gas, there will be much more NFW in the atmosphere and hurricane intensity increases significantly.
Effect of climate change on rapid intensification
Coming back to the article by Prof. Emanuel, he has used the following formula to calculate rate of change in intensity of cyclones where is the surface exchange coefficient of enthalpy and is potential intensity.
One could see that NFW would influence both the surface exchange coefficient of enthalpy as well as the potential intensity.
If one looks at Prof. Emanuels earlier writings on Surface Exchange Coefficients, it could be seen that it is defined based on flux of enthalpy from the surface and the difference between the saturation enthalpy at the surface and the enthalpy of air.
If we consider (a) a situation where there is a lot of gasoline driven road vehicular transportation, and (b) the amount of NFW vapour been generated to give the same amount of energy as CO2 we would see that there would be a 33% increase in enthalpy transfer due to this water vpour been formed to generate energy for vehicular transportation.
As such, when a hurricane enters an area like Houston, with a lot of vehicular transportation, the tendency for increases in intensity will be much larger than in an area where only coal is been used to generate energy. We need to remember that water vapour and waste heat from a vehicle is generated at a level of about 1-2 feet from the earths surface and it would be moving vertically up after leaving the exhaust pipe in the horizontal direction. As such it is very similar to what happens at the sea surface.
On the other hand, when an impending hurricane is announced, all the vehicles in the area get onto the road to move away to safer locations, they may get stuck in severe traffic jams  specially near gas stations and all what we mentionedin the previous paragraph only gets aggravated.
At the same time, NFW will also lead to a higher potential intensity due to the dynamic viscosity of NFW being the lowest amongst the four major components in the atmosphere  nitrogen, oxygen, CO2 and water vapour.
Furthermore, if we decide to use more gas as envisaged by Paris Accord at least till 2035, this would lead to much larger intensity increases during the last 24 hours before land fall.
Extent of downpour
Another aspect  in addition to frequency, intensity and tracks  that need to be considered in respect of a hurricane is the total volume of water that would be delivered by the hurricanes. Andelman has mentioned about the 7% more additional water vapour that need to enter the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity per degree centigrade increase due to greenhouse gas effect of CO2.
But what bothers me is the fact that when somebody burns 1 litre of gasoline, 1.08kg of NFW is also generated and the corresponding increase in temperature due to this and 2.64kg of CO2 generated will make another 3.08kg of water enter the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity.
If Paris Accord works out a specific plan to rectify this, yes, please sign the Paris Accord and be a flag bearer. If this litre of gasoline is replaced by gas as probably proposed by Paris Accord, the amount of NFW and evaporated water vapour to maintain constant relative humidity will be 5.82 kg of total water - 40% increase above the previously mentioned. This is what Paris Accord will do and who wants to support it.
So the issue is NFW and related water vpour which heats up the atmosphere more, brings about hurricanes in greater numbers, intensities and then delivers unbearable amounts of water to bring about landslides, earth slips etc.
While this NFW and related water vapour remains in the atmosphere, it will heat up the atmosphere, pinch you through a wild fire or a long-drawn drought. All this due to the gasoline and gas you burn to get energy when the sun delivers you an unbelievable millions of TWhrs of energy every day.
So the message Nature has conveyed through the recent hurricanes to Mankind is that you need to (i) drop Paris Accord because it does not provide a solution for this, (ii) amend CMIP5 model and bring NFW into the screen and (iii) start a new civilization based on solar energy; of course only if you dont want to get washed away. Dont ever thank that wine-cellars (quite in line with the origin of the Accord) like that of Richard Branson will help you. Noah in comparison, may have been a teetotaler and very kind and concerned about his animals as well.
A probable solution
When I read the IPCC TAR 4  2007which won 50% of the Nobel Peace Prize, I was surprised to see the number of options suggested to replace the gasoline driven vehicles. Then I read those PhD theses at MIT on On the Road in 2035,etc, and also The World Energy Councils Transport Scenarios in 2050 which had a very useful Accessibility, Acceptability and Availability analysis on these different alternatives and indicated the battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would be the most preferred.
On February 11, 2011, I wrote to Daily News that BEV would be the ultimate winner and that will be the only way to keep flooding and other water related disasters away. Prof. Henry Lee of Harvard Kennedy School published his paper in July 2011 to say that BEV will be the ultimate winner. When one sees that even after 10 years since the publication of IPCC TAR 4, the oil and gas driven vehicles are still creating this havoc on humanity one tends to wonder whether IPCC has served its purpose. Ph.Ds may have been awarded, research papers may have been published, models may have been developed ; but the problem remains unsolvedor rather getting aggravated by every liter of oil you burn.
Like what we mentioned in that article in February, 2011, there is only one way to solve this problem and that is by converting our transportation to Battery Electric Vehicles and harnessing solar energy to power these using Highway Solarisation which is defined as a dedicated infrastructure for generating electricity for supply to the main grid and/or powering battery electric vehicles using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways as a solution for climate change.
In fact, UN Climate Summit in September, 2014 established three objectives in respect of this as follows: (a) 30% of vehicles sold in cities in 2030 should be battery electric vehicles, (b) these should be powered by renewable energy and (c) deforestation should be reduced to 0% by 2050. As such you could see that Highway Solarisation is the only solution which would meet all three objectives mentioned and it appears that Climate Summit officials had been convinced about the applicability of this solution. We have been writing to them on this solution since January , 2011.
Conclusion
If there is one single fuel which brings all this misery through hurricanes it is hydrocarbons which generates more water vapour in order to reduce CO2 emission. CO2 never precipitates. Water vapour increases temperature more than CO2 per unit of energy provided. Water vapour promotes hurricanes due to its inherent properties like viscosity, latent heat, specific heat, etc. If Paris Accord promotes hydrocarbons  especially gas  instead of coal, drop it like a brick. If it discourages hydrocarbons support it. This is not about who supports it, where it originated, who signed it, who wanted me to sign it,etc; but purely based on facts of science which can be ignored only at your own peril, rather at every human beings peril.

[Parliament (31-10-2017)]
Political parties should support formulating new constitution
Political parties should not act to defeat the attempt of introducing a new constitution, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The Minister was speaking during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms in Parliament yesterday.
No body needs to fear because a new constitution that would lead to a racial, religious or ethnic conflict would not be moved. The Buddhist prelates do not need to fear since the new constitution would guarantee the same status Buddhism has in the present one, he said.
The Minister said the clauses from one to nine in the Constitution should be kept intact in the new constitution since they would not obstruct devolving powers.
The Mahanayake Theras and the people requested not to amend the clauses pertaining to the unitary status and the place given to Buddhism, Minister de SIlva said. We as the SLFP maintain the same view, he said.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa assured the international community that he would give 13+. The Minister said the SLFP maintained the same view.
President Maithripala Sirisena assured in his election manifesto that he would not amend any clauses of the Constitution that required a referendum, the Minister said.
The SLFP is against the amalgamation of the North and East. Judges to the Constitutional Court should be appointed from the Supreme Court. The governor, as the presidents representative, should have some powers to uphold unitary status and security. Lands should be procured to the President whenever he asked them for the national security, the Minister said.
He said that although the SLFP always requested to change the election system, so far it has not been fulfilled.
Position of Buddhism well protected in new constitution: Kiriella
The position of Buddhism could be well protected by introducing the clauses on Buddhism in the Constitution to the new constitution, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said.
He was participating in the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms in Parliament yesterday.
He said the countrys unitary status would be guaranteed.
The document in hand today was not the final draft and the clauses in the interim report could be changed during the Constitutional Assembly if necessary, he said.
The Minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa said the government would give more powers than in the 13th amendment to the constitution by way of a new constitution while he was the President. Now he stands against a new constitution, Minister Kiriella said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa promised India during the war that he would give 13+ to get their support for he knew he could not win without Indias support, Minister Kiriella said. Former President said he would accept what the Steering Committee suggests on a new Constitution. But he could not appoint the committee as the other parties did not have confidence on it, the Minister said.
The Minister said the unity government was able to bring all parties and all races to one table and prepare an interim report successfully. He said the Tamils asked for their right of language in 1950s, but the then governments did not accept it. He said the country experienced a three-decades civil war as a result.
He said a national land commission would be given the authority of the lands whereas the Police matters would be considered by a national police commission.
The Minister said that when we obtained independence, economy of many countries were far behind us but they have gone passing us as they had managed their ethnic issues. But we were not able to do so, Minister Kiriella said. But after 60 years, we were able to bring all parties and representatives to one table for discussions, he said.
Sumanthiran exposes JOs duplicity
TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran yesterday exposing the duplicity of the Joint Opposition members led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took them to task over their contradictory statements now and then over power sharing and related matters in the Constitution.
Sumanthiran joining the Constitutional Assembly debate yesterday reminded that not only Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena but also UPFA Presidential Candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged to bring in a new constitution in the run-up to the 2015 Presidential polls.
Ninety seven percent of those who voted in January 2015 have voted for a new Constitution. A few individuals standing on the streets cannot deny this fact, he said. He reminded that the Resolution to form a Constitutional Assembly to formulate a new Constitution was passed unanimously in Parliament after extensive debate.
Nobody raised a voice against nor called for a division. Even the Steering Committee and all the sub-committee members were appointed unanimously. The two joint opposition MPs representing the Steering Committee played an active role. Almost 20 percent or more of the entire contents of the Steering Committee minutes are their participation, he said.
Sumanthiran said MPs Namal Rajapaksa and Shehan Semasinghe, who cried foul that their views had not been incorporated in the Law and Order Sub-Committee report, were invited by the Steering Committee to present their case. The Prime Minister requested them to present their views in writing in one week. They agreed but nothing came to the Steering Committee, Sumanthiran said.
Establishing his partys case for a new Constitution to resolve the national question, Sumanthiran said the TNA was for a one, undivided and even indivisible country.
In the interest of reaching an acceptable consensus, the TNA is willing to consider agreement with the main principles articulated in the Interim Report if the same are acceptable to the two main parties. We are striving hard to achieve a consensus which we can put before our people. If the country is to remain one, different people in this country must have a share of the governance. We do not want to be second class citizens in this country. That is why we seek maximum possible devolution of power. Until we are treated as equals, we will never be in a position to say we are proud of being Sri Lankans, he remarked.
Sumanthiran, exposing the contradictory views held by former President Rajapaksa over the 13th Amendment, reminded that Rajapaksa was in the forefront in the Hartal against the 13A in 1987 at Pettah saying the country was going to be divided. The same Rajapaksa, when he was in power, repeatedly said that he would implement the 13A in full and even go beyond it to make power sharing meaningful. Not only that, when the Provincial Council elections are postponed today, he is screaming his head off asking for PC polls he said.
When the 2000 August Constitution Bill was presented, Mahinda Rajapaksa as a Cabinet Minister of the then Government supported it. Today, in the Interim Report, we say that the country is one or in other words ekeeya rajya. The Constitutional Bill in 2000 does not even say that. It says Sri Lanka is a union of regions. The UNP burnt the copy of this Bill because there was a transitional provision with regard to the Executive Presidency, and not because of its clause on power sharing, he recalled.
Rajapaksa formed the APRC and pushed for maximum power sharing. It recommended not having a concurrent list. But today we have no objection for a short concurrent list, he said.
Then why do you say the country is going to be divided by this report, whereas you approved a draft bill that went far beyond what is contemplated in this interim report when you were in power. Is it not to mislead the people of this country and prevent a final resolution to the national question that has plagued this country ever since independence he questioned from the Joint Opposition MPs.
We do not oppose Buddhists having foremost place
TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran yesterday making his partys case for a secular and federal state, said if Buddhists wish to be in the foremost place, they (TNA) have no objection of granting it to them.
Yet he questioned how could any Buddhist defends that position in line with the teachings of Buddhism.
I am not a Buddhist. I dont like to be told that I am a second class citizen in this country. It is up to this House to decide whether you want a Constitution that does not treat all of its citizens equally. We will not stand in the way if Buddhists want the foremost position, but it is an indefensible position for the Buddhists to take. How can any Buddhist stand up and say that they are above the others who follow other faiths he questioned.
We have said Sri Lanka must be a federal state. There is a wrong view that the call for federalism comes from the Tamil people because they want to separate from this country. Nothing can be furthest from the truth. The federal idea was introduced to this country by former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926. He wrote six letters to the Ceylon Morning Leader on federalism. He categorically stated that Ceylon must be a federal state, Sumanthiran said tabling the six letters in the House. Even the Communist Party had articulated its position in the past that Sri Lanka must be a federal state, he said.
Constitutional reforms must abolish Executive Presidency: JVP
The JVP yesterday reiterated its position that the Executive Presidency must be abolished under the proposed Constitutional reforms.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake taking part in the Constitutional Assembly debate said the Executive Presidency has contributed to large scale corruption in the country.
Executive Presidents tend to cover up his corrupt ministers. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the most recent example to prove the case; all his predecessors more or less did the same, he said.
He said the Executive Presidency over the past 40 years produced dictators, invited corruption, interfered in the judiciary overwhelmingly and restricted Parliament to a mere rubber stamp.
This history speaks that the Executive Presidency has not protected the country, he said.
Abolishing Executive Presidency was a key pre-election promise of all Presidents elected to power since 1994. The public discussion in the run-up to the 2015 Presidential Polls was centred on the abolition of Executive Presidency. The hue and cry against the Constitution that we see in the country has suppressed this important dialogue on Executive Presidency, he said.
The JVP is in favour of a multi-party democratic system with a President appointed by Parliament with limited powers, the MP said.
MP Rathnayake said the Constitution was revised 19 times and it has big holes that could not be patched up with amendments.
New Constitution will not solve the economic and social problems in the country, but it will be helpful in attaining solutions to certain political problems plaguing the country, he said.
The JVP MP said various parties were trying to see the continuance of Executive Presidency by creating fear psychosis in the minds of the people that Buddhism in peril and unitary status of the country is in danger.
New constitution formulated on foreigners instructions: Dinesh
The new constitution is formulated on foreigners instructions, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said.
He made these observations yesterday during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms in Parliament.
He stated that the Steering Committee report was prepared unilaterally.
Gunawardena said the committee took only views of 3,000 people. When we take into account the number of voters in the country, a ridiculously low number contributed, MP Gunawardena said. That is why the SLFPers stands against the constitution, he said.
The JO demands to stop this endeavour that has grave implications on the country, he said. Fourteen suggestions the JO made were not included in the report. The Government exploit parliamentary power in this case, he said.
He questioned what happened to the six sub committee reports. He added that the Joint Opposition disagreements are not included in the reports. The Tamil Translation of the report does not contain the phrase unitary status but of a united government which cannot be acceptable, he said.
The majority of the people object this new constitution, MP Gunawardena said.
The Government is attempting to go for a federal concept. We oppose it. The powers of the central government should not be limited, he said.
If the same new constitution was passed, it would divide the country, he said.
NFF MPs in protest outside lunch in Parliament canteen
The National Freedom Front (NFF) MPs who led the demonstration near the Parliament roundabout yesterday against the Constitutional proposals were subsequently seen at the MPs canteen in Parliament enjoying their lunch.
The five NFF Parliamentarians led by MP Wimal Weerawansa refrained from taking part in the debate on Constitutional Reforms as they pulled out of the Constitutional Assembly in July.
Without placing their views on record and arguing their case inside the main chamber, the NFF MPs resorted to protest on streets outside Parliament seeking media spotlight.
Despite the fact they boycotted the debate, they were present in Parliament at the lunchtime to have their meals.

Pepper industry vital to Lankas economy: President
Almost all countries including Sri Lanka depend on the contribution of the export agricultural sector to earn foreign exchange and increase foreign reserves. Pepper used as a food item, a medicine as well as a raw material for the perfume industry, has a great demand internationally, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The pepper industry in Sri Lanka has systematically progressed and come to the forefront in recent times, he said.
The President made this observation addressing the inaugural 45th sessions of the International Pepper Community held at Earl's Regency Hotel, Kandy, yesterday.
The annual sessions and meetings are jointly organised by the Primary Industries Ministry and the Export Agriculture Department.
Welcoming the delegates attending the sessions, President Sirisena said delegates who attended the previous 44 sessions over the years would have gained a wealth of information regarding the industry. The pepper industry sector is a vital sector in the economy of Sri Lanka.
He said the pepper sector faced many challenges in trying to achieved its annual targets. Among them were climate change and plant diseases which threatened the industry.
Added to this, there were changes in market demand. Such challenges were common to other agricultural industries such as tea.
Problems had arisen in the re-export of pepper and tea after value addition, he said.
Pepper prices had been affected by the re-export industry. Prices had dropped sharply giving rise to marketing problems.
The government had intervened and held several rounds of talks to address these problems. Provision of high quality farm products including pepper enabled customers to purchase quality goods at affordable prices. They should all join hands to create the necessary background to ensure this, he said.
The President said the Primary Industries Minister had launched several projects to promote spice exports including pepper during the last two years.
"We in Sri Lanka lagging behind in export products in the international market. The state and private sectors as farmers should pay more attention towards increasing our agricultural exports," he said.
It was with this objective in view that the government recently launched a production drive two months ago. Emphasis had been laid on developing the pepper industry too under the production drive as well as the Grama Shakthi movement, he added. Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Ministry Secretary Bandula Wickramarachchi also spoke. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and International Pepper Community Executive Director Hoang Thi Lien were also present.

Pet Scanner operational in January
The Pet Scanner bought with public funds collected with the assistance of the Kadijah Foundation and a number of other organisations and persons etc will be provided to the National Institute of Cancer in Maharagama in Januray, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. According to Minister Senaratne, the Pet Scanner which is made in Germany will be given to the hospital in Januray, next year.
"The tender procedure of the Health Ministry took 9 to 15 months which is a long time. Another company submitted an appeal, but,now the machine has been ordered," the Minister said.
The public donated Rs.200 million to the Government to purchase the PET Scanner for the National Institute of Cancer in Maharagama. The fund raising campaign was implemented by Kadijah Foundation and several other organisations, individuals etc. The fund raising campaign was completed in June last year (2016).
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine functional imaging technique that is used to observe metabolic processes in the body.
Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis.
PET Scans assist oncologists immensely to determine the latest status of cancers in patients bodies.

PM optimistic of the future
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was buoyant yesterday when he presented the two year progress report of the government led by the United National Party.
Addressing the media and partymen at the Sirikotha party headquarters, an optimistic Prime Minister said the United National Party succeeded in bringing an era of transformation to the country.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said his party, when in power has always brought out a change in the country adding that it is prepared to face challenges.
The Prime Minister added that the past two years have been transformational for Sri Lanka and the party in the national government has strengthened Sri Lankas democracy, giving rights back to people and the media who can now comment freely and without fear.
It is only with the UNP in the national government and with our economic plan that we can continue to build on on this progress, strengthen our economy and ensure that all Sri Lankans are sharing in our new properity, the Premier said.
Prime minister Wickremesinghe stated that the UNP had to take charge of a country that was in a similar state of a dying patient and their first and foremost achievement was that forming the national government with the aid of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
The UNP in the national government has been delivering across the board for Sri Lankans. There should be no doubt about this. We are building a stronger economy, the Premier said.
He added that the Government was able to help over 200,000 families to secure a home, improve the lives and security of hundreds of thousands of families and contribute to the UNPs mission to ensure all Sri Lankans are sheltered by 2025.
The UNP has already ensured 400,000 employment opportunities in the country, a nutritious pack worth Rs.20,000 for pregnant mothers and a salary increase of Rs.10,000 to government servants.
The Party is committed to ensuring that ordinary families, vulnerable people and poor communities in our society receive the necessary support. Therefore the UNP continues to provide Rs.20,000 to pregnant women, the Prime Minister said
He added that the government is lowering the cost of living for ordinary families by reducing the prices of essential items including the price of fuel which has been reduced up to 22%.
The Prime Minister said the party could make an immense difference for the betterment of the country by firstly tackling the crippling financial burden left by the previous regime by bringing down the debt and deficit which the country had no revenue to pay through a discussion held with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The UNP is building a stronger economy and making solid progress and the biggest development achievement is that we are going to repay the debt in our lifetime.
Therefore, undoubtedly these two years has been transformational for Sri Lanka, the Prime minister said.
Under the UNP, Sri Lanka attracted 2 million visitors for the first time in history and increased foreign investment attracting investments into strategic infrastructure projects necessary to sustain economic growth. Also, the UNP has been able to secure freedom for Sri Lankans by regaining the GSP+ trade concessions from the European Union giving duty free access to our biggest export market,Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
In 2016, the UNP introduced the Nearest School is the Best School to develop 600 schools and upgrade primary and secondary schools. Also, Sri Lanka launched the first free insurance policy for school children in South East Asia under this government,Premier Wickremsinghe said.
The government is also bringing back stability and security so that people can enjoy peace of mind and live without fear. Since the UNP took office, serious crime rates have declined by almost a third, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that the country was in utter chaos under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
Denial of human rights, rampant fraud and corruption were the order of the day during the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, the Prime Minister said.
Now there is rule of law in the country and crime has gone down. This is the difference when the United National Party is in power, the Prime Minister added.

Qatar Emir accuses blockade countries of wanting regime change
QATAR: Qatar's emir in an interview which aired on Sunday accused Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies of seeking to topple his government with its nearly five-month-old political and economic embargo of the tiny Gulf state.
"They want a regime change. It's... so obvious," Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani told CBS's 60 Minutes.
"History as well tells us, teaches us they tried to do that before, in 1996 after my father became the emir. So, and they made it also so obvious in the last couple of weeks."
The Gulf crisis erupted on June 5 when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposing economic sanctions as it accused the emirate of supporting terrorism and of becoming too close with Shia rival Iran.
Riyadh and its allies closed land and maritime borders, suspended air links and expelled Qatari citizens. Doha denies the charges.
"They dont like our independence, the way how we are thinking, our vision for the region," Sheikh Tamin said on Sunday.
"We want freedom of speech for the people of the region. And theyre not happy with that. And so they think that this is a threat to them."
When Arab streets exploded across the region in 2011, Qatar openly backed the uprisings that eventually toppled longstanding dictators. The upheavals unnerved Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to Sheikh Tamin.
When the border was shut, there was a dairy shortage. But in three months entire farms rose from the desert. If the Cold War had its Berlin Airlift, the Gulf crisis has its bovine airlift. More than a thousand cows a month are imported by plane from California, Wisconsin and Washington state, CBS said on its website.
Across Qatar, a sense of urgency has galvanised the country to meet the current threat, CBS said.- AFP

Rs.40,000 spirited away during Saturn transit
A couple, who sought the assistance of an exorcist to overcome the malefic effects of the recent planetary change caused by the transit of Saturn, had to cope with shattered hopes and the loss of Rs. 40,000, according to a report from Lenadora, Dambulla.
When the couple consulted the exorcist, he had told them to arrange a pooja at their residence to coincide with the planetary change.
Accordingly, the exorcist had placed images of four deities in the hall of the residence and asked the couple to place Rs.10,000 cash each on a betel leaf in front of each image saying they could take the cash back after the ritual.
After starting the invocation to the deities, the exorcist had sent the couple out in search of additional offerings.
The wife was sent out to fetch for empty coconut shells and the husband to bring a banana leaf. As there had been stoic silence as they entered the house, the exorcist had been missing and nowhere to be seen while the Rs. 40,000 cash had also been spirited away.
As the couple ran helter skelter searching for the exorcist who had disappeared, neighbours had said it was a search in vain as they had been tricked by the exorcist and cautioned them not to resort to such foolish things in future.

Sacked MP Wijesekara confuses Parliament with crossover
UPFA MP Dulip Wijesekara, who was sacked from his Deputy Ministerial post on Sunday, staged a crossover, confusing the Constitutional Assembly in Parliament yesterday.
MP Dulip Wijesekara, rising to a Point of Order at the outset of the debate on Constitutional reforms, said he decided to crossover in protest of the Constitution-making process, which the Chief Prelates of the country have objected.
He then tore the document and crossed the well of the House and sat on the Opposition benches as the Joint Opposition members thumped on their desks to welcome him.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at this point reminded that the House has been convened as a Committee with the Mace not being placed in the podium.
This is not a regular Parliament sitting to make a statement and crossover.
If a member wants to make a statement and switch parties, that should be done when the Mace is at the podium and when the Speaker is at his chair. If the member is not even aware of this basic fact, then what else have we got to say he remarked.
Many members thumped on their desks in agreement with the Premiers statement.
As TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, who was standing at the time of the crossover, continued to make his speech, MP Wijesekara was seen handing over a letter to the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament.
MP Wijesekara also joined in the demonstration organized by the Joint Opposition near the Parliament roundabout.

The Management of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in a statement would like to inform the general public of Sri Lanka and reiterated their legitimacy following the media statements that are currently circulated through the Department of Government Information.
The SAITM statement: "SAITM was established as a Degree Awarding Institute in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and is recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).
SAITM was established with the aim of providing quality private medical education in the country to augment the requirement of quality doctors to serve the people of the nation.
Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM. Therefore, these proposals need to be discussed at length with all stakeholders to ensure that justice to concerned parties are met. Going forward, we hope that SAITM graduates will be given provisional registration, subject to court proceedings and the current students education will continue without any disruption to their studies.
We also note positively, the vision of SAITMs founder Dr.Neville Fernandos to produce quality non state doctors will continue despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests.

Shanil Nethicumara files FR seeking interim order to prevent arrest

Shanil Nethicumara, who is involved in his family business run under the name of SALAKA, has filed a Fundamental Rights Petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order preventing CID from arresting him over an allegation that he posed a death threat to Wijith Wijesuriya over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The petitioner filed this Fundamental Rights petition through his counsel Sanath Wijewardane naming IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara and the Attorney General as respondents.
The Petitioner states that what was essentially a personal dispute has been deviously manipulated by 4thRespondent Wijith Wijesuriya the brother of Anika Wijesuriya and other interested parties into an allegation of threats to a witness before the Bond Commission.
The petitioner said he became aware that the aforesaid Anika Wijesuriya, who studied at the same school with the Petitioner, too had been called to give evidence before the said Bond Commission, pertaining to an apartment allegedly purchased by the aforesaid Arjun Aloysius from Anika Wijesuriya, which was being occupied and subsequently allegedly purchased by MP Ravi Karunanayake.
The petitioner stated that on or about the 14th October 2017 at round1.30 AM, he visited the night club named Love Bar Club located at 58A, Horton Place, Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7 which is a usual location the Petitioner visits during the weekends.
The Petitioner had a few drinks of liquor from the aforesaid club and later on towards dawn he walked up to the Gents Washroom and waited in the queue to enter the same.
The 4th Respondent Wijith Wijesuriya who appeared to be under the influence of liquor came from behind a curtain at the entrance of the wash room and started a quarrel with the Petitioner accusing him of being instrumental in the breakup of the love affair between him and the Petitioners sister.
The Petitioner categorically states he never threatened the 4th Respondent in respect of Anika Wijesuriyas evidence against Ravi Karunanayake MP. He states that even though the exchange of words was a heated exchange it related to what transpired in the early hours of the day at the Love Bar club and the 4th Respondents conduct in respect of his sister.
The Petitioner states that he became aware through the media that Yasantha Kodagoda PC, Additional Solicitor General had on 17thOctober 2017 informed the Bond Commission, that the Petitioner had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya.
The Petitioner states that when he became aware of the above on the 17th October 2017 he lodged a complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station against the 4th Respondent for assaulting and threatening him at the said Love Bar club on 14th October 2017.
The Petitioner states that on 18th October 2017, several national newspapers too reported that Additional Solicitor General Mr. Yasantha Kodagoda PC informed the Bond Commission 17th October 2017 that Anika Wijesuriya who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission fled the country due to death threats posed to her by various parities affiliated with Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that the newspaper articles implied that ASG Yasantha Kodagoda had informed the Bond Commission that the Petitioner posed death threats to Anika Wijesuriya directly.
The Petitioner states that he was taken by surprise to read the claim that Anika Wijesuriya fled the country due to death threats posed to her by the Petitioner, as he learned from reports published in internet that Anika Wijesuriya left the country on 6th October 2017 before 7 to 8 days from the date on which the telephone conversations occurred.
The Petitioner further states that it has been alleged in the media that, Anika Wijesuriyas entire first week of October was spent in Bali and thereafter en route to London she had arrived in Colombo on 5th October 2017 in the aircraft bearing No EK 349 at1.55 a.m.The Petitioner states that as per the same article, from2.08 a.m.of 5th October 2017 she was in Colombo until she left the country from aircraft bearing No. EK 655 on 6th October 2017 at to 10.10 p.m.
The Petitioner verily believes that accordingly Anika Wijesuriya was during the said time period spending a vacation out of the country and the position that she fled the country due to any death threats is far from truth.
The Petitioner states that in all the afore mentioned newspapers, it was reported that ASG Yasantha Kodagoda stressed that an investigation must be carried out with regard to the incident and that the Police protection must be provided to family members of Anika Wijesuriya under Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015. The Petitioner states that as per the newspaper articles, Anika Wijesuriya was already been named as a witness under the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.
The Petitioner states that by the contents of all newspaper articles aforementioned, the inference made was that the Petitioner posed death threats to the 4th Respondent over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that on October 20th2017, a national newspaper reported that the Criminal Investigation Department had commenced investigations into the alleged incident of posing death threats to Anika Wijewardana and the investigation is carried out in relation to Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the Petitioner who was again described therein as a cousins son of the former Minister Ravi Karunananyake.
The Petitioner states that he apprehends that he will be subject to arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015, which stipulates that bail can be granted only under exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner also seeking an interim order directing the CID Director to take appropriate steps according to law to prevent the owners or managers or employees of the Love Bar Club from tampering with the CCTV cameras installed at the club and from deleting/destroying any footage recorded in the system on 14th October 2017.

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) is to set up an Enforcement Unit to take action against tourist establishments not registered with the SLTDA.
A senior official from the SLTDA speaking to the Daily News said it was mandatory that all tourist establishments register with them and that they receive a license to operate.He added that they were developing their resources to have the Unit operate around the country.
According to SLTDA data, only 50 percent of all tourist places in the country are registered with them, making it harder for the Authority to monitor whether these establishments are up to standard and in accordance with the SLTDA regulations.
The Tourism Businesses Licensing System registers classified tourist hotels, boutique hotels, boutique villas, tourist hotels, guest houses, restaurants, travel agencies, spa and wellness centers, rented apartments, heritage bungalows, rented homes, bungalows, heritage homes, home stay units, tourist shops, spice gardens, tourist guides and water based adventure sport centres.
The SLTDA official further noted that the Authority was also in the process of updating their structure and that they would take legal action against any persons not registered with the Authority. This would also include larger hotels which are yet to obtain the SLTDA registration.

Sri Lanka needs permanent policy on working expats
Sri Lanka should come up with a long-term policy on foreigners working in the island, said Anthony Watson, Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Visa Worldwide (Pte) Limited.
He said that the tax on their earnings keeps on changing and this is not good. We need a clear and long-term policy not only on earnings of foreigners, but also on other matters relating to work visas, work permits, income tax and other matters. We dont know what is going to happen tomorrow.
"If you take a country like Singapore, the laws on foreigners working there have not changed for decades."
He said that Sri Lanka also needs better places for entertainment, especially for kids similar to that available in Australia and other parts of the world. Yes, there are hotels, but people need large entertainment areas in Colombo, where both kids and parents can relax and enjoy.
"However, we are happy that the country has no terrorism and violence. He said that he is happy with the standard of education in Sri Lanka, especially for expat kids as there is a choice. Health care standards are also good, he said.
Commenting on Visa's operations in Sri Lanka, he said that the country is slowly but surely moving away from using cash and looking at other options.
Q: How do you rate Visa's operations in Sri Lanka
A: Sri Lanka has seen a 15% increase in the use of credit and 11% in debit cards until July 2017, according to Central Bank figures. There are over 19.5 million cards in total in circulation in Sri Lanka.
Today, there are more than 18 million debit cards and 1.4 million credit cards in circulation, providing around 70 per cent of the population with access to a digital form of payment. Combined with 126 per cent mobile penetration (where one person could own more than one SIM), I believe Sri Lanka is well placed to become the first South Asian economy to truly transition into a digital economy.
Transactions done on cards last year sans cash withdrawals were Rs 290 billion and this number excludes cash withdrawals from 2016 and includes POS and e-commerce transactions as well.
As only less than 5% of transactions are done via cards, there is a lot of opportunity for the industry to grow. We see a greater shift from cash to cards, which is encouraging.
I must also say that last month, I travelled 1,168 km around the country on a three wheeler in the pursuit of going cashless and raising funds for charity, as part of the 2017 Pimp My Tuk Tuk Challenge.
This is the second year the Pimp My Tuk Tuk Challenge has taken place in Sri Lanka and in 2017 the journey saw 52 local and international riders in 26 tuk tuks raise more than US$250,000 for local charities across the country.
I feel extremely privileged to have been able to take part in this challenge, which has given me tremendous insight into the local communities across this beautiful country and the opportunity to give back by fundraising along the way.
The tuk tuk journey, consisting of a convoy of brightly painted three wheelers, delivered supplies and supported charity projects all the way from Chilaw to Trincomalee and Hambantota, finally winding up in Galle and Hikkaduwa, before returning to Colombo.
As the usage of smartphones and internet grows throughout Sri Lanka, so will the willingness on the part of consumers to embrace technology. Various business models and apps being used are going to change the landscape for payments in Sri Lanka. There is likely to be a surge of growth in digital payments in this manner.
Contactless payments are rapidly growing in popularity across the world and in Sri Lanka too, this segment is showing growth. In Sri Lanka, contactless payments began rolling out only in September 2016 and so far growth numbers across the first 12 months are growing rapidly.
Q: Whatare thenew innovations that you see in Sri Lankan industry in this segment
A: In addition to the shift to card payments, we also see more apps being created in the banking segment for customers to move to online and phone banking.
Today, movie tickets, transport and several dining options too are offered online and this segment is growing. This indicates the appetite of the people to move towards digital space.
Q: How do you see the Visa business in Maldives
A: Here again we see increase in business and this is mainly driven by tourism.
Q: What is the best place you like to spend a holiday in Sri Lanka
A: Firstly, I must say that the standard and services of the hotels are of very high quality. I like the Cultural Triangle and also Yala. I am also fascinated by the Trincomalee beach. Sri Lankan biodiversity is huge and is similar to that of Australia. But you can see different terrain in Sri Lanka in a shorter time.
I must also say that the attitude of Sri Lankans to help is in their DNA and this is really highlighted when people are in distress.
Once when our car broke down a local came forward to our assistance and even went on his motorbike to the next garage to fix our vehicle problem, just for nothing. This is amazing.
Q: What do you miss in Sri Lanka
A: Its definitely the Australian cool beer and Aussie meat pie!

Minister Senaratne pointed out that more steps are to be taken in the future to minimize the sugar consumption to protect individuals from NCDs such as diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure etc. Smoking has gone down at present by 46 percent due to introducing the 90 percent tax on tobacco.
In 2016, Rs. 235 billion was allocated for the health sector from the Budget. This year, more funds will be allocated for the health sector. A new nursing faculty with all facilities to train 2,000 nursing degree holders will be established at Sri Jayawardenepura, he added.

TISSL International Conference for heads of schools
The International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL), which is an association of premier international schools in Sri Lanka, was formed in 2001 with the main aim of fostering good relationships with its 25 member schools. The association also organizes annual international conferences with heads and decision makers of member international schools and non-member international schools, state schools and private schools in the region in order to exchange best practices and enhance the quality of teaching-learning practices in schools.
Over the past three decades, there has been a significant rise in the number of international schools in Sri Lanka following English medium instruction, which has been due to the growing demand of parents opting to educate their children in a language that the world speaks.
This years TISSL Conference will take place at the cross roads between extensive infrastructure development of educational institutions in the government sector as well as educational institutions in the private sector. With this in mind, the Chairperson of the TISSL association leading the TISSL Conference Organizing Committee - Mrs. Kumari Grero and her team, identified a timely theme for this conference  Unleashing Problem Solvers. Under this theme, three reputed professionals from foreign countries have been invited to share their expertise to school leaders and decision makers in Sri Lankas international schools community, in order to help them identify and tackle any upcoming issues during the planning phase of this infrastructure development.
Pearson and Cambridge Assessment International Education are the Principal Sponsors of this event and will each host a prominent speaker to share their expertise related to the theme of the conference.
The British Council teamed up as a Co-Sponsor and will sponsor Sir Michael Wilshaw, who will grace this event as the Chief Guest and deliver the key note address to participants. With over 50 years of experience in education and successful incumbencies as the former Chief Inspector of Schools in England and the former head of Ofsted, his insights on education will be extremely beneficial and relevant to the theme of this conference. Another Co-Sponsor of this event is Monash University.
The TISSL conference will also highlight and demonstrate TISSLs commitment to bring best practices of world class education and foster close co-operation between member schools and all other schools in Sri Lanka who are faced with this challenge. A variety of presentation formats await all participants, which include the key note address as well as other speeches backed by multi-media presentations, speech moderation and interactive group activities. A dance item and choir performance will also add colour and value to the three day event.

Traditional strategies to rebuild Uva-Wellassa
It was a herculean task to rebuild the broken economy which the government inherited under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, said the Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa.
The Minister made this comment at a meeting held at Moneragala, Madulla Divisional Secretariat office on Sunday(29).
Minister Zoysa said, nearly 200 years ago Uva-Wellassa was destroyed by the colonizers who governed our country and since then, all governments have had to face the challenge of rebuilding Uva-Wellassa.
The government is implementing traditional strategies to rebuild the Uva-Wellassa region by rehabilitating the tanks, ponds and other water resources destroyed by the British rulers, he said.
He explained that the Kumbukkan Oya Water Project in the Moneragala Divisional Secretariat area and the Hada Oya Water Project in Siyabalanduwa DS area were the main water projects that the government commenced recently and that the resettlement of people in the catchment areas was the key issue to be solved soon.
The Minister further added that the Kumbukkan Oya water Project could add 15 MW of electricity to the national grid, provide drinking water and water to cultivate 18,000 acres of paddy.
Minister Zoysa said that though the economy was agrarian based, many farmers who engage in chena cultivation faced many hardships as they did not possess proper legal documents for their land. Thus it was a timely need to have them focus more on more economical crops such as paddy and rubber, the latter he said would help increase the forest density in the area.
Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anuradha Jayaratna said, the President will take all measures to ensure protection of the environment through the implementation of eco-friendly projects throughout the country.
Minister Anuradha said forest cover should be increased to minimize natural disasters that Sri Lankans face annually.
He said, the farmers should pay more attention to the issues pertaining to environment when they engage in cultivation.
The Deputy Minister assured a long term solution to grievances raised by the farmer community regarding the conflict between wildlife officers and farmers, on the ownership of government land that they cultivate.
The Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathna, Irrigation and water Resources Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, Director General of Wildlife Conservation Anura Satarasinghe, Moneragala District Secretary D.S.Pathmakulasuriya, Additional District Secretary Land P. Somarathna, Wildlife officers and other officials conducted field visits to Pubbara Village in Medagama DS area on the same day to ascertain the feasibility of resettling the people under the Kumbukkan Oya Project.

Victory for education
Finally, there is light at the end of the tunnel for the issue concerning the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine, popularly known as SAITM. There were two schools of thought with regard to SAITM - some argued that it should continue as a private higher educational institution while others called for either its abolition or a Government takeover.
Despite attempts by the Joint Opposition and some others to portray the SAITM as a baby of the present Yahapalana Government, it came into existence during the regime of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who even ensured funding for its academic activities. His Government even provided scholarships for a number of students to study at SAITM. In fact, it is JO firebrand Dinesh Gunawardena himself who presented the SAITM legislation in Parliament. Many organisations that oppose the SAITM tooth and nail now maintained a deafening silence then.
However, that did not mean that the new Government could wash its hands off the matter. To its eternal credit, it confronted the issue head-on and maintained a healthy dialogue with all concerned parties including the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), student unions, parents and students of State universities as well as those of SAITM. Accordingly, a Presidential Committee was appointed to resolve issues related to SAITM. As a first step towards an eventual solution, the Government took over the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe with the fullest cooperation and consent of Dr. Fernando.
The same committee has now recommended abolishing the SAITM Medical Faculty and establishing a not-for-profit Institute under the supervision of the Higher Education Ministry for its operations and management. The Government Information Department in a press statement disclosed the eight-point recommendations of the Committee headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva on SAITM.
The Committees proposals are aimed at a permanent solution to the long-drawn issue of the SAITM and its medical degree. With the abolition of SAITM, the profit oriented entity owned and managed by Dr. Neville Fernando and family will cease to exist. The Committee has specifically stated that the current shareholders of SAITM shall not participate in the ownership or management of the new entity.
This is certainly a step in the right direction. With the profit motive gone and new standards of admission implemented, no one should harbour unfounded fears over the suitability of graduates produced by the institution that would replace SAITM. According to the proposals, the assets, liabilities, staff and students of SAITM shall be transferred to a non-state, not-for-profit making degree awarding entity that will comply with the minimum standards on Medical Education and Training.
The Government has already consulted several already established non-state, not-for-profit entities with the objective of establishing the proposed not-for-profit entity for this purpose. The new entity will recognise all students currently enrolled at SAITM, who possess the required entry qualifications and an opportunity will be afforded to these students to continue medical education in the proposed new institution.
Since much time has already been wasted on this issue, the Government has declared that this entire process shall be mandatorily completed by December 31, 2017. Indeed, delaying the process any further would be a massive injustice to all university students, whose academic activities have already been hampered for months due to the activities of anti-SAITM political organisations with vested interests.
No solution can entirely satisfy all parties, but this seems to be a very reasonable and effective proposal that should be given a chance. Even the bitterest critics of SAITM have agreed in principle that private higher educational institutions should function to address the massive imbalance caused by the lack of opportunities for students who fail to gain admission to State universities. After all, there has been virtually no opposition to the hundreds of other private higher educational institutions that offer degree courses in everything from engineering to agriculture.
The critics point, not entirely unreasonable, is that since doctors literally have the patients lives in their hands, they must be duly qualified to enter the profession from the very foundation of their studies. There is, for example, a clear knowledge gap between someone who has three simple passes at the A/Ls and another who has two As and one B. With the imminent establishment of minimum standards for medical education, public or private, the Government is set to address this concern. We hope that the critics including the GMOA will in turn appreciate this move.
Millions of dollars in foreign exchange flow to foreign universities as a result of Lankan students going abroad for studies. At least a part of these funds can be saved if there are more private universities here, which will also attract regional students and actually earn foreign exchange. We cannot afford to be confined to medieval thinking since other countries in the SAARC region and Asia have already overtaken us in the sphere of private higher education. If the Governments Vision 2025 Programme is to succeed, we cannot afford to lag behind in education, a vital catalyst for development.

Wanted: qualified political candidates
Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. A good man brings forth good things out of the abundance of good stored in his heart. A bad man could bring only evil things out of the evil he has filled his heart with. When the heart is filled with an abundance of thoughts, be they loving and compassionate, understanding, indulgent and forgiving, ignorant, wildly angry and intimidating, threatening and foolish, it erupts at the first occasion in reply to a situation that elicits a response in a considerate or magnanimous or reactionary, intolerant and belligerent manner.
Thoughts find expression through language. Language gets fiery and expressive when thoughts are heated by reactionary emotion and responses are calmed by reason, serenity and peace. We have often experienced the serene peaceable composure or the silent sadness of our mothers and fathers. They responded with gentle wisdom to the angry and livid outbursts of our adolescent and youthful years. Their temperate reprimands brought us back to good sense. Their patience and immeasurable love brims over even in the face of the heat of anger of their children who soon learn from their mothers who teach without speaking. When a heart is filled with loving kindness and compassion even an angry provocation is met with patient understanding and indulgence.
There is a true story of the Saintly Mother Theresa of Kolkata who used to approach rich people to seek help for the poor she was looking after. When she approached the owner of a bakery and in a humble gesture of begging asked for some bread for her orphans, he got very angry and spat on her face and scolded her. Mother Theresa calmly took out her handkerchief and patiently wiped the spittle off and without any annoyance said, Thanks for whatever you gave me, but what will you give to help my poor people. The rich man was stunned by her response. He gave her sufficient funds to help the poor people she was looking after.
It takes a lot of inner resilience to respond to peak anger the way Mother Theresa did. However she teaches us that an interior spiritual strength carries forth also a patience needed to respond to vehement wickedness.
Political madness and anger
The drafting of a New Constitution, a basic and just law for all, attempts to structure sane and solid relationships towards the greater solidarity, fraternity, civility and progress of all people and all parts of Sri Lanka. However the democratic exercise has occasioned the eruption of long-held prejudices, fears of insecurity and anti-democratic stances and attitudes in the narrow hearts of some people who were fierce critics of the existing constitution.
Paradoxically, in the opposition, they wish to keep the constitution they denigrated. These strange attitudes finding expression through unbridled tongues seem to threaten the free options of the majority of the people who have given a mandate to the government headed by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who have ventured on a democratic consultation of the people who have a claim to the land they have for centuries legally inhabited having inherited them from their forefathers.
This collaborative initiative supported by the majority of the people seems to irritate the rejected elements defeated by the people. Though rejected, they blatantly exhibit totalitarian, dictatorial and inhuman tendencies and wish to impose their stand on the people by threat of annihilation and mass murder and genocide and the very obliteration of the state legislature by bombing seemingly showing they are possessed by an underworld satanic power. Politics drives uneducated and uncouth people lacking self-control to madness and frenzied anger.
While they should be dealt legally for sowing social ill-will that disturbs the peace, people should be protected from political thugs. The government should be able to look after the parliamentary complex. Other things have to be done in the meantime.
Keep people informed
The people should get to know properly the facts of the situation of the people of Sri Lanka and understand how selfish and egoistic politicians have denied human rights and justice to the ethnic and religious minorities to whom a fair deal has been long overdue. The will of the majority of the people, who wish to uphold democratic values and live in solidarity with all others and mutually share the respect, honour and dignity of equal citizenship, should be strengthened by sober and true information about the intentions of the government towards the long-standing stable and peaceful future of Sri Lanka.
It is up to the members of the government to speak unambiguously in one voice and keep all the people well-informed and appeal to their intelligence, sense of justice and fairness and good civic sense and not allow them to be misinformed and misguided by self-absorbed and evil megalomaniacs who wish to capriciously manoeuvre themselves to power by bringing about social chaos through pitting large sections of the people against the minorities of Tamil, Muslim and Christian communities. These megalomaniacs are presently at the receiving end of the due deserts of the corrupt deals they have engaged in when they abused power with impunity. So they wish to devise many escape routes to avoid the doom that awaits them as the retribution for their social misdeeds.
The members of the government too have to put their house in order. The unbridled corruption of the last government is no excuse for them to be just 25 to 50% less corrupt. They should all come totally clean and first put the interests of the country before that of their party and their individual selves or else leave politics to others more capable and honest. And the government should prepare and put before the people candidates of the highest integrity with a good educational, professional and social background, for the Provincial and Parliamentary elections, so that, once elected, their performance may not disappoint but tangibly improve the lot of the people and advance the common good.

Will Ray Illingworths track record as a successful captain help our cause
At present, nothing seems to go right with present cricket set up and I thought the readers might be interested in delving into the late seventies where Raymond Illingworth ruled the roost as a highly successful captain for England.
According to John Arlotts Book of Cricketers Raymond Illingworth had all the ingredients of a fine captain.
Illingworth is above all, a thinking cricketer. Some have said that things worked out for him; and in terms of opportunity, he was in the right place at the right time. He himself, however worked out many things for himself, and it might well be argued that no English captain ever achieved better results in terms of relative playing strengths, states Arlott.
Illingworth the seam bowler who had the perception to switch to off spin; he had always been a utilitarian player; able to fill in where needed. So he took a hundred wickets in ten seasons; scored a thousand runs in eight; performed the double in six. In his forties he was not only fit enough to chase a ball hard, but able to take acrobatic catches. He did not rate himself highly as a batsman, but he often scored more runs under pressure than men with high reputations. As a bowler, he struggled in recent years with a shoulder injury, and often bowled in pain. Yet he retained his accuracy; exploited the turning pitch and on the plumb one set sufficient problems of length, flight - and above all the late out floater - to check and beat good batsmen.
Illingworth may not have been great in any of these departments but he must be accepted as Englands best all-rounder then since Trevor Bailey, states Arlott. Yet cricket history will probably remember him primarily as a captain. His reading of a match and general tactical acumen was appreciated while he was with Yorkshire, several of whose captains by no means least Brian Close, esteemed his advice. That was fair recommendation as a cricket brain: and, perhaps why the Yorkshire players accorded him the respectful Raymond rather than Ray.
Ironically, the biggest upset of his career put him in a position to captain England. In 1968, with characteristic independence, though by no means out of harmony with other employees of the time, Arlott states that he asked for a long term contract with Yorkshire and when they refused, he asked to be released.The county granted his request; but in an unworthy petty gesture withheld the life insurance policy, others had been allowed to take it with them when they left. So, he joined Leicestershire for the 1969 season, and was appointed county captain. At that point Illingworth was rising 37; his Test career seemed over. He had never been an England regular (30 tests and only one tour in ten years), Arlott notes. After an indifferent series against Australia in 1961-2 he was not chosen for the subsequent tour of Pakistan. Illingworth had played with Leicestershire for only three weeks when Colin Cowdery, who had taken the successful 1967-8 side to West Indies was severely injured and had to be ruled out of consideration for the 1969 Test against West Indies. There was much shuffling of ideas and names before Illingworth on paper the least experienced captain in the country was given charge of England.
Arlott noted that Illingworth inherited a seriously depleted side by comparison with that of even a year earlier. Barrington, Dexter, Milburn, Cowdrey and Prideaux were all for various reasons unavailable; and Graveney played only more test innings, his last in that summer. On the face of it England had little chance against a West Indian side captained by Sobers. Yet they won that series and the following three test rubber with New Zealand by 2-0. Illingworth shored up a thin batting side with an average of 40.75 second only to Boycott. In the New Zealand series he was the second in the bowling with ten wickets at 15.40.
There was no dropping Illingworth after that, he was the victim of the same people hostility from the same people as had thought Len Hutton not officer class but on the surface at least, he let that worry him less than his predecessor. In four years until 1973 he took England through 9 test rubbers of which only two were lost; the first to India by a single match after rain had cost him a win at Lords and the overwhelming defeat by the West Indies in 1973. In that four year period, England won twelve matches, lost five and drew fourteen. They won the Ashes after twelve years by beating Australia in Australia; and retained them in England. Even in isolation that was an outstanding sustained performance.To those who observed the side objectively and realised how weak it was by comparison with its opponents - certainly including the Australians, who were not allowed to prove their superiority in results - it was amazing.
We surely need someone with a track record of Ray Illingworths credentials who would have papered over the cracks but far more than wall paper was needed to hold together the crumbling faade of our team.
Its well worth noting that Illingworth picked the best men for the job, not necessarily in terms of technical ability though he was quick to appreciate that but also for temperament and sheer application (selectors please note, as you know raw talent will not get you anywhere as we have seen since of late a flame will flicker) which could be vulnerable even to a soft breeze.
Illingworth deployed his team with such balance that it achieved maximum efficiency: and , through his own high professionalism and the trust he placed on them, he commanded from his players a degree of respect, loyalty and effort which often lifted their performance to a peak higher than the apparent sum of their talents, he was an introverted pragmatic thinker, we need many of such people who do not play to the gallery!

Boyzone star Ronan Keating revealed he made a big mistake by TURNING DOWN smash hit Sweetest Thing when fellow Irishman Bono offered it to him.
Chatting to co-host Harriet Scott on their Magic Radio Breakfast Show, Keating - who famously cameoed in the video for the single - confessed that the U2 hit was initially offered to him and he will always regret declining and insisting that U2 took the song instead. He said: It was U2s, they had to sing it, I knew they had to sing it.
Harriet shot back: You idiot! Why would you do that!
He explained: Because it was U2s. They had to sing it. I knew they had to sing it. I had to give it back, because I knew.
When she asked if the U2 singer-songwriter had ever offered to write anything else for Ronan, he confessed he hadnt: No. Big mistake. Huge!

DC villain Deathstroke is getting a solo movie for himself at the Warner Bros studios. Reportedly, director Gareth Evans of Raid fame is in early negotiations to helm the standalone movie based on the assassin.
The movie would serve as a starring vehicle for Joe Manganiello, who was earlier attached to feature as Deathstroke in Ben Affleck-directed solo Batman film. It is doubtful if the actor will still appear in the movie, which is now being directed by Matt Reeves.
No deals have been closed with Evans or Manganiello yet.
Deathstroke was created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez and first appeared in DC Comic The New Teen Titans #2 in 1980.
The character has a grudge against Green Arrow but his original enemy was the Teen Titans. PTI

Measures to enable MPs to enter Parliament
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said steps would be taken without delay to enable Parliament Members to access the Parliament without being hindered by protesters, yesterday.
He stated that he informed the Police to assure that the Members of Parliament (MPs) attend the sittings.
He added, however, he was informed that 2,000 to 3,000 protestors attempted to forcefully rush into the Parliament and such attempts cannot be allowed.
The Speaker made these observations yesterday when a heated situation was created between the Government and the Joint Opposition (JO) when JO Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena charged that the Joint members were deprived of attending the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in the House of the Parliament.
Raising a point of order, MP Gunawardena stated that the privilege of the Joint Opposition members have been violated due to the road block. UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said that those who cannot attend the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee, like those of the National Freedom Front, are staging protests. He added that they were bankrupt politicians.
Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena said that right of the Members to attend the Parliament should be guaranteed.

No risk hair products at Chagall
Hair Wizard Gerald Solomons the founder of Chagall salon, promises his clients Amonia free, hence Risk Free hair products. Gerald who has clients from all over the world jetting down, just so that he could style their hair says that in the wake of hair dye and related products being linked to a higher rate of breast cancer amongst women who colour their hair more than six times a year, says that at Chagall he uses parabin free, amonia free and PPD free hair dyes and products which do not cause his clients any harm.
Professor Keith Mokbel, breast cancer surgeon, who has carried out research has aid that his study suggests that dyeing hair increases the risk of developing the dreaded disease of breast cancer by as much as 14 percent.
What I find concerning is the fact that the industry recommends women should dye their hair every four to six weeks . Although further work is required to confirm our results our findings suggest that exposure to hair dyes may contribute to breast cancer risk. Professor Mokbel advises women to switch to hair dyes that contain the minimum concentration of aromatic amines such as PPD [ less than 2 percent ]. PPD stands for paraphenylenediamine, a chemical often used in hair dyes .
 At Chagall we only use products such as Loreal INOA (Not Tested On Animals), Paul Michelle (Not Tested On Animals), Schwarzkop, So Pure (Not Tested On Animals) , Kevin Murphy (Not Tested On Animals), however these cost more and sometimes clients insist we use the cheaper products which contain ammonia and PPD and other carcinogenic ingredients . Needless to say we always caution them and tell them they use it at their own risk, averred Gerald.
I always recommend that my clients use safe products because I can confidently say that they are safe to use. Price is not everything, and Gerald admonishes his clients to go the extra step and use such products. At Chagall I am very conscious of the fact that my reputation rests on the products I use and the capabilities of my staff, hence I recommend only the best and the safest of brands. A firm advocate that one should look after ones crowning glory, Gerald is a rare hair dresser who actually advises you against using too many products, colour and blow drying. He recommends Moroccan and Argon oil for the hair and has always advised against over colouring and blow drying.
A firm believer in doing things his way he constantly advises clients to step out of the box they are in and reinvent themselves and he is always right in his advice, be it hair, make up or clothes.

Minister Senaratne said that in 2014, expired drugs worth Rs. 350 million were destroyed because there was no proper drug distribution system in the country at that time.
He said this while addressing a ceremony held to hand over seven mobile dental units and 50 computers to state hospitals at the Family Health Bureau in Colombo recently.
But now state hospitals have been networked and a software has been introduced to ensure the proper distribution of drugs among state hospitals. Nothing can be done today without digitization and modern technology, the Minister said.
The seven mobile dental units and 50 computers provided for state hospitals are worth Rs. 407 million, the Minister said.
There was a shortage of 44 to 79 drugs due to the non availability of information on drug stocks online. But after introducing the new software all artificial drug shortages in the country ended, he added.

ADB to grant US$200 mn for 100 MW wind park
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a loan of US$200 million with sovereign guarantee for Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop Sri Lankas first 100-megawatt wind park.
The new Wind Power Generation Project will not only provide access to a clean and reliable power supply in Sri Lanka, but also create an environment for further wind power development through future public-private partnerships, said Mukhtor Khamudkhanov, an ADB Principal Energy Specialist. Diversifying the countrys power generation through clean, renewable energy sources will improve the countrys energy security and environment.
Sri Lanka boosted its national electrification from 29% in 1990 to more than 99% in 2016. Yet the power sector continues to struggle to meet the growing demand for an affordable and reliable electricity supply.
With the share of thermal (coal and oil-fired) power still accounting for two-thirds of power generation in 2016, there is an urgent need to develop clean energy sources such as wind and solar energy, reduce losses in the system, and boost energy efficiency.
While the remaining third of total generated power in 2016 was from renewable sources, most of this was accounted for by large hydropower facilities. Only about 8% comes from nonconventional renewable energy sources such as mini hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. The countrys goal is to increase the share of these nonconventional renewable energy sources to about 20% of the total generated power by 2020.
Besides the wind farm to be constructed on Mannar Island in Northern Province, the project will provide the associated infrastructure, such as internal cabling and access roads, energy dispatch control center, and reactors to manage voltage levels.
The project will also establish the procedures to enable the CEB - the executing and implementing agency for the project - to act as a wind park developer that can attract the private sector in future wind power generation.
These include establishing cost benchmarks and conducting competitive bidding for future wind power projects, and managing the flow of intermittent wind energy through the power system.
The CEB will provide US$ 56.7 million toward the total project cost of US$ 256.7 million. The estimated completion date for the project is the end of 2021.

The CID conducting investigations against former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project today informed Court that the Attorney General is expecting to file indictments in the High Court against the suspects.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID informed court that they have sought Attorney Generals advice regarding the case. The Attorney General will soon file indictments against the suspects. Further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for March 22.
Six suspects including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) had been arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to CFHC during the last Presidential election. They are currently out on bail.
In this case, the CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney Generals advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.

During his visit, he will meet with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Regarding his visit, Prime Minister Turnbull said, This year marks the 70th anniversary of Australias bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, and I am delighted to be able to visit Sri Lanka. I had the pleasure of meeting President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe during their visits to Australia earlier this year.
I look forward to continuing our discussions on strengthening our economic links, defence engagement, and our work together to combat transnational crime, particularly people-smuggling.
Prime Minister Turnbulls visit to Sri Lanka will follow his overseas visit to Israel, where he arrived on Monday. It comes on the heels of a High Court ruling which disqualified his deputy Barnaby Joyce from elected office due to his dual citizenship with New Zealand at the time of the last election. While Turnbull is in Israel and then Sri Lanka, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will temporarily assume the role of acting Prime Minister.

Balancing Urbanization
A series of familiar images were unfolded on the screen; the photos described the growth and expansion of Colombo as the main urban city in Sri Lanka. The visuals were accompanied by a sequence of statistics; which depicted that the urbanization trends show a rapid transformation of rural areas to urban through unplanned development activities.
It was the fifth International Urban Design Conference on Cities, People and Places (ICCP-2017) at which the speakers highlighted the need for balance in urbanization and sustainable development and added that internal migration and settlement has been considered less important in the phase of development.
Dr. Harsha de Silva
They emphasized the need to prepare development plans and land use plans taking into account healthy environment, climate change impacts and the need for disaster reduction as an integral part of the planning process.
The conference recently held recently at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo and was organized by the Department of Architecture of the University of Moratuwa in collaboration with its international and national academic partners.
The world cities in 2016 - United Nations Data booklet revealed that in 2016, an estimated 54.5 percent of the worlds population lived in urban settlements. By 2030, urban areas are projected to house 60 percent of people globally and one in every three people would live in cities with at least half a million inhabitants.
Understanding the key trends in urbanization likely to unfold over the coming years, is crucial to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By 2030, a projected 27 per cent of people worldwide would be concentrated in cities with at least one million inhabitants. Between 2016 and 2030, the population in all city size classes is projected to increase, while the rural population is projected to decline slightly. While rural areas were home to more than 45 per cent of the worlds population in 2016, that proportion is expected to fall to 40 per cent by 2030.
Sri Lanka too is no different from this statistic and is urbanizing rapidly, with at least 50 percent of its projected 22 million population expected to be living in urban local authorities by 2020. The process of making Colombo a great city, begun post-war under the Rajapaksa regime and it still continues under the yahapalanaya government  though this time around, relocations are supposed to be conducted in a far better manner, according to the current government whips at least.
Lack of balance  in the process of urbanization
Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Housing and Construction Susil Siriwardana speaking under the topic the Urban Underserved - An innovative strategy said new buildings, new administrative structures and ever increasing place rules mean that the people will become marginalized, insignificant and at the mercy of the urban space, although theoretically the city is meant to be for people.
Metro Colombo Urban Development Project
Siriwardana emphasized on the need for balance in the process of urbanization comparing the housing development projects that consecutive governments implemented so far. He said that from 1984 to 1993 housing programmes were initiated by every single urban authority (municipalities and urban councils) at the time and to this day the state made all the decisions and sent people to houses built on their own whims and fancies.
Housing in Sri Lanka revolved around the policy decisions of successive governments in the past. In the 1950s, the government functioned in a regulative role whilst focusing on the urban middle income and working class. In the 1960s to the 1970s, the government was directly involved in housing to encourage a home owning society and in the 1980s to 1990s, it emphasized on its role in enabling housing. The housing sector however, gained momentum after 1990s when the government encouraged public private partnerships.
Siriwardana said the former governments Urban Regeneration Programme (URP), is being continued by the present government and in his words, The present government was continuing the same paradigm.
A report issued by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) titled The Working of a World Class City: Displacement and land acquisition in Colombo stated that there was no official data available on evictions from 2010 to the end of 2014 though the Urban Development Authority (UDA) website stated that approximately 5,000 persons have been relocated to date.
The report further stated that although the concept of relocation implied a voluntary act, it was complicated in the context of post war land acquisition and the role played by the military in evictions under the previous regime and their continued presence within the UDA.
We have not found that balance as yet and we need to find it, he said.
Siriwardana looking back said the participatory housing development projects which resulted in voluntary settlements was a better option.
He noted that the Sahasthapura housing plan to be one of the non- participatory plans developed and called it unmovable hell.
There is no light in the common spaces, the lift is broken and its haunted, he said.
Siriwardana stressed that this needed to be changed in the present context.
Disorganized policy decisions - local authorities should be involved
Professor (Emeritus) Willie Mendis speaking under the topic of defaulting Urbanization Policy Formulation Imperatives for the future said the country generally tended to follow a disorganized policy decision with regard to urbanization.
We have no urbanization policy/ strategy but only an aggressive urban development policy, he said.
The ICCP addressed the issue from different perspectives, said Mendis as houses and apartments were beginning to be smaller than what they were, Urban spaces shrink and every inch of land is under the spell of the real estate developers, he added.
The policy decisions that concern only urban development would not clear all the related issues concerning development, according to Mendis.
One of Mendiss greatest concerns was that local authorities too should be a part of the urban development programmes/ infrastructure.
He complained of there not being any synergy in urban development programmes and added that architects and planners were usually not associated with cities, though they had an important role to play in the transformation of places in cities.
In the meantime, Mendis stressed for the need for a policy organization in Sri Lanka. He further said that nothing has happened with the National Physical Development Plan launched to guide development and added that it never saw the light of day.
Managing urban spaces  view from one of the policy makers
Deputy Minister of Policy planning and Economic Development Dr. Harsha de Silva who was present at the conference said the government was concerned on the zonal based approach to the issues for optimal development.
He said that Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development was in the forefront in managing these projects and he added that the government executed a public friendly approach to implement their plans unlike the former government.
Minister de Silva noted that the last two years were spent on research and developing papers with regard to the proposed development plans.
There will be much faster implementation in the next three years, he said.
Nevertheless, United Nations observations revealed that rapid and unplanned urban growth threatened sustainable development when the necessary infrastructure was not developed or when policies were not implemented to ensure that the benefits of city life were equitably shared.
It further stated that today, despite the comparative advantage of cities, urban areas were more unequal than rural areas and hundreds of millions of the worlds urban poor lived in sub-standard conditions. In some cities, unplanned or inadequately managed urban expansion lead to rapid sprawl, pollution, and environmental degradation, together with unsustainable production and consumption patterns.
The UN data book The World Cities in 2016, clearly stated that urbanization was integrally connected to the three pillars of sustainable development: economic development, social development and environmental protection.
The Minister continued to stress that there was a mismatch between livelihood and resettlement under the former government and added that the UDA followed undemocratic practices to relocate people.
The methods used by the former government to remove people were simply unacceptable. The Urban Development Authority was under the Ministry of Defence and that explains everything, he said.
The Minister however, agreed that the urban designs sometimes created social and economic problems and pointed out that people have similar problems like getting admission to schools.
End of process and the crisis it has created in a developed city
The urban study findings lead to several important conclusions about the role of density in urban productivity. Whilst it found that density played a significant role in the productivity of metro areas, it noted that it played a bigger role in cities where levels of skill and human capital were higher. Also it found the effects of density to be even more substantial in industries with high levels of knowledge and creativity.
Keynote speaker of the conference, Peter Barber Architects, United Kingdom, Architect Peter Barber speaking on Hundred Mile City and Other Stories, explained the negative impacts of urbanization and how it was demonstrating reverse qualities.
He said that the city would struggle to survive and would invent new ways of existence.
While the formal city appears to be in command and demand, informality cannot be eradicated and those poor marginalized and illegal occupants of the city will either fall off the systems or re-invent themselves for survival, he said.
Barber did not believe in high density high rises as he said that they had witnessed the negative consequences of it.
According to the UN, on average cities in less developed regions were at higher risk of exposure to natural disasters and were more vulnerable to disaster-related economic losses and mortality than those in the more developed regions. Moreover, larger cities tended to be at higher risk of exposure to disasters and more vulnerable to disaster-related economic losses and mortality compared to smaller cities.
Floods were the most common type of natural disaster affecting cities, followed by droughts and cyclones. These three types of disaster were also the most devastating for city dwellers globally in terms of the mortality and economic losses they caused.
The report further stated that of the Worlds 31 megacities (that is, cities with 10 million inhabitants or more) in 2016, 24 were located in less developed regions or the Global South.
As the world continued to urbanize, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities, particularly in the lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is expected to be the fastest.Barber emphasized that integrated policies to improve the lives of both urban and rural dwellers thus, were the need of the hour.

Biopics and biographies are on a roll these days; especially in Bollywood. Not only are films being made on celebrated personalities but some Bollywood celebrities are coming up with their own biographies as well. After Karan Johar and Rishi Kapoor, the recent one being Nawazuddin Siddiqui. When Irrfan Khan was asked if he too was keen on getting a biography written, he told a daily that biography is not on his mind. Irrfan reportedly feels that going around praising himself is too boring a thing to do.
Irrfan added in the report that he doesnt want people to sensationalise the episodes of his life.
However, the actor reportedly also mentioned that the only way to get him to be part of biography is to moving the focus of the narration from him to key anecdotes and episodes from his life.
He even reportedly dismissed the idea of a biopic being made on him citing that a biopic on his life wont make up for an interesting script. Irrfan reportedly feels a biopic on his life would be a mistake.

Budget to offer concessions to SMEs to boost exports
Only a few large corporates are engaged in Sri Lankan exports and the government is keen to extend the list of exporters, said Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera.
Speaking at the Tech4Trade event yesterday, the Minister said that with this in mind the 2017 budget would offer a series of concessions to entice more SMEs to export. He said that under the Unity Government, the country regained the GSP Plus facility and also managed to lift the EU fish exports ban.
This resulted very positively for Sri Lankas exports where there was an 82% increase in fish exports. In addition, there was 12.2% increase of apparel exports to EU last August. The government has also introduced several new tools such as Electronic Single Window and RMIS to simplify exports and this too would encourage more exporters. In addition, we will replace the ageing Customs Ordinance which was formulated in 1850 and also the Exercise Ordinance in 1912.
Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade said that Sri Lanka must be an economy that is driven by exports and private investment.
A trade-oriented strategy is the only path towards prosperity for our people.
There is a growing sense that some people simply have not benefited from trade and globalization. Government has made skills development a top priority and is investing more towards it. The business-as-usual approach simply will not work anymore. Our government has clearly identified innovation as a key policy priority, if we are to move our economy into high gear, make our enterprises more competitive and build resilience to the rapid global changes taking place.
The Minister also noted that for every business, one days delay, that extra procedure, that time-consuming process, all adds up to business costs.
It all adds to the cost of production, it all adds up to operating costs and it chips away at efficiency in the overall functioning of trade and the government is trying to correct this.
Improving trade facilitation will have the biggest impact on small and medium enterprises, which find it hardest and most costly to navigate through restrictive procedures and processes.
Trade finance continues to be a challenge, especially for SMEs, and we must do more to find technology-driven solutions for this.
Minister also said that he was very impressed to learn that Australian banks have begun to pilot block chain trade transactions already. I was also impressed that Australian fintech companies like Trade Ledger are helping SMEs obtain trade finance more easily.
President Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Rajendra Theagarajah said that technology was important for businesses and systems like blockchain trade transactions helped banks to be better informed which can improve their financing of SMEs for trade.
Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Bryce Hutchesson said the Sri Lankan entrepreneur should invest more on technology like that the block chain which would reduce a lot of overheads for businesses.
He said that Sri Lanka has to concentrate more on exporters and the concurrent Australia and Sri Lanka bilateral trade too is at a low ebb of around one billion Australian dollars.
World Bank Country Representative, Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough said that Sri Lanka should try to reduce the trade transaction time.
It takes a minimum of two days for Sri Lanka when it comes to clearing, while it is less than one day in both Vietnam and Thailand. This also costs a uncalled for additional expense for them.

CA seeks SC interpretation on judgment in Sinhala
The Court of Appeal has sought the Supreme Courts interpretation to ascertain whether Court of Appeal can issue a judgment in Sinhala as per a partys request in a particular case. The Court of Appeal Justice (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne has sought Supreme Courts interpretation to ascertain whether there is legal provisions in the constitution to issue a judgment in Sinhala.
The judgments in the apex courts of Sri Lanka are delivered in English pursuant to the provisions of Article 24.4 of the constitution.
Public interest litigation activist, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri had made a request from Court of Appeal that he be provided a Sinhala translation of a judgment that was delivered by Court of Appeal on March 9, 2017 regarding a revision application.
In his revision application, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri has challenged lower courts decision to release several illegally captured elephants to the claimants to take part in the Perahera last year.
Mr. Laksiri maintained that citizens of Sri Lanka have constitutional right to obtain Sinhala translation of a judgment. He argued that powers vested on the Justice Minister through a gazette pursuant to the provisions of Article 24.4 of the constitution cannot be exceeded the provisions of Article 24.1, 24.2 and 24.3 of the constitution which need to be widely interpreted.
However, Counsel Asthika Devendra appearing for a respondent party informed that the Court should not entertain this request since Court proceedings could be disturbed and delayed if parties allowed to obtain Sinhala transaction of a judgment.
Deputy Solicitor General Warunika Hettige submitted to Court that this application should be referred to the Supreme Court since it a matter of constitutional interpretation.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal has sought Supreme Courts interpretation in this regarding in terms of Article 125 of the constitution.

Catholic Church proposes educational reforms
Father Ivan Perera laid out a list of proposed educational reforms sought by the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka, including lifting the ban on the establishment of schools by anyone other than the government and allowing both public and nonpublic sectors to manage schools, at the Archbishops House Auditorium on Friday.
Delivering the Thomas Cardinal Cooray Memorial Oration 2017 on the topic Catholic Schools in a Changing Social Environment, Father Perera, the National and Archdiocesan Director of Education, insisted that the governments strict control over education had not been successful.
In spite of the government monopoly of schools, private schools, Pirivenas, unregistered English medium schools, and international schools are proliferating. These schools seem to deliver education that is required in keeping with todays employment market, as well as social and cultural requirements.
He said the state monopoly of education had been rejected by many countries, and that in Sri Lanka, it has not yielded the desired results.
We need free schools and we need free education, and we support it. But we need new policies which would give more control to schools in implementing a pragmatic financial regime which is controlled internally by school managements.
He added: The ban on the establishment of schools by anyone other than the government should be lifted, and some sensible rules should be adopted for ensuring proper standards. Both public and nonpublic sectors should be permitted to manage schools.
In addition to these reforms, he requested that the government allow Catholic schools to fundraise for themselves, bring in foreigners to teach, and appoint priests and nuns as principals.
These proposed reforms were originally composed for a memorandum submitted by Father Pereras office to the subcommittee of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Education, Fr.Perera said.

CGT, a solace for the prevailing tax system
Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in his budget speech for 2017 stated that the tax system of the country is revisited with emphasis being made on the creation of much simpler tax regime with minimum tax exemptions and a broadened tax base. He also said that Capital Gain Tax (CGT) will be introduced with effect from April 1, 2017 at rate of 10 percent because they consider this tax to be equitable as it bridges the income gap and assists the government initiatives in poverty alleviation. Therefore it is very clear the Capital Gain Tax has been introduced to achieve mainly with two objectives.
He also mentioned in his budget speech that the government intends to increase the direct tax component to 40% from around 20% at present and gradually reduce the indirect taxes to 60% from around 80% in the medium term. Thus taking a commendable step in the right direction at this belated stage to reintroduce Capital Gain Tax which was abolished by the then UNP in power in the year 2002. Accordingly the new Inland Revenue Act has imposed a capital Gain Tax on the gain from the realization of an asset with effect from April 1, 2018. This article attempts to see some implications and impact of the CGT in its implementation.
What is meant by Capital Gain Tax
In a business, land, buildings, equipment, inventory, and raw materials as well as stocks, bonds, and cash deposits are considered as capital. An individuals capital includes real estate that has a cash value and financial assets such as bank deposits. Accordingly the gains earned out of capital are called capital gains. Taxation of capital has been a feature of the Sri Lankan tax system for several years and has taken many forms. Taxes on immovable property were levied in the form of a land tax between 1960 and 1962. Immovable property was also included in the once and for all Capital Levy in 1971. Estate duty was an old tax since 1919 and it was abolished in the year 1985.
Taxation on capital gains was introduced as part of the Kaldor Reforms in 1957 and it lasted until the year in 2002. Stamp Duty too is charged on the consideration value of the transfer, gift or exchange of immovable properties as well as on the execution of some instruments in terms of the Stamp Duty Act No.43 of 1982. Therefore Stamp Duty also can be treated as a tax charged in relation to capital asset and stamp Duty goes hand in hand with the Capital Gains.
Why Capital Gain Tax is introduced
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Sri Lanka is US $67.18 billion in 2013 and its per capita income remains at US $3280 in 2013. Tax revenue to the Gross Domestic Product remains low at13.6% in 2013 and it plays a major role in the Government revenue as well. Likewise, a properly administered tax regime is indispensible for the economic well-being of an organised State. When the analysis of the data of the Department of Inland Revenue (DIR), it was evident by statistics, in recent time that the tax revenue as a percentage of the GDP is on remarkably decline over a long period of time. This situation leads to a serious concern for the authorities who are responsible and accountable for economic management and development of the country. An attempt is made to examine the key elements of the Capital Gains regime in order to determine its the impact on the Sri Lankan current tax system.
The research was done primarily by using secondary data, with a view to evaluating the Capital Gain Tax procedures as well as various aspects of CGT in its implementation.
The government revenue mainly consists of tax revenue and non-tax revenue. Tax revenue consists of several taxes such as Income tax(IT), Value Added Tax(VAT), Nation Building Tax(NBT), and Economic Service Charge(ESC) etc. which are presently administered in Sri Lanka and they bring a larger share to the government revenue. Taxes and their contribution to the total tax revenue are as follows:
See table
When the Capital Gain Tax was in force, it amounted to a 1.1% of the total tax collection in the said year according to the administration report-1997 published by the DIR. It should be noted that the Capital Gain Tax was abolished in the year 2002 and it was not liable to be taxed as a source of income for a period of 16 years in the country.
Tax revenue/GDP ratio
In the year 2013, the total tax revenue was Rs.1,006 Billion, and it represented 51.69% of the total government revenue. Its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 11.59%. However, the proportion of tax revenue to the GDP in other countries is very much higher when it is compared to Sri Lanka. According to OECD complete data base, tax revenue as a percentage of the GDP in Australia is 30.8% (2012), Norway is 43.6%, and Denmark is 49%. This ratio in developing countries such as India is 17.7%, Malaysia is 15.5% and Maldives is 12.5%. In the year 2012, Sri Lanka it was 15.3% and the government has projected to increase the tax/GDP ratio to 19.0% by the year 2016. But it was not achieved as projected. Economists argue that for a country to become developed, it should collect taxes at a ratio of 20-30% GDP. In order to maintain the present economic growth rate at 8% and to reduce the government Debt/GDP ratio (82%), it is the responsibility of the Government to increase tax/GDP ratio up to a projected level. In this sense, tax revenue in Sri Lanka plays a vital role and broadening tax base also becomes equally important in todays context.
Rationale for Taxing Capital Gains
The case for taxing capital gains rests on the premise that capital gains provides the recipient with just as much economic power over goods and services as any other form of income. If capital gains are not taxed as income, certain individuals and groups will receive preferential treatment relative to others who have the same ability to pay and undermine the progressivity of the tax system.
Taxation of capital gains prevents the misallocation of resources and minimizes the opportunities for tax avoidance. In other words, CGT will help to decrease the unfairly distribution of income to ascertain extent. For example, in the case of increase of Port and Air Port Levy (PAL), Excise Duty, Nation Building Tax (NBT), Value Added Tax (VAT), the prices of consumer goods will go up and affect the poorest of the poor rather than affluent. Generally transactions relating to land, building, membership interest in a company and other financial assets are taking place among those who have. In that context, CGT is comparatively better source of income for the state coffers rather than increasing PAL, NBT, VAT and excise duty which will lead to increase the prices of consumer goods.
Capital Gain Tax under Old Inland Revenue Acts
From the year 1957, Capital Gain Tax has been in existence under various Acts of the country. CGT was imposed under the Section 7 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 and it lasted until the year 2002. Capital Gains arise from change of ownership of any property and from gains arising from certain transactions such as surrender or relinquishment of any right in any property; thereby immovable property as well as the moveable property were subject to be liable for the Capital Gains. Formation of a company, dissolution of a company, and amalgamation or merger of two or more businesses or companies were liable for Capital Gains. At the same time there were some exemptions for such gains under section 14 of the said Acts. Under the earlier Acts, the rate of Capital Gain Tax was depending on the period of ownership held by the owner. The shorter the period of ownership held by the owner, higher the rate of tax. It varied depending on the period of ownership.
Period of ownership of property between 2 to 5 years -20%
Period of ownership between 05 to 15 years  17.5%
Period of ownership between 15 to 20 years- 12.5%
Period of ownership between 20 to 25 years 5%
Period of ownership of property held in possession for more than 25 years-exempt
The period of time less than two years was treated as a trading income and it was taxed at normal tax rates. There were several tax exemptions under the old Inland Revenue Acts and such exemptions have not been taken into consideration when drafting the new Act.
CGT under the New Inland Revenue Act
Section 36 to Section 50 of the New Inland Revenue Act provides the manner in which Capital Gain is arisen and how it becomes liable to tax.
Section 36 of the Act provides that capital Gains arise from the realization of an asset or the sum of the consideration received or receivable for the asset or liability exceeds the cost of the asset or liability at the time of realization. In other words, Capital gain will be the result of sale price less the price of purchase. In addition, expenditures on advertising, transfer taxes, Stamp Duties; charges imposed by Local Authorities will be allowed to be deducted from the capital Gain. Net difference between the sale price and the purchase price will be treated as net Capital Gain. Accordingly, in calculating CGT, definition of capital assets, cost of assets, realization of assets and consideration will be very important.
The cost of the asset will be allowed to deduct from the price of purchase. In terms of the section 37(1) cost of the asset includes, expenditure incurred in acquiring the asset such as construction, manufacture, or production of the asset, and the expenditure on altering, improving, maintaining, or repairing the asset.
Incidental expenditure in acquiring and realizing an asset, such as advertising expenditure, transfer taxes, and other levies paid to local authorities, expenditure of establishing, preserving or defending ownership of the asset will be allowed as deduction from the purchase price. Expenditure on improvements, fencing, repairing the asset and remunerations paid for services such as accountant, agent, and auctioneer can be deducted.
Realization means that when a person parts with ownership of the asset including when the asset is sold, exchanged, transferred, distributed, cancelled, redeemed, destroyed, lost, expired, expropriated, or surrendered.
Exemptions
The trading stock or depreciable assets are not treated as realization of asset. When an asset is realized due to a death of a person, it will not be included in the realization of an asset. Transfer of an asset from husband to his spouse in a bona fide separation is not treated as realization of asset and capital gain tax will not arise. When a transfer of an asset takes place due to death of a person, Capital Gain will not arise. Realization of trading stock, depreciable assets, investment assets, or capital assets of a business will not be fallen into the source of Capital Gains. There are few other items which have been made exempted from Capital Gain Tax. Consideration received for an asset shall not include an exempt amount, a final withholding payment or trading stock.
Consideration means the value received for an asset of a person at a particular time shall be amounts received or receivable by the person for the asset including the fair market value of any consideration in kind determined at the time of realization.
Rate of CGT
Under the new Inland Revenue Act, CGT is taxed at a flat rate of 10% irrespective of the period of ownership held by the owner of the asset.
Registration of Transfer of capital assets
Under clause 50 of the Inland Revenue Bill, any person authorized by law to accept, register, or approve the transfer of a capital asset shall not register the same unless he is satisfied that any tax payable under this Act has been paid. At the Committee stage, the said clause has been amended as The manner and the procedure relating to the payment of tax on the gain from realization of an asset may be specified by the Commissioner General. Accordingly when registering a document for transfer of properties, it should be ensured that the capital Gain Tax thereon has been paid or not. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is supposed to prepare a procedure in this regard.
Stamp Duty
Stamp Duty is imposed on the instruments relating to transfer of movable and immovable properties and on the registration of documents. Stamp Duty and Capital Gain Tax should be paid based on the same transaction on deferent basis. Stamp Duty is charged and collected in terms of the provisions of Stamp Duty Act No.43 of 1982. Stamp Duty was repealed by the Finance Act No.11 of 2002 and it was reintroduced by the Stamp Duty Act (Special Provisions) Act No.12 of 2006. Accordingly the instruments relating to transfer of properties should be stamped on the rates published by Gazette Notifications. Anyway the Stamp Duty so imposed and collected by the central Government should be transferred to the Provincial Council in terms of Section 2 of the Provincial Councils (Transfer of Stamp Duty) Act No.13 of 2011.
Newly introduced CGT is not complicated and it has only one flat rate of 10%. CGT will broaden the tax base and it will bring a considerable income to the state coffers while CGT helps to ease unequal distribution of income. It will help to increase direct tax ratio to a certain extent in the long run. Exempt items should be clearly distinguished in the procedure and simpler procedures should be adopted in order to enable the tax payer to distinguish exempt items clearly and to ensure that the tax payer does not face many complications. CGT will not be a panacea for all the diseases but it will be a solace for the prevailing tax system if properly administered by the relevant authorities and if not it will not be a Saradiyels budget.

CH and FC - a force to be reckoned with
In 1892 the Colombo Hockey and Football Club (CH & FC) was formed. It was headquartered at the Race course and catered to Rugby with ample playing area and with well kept grounds. It attracted some of the best exponents of the game. Before long The Club gathered a reputation for fielding outstanding players in Rugby. Many went on to play for Ceylon (Sri Lanka). In 1962 when the Army acquired the Grandstand and the Race Course, CH & FC moved to Maitland Crescent.
Rohitha Rajapaksa (captain) and Tavita Tulagaese (coach)
In 1959, for various reasons that prevailed at that time three Clubs came together and decided to call themselves The Gymkhana Club. The first Chairman Elect was FC Rowan. At that time the membership of the Club was almost totally made up of expatriates. With the passage of time the Europeans left the shores of Sri Lanka. However, the spirit & soul of Gymkhana never died. Ideals and values that made it outstanding remained stronger than ever. By 1964 Sri Lankans with the same vision tock the reins.
The first Sri Lankan Chairman was P S C Fernando in 1969. The first Sri Lankan Rugby Captain in 1971 was Brian Baptist. Lorensz Pereira who played for the club went on to captain Sri Lanka in 1968.
The CH & FC rugby team has been among the top five rugby sides in the island. During the stellar years of 1990-1994 they won almost all the titles and accolades for rugby.
The Colombo Hockey and football club as one of the oldest rugby playing clubs in the country will give off their best in the forthcoming 2017/18 rugby season as a major force in the field of local rugby arena.
They last won the coveted league title in the year 2000 under the leadership of winger Ajith Upawansa. Former SThomas and Sri Lanka captain Namal Rajapaksa is the person behind transforming CH and FC to be a force to be reckoned with and they will be strengthened by the inclusion of some of the vastly experienced former Sri Lanka national players and talented school rugby players.
CH have got some experienced club rugby players this year to their squad namely Navy/ Sri Lanka centre Lee Keegal, Navy/ Sri Lanka forward Sajith Saranga, Navy/ Sri Lanka prop forward Sathya Ranatunga and Police/ Sri Lanka prop forward Henry Terence, who has made a welcome return to rugby under CH jersey this season along with Navy second row forward Matheesha Sarathchandra and CR and Sri Lanka wing three quarter Peterite Anuradha Herath, CR third row forward Sasanka Ariyaratne, Navys cracking number eight Chathura Dilshan , CR & FC scrum half Piyum Jayasinghe and Dhiren Warnakulasuriya who has loads of club rugby experience.

CH have to start all over again from Zero this time around and in the process of team rebuilding stage where the players as a team can put up a reasonable show this season and want to prove a point to Sri Lanka rugby lovers and club supporters that they are a strong club hence coach Laga expects discipline to be at its best among their club players.
This year the club will be captained by one of the most experienced players in fly half Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa, the S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia 2008 rugby captain.

Personality development tips
It is very important for a person to develop his personality not only in official life but also in private life. For example, a person has to maintain a high standard as a husband, father, neighbour and also as a true citizen of Sri Lanka.
Efforts that may be taken to develop personality in office are listed below.
* Subject matter of the work and expectation of the management should be clearly understood.
* Adequate qualification and training are important. Learning has no age barriers etc. Knowledge should be improved according to the market trends.
* Strengths and weaknesses should be identified. Rectification of weakness itself is a way of strengthening. For example, computer literacy nowadays is very important. When a person is working in an era he must be fluent in that area language and culture as well. Never depend on others for translation/interpretation.
* Never avoid a problem but face it with courage. A Japanese proverb goes to say If the job has to be done by you, it is pointless delaying it.
* Never get disheartened when faced with losses. Analyse the situation and rectify same with courage.
* Allocate the work among the staff, so that absence of a member or group does not affect the work. Proper team work is essential.
* Allow the members of staff to have free discussion with you for better understanding. Never overrule them using your position.
* Appreciate the good work done by staff publicly. Criticize them privately. Never place a person in an embarrassing situation.
* Favouritism and discrimination, both have to be avoided. It will hinder improvement.
* Benefits accruing to the team should be shared by all (Say Bonus)
* Create a sense of humour. This will reduce tension in the work place. Cordial relationship with the staff will improve.
* Having tension is a weakness. Proper planning will reduce tension. When faced with sudden problem deep thinking could help to solve them.
* Create positive thinking and direct the staff in that direction. Take up the leadership with confidence.
* Never put the blame on others. Heads I Win Tails You Lose is a wrong policy.
* Express your views to the management, staff, even to the public at large, with confidence backed by knowledge and experience.
* Appearance plays a major role in personality development. Clean appearance, proper attire, well mannered speech are important. Do not use improper language especially in the presence of female members.
* Good health (Body and mind) is important. Proper exercise, diet, rest etc would help.
* Pay special attention to public opinion. Media reports should be carefully watched and corrective action taken. Never create hatred against those who criticize you.
Great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Winston Churchill, Dr. Colvin R. De Silva are the best examples of persons having stunning personality. In the cinema field Bruce Lee, M.G. Ramachandran, Rajinikanth, Kamalhassan may be named. There are several others in other areas as well.

Coconut and palmyrah toddy tapping to be brought under license

Licenses will be issued to coconut and palmyrah toddy tappers under the proposed amendment to Section 15 (Chapter 52) of the Excise Ordinance in order to impose adequate excise duty, the Finance and Mass Media Ministry said.
The Cabinet of Ministers approved to the above amendment, proposed by the Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
The current license was issued under the Amendment made in 2013, exempting toddy tapping from Kithul, Palmyrah and Coconut.
With this, determining the volume of liquor produced from toddy by distilleries has become difficult for the Excise Department, in order to collect excise duty.
However toddy tapping from the Kithul tree has been exempted from the provision of the licensing requirement.
Accordingly, the new amendment bans lowering or drawing toddy from coconut or palmyrah trees, without a license issued by the Excise Department or by respective Divisional Secretaries.

As comedy crows in
Despite many complaints, Sri Lankas theatre drags on somehow. The walls of the cities as well as the suburbs are noted for the ubiquitous poster-presence of newly arrived stage productions. Most productions are richly generated Sinhalese colloquial titles very much scoffed at by the sophisticated crowd. English theatre productions are not a common element in rural areas. Tamil productions are quite unheard of.
Aslam Marikar is among the minority of dramatists who choose their medium in English and reach out to the capitals limited edition crowd. Over the past four years, Marikar has written and produced three full length productions. One of them was a first original English full length play performed in Galle.
Marikars stage production, The 21st Century Monk, features a character that has distanced her/himself from the material world. The monk is an allusion to anyone in the society, well including an ascetic.
Aslam Marikar
The recent influx of Sri Lankan stage productions seem inclined to the comedy more than any other genre.
Sri Lankan theatre seems more interested in imitating, copying, translating and finding more sophisticated ways of copying art than actually doing it. I am referring to the majority of individuals that we today in Sri Lanka identify as professional artistes, Marikar comments.
As Vihanga Perera notes, Marikars fusion of a variety of humours  from classical Old variety of humours  from classical Old Comedy to contemporary Dark Humour forms  was a refreshing blend, with textual and situational comedy aligned along slapstick, farce and burlesque. Perera also claims that the play was an experiment and credits the statement to a third party source.
The 21st Century Monk is not an experiment. At least I tried my best not make it appear. It was a story narrated within Sri Lankan tradition, Marikar responds.
Experiment or not, does English theatre have a ground in Sri Lanka to grow as an independent art
If theatre in English is to thrive we must put our money where our mouth is. English Theatre is financed with aid or blatantly imitation. Some go to the extent of copying skits from the internet and then readjusting it to appear different but have no cultural relevance, Marikar notes.
Although English is a necessity, Marikar remarks that the language can pass off as a threat to our culture. English has its own evolutionary process within the country though it requires financial stability coupled with intellect. But it is a slow process. As a result, the theatre productions, approved by foreign aid and foreign organisations, have a crippling effect of the profession.
Aslam Marikar was the first to initiate theatre professionally within the city of Kandy. His path was not without challenges. Although he had to deal with novice performers at the outset, most of them have become professionals now. Most of his actors have performed in other productions now and gathered experience in the industry.
They have acquired the qualities of professional acting. We have performed over 20 times in Kandy, Colombo, Galle and Bangalore, India. Most of my cast is from the university. We also have doctors, teachers and others from the corporate sector in Kandy, Marikar explains.
While fully attached to Trinity College, Marikar has offered his theatre expertise to many schools in Kandy. Some of his students have found fascination in the profession.
Recently I had the pride of watching a student of mine, Dhisal Kapuge, perform in Hecuba, his first play at the university. It was a rendition of a foreign play. But it shows that my work is beginning to crystallize. I hope to establish theatre to an extent where dramatists can make themselves a healthy living doing all that they love most.
And now, Marikars hands are busy with his newest play, To Be or Knot To Be. He calls it a comedy about marriage and Sri Lankans expectations about the union. The full length play will go on boards in January.
None of my dramas has been produced with foreign aid. All of them are originals.
When you reach for theatre, especially the English, without such props, it is a challenge as well as a risk. For Marikar, the risk matters. In fact, he toys with it. When you take risks with your pen, he adds, it brings the best in you.

Cremer strikes late as Windies close on 78-1
Bulawayo: Zimbabwe legspinner Graeme Cremer struck late on day two to end a turgid opening stand and keep the West Indies in check in the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Monday.
A grinding partnership of 76 in 46 overs between Kraigg Brathwaite and Kieran Powell had given the West Indies a solid base in their reply to Zimbabwes 326 all out, before Cremer removed Brathwaite for 32 to send the visitors to stumps on 78 for one. Zimbabwes total was built on the back of Hamilton Masakadzas 147 and Sikandar Razas 80, which saw the hosts bowled out in the hour after lunch.
Brathwaite and Powell ended a run of 18 innings without a fifty partnership as they took the patient approach to batting on a slow, turning surface.
The West Indies lead the two-match series 1-0. AFP

Death of Waters Edge veteran
Sugunapala Medis of Moratuwa who has authored many books on Buddhist Philosophical topics passed away at the age of 90.His funeral will take place at the Wadduwa cemetery on Wednesday at 4 pm.
Medis began his life as a public servant and turned to be a prominent Social worker and a critic of government action wherever criticism Was necessary. He was the Petitioner in the famous Waters Edge Case where judgment was made with an award of compensation and Costs Of Rs. 500,000.
In the judgment of the waters edge he urged that his rights were violated by the then Secretary to the Treasury Dr. PB Jayasundera With the alienation of the land that was owned by the UDA and divested To a private company for the creation of a private Golf Course where as the State land was meant for public purposes.
In this case one Ronnie Peries was alleged to have made Rs.57 Million in the corrupt deal was ordered to pay 2 Million as compensation. Court further ordered that the flood retention area of the controversial site be restored and recommended that the WatersEdge complex be used to house government offices.
Given the fact that the 1st Respondent actively and successfully lobbied the Cabinet for concessions for Asia Pacific beyond and in excess of the guidelines she herself had promulgated in her capacity as President, it is patently disingenuous for the 1st Respondent to now abdicate responsibility and claim ignorance of the nefariousness of the transaction. Quite simply, it is unacceptable and reprehensible for the 1st Respondent to have made use of the power conferred upon her by the People to advance this Project, and now distance herself from the responsibilities inherent to such power.
Notably, this is not the only instance in which she has interceded in land alienation procedures for the purpose of "actively facilitating,and if not seeking to bypass the appropriate approval process.
According to a Report of Committee of Inquiry delivered on 6th November 2002 regarding, in part, the propriety of alienation of land in Narahenpita to Lifestyle Health Services (Private) Limited, the 1st Respondent issued several pieces of correspondence through which she, inter alia, expressed repeated concern over procedural delays and instructed the BOI to expedite the process of&#39; vesting of the land by"eliminating some of the steps outlined or by accelerating the same."
In the order The Supreme Court further directed the BOI and the SLLR & DC to immediately investigate this dubious alienation and to act forthwith to restore the public purpose for which the said land was acquired especially as the affidavit of the SLLR & DC reveals that several instalments amounting to approximately Rs. 25 Million have not yet been paid. This is of particular importance given the pressing problem of the lack of housing for middle class government officials who reside in Colombo, since no development whatsoever has taken place on this land....

Victoria and Abdul
A delightful portrait of English monarchs
The opening of the film is strong and audiences may be delighted to realize that this rhythm continues throughout Stephen Frears movie. Victoria and Abdul boasts of a stellar cast lead by Judi Dench.
In her latter years, Victoria, the Queen of England and Empress of India, found solace in the company of an Indian clerk Abdul Karim, who went on to become her Urdu teacher, spiritual adviser and closest confidant. Based on Shrabani Basus book on this extraordinary true story, the film takes a bittersweet look at this little-known friendship that caused a furore within the royal household.
Frears begins his film by taking us through the monotonous routine of Queen Victoria as she goes around meeting her social obligations during her Golden Jubilee year (1887). During one such royal gatherings, she glances upon Abdul, a wide-eyed Indian boy, who presents her the ceremonial coin (mohur). Despite being warned against looking at her, Abduls childish intrigue makes him stare back at her and flash a nervous smile when their eyes meet, amidst a sea of exasperated privileged people. Abduls accidental defiance and indifference to protocol, liberates the queen emotionally, who is a prisoner by her own means. Evidently, a Hindoo attendants rising influence on the queen, rattles members and servants of the royal family, who later discover that hes Muslim.
At 82, Judi Dench arrests your attention with her unwavering screen presence and eyes that exude a myriad of emotions - mischief, melancholy, loneliness and longing. She humanises her character effortlessly. Your heart goes out to the ageing monarch as she engages in introspection on a quiet, windy day and tells Abdul, Everyone Ive loved has died, and I just go on and on. Dench is the reason why this fascinating story refuses to seem like a scandal.
Making the most of this incredible opportunity, Ali Fazal holds his own in front of a legend (Dench). Frears smartly uses Alis raw, nervous energy and enthusiasm and infuses it in Abdul, organically. However, his one-dimensional portrayal of the munshi, leaves a lot to imagination and thus unexplained. Why was an Indian so devoted to the Queen of England, who ruled his country (He even happily kisses her feet). Was he naive or just an opportunist What was he like as a person The narrative reduces Abdul to being a mere spectator and thats its biggest flaw. Also, the film falters as it abruptly changes gear and transforms into a tedious tragedy from a cross-cultural comedy.
Victoria and Abdul is a delightful film that deserves to be watched.
Frears wouldve walked away with a film both heartening and heartbreaking.

Emil Kanthan released from attempted murder case
The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to acquit and release the nine accused, including former senior LTTE leader Emil Kanthan from a case regarding the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda in 1998.
High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe ordered that the nine accused in the case be released taking into consideration the insufficient evidence placed before Court against the accused.
Meanwhile, six other accused who were found guilty to the charges were sentenced to ten-and-a-half-year Rigorous Imprisonment. The Court further ordered each of them to pay compensation of Rs.10,000.
Out of these six accused, five accused had evaded Court since inception of the investigation. The Court issued warrants for the arrest of these five accused.
Emil Kanthan is said to be the former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head and he had been named as an accused in connection with the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda in 1998.
The name of Emil Kanthan transpired during the magisterial inquiry into the controversial RADA case.
It transpired in Courts that high profile officials at RADA had gone to the LTTE controlled area in Kilinochchi and had discussions with former LTTE activist Emil Kanthan over reconstructing houses for tsunami-affected people.
In this case, the Attorney General had filed indictments against Emil Kanthan and several other accused in the High Court. Mr. Devananda was attacked on June 30, 1998 inside the Kalutara prison, when he visited some LTTE suspects.
He was attacked with sharp weapons which caused serious injuries to him. The accused were LTTE prisoners.
Defence Counsel Laksman Perera appeared for Emil Kanthan.

QL Tell us a bit about your family-parents and siblings.
My Father is Pathmakumara Perera. My mother is Sriyani Abeygunawardana. I have two sisters Asha Balasuriya, Sapna Perera and one brother Mahesh Perera. I am the youngest in the family.
How does it feel to be the youngest child
Ha, ha. I always end up getting blamed for things and I have to listen to a couple of lectures from my siblings about studying on a daily basis. Sometimes they complain about how I am chilling too much while they work too hard but they are all very supportive. They love me very much.
What made you enter into the field of modeling and what inspired you to become a fashion icon
I have been in the industry for six months now. I was passionate about modeling since childhood. From small days I was interested in the field and I used to see my sisters friends who were models and I thought I should try it too. Then I joined Brian Kerkovens agency and he encouraged me to come so far. It is mostly my passion that made me enter the field. It is pretty challenging and exciting!
Tell us about your experience at Mister Teen International 2017.
It was the first pageant that I took part in. It was definitely a great experience for me. Brian wanted me to take part in the pageant and it was definitely worth it. I met so many people and made a bunch of new friends. Everyone was really friendly and easy to work with. It was nice to see people from different countries and different cultures coming together. The exposure was great especially since I am still very young. I was confidant with what I was doing and I am extremely happy with my performance.
What were the best memories from the pageant
The best moment was the winning moment. The swimsuit shoot was another unforgettable experience though it was the most embarrassing thing for me to do all the posing!
How has the support been from everyone around you
The support was just great. From family and friends to school, everyone was just so supportive. So many people came to the airport to see me and I didnt expect so much love. My school had put up banners and all to celebrate my victory and it was so nice to see all that. Even with the voting, my friends helped immensely. I was able to get more than 2000 votes thanks to all my friends and fans. I must thank Brian Kerkoven for bringing me thus far and training me, Kamil Hewavitharana for the wardrobe advice, Hiran Wijesekara for the dance choreography and traditional costume designing done for me. I am so blessed to have a very supportive bunch around me.
What are your hobbies
I love to restore vintage and classic vehicles cars and run them. I also engage in charity work. I am a car collector so I am very passionate about classic cars! I have around 15 classic cars. I basically restore the cars with the help of an engineer. I do a test run twice a month.
Are you an animal lover
Yes, of course. I love dogs! I had four Grade Danes in my younger days but sadly they passed away due to old age and a snake bite. It was very saddening.
Who are your role models
Jeff Seid and our very own Daham Dias.
Whats your favourite attire and what type fashion trends do you follow
I am more into casual wear but I like Tuxedos as well. Colour coordination is a must for me! I love to match my shoes with my outfits.
Whats your workout and skincare routine like
I hit the gym every day of the week. I focus more on building my upper body and chest which I allocate three days for and then the rest of the days I do some cardio and legs. I trim my hair often and go for my facials every month. I love using hair mousse to style my hair!
How do you spend your weekends and holidays
I usually cook my breakfast and sometimes I cook for my family too. I make my own meals and then I hit the gym. I hangout with my friends and maybe go for a dinner out with my family.
Whats your favourite place in Sri Lanka
Nuwara Eliya. That is like the best place to go with my family! With friends anywhere is fun as long as they are around. I am a party animal so I love happening places.
How does it feel to be famous
Firstly, you cannot do anything silly in public because everyone is watching you and they know who you are so every move you make counts. It is cool though to be loved by many people. People ask me to pose for pictures with them and they click so many selfies. All in all its great!
What are your future plans
I want to pursue a degree in Accounting and I am looking forward to taking part in more pageants. I am also hoping to take part in Mr Asia.
Whats your message to the youth
Be confident and put yourself out to achieve what you want to achieve. Give your very best in what you do and dont let anything stop you.

Fitch affirms National Insurance Trust Fund at AA-(lka)
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based National Insurance Trust Fund Boards (NITF) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating (IFS) and National Long-Term Rating at AA-(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
NITFs ratings reflect strong ties with the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Stable), a strong business profile as the countrys only reinsurer and a conservative investment policy.
This is counterbalanced by weakened capitalisation due to natural disasters in 2016 and 2017 and high dividend payments.
NITFs ratings reflect its 100% ownership by the government of Sri Lanka, its role as the countrys only reinsurer and its function as an arm of the state in implementing some policies, such as serving segments that are not covered by commercial insurers.

SLC to make announcement at end of Indian tour
Five in the mix for post of head coach
Sri Lanka Cricket will announce the appointment of a permanent head coach by January 1 after the completion of the tour of India which ends on December 24.
We have about five guys including Nic (Pothas) shortlisted for the post. We want to finalise it by January 1 who is going to be our head coach upto the 2019 World Cup, Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva told the Daily News.
We advertised and head-hunted for a permanent coach and basically have spoken to all of them. We had discussions with them over the phone and their representations were made on Skype, he said. De Silva said without naming that among those who have applied for the post are from the Asian countries as well as Australia, England and South Africa.
Sri Lanka have not had a permanent head coach since Graham Ford of South Africa resigned from his post ahead of his contract at the end of the Champions Trophy in June.
SLC appointed fielding coach Nic Pothas to the position of interim coach and he has so far overseen three series against Zimbabwe, India and the recent one against Pakistan which ended in Lahore on Sunday.
Whether Pothas will carry on in the same role for next months tour of India, De Silva said Sri Lanka Cricket will have to take a call after first having a chat with him.
We would first have a chat with him and see how we could take it forward. We have to get a feedback from Nic, have a discussion with him and then see what is going to be our support staff for the Indian tour, said De Silva.
If you really look at the performances we all know that youngsters have been given opportunities, the on-field performances have not been that great, but we did well in the Test series, won two games against Pakistan and this is the first time Pakistan got beaten in a series in the UAE, de Silva said.
But the one-dayers and T20s were a bit disappointing. Then again based on that performance is why we need to take a call with Nic about the feedback and see how we want to move forward, his ideas, his strategy etc. Based on that we will refer it to the national cricket committee for them to give their recommendations, De Silva added.
Any decisions regarding team appointments have always been based on the recommendations of the national cricket committee and the ExCo finally takes a call on their decisions. We will meet within the course of this week because the team is due to leave for India on October 8.
Ashley de Silva has been heading the national cricket committee since Aravinda de Silva resigned as chairman at the end of June. Other members of the committee are Ranjit Fernando, chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy and his co-selectors, cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha (who is also part of the selection committee), high performance manager Simon Willis and SLC vice-president K Mathivanan.
The national cricket committee was formed in March 2016, to evaluate the existing stratagem of SLC and to make technical recommendations that would revamp the structure.

Four to five stroke patients admitted daily to NH
A recent survey revealed that four to five stroke patients are admitted to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) daily, the Consultant Neurologist attached to the NHSL Dr. Padma Gunaratne said.
She was addressing the media during a health seminar at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo to mark the World Stroke Day which falls on October 29.
According to Dr.Gunaratne, the survey reveals that 57.4 percent of stroke patients are men while 42.6 percent are women. Most stroke patients are between the ages of 50 and 80. However, 33 percent of them are below the age of 60. They have had developed strokes even before their age of retirement. Around 200,000 stroke patients exist in the country at present.
Dr.Gunaratne said the percentage of young strokes is seven and the patients are below the age of 45. Ninety percent of strokes can be prevented, he said. An injection can save lives of some stroke patients if they are brought to hospital within four and half hours from the time of developing the stroke.
Patients need specialized care for a long period - one month or more - after suffering from a stroke. Care should be provided by health professionals such as physiotherapists, speech therapists, etc. After complete rehabilitation, stroke patients can lead a normal life, Dr.Gunaratne said.
If not rehabilitated properly, with the assistance of health professionals, stroke patients can develop other complications such as pneumonia, bedsores, etc. Hypertension, diabetes, smoking and use of alcohol are the four main reasons that lead to strokes, she added.
Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M.W.Jayasundara Bandara addressing the gathering said the National Stroke Centre will open at Mulleriyawa next month. Stroke management centres will be set up in all provinces, he said. According to Dr. Bandara, stroke management is recognized as a National Policy in 2015.

Gayle wins Australia masseuse court case
Sydney: West Indies cricket star Chris Gayle Monday won a defamation case against an Australian media group which claimed he exposed his genitals to a massage therapist. The lurid accusations were made by Fairfax Media newspapers The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times in a series of stories in January last year.
They claimed the all-rounder exposed himself to team masseuse Leanne Russell in a dressing room at the 2015 World Cup in Sydney and indecently propositioned her.
Gayle denied the allegations, saying the journalists behind the story wanted to destroy him.
His teammate Dwayne Smith, who was in the changing room at the time, also denied the incident took place.
A NSW Supreme Court jury ruled in Gayles favour, finding Fairfax was motivated by malice.
The media group had defended the articles on the basis the allegations were substantially true and in the public interest. At the end of the day Im very, very happy, Gayle said after the verdict, according to the Herald, adding that coming to court had been very emotional.
Im a good man. Im not guilty, he said.
The publication of the stories followed an uproar after Gayle attempted to flirt with an Australian presenter on live TV, asking her out for a drink and telling her: Dont blush, baby.
During the week-long hearing, a tearful Russell stood by the allegations, saying she had gone to the room looking for a towel and came across Gayle.
She alleged he lowered the towel he was wearing and asked: Are you looking for this
Gayles close friend Donovan Miller told the hearing that since the allegations the West Indian had become scared, especially (around) females and he always feels someone is out to get him. A hearing on damages will be held at a later date. AFP

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) had sent a letter to the President requesting an appointment for a meeting in order to inform him the GMOAs stand (in detail) on SAITM solution presented by the Government, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said during the meeting with the President, the GMOA also expects to discuss the unclear facts mentioned in the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue.
It is commendable that the Government decided to abolish SAITM, remove the ownership of SAITM from its current owner and his family and to legalize the minimum standards of Medical Education according to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) document. The GMOA will extend his fullest support to implement the set of proposals (with certain amendments), Dr. Aluthge said.
But it is very confusing the proposed new institution to be set up after abolishing SAITM. Whatever new institution must obtain the compliance certificate from the SLMC. This new institution should be scrutinised by a state body.
The `Government / State Policy mentioned in the Governments statement is not clear at all.
An Interim Committee should be appointed under the SLMC immediately to look into the issue of current students in SAITM. The countrys law should be implemented against the current SAITM owner for all grave offences executed by him so far, the GMOA Secretary added.

Selena Gomez has amassed two albums worth of new material from all of her recent studio sessions.
The singer has been working on the follow-up to 2015s Revival, recently releasing a string of hit tracks, including Bad Liar, Fetish, and It Aint Me, and she has teased theres a lot more to come. Following the premiere of Wolves, her new collaboration with DJ Marshmello, on Wednesday (25Oct17), the 25-year-old sat down for an interview with Zane Lowes Beats 1 Apple Music show and explained she is waiting for the right time to share her new music with fans.
Im ready. I want to get back in and re-focus on all of my music, she said of her release plans. To be honest, I feel like I have two albums already completed, but Im wanting to figure it out. So its a lot sooner than I think people anticipate. I want to call the shots, I want it to be good, I want to be ready, I dont want to do anything thats forced. It will be soon.
Gomez also discussed why she opted not to rush her music last year, as she instead took time away from work to focus on her battle with lupus, the autoimmune condition which required her to undergo a kidney transplant this summer.
I wanted my music to be a lot more meaningful, to be honest.... I just wanted to take my time, she revealed. I didnt want it to be crowded by over-glamorised things and the pop world can just be really distracting sometimes.
This year, I did it at my own pace.
Her pal Taylor Swift is gearing up to release her own album, Reputation, next month, and Selena has given it her seal of approval. Its so inspiring. Its really cool to surround yourself with people who are inspiring and changing the way they dictate what they love, whether its acting or music, and shes one of those people who will continue to do that, she gushed.

Gorgeous is about boyfriend Alwyn
Taylor Swift reportedly told her fans she wrote her new tune Gorgeous about boyfriend Joe Alwyn as she hosted an album listening party on Wednesday (18Oct17).
The 27-year-old singer invited a select group of fans to her home in Rhode Island to listen to her new record Reputation. And she also used the occasion to give some insight into the inspiration for some of the songs, revealing that her newly dropped track Gorgeous was written about her British actor beau Joe, who shes been dating for the past year. One fan, called Away-from-the-crowds, who was at the secret album party wrote: Basically Taylor made us all promise that if anyone made any accusations of who this song is about, we tell them it is 100 per cent about her angel boyfriend of 1 year (this isnt a secret, she wanted us to tell people).
Lyrics in the tune include: Youre so gorgeous/ I cant say anything to your face/ Cause look at your face/ And Im so furious/ At you for making me feel this way/ But what can I say/ Youre gorgeous. Another line sees Taylor mention a boyfriend, adding hes older than us, hes in the club doing I dont know what, with many people speculating she could have been referring to Calvin Harris or Tom Hiddleston, both members of her ex squad and both of whom were older than her. However, another fan who had been at the listening session confirmed that Taylor had told them the tune was penned solely about Joe.
Any love song Taylor writes now is about Joe and only Joe, the fan, called Befearlessandstaybeautiful, wrote. She is so happy and this is about them. And only them. This is confirmed. Its a rule. Joe love songs from here on out, this goes for all of reputation. No speculating if it is about Taylors ex from a million years ago because I promise you its not. Joe and Taylor, Happy.

Government should assist development of state institutions: Rajitha
Only 11 state institutions are making losses under the present government while all other state institutions are making profits, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the government should assist to develop all state institutions and to bring them up to a profit making level. The belief that 'State institutions cannot make profits' is only a myth. State institutions can make profits with proper management, he said addressing the gathering after opening a Suposha and milk sales centre at Kandana recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that he often received loss making institutions with different state ministries in the past and he changed them all to profit making state institutions. "I distributed the profit among employees. But at a later state those profit making state institutions started to make losses again with the change of administration."
Senaratne stated that two or more state institutions can get together and open sales centres countrywide to supply their products to the people.
This is a very successful strategy, he pointed out.
Health Deputy Minister and many others were also present at the occasion.

Hamilton takes fourth title despite collision
MEXICO CITY: An ecstatic Lewis Hamilton became Britains first four-times Formula One world champion on Sunday after fighting back from last place following an opening-lap collision with arch-rival Sebastian Vettel at the Mexican Grand Prix.
In a race won by 20-year-old Dutch prodigy Max Verstappen, in a Red Bull, the 32-year-old Mercedes driver finished ninth to cement his place as his countrys most successful driver of all time.
Vettel, the only man who could have delayed the seemingly inevitable, ended up fourth after starting on pole position and then dropping to 19th following a pitstop to replace a broken front wing.
Hamilton has an unassailable lead of 56 points with two races, worth a total of 50, remaining in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.
It doesnt feel real. Thats not the kind of race that you want but I never gave up. I kept going right to the end, said a jubilant Hamilton, the British flag proudly draped over his shoulders.
He had raised both hands to his helmet as he took the chequered flag, with the crowd rising to applaud.
Lewis has done a superb job all year and deserves to win the title, said Vettel. Congratulations to him. It is his day.
Sundays race was both the best and worst of afternoons for the sports biggest star, who ended up sprinting down the pitlane chased by fans.
A winner nine times this season, including five of the six before Mexico, ninth was his lowest placing of the campaign and he did it despite having a badly damaged car at a track where overtaking is difficult enough anyway.
Hamiltons team mate Valtteri Bottas finished second at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen third.
Vettel had needed to be in the top two to have any chance of taking the title fight down to Brazil in two weeks time but his already slim hopes seemed to have disappeared within seconds of the start.
Verstappen, with nothing to lose and everything to gain from his front row position, seized the lead with an aggressive move through the opening right-left-right corners and the Red Bull bumping wheels with Vettel as he went through.
Hamilton, starting in third place, tried to follow Verstappen but the Ferraris front wing sliced Hamiltons rear right tyre as they made contact at turn three.
Did he hit me deliberately asked Hamilton over the radio, limping back to the pits and fully aware that Vettels only real hope of getting back into the reckoning would be if the Briton went out.
Not sure, Lewis, his race engineer Peter Bonnington said in reply. It looked far from deliberate and stewards swiftly decided that no further investigation of the incident was necessary.
Vettel pitted while Hamilton, who had started the day 66 points clear of his rival, had a longer stop while mechanics inspected his car for further damage.
The incident robbed the crowd of the prospect of a real duel between the two contenders, who will both be four-times champions when next season starts, but they still provided thrills as they fought back.
Hamilton, who had a thrilling wheel-to-wheel tussle with former McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso in the latter stages that could have cost him dear, had hoped to celebrate by spraying the winners champagne from the top of the podium.
Instead, there was the considerable consolation of being one of only five men -- Germanys Michael Schumacher, Argentinas Juan Manuel Fangio, Frances Alain Prost and Vettel -- to win four titles or more since the championship started in 1950.
Prost and Vettel both have four, with the late Fangio on five and Schumacher seven.
Hamiltons tally of titles took him above fellow-Briton Jackie Stewart and also his late Brazilian idol Ayrton Senna in the all-time lists.

Hazlewood targets Englands batting greenhorns
Sydney: Australia paceman Josh Hazlewood has warned Joe Roots England tourists and their raft of Ashes debutants they risk being exposed if their big guns dont fire in the coming series.
Englands depleted squad touched down in Perth on Sunday without suspended star all-rounder Ben Stokes.
Their arrival coincided with Hazlewoods Test pace partner Mitchell Starc picking up a career-best eight wickets with the pink ball in a Sheffield Shield match in Adelaide.
The world number twos inexperienced batting line-up has been highlighted as its biggest weakness as it aims to emulate the feat of Andrew Strauss men by becoming only the second England team to retain the Ashes urn in Australia in 31 years.
While doubts remain about the security of Australias top six batsmen, there is an air of confidence among their bowling attack heading into the opening Test at the Gabba on November 23.
If you get him (Root), Alastair Cook and Jonny Bairstow, who have been scoring runs the last few years, it places extra pressure on the inexperienced guys even more so, Hazlewood told Fairfax Media.
If we get the wood on them hopefully the rest fall in line.
Only Root, Cook and Bairstow have played a Test in Australia, while Gary Ballance was dropped during the last Ashes series and James Vince, Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan have played a combined total of 17 Tests without scoring a century. Root, rated the worlds second-best Test batsman, shapes as the key wicket for Australia despite a horror campaign in 2013/14 when he passed 50 once in eight innings and was then dropped. AFP

Horan desperate to be nominated for a Grammy
Niall Horan has joked he would rip someones arm off to be nominated for a Grammy Award.
The 24-year-old singer is currently enjoying solo success with his debut album Flicker, which boasts singles Slow Hands and This Town.
And with the announcement of who is up for one of the prestigious accolades at the 2018 ceremony just around the corner on 28 November, Niall is excited by the prospect of receiving a nod.
Id rip someones arm off for that, he laughed to New York City radio station Fresh 102.7s Karen & Jeffrey.
Just to be nominated would be amazing. Ive spent so many years watching it. It comes with all the prestige that everyone thinks it does. That would amazing, a far cry but well see what happens.
Niall also spoke about the creative process behind his first solo record, which he admits took him over a year to pen. Hes thrilled to have finally released all the material and has been busy performing his songs on various chat shows, including The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this week (beg23Oct17). One stand out tune on the deluxe edition track list is Mirrors, which the Irish star was inspired to write after a moment in a coffee shop.
I had this idea, obviously I see a lot of stuff online and I know girls in general, the One Direction heartthrob explained. I was in Pret (a Manger, cafe chain) one day in town and I was looking at my phone and I had seen a girl in the corner who I thought looked a little bit upset or whatever, (was) on her own and looked a little bit lonely. And the waiter came over and made her laugh out loud and her laugh made me look over.
Lyrics include the lines, The coffees cold/ He turned around and said I hope you know youre beautiful, have you ever been told / Shes a little shy.

'House of Cards' ending after Season 6

"House of Cards" will conclude after its sixth season, which is currentlyfilming, a source close to production tells CNN.
The announcement comes less than one day after star Kevin Spacey wasaccused of sexual misconductby an actor who says he was a minor at the time of the alleged incident.
The decision to end the show and the allegations facing Spacey were "two separate things," according to the source.
Two sources close to the show told CNN that the production team was told months prior to filming that the sixth season would be its last.
Netflix did not offer an official statement on the show's cancellation when contacted by CNN.

Its important to explore our identities and differences through art
Louvre Abu Dhabi is an encounter with beauty and creation.
The company did, however, address the allegations in a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, which produces the series.
"Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night's news concerning Kevin Spacey," the statement said. "In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time."
"House of Cards" is a five-time Emmy nominee for outstanding drama.
Spacey's work on the series has also earned him five Emmy nominations for outstanding actor in a drama. On the show, Spacey plays an amoral politician who ascends to the White House through troubling means.
Filming on Season 6 of "House of Cards" started about two weeks ago in the Baltimore area, according to a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Commerce.
On Sunday, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed about an alleged encounter with Spacey at a party in 1986, during which Spacey made a sexual advance toward the then 14-year-old Rapp.
Spacey issued a statement late Sunday, claiming he did not recall the incident but apologized for what he said would have been "inappropriate drunken behavior."
"But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years," Spacey said.
Prior to news of the show's end, "House of Cards" creator Beau Willimon issued a statement calling Rapp's accusations "deeply troubling."
"During the time I worked with Kevin Spacey on 'House of Cards,' I neither witnessed nor was aware of any inappropriate behavior on set or off," he said. "That said, I take reports of such behavior seriously and this is no exception. I feel for Mr. Rapp and I support his courage."
Spacey is the latest figure in entertainment to face allegations of sexual misconduct in what some are calling a new era in the industry -- one where long-silent victims of sexual assault and harassment feel emboldened to share their accounts.
The allegations made against movie executive Harvey Weinstein, detailed in stories byThe New York TimesandThe New Yorker, are seen as a turning point.
To date, Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than 60 women. He has denied the allegations of sexual assault. Following the initial report by the New York Times, he apologized for the way he "behaved with colleagues in the past."
The accusation against Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, comes as entertainment organizations seek ways to address sexual misconduct in the industry.
Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences earlier this month, and the organization said it intends to "establish a new code of conduct" for its members, according to amemoAcademy CEO Dawn Hudson sent to members.
"We believe our Academy has a role to play in fostering a safe and respectful atmosphere for the professionals who make motion pictures," the memo read in part.
Spacey is next set to appear in Ridley Scott's "All the Money in the World." The film is set to be the closing night film for AFI Fest, taking place November 9-16 in Los Angeles.
A spokesperson for the festival tells CNN that plan remains in place. "Our programming is locked and there will not be any changes to our film schedule," the spokesperson said in a statement.
The film is based on the 1973 abduction of John Paul Getty III. Spacey plays Getty's billionaire grandfather. Charlie Plummer, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg also star.
