President wants to scrap Executive Presidency
President Maitripala Sirisena's stance is that the Executive Presidency should be abolished, Cabinet spokesman, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
The SLFP Central Committee, chaired by President Sirisena, in the meantime, had stated that it had passed the resolution to continue with the Executive Presidency and have President Sirisena to contest a second term.
Though they have made that request, the President has not said yes," the minister said addressing the weekly cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
He said since 1994, all Presidents had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and used that very promised to get into power, but due to various practical or personal constraints, failed to live up to it, he said.
Either they didnt have two thirds majority or didnt want to do it. And given the war, there were practical issues of whether it was a wise decision to make. But after 2010, there has been no excuse to keep it. On January 8, we promised to abolish it. That is the mandate upon which is the government was formed," Minister Senaratne said.

Airport congestion under control
The initial congestion caused as a result of the partial closure of the Katunayake International Airport beginning January 6 has now been completely eased according to the Minister of Tourism Development. The airport is closed from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm daily for a period of three months to carry out resurfacing of the main runway.
Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga who has been closely monitoring the situation visited the Katunayake Airport on January 8th and followed it up with a meeting with airline representatives and Airport and Aviation Services Limited (AASL) officials at his office.
It was the general consensus among the airline representatives that congestion issues have been completely overcome and they in fact commended the authorities for their quick action to ease passenger traffic. Following reports of congestion on the first day of the partial closure, airport authorities swiftly moved in to action to minimize inconvenience to passengers by introducing a series of measures, noted Minister Amaratunga.
The Minister who visited the airport on an inspection tour observed first-hand the measures in place to ensure the smooth flow of passenger traffic. During a meeting at the airport which was attended by the Controller of Emigration and Immigration, AASL senior management, representatives of runway repair contractor, security heads and other top officials, the Minister inquired about operational issues and the measures that had been introduced.
The Minister was informed that the number of counters for check-ins, immigration and also customs has been increased corresponding to the increase in traffic. Having spoken to all the officials concerned and some of the passengers themselves I found that passenger flow was quite smooth and fast getting back to normal. It must be remembered that with 2 million tourist arrivals the airport is operating at 150% capacity, so until the new terminal is ready it's going to be a very busy airport, Minister Amaratunga said.
Some of the other measures that have been introduced are queue management, entertainment for waiting passengers, additional seating arrangements, passenger facilitation services in the emigration area and free Wi-Fi for passengers.
During the meeting at the airport we discussed the feasibility of introducing a separate business class check in area to ease main terminal passenger traffic. We are also exploring the possibility of enabling passenger check in at airline offices in Colombo. Logistics and emigration issues need to be worked out in this regard, explained Minister Amaratunga.
Senior management of all airlines operating in the country expressed their satisfaction with the measures in place during the meeting with the Tourism Minister in Colombo this morning.
The passenger flow is better than before the closure. The relevant authorities must be commended for their pro-activity, said Chandana De Silva representing a leading airline.
We are also looking at the possibility of reducing the 5 hour check in time. I'm confident this can be reduced in the near future, Minister Amaratunga said.

Amla hits  century in 100th Test
Johannesburg: Hashim Amla made a century in his 100th Test match as he and JP Duminy put South Africa in command on the first day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday.
South Africa reached 338 for three at the close of play, with Amla unbeaten on 124 at the Wanderers Stadium.
Duminy made 155 before he was caught at second slip off Lahiru Kumara in the penultimate over of the day, ending a third wicket partnership of 192.
Amla became the eighth player and second South African after former captain Graeme Smith to mark 100 Tests with a hundred.
After a lean run of form, Amla struggled early in his innings.
South Africas JP Duminy celebrates his hundred during the third Test against Sri Lanka on January 12, at Wanderers Cricket Stadium in Johannesburg.
The left-handed Duminy was the dominant partner as he shepherded Amla, who was dropped by Dhananjaya de Silva at gully off Suranga Lakmal when he had five.
Amla only scored six in the pairs first 50 runs together. Gradually, though, Amla found his timing and he reached his first half-century in 11 Test matches shortly before tea. He had faced 109 balls and hit seven fours.
He blossomed to hit his second half-century off only 60 balls, reaching his 26th Test hundred when he skipped down the wicket and lofted Rangana Herath over mid-off for his 14th four.
Duminy, by contrast, cruised to his half-century off 62 balls with ten boundaries and went on to his sixth Test century after facing 140 deliveries and adding four more boundaries. Duminys previous highest score in three previous Tests at the Wanderers was 29.
Amla and Duminy came together when both opening batsmen, Stephen Cook and Dean Elgar, were dismissed within six balls when the total was on 45.
Cook and Elgar survived the first hour before both were out soon after the mid-morning drinks break.
Cook, playing in a Test on his home ground for the first time, was leg before wicket to Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews for ten. He sought a review of umpire Bruce Oxenfords decision but was palpably in front of his stumps.
In the next over Elgar, on 27, pushed at a lifting delivery from Kumara and was caught at first slip by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Kumara finished the day with two for 79.
South Africa opted for an all-pace attack and gave a first cap to Duanne Olivier, 24, with left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj being left out. Left-arm seamer Wayne Parnell replaced Kyle Abbott, whose contract with Cricket South Africa was cancelled after he revealed he had signed a Kolpak contract to play English county cricket with Hampshire.
These are nice conditions for Duanne to make a debut, South African captain Faf du Plessis said at the toss.
Hes got a bit of pace and skill. Our best team in general conditions has a spinner but at the Wanderers in the past spin doesnt really play a role.

To be  or not  to be 
To be or not to be: Thats the question. The above words taken from Prince Hamlets soliloquy in William Shakespeares play by the same name must be in the mind of President Maithripala Sirisena in view of the new voices heard from spokesmen of his own party about retaining the executive presidency.
Championing the campaign for retention of the executive presidency the Dissanayake duo in the SLFP high Command  General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake and maverick politician S B Dissanayake want President Sirisena to contest the next Presidential election. Only former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has openly contradicted their story. Whether it is approved or not by the SLFP Central Committee it does not seem to be a result of careful deliberation for the party has been long campaigning for its abolition.
They have a fine argument. Since President Sirisena is now the President of the SLFP, a position thrust upon him, he must abide by the party decision. That is he is denied the freedom enjoyed today by everyone else in the SLFP who openly flout every canon of party discipline and general consensual behaviour. For example, former President Rajapaksa and the politicians hanging around him have the liberty even to form rival political parties.
Executive presidency
It is necessary to keep in mind that the above call for retention of the executive presidency has been made despite the explicit assurance given by President Sirisena that he would abolish it. That was an assurance given to the public and endorsed by 6.2 million people. No decision of a political party, least of all of the SLFP which stands disunited and fragmented could override this popular verdict. It would not be impolite to remind the SLFP that President Sirisena won despite its own opposition and most of those ask President Sirisena now to contest again for presidency were his opponents.
If President Sirisena agrees to the proposal of the Dissanayake duo he would be dishonouring his election promise. It would make him fall into the category of unreliable and opportunist politicians and ruin his stature as an honest statesman. Thus the acceptance of this proposal by the President would result in his own ruin. This would be an example how foolish and nave friends could be more dangerous than sworn enemies!
The main thing, however, is not what would happen to the President or to any other individual for that matter. It would be the effect on the country and its people. Almost four-decade old experience of the executive presidency has shown its dictatorial and anti-democratic nature. It has amassed enormous powers on an individual holding that office, who could override both the legislature and the judiciary at his will. It has proved to be disastrous with the legislature made impotent and the loss of independence of the judiciary. Retention of this authoritarian system would have the possibility of dragging the country towards the tribal and despotic regime that was ousted by the people on January 8th.
Constitutional reform process
This new love for the executive presidency has arisen parallel to the advance of the Constitutional reform process. It is a ploy to sabotage that effort by blackmailing the people that a change in the executive presidency would result in an inevitable defeat a referendum. This is also a ploy used by the racist forces to prevent any meaningful devolution of power to reach a democratic solution to the National Question. Thus its proponents want to kill several birds with one stone. That the SLFP seems to have capitulated its position to the racists is evidenced also by its reported hesitation to go beyond and even implement the 13th Amendment in full.
A presidential election is still far off. It would take place in 2020. Then, why hurry with naming candidates and speculating on alliances and chances of victory The talk is part of the speculation about the victory of the SLFP
over the UNP at the next Presidential election. Here Constitutional changes are mirrored in personalities and not based on policies. It is not individuals that matter but policies and practices. The question is whether the Constitution would advance democracy and not whether it could produce a Messiah to solve all problems
A presidential election is still far off. It would take place in 2020.

Here Constitutional changes are mirrored in personalities and not based on policies. It is not individuals that matter but policies and practices. The question is whether the Constitution would advance democracy and not whether it could produce a Messiah to solve all problems.
The SLFP internal feud will not die off before the next presidential election. The new political party of the Rajapaksa clique would continue to challenge the official SLFP leadership. Whatever deals that it may have with certain leading personalities of both the SLFP and the UNP, it would in all probability would field its own candidate, at least a proxy at the presidential election ensuring a three-cornered fight in the main.
Though its result cannot be foreseen it will not be a new version of the comedy film Three Idiots. It has, however, the possibility of a defeat for the incumbent in office, should he consent to contest.
Consensus Government
Leaving speculation on a far-off election, the SLFP could far better concentrate its energies on serious soul-searching to find out what went wrong and convert it into disciplined modern party with democratic ideals shedding racist and opportunist deviations of the immediate past so that it could better withstand the rigours of any election battle.
Also it has a duty by the people to honour election pledges of President Sirisena and respect its own agreement with the UNP and to take part in a consensus Government or abrogate the agreement and openly separate honourably. The absurd policy of keeping the cake and eating it simultaneously should be abandoned.
In conclusion, it must be said that retention of the executive presidency should be opposed by all who desire a change for the better. Unless the masses openly challenge this despotic call for its retention people would again be thrown into suffering under a more autocratic a regime, whatever the hues and shades in its political spectrum may be.

Constitutional reforms: TPA  posits second chamber  in Parliament
As the drafting of the new Constitution remains a priority of the government in 2017, National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan in an interview with the Daily News said the four parties: Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), All Ceylon Muslim Congress (ACMC) and Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) too have come with their own draft proposals to be discussed. He has insisted that the currently proposed mixed system be done away with and replaced with a fairer system for minor parties.
They are trying to take away the one-man dictatorship and replace it with a two party dictatorship," Ganesan said.
Excerpts:
Q. What has been the view of the minority parties with regard to the new Constitution making process
A. The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) (where I am the leader) which consists of the Upcountry Peoples Front, Democratic Peoples Front and National Union of Workers (NUW), the SLMC, ACMC and EPDP- the four parties represented in the Steering Committee have got together and started discussions to produce a common paper. We have a draft now.
Q. This is in addition to the six sub-committee reports
A. Yes.
Q. Do you think the reports have not adequately addressed minority rights
A. No, they have, but they are coming from a general perspective, we put forward the view from our parties. A lot of input is forthcoming from all over, even the Public representations were put through Lal Wijenayakas report.
Q. What are the differences between your draft paper and the sub-committee reports
A. We have discussed seven main points of power sharing, Executive Presidency, territorial integrity, language, religion, national anthem and electoral reforms.
Q. When you talk of power sharing, we also have the sub-committee report on Centre and Periphery relations where they do recommend certain changes such as making the post of governor nominal and giving more powers to chief ministers. What are your views
A. we agree to most of the proposals in sub-committee reports. In addition, we have some views. We mostly talk of the dispersed minorities living in the Central, Western, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces. Almost 65 percent of the Muslims live outside of the North and Eastern provinces. We are living in various pockets; in certain areas, we are dense, but in most areas, we are living with the Sinhala community. We live in dispersed formation. Only in Nuwara Eliya, the Indian Tamil Community is living in higher numbers. We have taken this into account.
Our proposal is based on the Pradeshiya Sabha (local government) format in rural areas. In urban and semi urban areas, there will be urban and municipal councils. We are mostly concerned with rural areas. Our opinion is that there should be a Pradeshiya Sabha for 25,000 people. No Pradeshiya Sabha should exceed that limit. In the Eastern and Northern Provinces, there are Pradeshiya Sabhas for about 7,000 people, while in Nuwara Eliya, there are over 200,000 people in the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha. It is unfair. That is the basic unit for power devolution.
A Pradeshiya Sabha will be established in the divisional secretariat area as a norm.
Q. You are asking to increase the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas
A. Yes. A Pradeshiya Sabha should have 25,000 people and not more. It is then that government services will reach the people. If you have more people, it is difficult to administer. In this format, republican democracy will prevail in the country.
In addition to this, when it comes to power devolution, we have proposed a second chamber in Parliament. Its main role is to review the laws passed in the first chamber. It wont have the right to cancel the law, but will review and ask Parliament to check it again. That will have 36 members. Out of 36, 18 will be Sinhalese, six Sri Lankan Tamils, six Muslims and six Tamils of Indian Origin. So, 18 majority and 18 minority, that is the safeguard we have to review the laws. This wont be for all the laws.
Q. This is something even the Prime Minister has proposed
A. Yes. He has spoken about it, but he hasnt spoken about the composition. Thats what we have proposed.
Q. Going back to the Pradeshiya Sabha and power devolution, you speak of a dispersed minority, so will you also be wanting a minority quota when appointing members
A. Our people are not concentrated in large numbers, maybe 25,000 or so, wherever you have that, you have a Pradeshiya Sabha. We say Divisional Secretariats shall be demarcated wherever possible, for the Communities of Interest (CoI), whether racial, religious or such other like interest, but differing in one or more respects from "the majority of the citizens and being minorities in that district and/or province, as the case may be.
We got this sentence from the Donoughmore Constitution.
Q. In that sense, if there are 25,000 people, you want a member representing the majority race in that group represented in the Pradeshiya Sabha
A. Yes. In Sinhala dominated areas, that is the case, we are just asking for that in the Tamil and Muslim areas.
People talk of federalism and district councils, but we are not talking about that. We are talking about the grass roots level of government.
Q. In that case, we wont need Federalism if we have more minorities at the grassroots
A. Our proposals are not for federalism, but I cannot answer that. We are talking of dispersed minorities, not talking about the Sri Lankan Tamils in the North and East.
Their realities are different from ours, we cannot expect them to take our proposals and at the same time, their proposals cannot be put to us here. Everyone has their own proposals.
Q. Then we have the Executive Presidency, the SLFP Central Committee has asked that it be kept. Whats your stance
A. We dont want to call it Executive Presidency. We want the President to be elected directly by the people. Presidential powers shall be answerable to Parliament and the powers of the President shall be as per the original proposals of the 19th Amendment.
The original proposals were not passed because certain clauses were not acceptable, but we want to go back and have the President be held more answerable to Parliament.
The Presidents tenure should be five years. There should be a fixed date for Presidential elections. The President should not hold any other portfolio apart from Provincial councils and Defence.
Q. You have not asked for the abolishment of the Executive Presidency
A. No, we have changed our stance. Prior to the last Presidential elections, minority parties have thought that the Executive Presidency was favourable to us, because at least after six years, they come to us to form a government. But when the whole country was against it, we thought we should not be a hurdle and went with what the country wanted. But now we see that the people who proposed the abolishment are also against it, so why should we worry about it We thought we might as well go back to our earlier stance.
Q. You change your stance based on the direction the wind blows
A. No it is not that. This was our original stance. The reason is that electoral reforms are coming. That is not favourable to us. It favours majority parties. When we spoke to the UNP and SLFP, both unanimously say that when there is no Executive Presidency, the country will be unstable. The majority parties have to have more power and seats to maintain stability. In the name of stability, they are trying to rob the fair opportunities of the minority parties. Hence, we thought it was better to keep the Executive Presidency; at least part of it and reduce its powers. At the same time, we need to have electoral reforms in a fair manner.
Q. What are your other proposals
A. We have proposed that Sri Lanka be known as United Republic of Sri Lanka. United, not Unitary.
Sri Lanka will consist of nine provinces. In the current Constitution, there is no reference to provinces, only districts, so we want this to be included.
When we come to language, we ask that Sri Lanka shall be written, stated and known as Sri Lanka in all three languages, namely Sinhala, Tamil and English. The Constitutional clauses amended by 13th and 16th Amendments relating to the subject of languages shall continue to prevail and the current format of Article 18(1) shall be amended and shall read as Sinhala and Tamil shall be the Official Languages of Sri Lanka.
At present, 18 is the language clause. 18 (1) says that Sinhala will be the official language of Sri Lanka. 18 (2) says that Tamil will also be another official language of Sri Lanka. We dont want that second sentence, we want both put in one sentence.
The other proposal is on religion. We ask that the clause relating to the subject of Religion shall read as The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give Buddha Dharshanaya, the foremost place and accordingly, it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).
Right now, it is Buddhism, so we asked that it be changed to Buddha Dharshanaya (vision).
Q. Whats the difference between the old clause on Buddhism and this
A. At present, it says that the State should give Buddhism foremost place and then in the next clause that all other religions also should be given equal protection. Those two contradict each other, no one has gone to courts over this.
What we are saying that we will upgrade the clause from Buddhism to Buddhist Darshanaya which no one has a problem with. The Buddhist vision is applicable to all, there is nothing wrong there and those following other religions will also be happy with it.
Then we have national anthem. The clause relating to the subject of National Anthem shall read The National Anthem of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall be "Sri Lanka Matha" in Sinhala language and Sri Lanka Thaaye in Tamil language as per the words and music of which are set out in the relevant schedules.
Finally, electoral reforms. We have proposed a system called zonal electoral systems. This is similar to the idea in the 14th Amendment. This was proposed earlier. At present, we have 24 electoral districts in the country. This has to be increased and called zones. We have proposed that there should be at least 50 electoral zones in the country. The number of Parliament seats will be increased to 245 from 225. There will be 215 from electoral zones and 30 from the national list. The main reason given for a new system is that the preferential voting system gives room to intra-party and inter-party violence and commotion. A district needs more expenditure. Theres absence of accountability and when the MP has to cover a large area, he/she is not directly connected to voters. But the new proposals are unfair by the minor parties, not minority, but minor parties. Other than the UNP and SLFP all are minor parties. They are trying to take away the one-man dictatorship and replace it with a two party dictatorship.
In what we propose, if you take Colombo district, it would be divided into three zones. Every zone will have about six MPs each. Ultimately, our target will be achieved as the area is smaller and less people would be contesting each other.
This is easier to implement even with the current system.
Q. But you would still have the preferential voting system
A. Yes. We can do away with it if people want, that can be discussed further.
Q. But if you want this system, you will have to start rolling it out before the next local government elections
A. Yes. And we want the same system practiced at the Parliamentary, Provincial Council and Local Government elections. The current laws should be dismissed.
Q. This is no different to the First-Past the Post system though it has the preferential voting system. Except that, the zones are of a bigger area
A. Yes.
Q. But the main objection was against the Preferential Voting System. There will have to be a compromise here
A. Yes. But we have reduced 21 candidates fighting each other to five. Whether it is electoral system, power sharing, territorial integrity, language or religion, we will have to compromise at some point. We cant eat the cake and have it.
Q. When talking of electoral reforms, at the recent party leaders meeting with the Prime Minister, it was reported that all had agreed to go with the new system for the local government elections
A. That report is wrong. We have no such agreement. The Prime Minister never said that, it was reported wrongly in the media. The Prime minister said, let all the parties decide. He remained silent most of the time anyway and got his party secretary Kabir Hashim to speak.
The new system has more problems, apart from delimitation, the law itself needs to be changed. According to the elections commissioner, there are 54 areas which need to be changed, it is no easy task.
Q. With all these demands, do you think the Local Government elections will be delayed further
A. If they accept our system, the local government elections can be held soon. No issue. Even other parties like the JVP will agree.
What was discussed up to now was the draft circulated among the four parties I mentioned earlier. It has to be agreed on.

Delhis apathy stalls Tamil settlement in Sri Lanka
The regime change in Sri Lanka exactly two years ago  ouster of incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his replacement by Maithripala Sirisena (as president) and Ranil Wickremesinghe (as prime minister)  was cause celebre for Delhi, dripping with triumphalism that a pro-Chinese government was overthrown through democratic methods. But as Sirisena celebrates two years in power, Delhi cannot but feel embarrassed.
The Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement couldnt be negotiated by end-2016 as expected. In fact, the negotiations brought to the fore atavistic fears in the Sri Lankan mind regarding Indian domination. As for the Sri Lankan Tamil problem, Indias retrenchment under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seriously weakened the prospects of a permanent settlement. With Donald Trump as president, American pressure tactic also eases dramatically.
Sinhala nationalism
Rajapaksa is riding the wings of strident Sinhala nationalism and he is getting the smell of blood, given the anti-incumbency building up against the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government under the conditions of growing popular discontent  rising cost of living, cut in social subsidies and social services and high level of unemployment. Rajapaksa cannot topple the Sirisena government due to the 19th constitutional amendment, which bars the dissolution of the parliament, even by the Sri Lankan president, until it has completed four and a half years of its full five-year term. But he can either replace Wickremesinghe
himself or be the kingmaker who exercises power
without holding office
The policy assumptions in Delhi that Sri Lanka could be incrementally entrapped in a ring of cultural nationalism and political bonhomie, making Colombo eventually a satellite within Indian orbit completely overlooked the mainsprings of Sinhala nationalism  culturally, historically and politically. Our Hindutva folks schooled in Chanakya and unaware of contemporary history and politics got their sums hopelessly wrong. An insightful op-Ed in The Hindu last week ended with this cry in the wilderness: For lakhs of Tamils still struggling to rebuild their lives since the islands brutal war that ended seven years ago, the wait has been long and painful. As far as the two leaders (Sirisena and Wickremesinghe) are concerned, it is as much a question of political will as it is of ability. It is now or probably never.
Over and above, Delhis strategic calculus was that Sirisena would roll back Chinese influence in Sri Lanka, but, on the contrary, Beijing quickly adapted itself to the new power-brokers in Colombo and is, if anything, doing one better than during the Rajapaksa era. China is gearing up for a vast expansion in the strategic Hambantota region and Sirisena government is forcefully quelling the local populations resistance to it. China is also drawing Sri Lanka close in security cooperation both bilaterally as well as within the ambit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. And, the mother of all ironies is that it is Rajapaksa who is currently encouraging the popular resistance to the Chinese SEZ. At a press conference recently, he said:
15,000 acres is too much. We wanted to give only 750 acres. These are peoples agricultural lands.
Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government
We are not against Chinese or Indians or Americans coming here for investment. But we are against the land being given to them and the privatisation that they are doing.
Rajapaksa is riding the wings of strident Sinhala nationalism and he is getting the smell of blood, given the anti-incumbency building up against the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government under the conditions of growing popular discontent  rising cost of living, cut in social subsidies and social services and high level of unemployment.
Rajapaksa cannot topple the Sirisena government due to the 19th constitutional amendment, which bars the dissolution of the parliament, even by the Sri Lankan president, until it has completed four and a half years of its full five-year term.
But he can either replace Wickremesinghe himself or be the kingmaker who exercises power without holding office.
The bottom line is that almost always the calculations behind regime change agenda go awry  be it in Sri Lanka or Nepal. Delhi should understand this. A recent book on the regime change in Sri Lanka, The January 8th Revolution: As I Have Seen It, authored by a first class political turncoat and parliamentarian of the ruling party who was a camp follower of Rajapaksa but switched to Sirisena, describes how Rajapaksa was overthrown in a deep-seated political conspiracy. The focus is on Chandrika Kumaranatunga as the chief caballer, but it is not particularly difficult to make out the foreign hand behind her  Clinton Foundation and so on.
From the Indian perspective, what stands out is the intriguing presence of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) as Kumaranatungas sidekick.
Evidently, TNA leadership came under pressure from Delhi to collaborate with her, although the veteran Tamil leaders were not country bumpkins unfamiliar with cosmopolitan politics or were unaware of Sirisenas deep roots in Sinhala nationalism and his controversial role as Rajapaksas right-hand man in the final bloodbath of the war against the LTTE.
At the end of the day, TNA leaders at least got a few crumbs that fell off from the high table of Colombo politics as they sold out Tamil interests. But Modi government and Hindutva folks who mentored its Sri Lanka policies got nothing.

Drought expected: Use power and water carefully, warns Disaster Management Minister

There will be a lack of rain fall leading to a severe a drought during the coming three months and the public is asked to use water and electricity carefully, Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said today at a press conference at the Department of Government Information.
The minister said the country had not received rainfall expected last year and the heavy rains in May and November were not enough to fill the total water requirement of the year - A three-month rainless season can be expected with rains only expected at the end of March, he said.
At present, the major reservoirs are filled to only 27 percent capacity while medium-scale reservoirs contain less than 30 percent.
Paddy cultivation is meanwhile at only about 1/3 and that will affect the coming Yala season, the Minister explained, adding that rice production in the major producing areas has also fallen to less than 35 percent.
Considering the situation, government officials have been deployed to 13 districts - Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Puttlam, Trincomalee, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Batticoloa, Mulativu, Hambantota, and Monaragala to discuss the prevailing situation with the relevant district officials and make necessary arrangements to provide relief.
Minister Yapa said water would be supplied through bowsers, where necessary: About 1,754 water tanks have been requested by all the districts and they will be provided following the due tender process, he added.
Meanwhile, he revealed, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board will repair hand pumps that are not working.
The UN Development Fund and the UN Food Program have also been briefed of the situation, he added.
The Disaster Management Minister said President Sirisena has instructed the appointed Cabinet Sub -Committee to submit a report regarding the prevailing situation.
Accordingly, a number of ministries including Water Supply, Irrigation, Agriculture, Social Welfare, and Power and Renewable Energy had submitted the report to the Cabinet of Ministers, he said - a special meeting in this regard will be held this evening under the patronage of President Sirisena.

EDEX Entrepreneur Zone enhanced at EDEX Expo 2017
Sri Lanka's largest education exhibition and job fair, EDEX Expo 2017 conducted by Royal College Union (RCU) will be held at the BMICH, Colombo on January 20.
The main objective of conducting this annual exhibition is to encourage youth to continue their higher studies after school education.
The novel and a significant feature of this year's Expo will be the EDEX Entrepreneur Zone where youth are encouraged to start their own business while providing employment to job seekers.
EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedara requested schools and university students and also interested parties to attend the EDEX grand opening ceremony.
Galagedara said three Exhibitions are held in Colombo and Kandy every year and the objective of holding these Exhibitions are to create the awareness of Sri Lankan youth about existing local and international educational courses. He said the exhibition will facilitate spot admissions to selected academic, vocational, technical and professional courses and post graduate programmes.They will be offered by both local and foreign educational institutions.
He also highlighted the promise made by Government to create 1,000,000 new jobs and EDEX could achieve this target.
"We also urge a reforming of the education system that prepares our youth to realise their full potential, academically and socially as youth are not just qualified youth they need practical skills, soft skills and marketing abilities.
Some youth without knowing the importance of higher education leave the country and work as unskilled labourers and housemaids and it is extremely difficult to find young people for construction, plantations, hospitality industries and as a result some are proposing to import foreign workers to sustain certain industries.
"Our work includes providing career and higher education guidance placements, promoting market relevant skills, providing jobs to job seekers, sustainable living and many outreach programmes to offer equity to rural student communities.The EDEX Entrepreneurship Zone launched last year will witness a new enhancement in terms of the innovation theme.
Royal College Principal B.A. Abeyratne said students should know the importance of receiving higher education after the Advanced Level Examination.
Accordingly, EDEX will immensely help them to follow various educational courses 
He also said it is our responsibility to empower youth, with education, skills development and training, so that they are ready and equipped to make a better tomorrow for themselves.
It is said all educational institutions which tie up with the EDEX organizing committee have agreed to offer discounted course fees , full or partial scholarships and many other offers with financial support options for the benefit students.
Former Chairman EDEX, Kamala Abeysinghe said the Expo will live up to its reputation to be a comprehensive platform offering choices , options in realizing opportunities in school to work transition, entrepreneurship and sustainability. He said large number of students who passed the AL Examination and not selected to universities due to cut-off marks have no idea about other higher studies that they should follow and thanked EDEX Committee to educate children on these problems. The EDEX Exhibition and Job Fair will be open from 10.00 am on the opening day and from 9.00am from January 21 and 22.
The print media sponsor of the exhibition is Daily News and Sunday Observer.

Equality at work: Scope and Developments
Part I
Income inequality between the rich and poor is increasing almost everywhere in the world, because among other factors, of the weakened bargaining strength of labour, due to multiple options available to capital in the globalized economy. Intensified global competition is adversely affecting the working conditions and labour standards world over.
Calls for re-asserting social and labour rules relating to work environment in todays global market place, culminated in 1998 with the historic at the International Labour Conference, a solemn declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, emphasizing on eight I.L.O Conventions  No. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, 111, 138, and 182. While all I.L.O. Conventions are important, the international community during the late 1990s had underlined the importance of this particular group of Conventions, known as the core labour standards.
The core labour standards are binding on all member states of the I.L.O including on those states, which have not ratified the eight conventions. They are both Universal and inalienable and are not relevant to the stage of economic development of the country and are binding on all the member states, irrespective of their economic progress. Following this Declaration, all members of the I.L.O. are obliged to respect, promote and realized in good faith the eight core conventions.
Sri Lanka has ratified the eight core conventions. The I.L.O. identified these core labour standards following the Social Summit held in Copenhagen in 1995 which said the Millennium Goals and the Global Compact as the social floor of the emerging global economy, to counteract the erosion of worker rights.
The I.L.O felt that good governance of the labour market based on respect for fundamental principles and rights can contribute to a stable social and political environment and make the Declaration as the key to such an environment. Social dimension is essential to the success of the structural adjustment and good social policy is an integral part of economic efficiency.
The aforesaid I.L.O Declaration obliges its member States to respect the principles that are the heart of these core Conventions, which include (a) free of association (No.87) (b) effective recognition of the right to engage in collective bargaining (No.98) (c) elimination of forced or compulsory labour (Nos. 29 and 105) (d) elimination of discrimination in employment (Nos. 100 and 111) and (e) elimination of child labour and child abuse (Nos .138 and 182).
Discrimination in employment Conventions
Out of the above mentioned eight core Conventions, two are related to elimination of discrimination in employment.
They are (i) Equal Remuneration Convention No.100 of 1951.
(ii) Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention No. 111 of 1958.
The right to freedom from discrimination is inherent in the ILO. Constitution and in the labour standards. Equal Remuneration Convention No. 100 of 1951 emphasizes the need to promote equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value while Discrimination in Employment Convention No.111 of 1958, defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion for preference made on the bases of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation and allows additional criteria included after consultation by the Government with the employers and worker organisations. It aims to promote equality of opportunity and treatment for men and women workers with family responsibilities.
Violation of human rights
Discrimination bars people from some occupations, denies them a job altogether at times and does not reward them according to their merit on account of their ethnicity, race, caste, sex or social background. This generates a social and economic disadvantage that in turn leads to inefficiency and unequal outcomes. Discrimination at work is a violation of human rights that entails a waste of human talents, with detrimental effects on productivity and may lead to social upheavals and may adversely affect investment and economic growth. Discrimination stifles opportunities, wasting the human talents need for economic progress, accentuates social tensions and inequalities. Compacting discrimination is an essential part of promoting decent work. Millions of women and men around the world are denied access to jobs and training, receive low wages, or are restricted to certain assumptions simply on the bases of their sex, skin colour, ethnicity or beliefs, without regard to their capabilities and skills.
Discrimination may be direct or indirect  direct when rules, practices and policies, exclude openly, people of certain ethnicity or of certain political party or give preference to certain individuals. Discrimination also occurs when the same job of equal value a migrant worker  an expatriate receives a higher pay than a national. Forms of direct discrimination include job advertisements stating discriminating conditions.
Human resources practices that require regular pregnancy tests of female employee, conditions prohibiting female employees marrying while in employment, are act of violations of the Conventions Nos. 100 and 111. Discrimination is indirect when apparently neutral forms and practices have disproportionate effect on one or more identifiable groups without justification. Differential treatment of particular categories of workers in the form of inferior social benefits or remuneration also amounts to discrimination. The lower protection granted to domestic servants (most of them are lower income male and female workers belonging to racial and ethnic minorities) under the various laws of our country also tantamount to discrimination and a violation of the above two conventions.
The state has a major responsibility in ensuring equality, at not only in public sector but also in private sector workplaces. Equally the trade unions and employers two have the responsibility to ensure that discrimination does not prevail in their work places.
ILO Headquarters in Geneva: The right to freedom from discrimination is inherent in the ILO
Despite a number of positive moves in terms of policies and legislation, the overall condition of women in Sri Lanka had not significantly changed. Bias in recruitment in working conditions, gender based low wages / salaries and cultural inhibitions, still keep the gender gap wide. The distinction made between male and female in fixing of minimum wages under the various wages boards for works of equal value is also discriminatory and is in conflict of with conventions No.100 and 111.
Collective bargaining and equality
With regard to interface between collective bargaining and equality, one important fact is that these two fundamental principles and rights are mutually reinforcing and can together promote work place governance which reconciles economic with social goals. Unequal access to collective bargaining is an equality challenge. Inequitable access to collective bargaining is a human right issue that implicates systematic discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups in the work place.
For equality to be advanced through the collective bargaining process, it is essential that trade unions and employers be committed to seeking it. The process of preparing for collective bargaining by both unions and employers and the setting of bargaining demands and prorates should include an assessment of existing problems of inequality and discrimination. Inclusive strategies for consultation and participation of historically excluded and disadvantaged groups are essential to identifying and defining problems of inequality.
Collective agreements and achievement of equality
Discrimination bars people from some occupations, denies them
a job altogether at times and does not reward them according to their merit on account of their ethnicity, race, caste, sex or social background. This generates a social and economic disadvantage that in turn leads to inefficiency and unequal outcomes. Discrimination at work is a violation of human rights that entails a waste of human talents, with detrimental effects on productivity and may lead to social upheavals and may adversely affect investment and economic growth
An important starting point for implementing equality at work is inclusion in the collective agreement of a basic commitment to equality and non-discrimination. Equality rights clauses may also serve as interpretive aids to other provisions in the collective agreement.
In the face of ambiguity or potentially contradictory provisions in the collective agreements, an anti-discriminatory clause may reinforce interpretations that are consistent with equality there is much potential within collective agreements to promote equality. Creative bargains struck in a context  sensitive fashion can greatly enhance the promotion of equality.
Legislation setting a floor flow of decent working conditions, including minimum wage laws, restrictions on hours of works, minimum rest periods as well as occupational safety and health legislative systems, serve a crucial equality role. Therefore, the importance of legislation on minimum working conditions for the promotion of equality is affirmed.
Bringing equality to the work place has significant economic benefits too. Employers who practice equality have access to a larger and more diverse work force. Workers who enjoy equality have greater access to training, often receive higher wages and improve the overall quality of the workforce. The profits of a globalized economy are more fairly distributed in a society with equality, leading to greater social stability and broader public support for further economic development.
Equality of human beings before the law is one of the most important of human rights and that it may be regarded as fundamental in the sense that it is the basis for the development of guaranties of specific human rights.
The concept of equality which is central to the discussion of justice lies at the root of the democratic idea. Many great revolutions aimed at shaking off arbitrary rule of one form or another has stressed this concept of equality. The question arises whether increased equality can only be achieved at the expense of liberty or conversely, whether expanding liberty must diminish equality. Learned opinion is divided on this matter. On the one hand, it is clear that certain degree of liberty is necessary to promote the ideal of equality. For example, to achieve economic equality in a society, a measure of liberty is necessary. Lord Acton, one of the outstanding thinkers on the concept of freedom, emphasized that equality unrestrained could destroy freedom.

Fair administration, satisfied citizens
I was astonished to come across the front page news item (9.1.2017), no one can topple the Government. It is absolutely true that no outside force can topple the legally formed democratic Government. Even internal force like the defeated political force cannot change the elected regime in power.
Neither foreign countries nor the conspirators will be able to capture the ruling power under the current situation in which Yahapalanaya is in progress and strong with promotion of economic development and ethnic harmony. Then what is wrong with the Good Governance Even enemies of the coalition administration cannot utter a word of animosity since everything is fairly and reasonably done without leaving anything for discrimination and denial.
It must be mentioned to the credit of the president and the prime minister that the precaution and vigilance have been exercised in preventing the evils of corruption in all the fields.
Then the police, and military forces have been reformed with good morality while the judiciary has been made independent of political intervention.
As a result, an exemplary democracy has been firmly established within two years of honest and hard work by the coalition government.
Then, there is no reason for anyone to attempt disrupting the smooth process of the administration after all. It is the bounden duty of all to extend the fullest co-operation towards the successful journey of the regime.

A programme to distribute fruit plants for home gardening will be launched to prevent the outflow of Rs 1.5 billion when importing fruits, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He made this observation after participating in a tree planting campaign organised to mark the second year anniversary of President Maithripala Sirisena after assuming office. Ranawaka said by cultivating fruit at home, the people could get fruit free of charge.
"Benefits of such a programme will be earned by the country and the people," he said.
"Although there are a variety of imported fruits in supermarkets, the quality is questionable," Minister Ranawaka said. "It is advisable to cultivate our own fruit in our land."
He said as the Environment Minister from 2007 to 2010, he took measures to distribute fruit saplings among the people.
The minister said around 100 of these people offered him a basket full of fruits when he went for election canvassing.

Good news for dieters!
It's that time of year when many of us are counting calories and making sure we don't eat more than we really need to.
But some foods are guaranteed to make you feel free from any guilt as you'll burn more calories by chewing and digesting them than you'll consume.
While most people know celery is one of these super-healthy zero calorie foods, some others on the list may surprise you - including strawberries and swede.
Some foods are guaranteed to make you feel free from any guilt as you'll burn more calories by chewing and digesting them than you'll consume - including apples
From apricots to asparagus, and garlic to grapefruit, these very healthy snacks are what are known as 'zero-calorie foods', according to experts.
And when eaten in moderation, they will not contribute to your daily calorie total, it's said.

1. APPLES
Calorie content: 47 kcals per 100g
As the old saying goes, an apple a day keeps the doctor away - and there may be some truth to it. Apples are packed full of important vitamins such as C, and A and can promote heart health.
2. APRICOTS
Calorie content: 12 kcals per apricot
Eating apricots is said to help reduce the risk of strokes, and heart attacks. They're also full of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fibre, which all promote good heart health.
3. ASPARAGUS
Calorie content: 6 kcals per spear
As well as being packed with antioxidants, it contains lots of essential vitamins such as A, C, E and K along with plenty of fibre.
Cauliflower is another vegetable that when you eat a floret, you'll burn more calorie by digesting and chewing than you consume
4. BEETROOT
Calorie content: 36 kcals per 100g
Beetroot is a good source of iron and folate as well as containing plenty of antioxidants. It's also been said to lower blood pressure, boost exercise performance and prevent dementia.

Broccoli is a great source of vitamins K and C, and also has lots of potassium and fibre. It also contains plenty of the powerful antioxidant Vitamin C which is said to help cuts heal quicker and fight off diseases such as cancers.
6. CAULIFLOWER
Calorie content: 3 kcals per floret
One serving of cauliflower is said to contain 77 per cent of an adult's daily recommended allowance for vitamin C. The vegetable is also a great source of other important vitamins.
7. CELERY
Calorie content: 2 kcals per stick
It's mainly water which is why you'll burn more calories than consume them when you eat this vegetable.
Watermelon is another fruit packed full of health benefits that won't contribute to your daily calorie intake

8. CRANBERRIES
Calorie content: 15 kcals per 100g
These red fruits are another great source of vitamin C, as well as fibre, manganese, and plenty of antioxidants.
9. WATERCRESS
Calorie content: 4 kcals per quarter of a bunch
Watercress is thought to have medicinal properties and contains particularly high levels of vitamin K - important for bone health - and vitamin A (eye health). It also contains glucosinolate compounds, which have been found to have anti-cancer properties.
10. CUCUMBER
Calorie content: 6 kcals per 1 inch piece
This vegetable is mostly water, and helps to flush out toxins from the body, say health experts. It also helps you stay hydrated, and contributes to both heart and eye health.
11. FENNEL
Calorie content: 12 kcals per 100g
As well as containing lots of fibre, it is thought that fennel helps to rebalance the female sex hormones blamed for some of the symptoms of PMT.
12. GARLIC
Calorie content: 49 kcals per 100g
It won't be zero calorie if you eat too much of it, but you'll burn off more calorie than you consume if you eat one clove, it's said.
Strawberries are not only a zero calorie food but a superfood as well because they contain lots of vitamin C
13. GRAPEFRUIT
Calorie content: 24 kcals per half a grapefruit
A study has found that drinking grapefruit juice when eating fatty food lowers the amount of weight put on by up to a fifth.
14. GREEN BEANS
Calorie content: 24 kcals per 100g
Eating green beans will help you get a flat stomach, according to some nutritionists. It's packed full of essential vitamins and vitamins, as well as some protein too.
15. KALE
Calorie content: 33 kcals per 100g
There are dozens of claims about the cancer-beating properties of kale, and while some nutritionists say eating broccoli and brussels sprouts is actually better for you, the vegetable still contains plenty of essential vitamins.

A great  achievement
The restoration of the European Unions Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP Plus) is one of the most significant diplomatic victories of the Yahapalana Government, on par with its handling of the human rights resolutions at the UN Human Rights Council.
This is great news for our exports sector, especially the apparel industry which accounts for 46 percent of Sri Lankas exports to the EU, with the GSP Plus being a trade concession system that allows developing countries to pay less or no duties on their exports to the EU. This gives them vital access to EU markets and contributes to their economic growth. The one-way trade preferences would consist of the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries, the EU said.
The mention of the UNHRC in the first paragraph is no coincidence. Sri Lanka lost the GSP Plus status in 2010 during the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency, due to the UNHRC alleging violations of human rights. The GSP+ trade concessions are linked to a countrys compliance with human rights and labour rights conventions.
When the EU evaluated Sri Lanka in 2014 it found that the country was not adhering to three of the 27 international covenants that a country must abide to qualify for the consideration of GSP Plus. Although the previous Government raised a hue and cry about these conditions affecting Sri Lankas sovereignty, they were actually beneficial to all Sri Lankans. Human rights are universal  we must adhere to all HR norms and practices if we are to be a member of the global community. Sri Lanka very nearly became a pariah state because the previous Governments lackadaisical attitude to human rights and its failure to address any of the concerns raised by the international community.
In restoring the facility, the European Council has said it welcomed the significant advances made by Sri Lanka to restore democratic governance, initiate national reconciliation and re-engage with the international community and the United Nations system while noting that the country still has room for improvement on the HR front.
It was none other than President Maithripala Sirisena who broke the news that the EU was on the verge of re-granting this facility. President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera deserve plaudits for this achievement that is yet another sign that Sri Lanka is no longer isolated on the global stage.
The restoration of GSP Plus will be a huge boost for the apparel industry, but it is not the only industry that will benefit. There are a variety of other products from flowers to precious metals that come under the purview of GSP Plus. Now these industries face the onerous challenge of making the maximum use of the GSP Plus facility, bearing in mind that Sri Lanka is not the only pebble on the beach.
In fact, some of Sri Lankas most fierce competitors in apparel and several other industries in the Asian region also enjoy the GSP or GSP Plus trade concessions. Among them are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor Leste and Yemen. Worldwide, there are eight countries that enjoy the enhanced GSP Plus - Armenia, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay and the Philippines. We have to catch up with some of these countries that enjoyed GSP Plus uninterrupted.
This is essential, since the EU is Sri Lanka's biggest export market accounting for nearly one-third of Sri Lanka's global exports. In 2015, total bilateral trade reached euro 4.7 billion. In the same year, even without the GSP Plus, EU imports from Sri Lanka amounted to euro 2.6 billion and consisted mainly of textiles as well as rubber products and machinery. The trade potential with GSP Plus on board is much greater.
But our exporters cannot sit on their laurels even with the GSP Plus back in play. Being a Middle Income country, Sri Lanka mostly does not qualify for many loans and grants from foreign governments. Trade is the best alternative, as exemplified by the famous slogan trade, not aid. The Government has begun an urgent mission to intensify exports and trade. Free Trade Agreements are due to be signed with several countries including China. Developing the Colombo and Hambantota Port, as well as the proposed investment zone in Hambantota, will help propel exports which have benefitted by the depreciation of the rupee. Sri Lanka is well on its way to becoming a hub for the SAARC region, but we have to think beyond that.
Sri Lanka has to diversify its exports and reach new markets beyond North America and Western Europe. There are some regions which our exports do not reach at all. More promotional campaigns should be started to popularise Sri Lankas exports, especially tea and gem and jewellery. Increasing exports is also the answer to the countrys Balance of Payments concerns. GSP Plus is thus a timely shot in the arm for our export sector which must pursue a vigorous expansion in the coming years.

GSP Plus given back without conditions:Finance Minister
There are no conditions to comply with in order to receive European Unions GSP Plus concessions, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said so speaking at a media briefing yesterday at the Finance Ministry.
He said that Sri Lanka would be entitled for GSP Plus concessions within a period of one and a half months. There would be a 11 percent tax exemption for the products exported under GSP Plus concessions and therefore Sri Lanka would economically benefit by over US$ 1.4 Billion, the minister added. The Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka had lost the GSP Plus concession, due to the misconduct of the previous regime and the credit for regaining it should go to President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera. Minister Karunanayake also said, the Southern Development Project had been implemented, while the final agreement on the Hambantota Port Project would be signed before the end of January.
Lands for the 15,000 acre project in Hambantota would not be selected from any populated area, the Minister added.

It's Friday 13th
One in 20 of us is so superstitious they say they will not leave the house this Friday the 13th  to minimise the risk of bad luck. A survey found 80 percent of Brits consider they are superstitious, with many having rituals. The most common superstition is lucky socks, worn by 36 percent, followed by touching wood and lucky pants both at 35 percent. A lucky coin wards off bad luck for 23 percent and 22 percent told Mecca Bingo they keep fingers and toes crossed.
Claire Taylor, 31, of Hastings, East Sussex, called herself very superstitious and plans a duvet day following the last Friday 13, last May, when she crashed driving back from the shops then dropped a bag and two wine bottles smashed all over my kitchen floor.
Taken as a whole of the UKs 60 million adults, that means around 3 million people are not planning to venture outside this Friday.
Several of those quizzed in the poll for Mecca Bingo said they had even booked the day off work on holiday to avoid having to leave the security of their own home.
The top five lucky rituals and charms Brits rely on to ward off bad luck were voted as:
1 Wearing lucky socks - 36 percent
2 Touching wood - 35 percent
3 Wearing lucky pants - 35 percent
4 A lucky coin - 23 percent
5 Keeping fingers and toes crossed - 22 percent.
The fear of Friday 13th stretches back to the story of Easter, when Jesus and the disciples sat 13 to a table for the Last Supper. Since Victorian times, a belief in bad luck on this ominous date has grown and research published in 1993 by the British Medical Journal found that there is actually an increase in road accidents on Friday 13th.
The top 10 moments when Brits are at their most superstitious and use lucky rituals are;
1 When sitting a test/exam
2 When buying a scratchcard/placing a bet/playing bingo
3 During a key life moment e.g. purchasing house/proposing/getting married
4 When looking for a new job
5 When its Friday 13th or Halloween
6 When getting on a flight
7 When playing games or sport
8 When going for a health check at the doctor/dentist
9 When taking a driving test
10 When trying to land a promotion

It was the JVP more than the Joint Opposition that ignited Hambantota people's emotions, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the JVP misled the Southern people to gain political benefits. UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has said that the protestor wanted to get someone killed and bloodshed. The Joint Opposition should not do politics resorting to violence, he said.
Devapriya said the Local Government election can be held after May. He said the Local Government election will be gazetted after the handing over of the report of the delimitation committee. The Pradeshiya Sabha Act (22nd article) will be amended before the election, he said.
According to the report, the number of seats will be changed. The SLFP does not wish to postpone it further on any grounds, Chief Minister Devapriya said.
Chief Minister Devapriya said one of the major problems in Sri Lanka is unplanned development. President R. Premadasa could not complete his project of establishing 200 garment factories because there was no good road network, he said.
The Chief Minister said there should be industrial zones around harbours and airports. There are industrial zones around Katunayake and Ratmalana airports, he said.

Kamindu Mendis led the Lankan run chase with a sparkling century  109 off 118 balls with 15 fours and a one six.
The Sri Lankan lads won the toss and elected to bat first. Thisaru Rashmika was included after both coaches decided to have 12 players each for the match with one player bowling and the other batting. Boland Academy scored 284 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in their 50 overs. Thisaru secured four wickets for 64 runs while Manelker got two wickets.
Captain Avishka Fernando had to retire early as he was hit on the hand while fielding and was unfortunately hit again at the same spot while batting.
Manager of the team Mahinda Halangoda confirmed that Fernando did not sustain any serious injuries or fractures.
As a precaution we decided to get him to retire. But he should be fine within the next two days. We have three days of practice and the first tournament match starts on Sunday against South Africa followed by Zimbabwe the following day, he said.

Kate Middletons most stylish moments
Kate Middleton, Duchess Of Cambridge, has evolved from safe and conservative style to elegant and chic since she's been thrust into the spotlight. The Kate Middleton style evolution has been one transformation weve been glued to watching over the last decade, journeying from uni student to Duchess of Cambridge in one seemingly effortless move.
From the Sloaney-esque looks she was first spotted in as a student at St Andrews University, to the bespoke designer clothes horse shes become since marrying Prince William, Kate Middleton has rarely put a foot wrong when it comes to her sense of style.
She is able to effortlessly mix high end with high street easily and is often seen recycling old outfits to demonstrate her thrifty skills  in fact, you may not have noticed, but there is one accessory Kate Middleton wears with everything (OK, practically everything), and it totally works.
When it comes to Kate Middletons fashion brands, the Duchess seems to favour British talents including Alice Temperley, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham, while Kates high street purchases always fly off the shelves minutes after shes first photographed wearing them  who can forget the infamous Red LK Bennet Kate wore to Wimbledon that sold out within FOUR HOURS That is the power of Kate Middleton style.
Along with the surge in LK Bennet sales, Reiss, Zara and Whistles have all reported record sales since being championed by the Duchess, a phenomenon dubbed, The Kate Effect.
Most recently, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been on an epic royal tour, and Kates overseas wardrobe has been nothing short of perfection, with her chosen brands ranging from Thornton Bregazzi to Alexander McQueen. And most recently, Kate wore a stunning Catherine Walker powder blue peplum suit that was quite a departure from her go-to wardrobe of fitted jewel-coloured dresses.
With all this in mind, come and take a look through Kate Middletons seriously enviable style evolution. Oh to be a Royal

Lanka made vast strides towards a rights based democracy: Mangala
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that Sri Lanka has made considerable strides from soft authoritarianism towards consolidating a rights based democracy with deeply entrenched institutions and values. We are convinced and we recognise clearly that societies that avoid looking at the past, fail to build sustainable peace, the Foreign Affairs Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera was addressing the Royal Institute of International Affairs, London on The Reconciliation Process in Sri Lanka.
Professor in Conflict and Development Studies, SOAS university Jonathan Goodhand and Sri Lankas High Commissioner in London Amari Wijewardene were present
Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka has suffered conflict several times both in the South and the North.
There is hardly anyone in Sri Lanka who can calim to have not been affected by conflict, he said.
He said that traumatic memories do not simply vanish. We have learned through experience since independence that girievances that are left unaddressed,can go on for generations,becoming entrenched and holding the risk of descending into cycles of violence,he said.
Minister Samaraweera added that the country will never be able to achieve the full socio economic development potential,if country fails to address grievances, that risk plunging our nation into confoict once again.
This led us to co-sponsor of the Resolution that we worked on with members of the Human Rights Council in October 2015,he said.
The minister added that the set of actions that the Government has identified to deal with the past in a comprehensive manner, addressing the grievances of all victims, include truth seeking, justice reparation and masures for guaranteeing non recurrence.
A a first step, we hve enancted legislation to set up an Office on Missing Persons,he said.
Minister Samaraweera added that there is a clear consensus across the board on the need of an independent credible domestic mechanism as promised by the manifesto President Maithripala Sirisena.
As a democratic and sovereign governemnt, we will work out the architecture of such a mechanism in consulation with all the stake holders,he added.
As an important measure to prevent non recurrence of conflict, the Parliament last year unanimously adopted a Resolution for the Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution that would, among other provisions,he said.
He added that much of the preparatory work for the new constitution has now been completed. wide ranging public consultations were conducted for the first time in Sri Lankas constitutional history: much study, reflection and negotiation was undertaken to arrive at consensus at the six sub committees st up and final negotiations on a draft are currently underway.
The Presidents Party, the SLFP and the JVP have asked for time to present their respective final proposals. The Interim report therefore is expected to be tabled in the Constitutional Assembly in early February for debate, Minister Samaraweera added.

Lankan who killed husband, allowed  to stay in Australia
A woman who killed her abusive husband will be allowed to stay in Australia after the Department of Immigration reinstated her visa.
Sri Lankan-born doctor Chamari Liyanage is serving a four-year prison term after being convicted of the manslaughter of fellow doctor Dinendra Athukorala at their home in the West Australian town of Geraldton in June 2014. She was acquitted of the more serious charge of murder and has been eligible to apply for parole since June.
Her application for parole is due to be heard next month, but there were fears that if it was granted, she would be moved into immigration detention and possibly deported because her visa was cancelled while behind bars.
However, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection has revoked its decision to cancel the visa after considering her case. It means that if granted parole, the 37-year-old will be released back into the community. Her immigration lawyer Alisdair Putt said Liyanage cried when she learned she was able to stay.
"She's delighted by the news and very grateful to the Minister and the Department for considering her case," she said.
"She's thankful for all the support she's gotten from a considerable number of people in the community. "She was obviously very emotional but so relieved."
The decision comes after an appeal by prominent domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty last month. The court heard Athukorala kept 13 terabytes of encrypted child exploitation and bestiality images.

Law breakers go  scot free: Dallas
The arrest of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa amounts to political victimisation of the government's opponents. But those who break the law on behalf of the government go scot free, Parliamentarian Dalla Alahapperuma said.
He said as members of the Joint Opposition, they are against the reasons adduced by the FCID to arrest Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa.
Alahapperuma said in the eyes of the Joint Opposition, Weerawansa is a political prisoner. Alahapperuma said the government seemed to be bending the law to suit its own whims and fancies. Although Weerawansa and the State Engineering Corporation Deputy General Manager were taken into custody, the Deputy Minister and the Chairman had been left alone because they were on the government side.
He said as regards the Hambantota incident, he would challenge the government to screen the video footage recorded in the drone taken into custody by police so that the people could decide whether the government or the Joint Opposition version of the episode was true.
Alahapperuma expressed these sentiments at a press conference held by the Joint Opposition at the Borella Dr. N.M. Perera Memorial centre on Wednesday.

Literary Galle
If you cant drop everything and come to the fabulous Fairway Galle Literary Festival this weekend, put Sunday, April 16, in your diary for a book launch that will rock the island.
The enigmatic and mysterious writer and white tea producer Malinga Herman Gunaratne, hailing from the South, has been a huge fan of the festival since its inception by Festival Founder Geoffrey Dobbs in 2007. He has from his childhood been a lover of books, poetry and theatre and, like anyone with a passion for knowledge and intrigue, he will be attending the Islands most exciting festival today and over the weekend finishing on Sunday, January 15, 2017 with a grand finale of talks, conversations and an exciting authors lunch at the Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel. Herman himself is one of Galles most notorious homegrown authors and has just sent his latest book to print, Gods Secret Agent - A Battle Against Dark Forces. Juliet decided to ask him about his explosive new book and what he would be visiting during the five day Fairway Galle Literary festival, which includes talks, debates, and private affair dinners with leading authors in stunning villas and hotel settings, and an incredibly exciting contemporary Sri Lankan art exhibition curated by Janaka De Silva at The Galle Fort Gallery at 60 Lleyn Baan Street.
Action packed days
Herman loves attending as many literary events as possible, including he says with a sparkle in his eyes the odd wine tasting at The Sun House, to break up the action packed days. He found it hard to pick through this years even more incredible programme on the www.galleliteraryfestival.com web site. His top picks include in conversation on Friday at 11am with Sundaram on Bad News: Last journalists in a dictatorship in the wonderful Fairway Pavilion; at tea time, Thinking Out Loud with Afdhel Aziz on Good is the New Cool; A Walk Through Time and Style with leading architect Channa Daswatte on Saturday 14th January; the exciting conversation with ground breaking Indian author Amish Tripathi on the Shiva trilogy series in the Hall De Galle at 2.15pm; and ending the day with an exciting feast of food with festival authors and local celebrity chef Nihal Senanayake in the fabulous Jetwing Club restaurant, Jetwing Lighthouse hotel at 8.30pm. Followed by Mayhem Past Midnight at the Sun House, not forgetting he reminds me to sober up in time for an exciting Sunday morning of talks back at the Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel.
Herman, one can see from his choices of festival events, is interested in the new ground breaking narratives in writing, discussions and great literary works. Famous in Galle for his pure Virgin White Tea, and having run over 100,000 acres of the most prestigious plantations in Ceylon (as he prefers to call it), Herman has himself already authored four fascinating books: The Plantation Raj, For a Sovereign State, Tortured Island and the bestselling The Suicide Club, which are on sale at the Festival bookshop. The Suicide Club for those that have not read it is a riches to rags to riches story like no other and charts his progress from a grandson of a preeminent tea grower, who, owing to a government grab of half his estate followed by the rest being lost on the throw of a dice, starts out as a humble tea-plucker to work his way through the ranks to basically the top job in management of the top estate.
It is an inspirational story and should really be read prior to reading his explosive new book, being launched later this year, in order to get a flavour of the type and calibre of this man.
One true God
Truth as we all know is often stranger than fiction and so it is in this world where the devil dupes mankind over and over again into thinking he is god.
Herman sets out on a journey over the last year to produce a book on a subject no one really feels comfortable talking about, particularly in the west, as it is one of the last real taboos: curses.
This extraordinary book is the true story of a doubting Thomas in the world of Ceylon witchcraft or mumbo jumbo as Herman likes to call it. Only, the mumbo jumbo in this book is very real and is all about bottles, hair, deadly stethoscopes, inhuman screams, bloody goats heads appearing from graveyards, snakes conjured out of thin air, demonic possessions with smatterings of holy water, prayers leading to visions and plenty of digging that would leave even crime writer Agatha Christie shaken to her core.
 It is also the story of the power of two great religions, not in collision but working together to take on a whole host of demons that call themselves gods. This is not a new thing for the word demon is derived from the Greek for god and so ultimately it is about the one true God.
Hermans stories in Gods Secret Agent are not limited to the lower echelons of society, where most people think that witchcraft abounds still, simply in the imagination of the poorly educated and ignorant. No, these stories span the entire spectrum of the people of Sri Lanka from top to bottom of the island and go as far as how even a president was cursed during the civil war.
Great storyteller
It is a fascinating journey about a small band of people travelling through many dark places, both physically and spiritually. It is worth pointing out that Sri Lanka has some of the most highly educated people in the world, especially in the medical profession and even here we have a tale of a top surgeon employing witchcraft effectively against his rival.
But the main character of the story, besides notorious Galle tea planter Herman, is the humble exorcist, a man from one great religion casting devils out in the name of another. His story is truly astonishing and one that would be considered too farfetched if it had been made up.
Herman is a great storyteller with an even greater story to tell so do stop and talk to him about it if you see him at one of the many festival events. The question is why, do we think, has he left writing this book for his twilight years.
Is it because he was afraid of what might happen to him or was it to protect some of the characters in the book still living Maybe it is just that he didnt think anyone would believe him before, or maybe a combination of all three Herman wanted to call the book In the name of God and we agonised over whether to indeed give it that name, for God must have the last word and this debate continues. However, we are settled currently after interviewing hundreds of people about the subject on Gods Secret Agent although we were tempted to call it the God brothers as in some ways the book has Blues Brother energy to it.
The stories are not about conventional religious wisdom; rather they are about evil spirits and good spirits and the war between them with humans as purely the vehicles and supplicants for their motivation. The name is also perhaps more reflective of Sri Lankas current status with witchcraft, where the country on one level, seems to be the Devils playground, some say since being re-named Sri Lanka in 1974. But ultimately the book is about hope and faith and the power of GOD.
If any book lover at the festival is interested in coming along to Herman Gunaratnes latest launch in April, do email [emailprotected] for more information and an invitation. Fairway Galle Festival is from Wednesday January 11 to Sunday, January 15, 2017.

Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa has said officials should have decided whether his decision was right or wrong, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
It is true that I gave this order, but the officials should have known whether it was the right directive to follow,' Deputy Minister Ajith P.

The former minister was arrested by the FCID on Tuesday for misusing vehicles amounting to a loss of Rs. 90 million to the government. The deputy minister who read out the B report in the case at the weekly cabinet briefing on Wednesday said the misuse of vehicles was an example of the massive corruption and misuse of state resources indulged in by the previous regime.
The General Manager released the vehicle under the orders of the minister and now, he says this. According to the report, most of these vehicles were given to his relatives," he said.
Perera said the government had no desire to pursue personal agendas against anyone. All should be treated equally under the law, he said.

The real nature of politicians who shed crocodile tears on poverty and unemployment among youths came to light with the Hambantota incident that attempted to disrupt the development programme there, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The minister told at a meeting in Bibile that if politicians and people in Hambantota do not need the industrial zone, the people in Moneragala were ready to obtain it by offering 20,000 acres instead of the 15,000 acres.
"The Moneragala district is of the most underdeveloped areas from time immemorial," Bandara said. "None of the two parties which ruled the country after independence paid any attention to this area. We are ready obtain the projects on behalf of the youths and the future generations of the area".
He said massive development projects have been initiated to solve unemployment and economic draw backs.
"Some elements who are concerned of power are misleading the people against the government's projects," Minister Bandara said. "Due to this, only the people in Hambantota and Moneragala would be deprived of their opportunities".

Movement grows in India as details of mass sexual harassment emerge

A movement is building and a multi-city march in India is now being planned for later this month to raise awareness about violence against women in the country after reports of a spate of assaults on women in Bangalore on New Year's Eve.
The specifics of the New Year's Eve event are still being investigated, and it is unclear exactly how many women were assaulted, but at least four men have so far been arrested, and witnesses and various local news outlets said "several" women and young girls were subject to harassment  with some comparing it toan incident in Germany on New Year's Eve 2015, when dozens of women were targeted by roving packs of men.
"I was going home and there were two random guys walking down the street, and one grabbed me and I went into shock," Chaitali Wasnik, a freelance photographer in Bangalore who was covering celebrations, told NBC News.
"I started beating him and punching him, and about 10 to 15 men tried to hold me back, and the guy just ran away," Wasnik said.
Wasnik said it was the first time she's ever been assaulted and "I went in complete shock. I went completely blank," she said. Wasnik wrote a public Facebook post after returning home and shared her story of assault, but has since changed her privacy settings after receiving messages from people harassing her, she said.
Other victims also reported being surrounded by large groups of men who groped and assaulted them. TheBangalore Mirrorcalled New Year's incidents "a brazen, mass molestation of women."
Then, to add insult to injury, local officials' initial response blamed the victims.
G. Parameshwara, the home minister of Karnataka state, where Bangalore is located, blamed the purported assaults on the women's"western" clothing. These young people "try to copy westerners not only in mindset, but even the dressing." he said according to several news outlets.
"Partying late night in half attire, blindly following western culture, has never been our culture,"saidAbu Azmi, another local politician and party leader.
That led to more outrage online, both from regular Indians and celebrities.
"Senseless people comment on women's clothes,"tweetedAnushka Sharma, an Indian actress and model.
"The Bangalore incident makes me feel we are evolving backwards," Akshay Kumar, an Indian actor,tweeted. "Truly shameful."
"It's important for women to speak about these cases," activist Japleen Pasricha told NBC News.
Pasricha is the founder of the group "Feminism in India" and is helping plan the march on January 21.
The public outcry over these assaults turned into an online campaign using the hashtag#YesAllWomen which first spawned in the U.S. in 2014  to share their stories of assaults from the past and present.
Pasricha said she grew disheartened after seeing the hashtag #NotAllMen on Twitter in response to the Bangalore attacks because she felt that the attention should be placed on the women instead of on men who had nothing to do with it. She decided to resurface the hashtag #YesAllWomen that originally appeared in the U.S. to counter that viewpoint.
"I was 13 at a festival in my village," one woman Pooja Sridhar tweeted. "My mom, sister, grandma and I all had our butts pinched as we walked home."
The online movement, in turn, instigated the gathering in Bangalore which will coincide with theWomen's March on Washingtonthe day after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
So far, only four men have been arrested in connection to an incident that was captured by a surveillance camera and went viral. The Bangalore Mirror reported that Parameshwara has now decided to install 550 CCTV cameras throughout the city in response to the allegations.
In fact, Parameshwara, who had first invoked the victims sartorial choices, days later changed his tune to condemn the attacks, and said "Incidents like the one that happened on New Year must not bring bad name to Bangalore,"according tothe Bangalore Mirror.
Many noted that the official responses to rape and sexual assault in India has traditionally been appalling  ranging from ignoring the victims to blaming them.
Less than five years ago, India was rocked by a widely reported sexual assault story that took the country by storm. It involved a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi who was raped and beaten by a group of men on apublic bus in December 2012 and later died.
"The conversation around sexual assault changed after the New Delhi incident. Now, more people are talking about their experiences in more ways," said Satish Kolluri, an associate professor of communications studies at Pace University in New York City who studies South-Asian culture. "In one sense, it has done good. Police are forced to take action."
And it seems that more rapes are now being reported and recorded.
TheNational Crime Records Bureauin India shows that 34,651 rapes were reported in 2015  compared to 2012, that's a 39 percent increase.
"Given the population of over a billion people in India proportionally to that figure, you might not think that's a huge number. It's still a big concern for everybody," Kolluri said. "A lot of it has to do with reporting and policing."
"It's not about just identifying four people," Kolluri said. "It is also a social systemic problem. What happened to those who escaped"
The Bangalore investigation is still ongoing, and police believe many women have yet to come forward, according to the Bangalore Mirror.
"The victim doesn't report for various reasons like victim blaming," said Shruti Kapoor, founder of Sayfty, an organization that educates Indian women and girls about how they can counter violence. "That's one of the reasons why these perpetrators get away with what they do.'
For victims like Wasnik, there needs to be a change in perception.
"There are a lot of girls who don't come out and report this because usually they're afraid or scared from their family or from society," Wasnik said

Palace phantoms
A palace used by Sweden's royal family is haunted, according to Queen Silvia. But the queen says there is nothing to be afraid of as the phantoms at their private residence Drottningholm Palace are "pretty friendly".
Silvia told a TV documentary that "there are ghosts, many" and says, "you feel you get a little excited" when talking about them.
She added: "You sometimes feel that you're not completely alone. It's really exciting but you don't get scared."
The palace, originally built in the 16th century, is located near Stockholm and is the permanent residence of Queen Silvia and her husband King Carl XVI Gustaf.
The palace is listed on the UNESCO world heritage list and has been the royal family's residence since 1981.
Aged 73, Queen Silvia married King Carl 40 years ago after they met at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and is Sweden's longest-serving queen.
Just before Christmas she was taken to hospital after feeling dizzy but was discharged a few days later. The royal family's role is largely ceremonial but they are hugely popular with the public.

Police protection  for Dutch school after Sri Lankan boys suicide
The Heerlen Police in the Netherlands arranged extra protection for the Grotius College and its school grounds. The Colleges director, teachers and students received threats in response to the suicide of 15-year-old Sri Lankan student Tharukshan Selvam on Sunday. Tharukshan died during the early hours of Sunday morning. His family published his suicide note, in which he described how he was being bullied at school. He was also being harassed by anonymous social media accounts, believed to be the work of his class mates.
The Sri Lankan teens story provoked numerous threats and death treats addressed to the director of Grotius College, several teachers and students. The condolence register the school opened on Wednesday was flooded with responses from across the country. You should be deeply ashamed, students and school, Bullies of Tharukshan: you should be deeply
ashamed, How could this happen and This could have been avoided, were just some of the responses.
Frank Schings, director of school organization LVO Parkstad, under which Grotius College falls, announced that the circumstances of the boys suicide will be investigated. Later on Wednesday the school leaders announced in a press conference that they have asked the Inspectorates for both Education and Youth Care to investigate what happened, according to NU.nl. Heerlen Mayor Ralf Krewinkel will also investigate.
The Mayors investigation will also look into the role of youth care and other health institutions in what happened to Tharukshan.
It is known that both school and municipality had contact with the Selvam family. According to Schings at the press conference, a municipal expertise center first spoke to Tharukshan on December 5th due to the bullying. After that the 15-year-old boy spoke to aid workers on December 28th.
Minister Jet Bussemaker of Education responded to Tharukshans suicide on television program Jinek on Wednesday evening. She called the death of the Sri Lankan boy heartbreaking and called on everyone not to turn a blind eye to bullying. Do not look away from abuses. If you notice something in your surroundings, report it, discuss it, she said. And if you cant do so yourself, make sure that experts are involved.
Education State Secretary Sander Dekker also responded to the boys death.
Heartbreaking. There is no other word for the suicide of 15-year-old Tharukshan from Heerlen. he wrote on his Facebook page. According to Dekker, Tharukshans death is reminiscent of the deaths of 20-year-old Tim Ribberink and 15-year-old Fleur Bloemen, who both committed suicide in 2012 after continuing bullying.

With restoration of GSP+ Lanka can export any product to European market: PM
We will be able to export any product to the European market without any export levy or duty, with the European Unions decision to remove significant import duties on Sri Lankan products by restoring GSP + trade access to Europes export market, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
Last May, I went to Brussels with a delegation to initiate discussions with the European Union. The European Union has decided to remove significant import duties on Sri Lankan products and restore GSP + trade access to Europes export market.Now, not only garments, we can export any product to the European market without export levy or duty, the Prime Minister said.
The proceeding week is going to be a very productive one.I could start the week following the opening of two new factories in Kurunrgala. Subsequently, in Kalutara we initiated another a new industry and thereafter we launched work on the new industrial zone in Hambantota, the Prime Minister said. Next we plan to start another industrial estate at Charly Mount in Weligama Prime Minister further observed.
Premier Wickremesinghe was speaking at the ceremonial unveiling of the pinnacle of the newly erected Chetiya (Pagoda) at Sunandarama Vihara, Karapitiya in Galle.
The new pagoda was constructed with the financial contribution of environmentalist and United National Party Habaraduwa electorate Chief Organiser Chandrala Abeygunawardane.
After the regaining of the GSP + trade access, our country will be greatly benefited. In 1977, we marked a big leap in our trade and export market. We introduced the garment industry to the country. However, we could not continue with the programme with the country plagued by terrorism. Investors were afraid to invest in our country. However, garment factories in large numbers were established in every part of the country, the Prime Minister said.
During my tenor as Prime Minister in 2003 and 2004 and during the period of former President chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, we were able secure the GSP + concession, the Preier said.
GSP+ trade access is granted to countries where democratic rights, law and order,child and woman rights and environment are well preserved and protected.But,during the past regime, all such freedoms were lost. Politicians were alleged for Women abuse and they openly admitted such offences. Environment laws were flatly neglected. Law and order was brazenly exploited. Media freedom was badly affected. Hence, we lost the GSP concession. However, following the Presidential election victory of Maitripala Sirisena and subsequent Parliamentary election, we were able to gain all such rights and freedoms which lead for the retrieval of GSP+,Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
We were also able to get the European Fish Export ban in 2015. We ensure many lost democratic rights and freedoms after the establishment of the new government of Good Governance. We introduced a number of many new laws in respect of Child and Women rights and social welfare, the Premier said.
During the first two years of our government, we initiated talks with European countries. We could relax the severity of Geneva proposals against our country. President Maithripala Sirisena made many diplomatic tours in Europe. He met the German Chancellor, French President and British Prime Minister.I also met the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and visited Brussels.We had talks with a number of world leaders and dispel many misunderstandings about our country. Now, we have to work towards the progress of the country with a patriotic vision and attitude, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
By next April and May, we hope to create a new market in the country, the Premier said.
I urge all local entrepreneurs to invest in new ventures and display their patriotism. We need to create more job opportunities for our young generation. We will not be confined only to Hambantota in our industrialisation process.We will commence our new development in other regions of the country, he added.
We will introduce new vocational training strategies. While concentrating on industrialisation, we will also take steps to promote the tourism industry. The Southern Province is the best region with an airport and two sea ports for industrial promotion. We will unite and work for the economic, social and community development of the country shunning all differences in our political visions. I earnestly appeal to Ministers Vajira, Gayantha and Chandima to work collectively and cooperatively for the uplift of the region, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe reiterated.

The Royal Nizami Food Fest at Taj
A dish that's par excellence, loved by all food lovers across the world and has a rich historical past. One of the representative dishes of India that reminds of the culinary heritage of the regal era is back at Navratna, Taj Samudra.
Colombo's premier Biryani feast returns with seven national treasures perfected by Chef Bhumi Chauhan at Colombo's oldest Indian restaurant, one of the finest places to enjoy an authentic Royal Nizami experience, Navratna at the Taj Samudra from January 13-29.
Using nothing, but the best authentic ingredients from age-old recipes Chef Chauhan will prepare some delectable Biryani dishes, from the famous mutton morels infused with fragrant basmati rice to a classic from the heritage menu of Hyderabad.
The fragrant and scrumptious dish is prepared with a mixture of spices and condiments, rice (usually basmati), meat or vegetables and yoghurt. The dish finds its origins in the Mughal dynasty and derives its name from a Persian word beryan, which means fried or roasted.
Hyderabad, Malabar, Delhi, Agra, Dhaka, Kolkata, Lucknow and Karachi are the main centers of biryani. Biryani was traditionally prepared in earthenware pots and is known for its unique aroma, flavor and spices. Navratna arguably Colombo's finest Indian restaurant of the Taj Samudra presents tantalizing Biryani cuisine that challenges you to resist.
The Biryani promotion also includes the Jalpari Zafrani which is a combination of saffron flavored lagoon prawns and Anda Dum Biryani, a traditional Biryani dedicated to egg lovers. Vegetarians are sure to love the kathal Dum Biryani, a combination of baby jack fruit or the Dhingri which includes mushroom. Subz Zafrani is known for its fresh ground vegetables and Chhara Aloo Masala which has baby potatoes infused in Biryani masala in a Dum pot.
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian, mild or spicy, as a stand-alone dish or combined with a complementary curry, the appeal of an authentically prepared biryani is indisputable. All Biryani dishes include Mirchi ka Salan, Burani Raita and the Kachumbar Salad.
The Navaratna restaurant exudes the ambience of luxury with beautiful paintings. The unique aroma of various spices wafts through as soon as you enter while waiters dressed in traditional kurtha welcome you graciously. Often times, there is a live instrument music playing in the background and adds to the exclusivity of the experience.
The Hyderabadi Biryani and Haleem Fest is happening from January 13-29 at Navratna at the Taj Samudra offering guests a complete experience of Indian cuisine at it's finest.

SriLankan ensures high level  coordination to facilitate easy passage
SriLankan Airlines despite the closure of the runway during the daytime hours from 6th January to 6th April 2017, its services and operations at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake are proceeding seamlessly.
This is with minimal inconvenience for both inbound and outbound tourists. The current smooth synergy between the Civil Aviation Authority, Airport and Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka(AASL), SriLankan Airlines (the ground handler) and the Defence authorities has resulted in a business as usual approach, resulting in operations continuing smoothly despite the ongoing renovation of the runway.
As the key parties to ensuring uninterrupted services at the international airport, all partners have benefitted by cooperating fully with each other whilst ensuring strong team work and proactive attitude. Their combined foresight is helping the new arrangements to work smoothly.
This renovation is a massive undertaking and marks the first time a renovation like this has taken place, which has required significant adjustments for all stakeholders. However, the stipulation by the authorities for passengers to report to the airport 5 hours before the flight has helped significantly.
The CEO of SriLankan Airlines, Suren Ratwatte said, I commend the support, patience and understanding displayed by all stakeholders, as we do our best to ensure uninterrupted services.
I would especially like to thank all the airport employees for their untiring efforts to tide us over this challenging period by sustaining their commitment to enhanced customer care.
I am also grateful to all our passengers for arriving early at the Bandaranaike International Airport in order for us to facilitate their travel with minimum hassle and delays.
Passenger check-in counter have been opened 5 hours before the flights in order to carry out all procedures with ease, whilst encouraging online check-in as well.

Trade deficit narrows, tourism  earnings increase in September
Sri Lankas external sector performance has improved in September 2016 with a contraction in the trade deficit and continued growth in tourist earnings,the Central bank said.
The trade deficit in September narrowed as a result of the increase in export earnings together with a reduction in import expenditure. Although workers remittances recorded a marginal decline, earnings from tourism increased during the month in comparison to that of September 2015. Furthermore, foreign investments at the CSE and government securities market as well as the long term loan inflows to the government supported to strengthen the financial account during September 2016.
Earnings from exports recorded a year-on-year growth for the second consecutive month in September 2016. Accordingly, earnings from exports grew by 5.7 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 898 million in September 2016, compared to US dollars 850 million recorded in September 2015. All major categories of exports contributed positively to this growth. However, the highest contribution to the growth was from industrial exports led by transport equipment, food beverages and tobacco and rubber products, followed by agricultural exports, led by tea.
Earnings from transport equipment increased by more than fivefold to US dollars 31 million in September 2016 mainly due to export of a ship to Singapore while earnings from food, beverages and tobacco exports increased owing to higher performance in miscellaneous food preparations. Earnings from rubber product exports showed a growth of 15.3 per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to the growth in export of rubber tires, while all other subcategories under rubber products performed well. Earnings from tea exports increased by 8.0 per cent, year-on-year, in September 2016, reflecting both higher export volume and average export price. Highest amount of tea export earnings was from Iran which increased substantially by 41.0 per cent while Middle-East as a region which accounts for about 43 per cent of total tea exports earnings, showed a growth of 15.9 per cent, year-on-year, in September 2016. Further, export earnings of sea food increased, both in value and volume terms, in September 2016 while earnings from sea food export to the EU, which accounts for about 28.7 per cent of total sea food exports, grew over 200.0 per cent, year-on-year, for the second consecutive month showing improved demand from EU after the removal of the fish export ban imposed to Sri Lanka by the EU.
In contrast, earnings from textiles and garments exports, which account for around 43 per cent of total export earnings, contracted for the second consecutive month by 7.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 382 million, due to a temporary slowdown in global demand for garment exports from the traditional markets, such as the USA and EU, in September 2016.
On a cumulative basis, export earnings during the first nine months of 2016 contracted by 3.0 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 7,763 million, mainly due to the decline in export earnings from transport equipment and petroleum products. In addition, agricultural exports, such as tea and spices, contributed considerably for the contraction in exports during this period.
However, earnings from textile and garments exports increased by 2.4 per cent during the first nine months of 2016 reflecting higher exports to both traditional and non-traditional markets. The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first nine months of 2016 were the USA, UK, India, Germany and Italy, accounting for about 52 per cent of the total exports.
Expenditure on imports declined by 2.5 per cent to US dollars 1,543 million in September 2016 compared to the same month in 2015. Lower expenditure incurred on importation of personal motor vehicles and fuel contributed largely to this decline.
Expenditure on personal motor vehicle imports decreased significantly by 51.9 per cent, year-on-year, in September 2016, as a result of the lower importation of personal motor cars and hybrid electric motor vehicles.
Meanwhile, expenditure on fuel imports declined substantially by 22.1 per cent to US dollars 176 million in September 2016, compared to US dollars 226 million in September 2015 reflecting declines in export volumes and average import prices of crude oil, and refined petroleum products. The average import price of crude oil in September 2016 declined to US dollars 46.99 per barrel compared to US dollars 48.65 per barrel recorded in September 2015.
In addition, import expenditure on wheat and maize decreased significantly by 48.7 per cent in September 2016, due to lower import volumes and average import prices. Further, the lower import expenditure registered on fertiliser, mineral products and building materials contributed largely to the decline in the overall import expenditure during the month. However, import expenditure on textiles and textile articles increased considerably in September 2016 mainly due to higher imports of fabric and yarn.
In September 2016, import expenditure on diamonds and precious stones and metals increased substantially owing to the higher gold imports during the month together with the comparatively lower importation of gold during the corresponding month of the previous year. Meanwhile, import expenditure on machinery and equipment, sugar and confectionery, base metals and transport equipment increased by 16.7 per cent, 186.2 per cent, 61.6 per cent and 17.4 per cent, respectively on a year-on-year basis in September 2016.
On a cumulative basis, expenditure on imports during the period January to September 2016 decreased by 1.7 per cent to US dollars 13,946 million, mainly due to the declines recorded in the importation of vehicles for personal use and business purposes, fuel and rice. China, India, Singapore, Japan and UAE were the main import origins during the first nine months of 2016, accounting for about 57 per cent of total imports.
The deficit in the trade balance decreased to US dollars 645 million by 12.0 per cent, year-on-year, in September 2016 compared to US dollars 733 million in September 2015 due to the combined effect of an increase in exports and a decline in imports. However, the cumulative trade deficit during the first nine months of 2016 remained almost unchanged at US dollars 6,183 million in comparison to US dollars 6,182 million recorded during the same period of 2015. The tourist arrivals for September 2016 amounted to 148,499 tourists which recorded a marginal growth of 3.6 per cent year-on-year.
As a result, cumulative tourist arrivals during the first nine months of 2016 increased by 14.6 per cent to 1,508,405 compared to 1,315,839 during the corresponding period of 2015.
Receipts from workers remittances declined marginally by 1.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 577.9 million during September 2016 compared to US dollars 584.2 million in September 2015.
However, cumulative inflows from workers remittances at US dollars 5,382.0 million during the first nine months of 2016 recorded a growth of 3.9 per cent in comparison to US dollars 5,182.2 million in the corresponding period of 2015.
Foreign investments at the CSE recorded a net inflow of US dollars 5.1 million in September 2016. However, the cumulative foreign investments in the CSE during the first nine months of 2016 recorded a net outflow of US dollars 19.02 million which included net outflows of US dollars 20.44 million from the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 1.42 million to the primary market.
Furthermore, foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a net inflow of US dollars 82.2 million during September 2016 while on a cumulative basis, foreign investments in the government securities market was a net inflow of US dollars 48.0 million during the first nine months of the year in comparison to a net outflow of US dollars 920.2 million during the corresponding period of 2015.
During the first nine months of 2016, long term loans to the government recorded a net inflow of US dollars 866.0 million, in comparison to a net inflow of US dollars 177.6 million during the first nine months of 2015.
International reserves and exchange rate movements
Sri Lankas gross official reserves as at end September 2016 amounted to US dollars 6.5 billion, equivalent to 4.1 months of imports, while total foreign assets stood at US dollars 9.1 billion, equivalent to 5.8 months of imports.
The rupee recorded a depreciation of 0.1 per cent against the US dollar during the period from end 2016 to 10th January 2017.
Reflecting cross currency movements, the rupee also depreciated against the Japanese yen by 0.6 per cent, the Canadian dollar by 2.0 per cent, the Australian dollar by 1.7 per cent and the euro by 0.6 per cent during this period while appreciating against the pound sterling by 0.9 per cent and the Indian rupee by 0.2 per cent.

Two of the most electrifying events at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival this year are Luke Wrights What I Learned from Johnny Bevan and Alison Wearings Confessions of a Fairys Daughter. Both shows represent a rare opportunity for Sri Lankan audiences to see truly world class theatre at a very reasonable prices, without having to go abroad to do so at exorbitant rates. Wrights marvelous solo show had a sellout 3 week run in Londons West End. In it he delivers a multi award winning hurricane of a performance filled with humour and humanity that tells the story of a friendship between two men against the background of British politics.
Wearings play Confessions of a Fairys Daughter is based on her own life and brings to life the story of how she came to understand her father was gay and how she struggled to come to terms with this momentous discovery. This show that won numerous awards, including the CBCs Outstanding Solo Show award and Best Dramatic Script at NYCs United Solo, the largest festival of solo theatre in the world- is no polemic on LGBTQ issues. Rather, it is a comically touching coming- of -age story, and is visually and theatrically stunning because it weaves music and imagery into the story. Alison has done more than 100 performances of the show since its premiere in 2011 and she continues to tour the show to theatres and festivals across North America and around the world.

Vehicle misusing: Wimal passes the buck to officials
Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa has said officials should have decided whether his decision was right or wrong, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
It is true that I gave this order, but the officials should have known whether it was the right directive to follow,' Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said as he revealed the admission made by Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities former Minister Wimal Weerawansa to the police on the case of misusing 40 vehicles. The former minister was arrested by the FCID on Tuesday for misusing vehicle amounting to a loss of Rs. 90 million to the government. The deputy minister who read out the B report in the case at the weekly cabinet briefing on Wednesday said the misuse of vehicles was an example of the massive corruption and misuse of state resources indulged in by the previous regime.
The General Manager released the vehicle under the orders of the minister and now, he says this. According to the report, most of these vehicles were given to his relatives," he said.
Perera said the government had no desire to pursue personal agendas against anyone. All should be treated equally under the law, he said.

Will going vegetarian lower your cholesterol
My GP told me my cholesterol has risen from 5.1 to 5.8 mmol/litre.
I wondered about becoming a vegetarian, but the doctor said I should continue with my diet of fish, fruit and vegetables.
What surprises and concerns me is that the cholesterol limit used to be 5, but the GP said it is now 6. What has changed
- Richard Eddington, Newbury, Berks.
Some people find their cholesterol levels plummet when they adopt a vegetarian diet, others are unable to lower it this way
As far as I am aware, there has been no recent official change to what is considered to be a safe level of cholesterol, though it has reduced over the years.
When I began practising, it was 7.25 mmol/litre, and now GPs generally accept that healthy adults should have cholesterol levels of 5 mmol/litre or less.
But this is a red herring for patients such as you where the aim is to reduce the chance of developing coronary heart disease and stroke.
This is primary prevention; secondary prevention refers to treatment given after a heart attack or stroke to stop the problem getting worse or recurring.
Helpfully, your letter draws attention to an important shift in thinking about primary prevention.
For years, the focus of primary prevention has been a patient's exact cholesterol levels, but under recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the focus has switched to the patient's risk of coronary heart disease within the next ten years.
This takes cholesterol into account, but not exclusively.
The ten-year risk is assessed by a tool called QRISK2.
This makes a calculation based on a number of factors, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, family history of heart disease and whether you have diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease, as well as blood cholesterol level.
GPs generally accept that healthy adults should have cholesterol levels of 5 mmol/litre or less
When the risk is above 10 per cent, the guidelines recommend treatment with a statin  even if your cholesterol levels are not greatly raised.
Your score can be lowered if care is taken to reduce your cholesterol as much as possible with diet.

To contact Dr Scurr with a health query, write to him at Good Health Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email [emailprotected] - including contact details.
Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence. His replies cannot apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context. Always consult your own GP with any health worries.
Some people find their cholesterol levels plummet when they adopt a vegetarian diet, others are unable to lower it this way  there must be genetic reasons for this difference.
Keeping your weight down so your BMI is below 30 (preferably close to 25) and regular exercise can also help.
What matters most is a low QRISK2 score so that your chance of developing coronary heart disease (the cause of death of 11 per cent of the population) is as low as possible.
My advice is to ask your doctor to calculate your QRISK2 score  your decisions can be based on that.
I developed temporomandibular joint disorder a year ago  my jaw becomes stiff and very painful and on a bad day it affects the whole side of my face, ear and down my neck.
The trigger is eating, so I can consume only soft food or food that's cut up small.
My dentist gave me a mouthguard, but it hasn't helped, nor has physio.
I've been referred to hospital, but there's a long waiting list.

You may be more honest if you swear often
Good news if youre a potty mouth.Your penchant for profanity not only means you might have a bigger vocabulary or are more intelligent than your clean-tongued friends. You may also be more honest.People who swear a lot lie less often and have higher levels of integrity, according to a new study published by researchers from Maastricht University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Stanford and the University of Cambridge.
The researchers set up three different studies exploring the relationship between profanity and honesty. First, they asked 276 people about how often they use curse words and why they say them. Participants then answered a lie scale, a series of questions that ask redundant questions to evaluate truthfulness. Next, researchers scanned 73,789 Facebook profiles based on profanity use and honest status updates. Finally, the study team used previous data to evaluate the profanity use and integrity levels in each U.S. state.In all cases, they found positive relationships between profanity use and honesty levels.
Profanity is often used to express ones unfiltered feelings (e.g. anger, frustration) and sincerity, researchers wrote. In such situations, people use curse words to truthfully portray how they feel.
Previous studies have shown that people who curse often do so because they prefer to express themselves using those words. Another study even showed that under certain circumstances, cursing can even make people feel better. So like all good things in life, just remember - moderation is key.
