Hope for betterment by Markar launched
A book comprising articles written by the former minister and the current chairman of the National Media Center Imthiaz Bakeer Markar titled 'Naduwadu Nalam (Hope for betterment) - experiences of a politician,' was launched on Thursday at the National Library and Documentation Services Center.
Addressing the gathering Markar said, we should explore similarities between religions and live together as one nation and refrain from looking for differences.
"We can make this country an example to the rest of the world by living together in peace and harmony, irrespective of religious differences.
There are many similarities between religions. We should start accepting the similarities and stop searching for differences. Similarities are high compared to differences, he said.
Markar added that the name of the book was his election motto when he contested for the first time in the District Development Council in 1981.
Since then, I made Hope for betterment as the theme of my election campaign. I believed in it and tried my best to implement it during my term as a politician, he said.
He said one should enter politics with the aim of serving the people.
The event was chaired by the director of the Jamia Naleemiah Educational Institute Dr. M. A. M. Shukri, President Counsel M. A. M. Zuhair, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum N. M. Ameen and the Vidivelli Newspaper Editor M. B. M. Fairooz.

Need to improve higher education links with India
The Centre for Contemporary Indian Studies, University of Colombo, Visiting Professor Prof. Mohamed Gulrez yesterday spoke of the need to further higher education ties between Sri Lanka and India to promote bilateral ties between the two countries.
Presenting, his monograph titled Prospects of Cooperation in Higher Education and Capacity Building: A Case Study of India and Sri Lanka, to the Vice Chancellor of the Colombo University, Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake at College House, he said it was an attempt to use Sri Lankas Vision for 2030; of becoming an IT and Education Hub, to facilitate closer ties between India and Sri Lanka.
His research thus saw how a feasibility study could be conducted on how higher education can be improved between India and Sri Lanka, said Prof. Gulrez.
According to the Professor, India which had a foreign student population of 50,000, only had 1,200 Sri Lanka students studying there. However, given that out of the 220,000 students passing their A/Ls, only 23,000 qualify for state Universities, Prof. Gulrez noted that there was immense potential for those left behind to study in India. Prof. Dissanayake, meanwhile, said he was interested in internationalizing the Colombo University further. We can no longer work in isolation in a globalized world, he said.
The Vice Chancellor spoke of the need to improve on two areas of the university; its research profile, and patenting and licensing of research.
He said he planned to appoint a Technology Transfer Officer at the University to help improve the patenting and licensing of products.
In this endeavour, Prof. Dissanayake also touched on the possibilities of further enhancing the exchange of knowledge and staff between Indian universities and the University of Colombo.

Beeralu lace industry in doldrums
The southern region has been in the forefront of the beeralu industry in Sri Lanka since the Portuguese era. The traditional industry now faces many difficulties since it does not receive State support.
Many house wives engage in the industry complain that they do not get support of the relevant authorities to prosper their livelihood. Lack of tourist arrivals and the tsunami disaster hit the industry very bad. The rising cost of thread put it in reverse and what they produce have no proper market now, they said.
They said Sri Lankan beeralu lace has a good market in Belgium and other countries, but lack of state or private sector support make it impossible to grasp the foreign market.

Common enemy of SLFP is UNP: State Minister Perera
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said the common enemy of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is none other than the United National Party (UNP).
He added that G. L. Peiris Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has destroyed the unity of the SLFP.
The State Minister was addressing the SLFP election candidates and party activists in Badulla, recently.
The event is the foundation for forming an SLFP government by 2020. To reach the target, it is needed to get the political power in the village while strengthening communal and religious harmony, he said.
He added that the SLFP will face elections with confidence. It is needed to create strong election committees to face elections satisfactorily. The SLFP received a huge demand for nominations. Therefore, certain active supporters may not have received nominations.
He added that the SLFP nomination lists related to the Badulla district represent every segment of society including farmers, state servants, workers etc. Besides, they represent communities, religions etc too.
According to him, the most balanced nomination list of the Badulla district was handed over to the Hali Ela Electorate.
He said he will decide who should be selected from the list to the Hali Ela Pradeshiya Sabha after winning the zone. The position of the list doesnt matter. The persons who work for the victory will be selected to the council from the list. They will be considered from the wining zones. The wining of the zone is essential, he added. He said the SLFP is contesting with Thondamans party.
State Minister Perera added that he is confident of winning this election as he could form a strong mechanism to win.
When considering the behaviour of persons, who are trying to split the SLFP, I am confident of winning the Hali Ela electorate. I tried my best to settle the in-party dispute peacefully, he said.

Conference on Role of Youth in Reconciliation
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka, operating under the Ministry of Defence, together with the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, held a one-day joint conference on the Role of Youth in Reconciliation.
The conference was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on December 12 with over 100 participants representing the Sri Lankan youth.
The inauguration ceremony was graced by National Integration and Reconciliation Minister A.H.M. Fowzie.
Delivering the keynote address, Minister Fowzie underlined how sustainable peace would not be a reality unless there is unity amongst people of all races and religions.
Director General of INSSSL Asanga Abeyagoonasekare noted that the conflict experienced by the youth in the country was a burden that was passed down to generations. Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, highlighted the contribution the Ministry has been making in terms of reconciliation mechanisms operating in educational and media spheres. The Secretary of Defence Kapila Waidyaratne PC further stressed this point by underlining how the youth of today will be the decision makers of Sri Lanka in the future, hence making it crucial to embed the ideas of peace and coexistence in their mindset so that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated. The Secretary of Defence also commended the INSSSL and the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation for implementing such a thematic workshop.
As a pioneering initiative, speakers of the conference comprised a cross-section of youth activists involved in reconciliation initiatives from both the North and the South who shared the platform with members of the civil society and leading academics who are involved in peace and reconciliation studies. The conference was conducted in all three languages to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing amongst participants.
The highlight of the session was the presentation made by Sivakumaran Vinesh who is a beneficiary of Sri Lankas successful rehabilitation programme. Being a rehabilitated former member of the LTTE, he spoke of the experiences faced by rehabilitated former combatants whilst a considerable number of beneficiaries were also present in the audience. Vinesh emphasised the success he has had after being reintegrated into the society as a rehabilitated beneficiary. He also highlighted the hardships and challenges his peers and himself face.
Certificates were distributed to moderators and speakers by Prof. Chandra Embuldeniya, member of the Advisory Council of INSSSL. A report on the outcomes of the conference will be presented to the President.
Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Kapila Waidyaratne PC was the Guest of Honour. Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V.

Court rejects former Litro Gas Chairmans request to go overseas
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday rejected a request made by Litro Gas former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe, to travel Canada for medical purpose.
The CID had filed a B report in the Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court regarding four suspects including Litro Gas former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal account in Sri Lanka.
While turning down the request made by Shalil Munasinghe, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the suspect's request cannot be considered at this juncture.
On October 6, the CID had arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account. The second suspect Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested on October 9, on the charge of misappropriating Rs.30 million. He is currently out on bail.
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.

## Title: Desolate, dispiriting, irredeemable day for English cricket
## Supertitle:

Desolate, dispiriting, irredeemable day for English cricket
On the grass bank at the western end of the Waca, the Barmy Army had organised an enormous conga line. Stuart Broad, fielding at mid-off, was watching with interest. Perhaps he was simply trying to avoid looking at the scoreboard. Australia were 549-4. Mitchell Marsh, 181 not out. It had been 466 balls since England's last wicket. On a desolate, dispiriting, irredeemable day for English cricket, neither numbers nor interpretative dance could offer the slightest solace.
This was, in theory, the middle day of the series: day three of Test three. In fact, it was probably the day the series died. The day it finally lost its last vestiges of mystery or sporting intrigue. England may yet bat out the four or five sessions they need for a draw (and the weather, with showers forecast tomorrow afternoon and Monday morning, may help them). But it wouldn't shift the fundamentals of the series, and in any case you would strongly bet against it.
For this was the day when we learned for certain what should probably have been apparent all along: that England simply lack the ability to take the 20 Australian wickets they will need to win a Test. They couldn't do it in English-style conditions in Adelaide, and they couldn't get close here. Instead, as Shaun Marsh and the wonderful Steven Smith and Mitchell Marsh batted and batted, as England toiled 90 overs in the heat for just a single wicket, their strength and resolve gradually deserted them. England were not so much deep fried as slow roasted: one of those long, thankless, exhausting days that shortens careers.
Smith progressed imperturbably to his 22nd Test century in the morning and his second double-century in the evening, ending on a career-best 229 not out. The much-maligned Mitchell Marsh, returning to the side on his home ground, could scarcely have dreamed that his maiden Test century would have come as bloodlessly as this. On what was admittedly a beautiful batting wicket, England gave them room, gave them time, gave them space, gave them friendly fields and bowling at a comfortable pace.
After all, when your most threatening bowler by far is Craig Overton, a one-Test rookie playing through a cracked rib, then something has gone wrong somewhere. England's five-man attack, a group with 1097 Test wickets between them, were reduced to the role of net bowlers, gentleman fluffers, Christmas panto stooges. Did you spread the field in a failed attempt to constrain scoring options Oh yes you did! Did you maintain pressure by bowling a consistent line and length Oh no you didn't! Where are the Ashes They're behind you!
If Joe Root came into the day with plans, it is hard to envisage any of them involving the gentle leg-spin of Dawid Malan. But at the end of a record-shattering day for Australia, this is where we were. Malan  who Smith mischievously described as the pick of England's bowlers  trotting in. Fielders diving over the ball. Bowlers struggling to get to the crease. Fans who had long since disengaged from the cricket itself and disappeared towards the bar or the conga line. A team not so much bereft of answers as finally grasping the only one that mattered: that there is only one team good enough to win this series.
Perhaps England telegraphed their intentions before a ball had been bowled. As James Anderson ran into Smith with a still-new ball, just one slip was in place. And Root's field placements were curious all day  appropriate for a sluggish Brisbane pitch where batsmen were struggling to time the ball, but quixotic in the extreme when the ball was smacking into the middle of the bat and racing away across a quick outfield.
There was very little attempt, for example, to bowl purely on one side of the wicket and dry up runs: the conventional method of containment. Instead we frequently had Broad bowling on a good length outside off-stump with no fielder in front of square on the off-side. Anderson going around the wicket with the old ball to Smith with a leg slip, and getting cut through third man. Australia were able not simply to score, but to score quickly. That bought time may yet be crucial in forcing a win.
We should touch on the day's only wicket: Shaun Marsh, who edged Moeen Ali to slip in the first hour and must have spent the rest of the day absolutely fuming. At least the stirring performance of his younger brother will have cheered him. Mitchell Marsh was magnificent from the off, driving straight with immense power and looking  both literally and figuratively  right at home.
As for Smith, where do you start It was a masterclass in adaptation by the world's No 1-ranked batsman: the polar opposite of his innings at Brisbane, where he almost entirely cut out the cover drive on a sticky pitch and accumulated off the back foot. Here he trusted the bounce and drove brilliantly, manoeuvred the ball into gaps for twos, glanced and late cut powerfully. A world-class attack in helpful conditions can trouble him. England had neither.
Once or twice he looked discomforted, and even then we are stretching things. There were a couple of edges that dribbled harmlessly into the off-side. A couple of LBW reviews that Root only agreed to grant when he realised that he had nothing better up his sleeve. The second of these was turned down because Anderson had overstepped the line for a no-ball. If England didn't already know what sort of day it was going to be, that was surely the clincher.
Whether all this was the lack of a plan or the poor execution of a plan is really a moot point. Test cricket is like tug-of-war: you can't both be doing well at once. Short of magically finding a 91mph delivery or getting at the Kookaburra ball with nail-scissors, what  realistically  could Root have done differently
What can you do about the fact that England's cricketers are drawn from a tiny demographic segment What can you do about the fact that their most talented players  Jos Buttler, Eoin Morgan, Alex Hales, Tymal Mills  play different formats of the game What can you do about a climate that produces juicy green seamers What can you do when your star all-rounder gets himself into a ruck outside a nightclub
The big decisions were made long ago. Everything else is nibbling at the edges. A few commentators wondered aloud why England hadn't tried to sledge Smith, disturb him, put him off his stroke. It was the idle speculation that you get when there is barely anything left to speculate about. The talking is over, and the Ashes soon will be.

Election law violations:
DIGs asked to show cause
Senior DIG (Administration and Elections) C.D. Wickramaratne has asked the relevant DIGs to show cause as to why the law was not implemented in relation to seven political processions that were held against the law on Thursday, said Police Media Spokesman, SP Ruwan Gunasekara said yesterday.
He added that the Senior DIG took this measure following media revelations about such processions.
Gunasekara said that the Police have also been instructed to take action against those people responsible for organising such processions.
The Police Media Spokesman was speaking at the Election Commission premises following the second discussion between the Police and the Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya.
SP Gunasekara said Rs.30 million has been allocated for the Police to employ labourers and for the welfare of Police personnel until December 31 of this year in relation to Local Government election activities.
He added the allocations from January 1 up to the election date would be approved in due course.
SP Gunasekara further said the Police decided, following yesterdays dicussions to establish a separate Hotline at the Child and Womens Bureau to hear the concerns and complaints of the female contestants at the Local Government election.
He added that a Hot Line number would be published within a few days.
He also said the main cause for election violence is that the contestants or their supporters canvassing from door to door. There was no proper provisions in the Ordinance regarding this.
During such a situation, the Election Commission can take a decision on it, if the Police requested for the Chairmans instructions, the Police Spokesman said.
The Election Commission Chairman following discussions with Party Leaders and the members of the Election Commission, would decide the number of supporters that could go on door to door campaigning, he added.
According to the Local Government Election Law, cases can be filed regarding most issues with the approval of the Attorney General. Therefore, during discussions, the Election Commission Chairman agreed to request the Attorney General to appoint a Counsel to attend to these matters to expedite hearings.
He added that the Police expressed support for the conducting of a free and fair election.
SP Gunasekara said that the Media was not a subject of discussion. However, there were provisions in the law in relation to the media which would be implemented accordingly.
The Police Spokesman added that processions were held in violation of the ban. Police had initiated investigations into them. The Senior DIG (Elections) had inquired in to the activities of the respective Police officers who had failed to commence investigations in relation to the seven such processions.
DIG Ravi Peiris (Election Commission Coordinator) and several other senior offices and officers of the Election Commission led by the Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya participated in the discussion.

England won't roll over in 'dead' Tests - Malan
Melbourne: In-form batsman Dawid Malan says the Ashes may be gone but England must remain aggressive in the final two Tests against Australia.
Australia reclaimed the Ashes urn with an emphatic innings victory in the Perth Test earlier this week, condemning the remaining Melbourne and Sydney Tests to dead rubbers in the five-Test series.
But Malan, who is the best performing of the tourists' batsmen with 302 runs at an average of 50.33, said despite the series being lost, pride was at stake.
"I believe we need to be as aggressive with these guys as they are with us," he told reporters ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne, starting on Boxing Day.
"If you ever take your foot off the gas with these blokes, they seem to really dominate.
"I think batting, bowling or fielding we have to be aggressive. One little mistake out here, and these guys seem to pounce on it," added Malan.
"You have to be mentally strong. It is a tough place, but it is as tough as you make it."
The Middlesex left-hander, who scored his maiden Test century with 140 in Perth, said England had their moments during the series, but have not sustained them.
"You can look back at all three Test matches and say we were in the driving seat for two or maybe three days," he said.
"It's just those crucial moments -- one session a game we've lost and just fallen away.
"It is disappointing we've got nothing to play for in terms of the Ashes but the pride of our players will want to make this 3-2 and we want to show we can perform out here."
He added that England remained united on what has been a miserable tour.
"No one is feeling sorry for themselves, blaming people or anything like that," he said.
"We hold our hands up and we need to improve. None of us are the finished article. Its not through lack of trying." AFP

Enjoining Orders against Home Lands Skyline
The Colombo District Court has issued two separate enjoining orders against Home Lands Skyline and agents or anyone from continuing with piling activities at Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nahimi Mawatha, (formerly known as Thimbirigasyaya Road) Colombo 5, in a manner that causes damages or a nuisance to the adjoining residents.
Two of the adjoining residents, instituted separate actions before the District Court of Colombo on November 20, 2017, stating that the piling activities for the construction of a luxury apartment complex Aurum Residencies by Home Lands Skyline at 185, Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nahimi Mawatha, Colombo 5, is most likely to cause serious damages to their residences and thereby hardship to the use and enjoyment of the said neighbouring lands.
The Plaintiffs alleged that the permit issued by the Urban Development Authority for the construction of a 13 storied building is contrary to the law and only a nine storied building could be legally permitted to be constructed.
They alleged that in any event, the minimum side space requirement has also been violated by the developer and instead of leaving four meter set back from the common boundary with the Plaintiffs, the Developer is attempting to build on the boundary itself. The Plaintiffs have also stated that they have challenged the validity of the Development permit issued by the UDA in a separate Writ Application before the Court of Appeal.
The Plaintiffs have stated that irrespective of the validity of the Development Permit, the Development Permit does not grant the Developer any permission to interfere with the rights of adjoining land owners or to cause a nuisance to them.
The Plaintiffs have also stated in their Plaint that the Developer is well aware of the risk and danger posed by the piling activities and have even obtained insurance covers to protect against third party claims, and therefore, the Plaintiff reasonably fear that their houses would be damaged in the process. The Plaintiffs have stated that the Plaintiffs are seeking the said Enjoining Orders to prevent such damages being occasioned to the Plaintiffs.
Attorney - at- Law Thishya Weragoda with Iresh Seneviratne under the instructions of Thamila Perera appeared for the plaintiffs in both cases.

Former Navy Spokesman further remanded
Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others yesterday ordered to be further remanded till January 2, by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
They were arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
The Court had earlier refused bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail.Except for the former Navy spokesman, the other suspects were produced before court by prison officials.
At a previous occasion, the court had issued an order directing the Welikada Prison Superintendent that former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake be transferred to the Prison Hospital from the Welikada Navy Hospital.
The Magistrate made this order taking into consideration a request made by both prosecution and aggrieved party of the case alleging that seventh suspect Dassanayake was enjoying special privileges at the Welisara Navy Hospital contrary to normal prison procedure.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident.
On a previous occasion, the CID informed Court that the 11 persons who were abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2008, had been taken to underground detention cells at a navy camp in Trincomalee which were supervised by a Navy Lieutenant Commander.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara with OIC of CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.

## Title: Gary Pratt runs out Ricky Ponting, 2005
## Supertitle:

Gary Pratt runs out Ricky Ponting, 2005
We should probably get one thing clear from the off  it was a ludicrous single. A bonkers, boneheaded, crackpot single, wearing stripey tights, a rainbow wig and driving a tiny car from which the wheels were about to fall off. Ricky Ponting should have sent Damien Martyn back then sent for the team doctor to check his batting partner for sunstroke. Instead, the Australia captain, who had been fighting desperately to keep his side in the match, staggered for the line as Gary Pratt swooped, shied and set all hell loose at Trent Bridge.
England rejoiced, Pratt was hoisted aloft by Andrew Flintoff, a tousle-haired Sophie being lifted by Englands BFG, those in the terraces went bananas  and so did the Australia captain. Aleem Dar bore the brunt of the first blinding wave, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles were next in the fallout zone, then, as he trudged up the pavilion steps, the sight of a smiling Duncan Fletcher on the England balcony proved the final straw and Ponting disappeared under a mushroom cloud of his own invective.
The meltdown became symbolic of a side, one which had won 30 of their previous 38 series stretching back to 1994 and had not lost an Ashes series since 1987, who knew the tide had turned. Here was the Australia captain not raging against the dying of the light (the events of the following Ashes series rather put paid to that theory) but sensing the Australian grip on the urn loosen for the first time in 16 years.
The match, and the series, was still on a knife-edge. England, though jubilant, were a long way from victory but they had the key wicket, the one that was prized above all others. It is worth remembering just how crucial the wicket of the Australia captain had become by the fourth Ashes Test of 2005. After Edgbaston and Old Trafford the top of the formerly formidable Australian batting order felt fallible, breakable, fundamentally bowl-outable, particularly given the arsenal at Michael Vaughans disposal.
All except Ponting. His near-seven hour second innings vigil in Manchester, one that began on the eighth ball of the final day and ended just 25 balls from the close, was a knock carved out of granite. The atmosphere in the ground was feverish, borderline rabid, and England bombarded the Australian order with everything they had in search of victory that would put them 2-1 up in the series. Sinews strained, sweat drenched shirts and batsmen wilted one by one. All except Ponting.
His 156 remains one of the great Ashes rearguard innings. Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath might have been the men seeing it out at the end (aided and abetted by an exhausted, wayward final over from Steve Harmison) but it was their captain who had made the game-saving contribution. Youre probably the most unpopular man in England right now, were Michael Athertons first words to Ponting at the post-match presentations, a statement in which there was more than just a grain of truth.
So when, 14 days later at Trent Bridge, Australia again found themselves with their backs against the wall in their second dig, Punter was the prize. Flintoff and Geraint Jones had helped England to 477 in the first innings, then Simon Joness five for 44 had skittled the Australians for 218. They were asked to follow on for the first time since Karachi in 1988, 190 Test matches ago.
The out-of-nick Matthew Hayden went for 26, Justin Langer was poached at short leg by Ian Bell off the bowling of Ashley Giles but Ponting had played authoritatively for two hours to reach 48 and help his side to 155 for two  still trailing by just over 100 runs but, as far as England were concerned, moving inexorably back into the game by mid-afternoon on the third day. The old fears, the pains of the past, were emerging from the dark recesses of the English psyche.
Then Martyn called for that single and, with his slingshot arm, David joyously felled the Australian Goliath, sending those psychological spectres scuttling for cover (for an over or two at least) just as he sent the bails cartwheeling away. For all the lunacy of Martyns call, it remains a quite spectacular piece of fielding by the substitute Pratt.
Pontings fury bubbled over. His anger stemmed from the belief that Pratt should not have been on the pitch. Throughout the summer the tourists believed that England were using their substitute fielders to allow bowlers a quick break before spells, giving them a chance to put their feet up, get a rub down or take on board some advice from coaches. A handy side-effect, of course, was that England benefited from fresh fleet-footed tyros in the field. The Australian camp had mentioned it to umpires during the one-day series, then before the start of the Tests, believing England to be following the rules of the game but riding roughshod over its spirit.
Therein lies part of the reason why the Pratt run out remains such a stand out moment in a series of stand out moments. After all, there is pleasure to be found in the heat of a sin. Later in the innings Simon Katich received a shocker of an lbw decision when Steve Harmison struck him on the pad with one that had pitched outside leg (by some distance) and was clearing the bails (by some distance). Katich, on 59, was well set and could well have added a couple of dozen more runs that could have made the difference  England finally chased down 129 with three wickets to spare.
Might an extra 30 runs have been enough for Australia to take that last trio and go 2-1 up in the series with one to play In terms of the match, and the future destination of the Ashes, that moment could be argued to be just as vital. But Katich wasnt Ponting and in his dismissal there was error, but no thrilling frisson of naughtiness.
England, of course, would deny that there was anything naughty about it. There was a substitute fielder on for an injured man, a bowler in fine form who at that point was in hospital having X-rays on his injured ankle (and has not played Test cricket since). And, the case for the defence continued, Trevor Penney, the swooping, diving Red Baron of English fielding, was among the available substitutes not used. If England were seeking to double up on an unfair advantage, why would they not use their own answer to Jonty Rhodes
The overriding suspicion was that Ponting had a point, but, with Jones in hospital, had chosen the wrong time to go postal about it. And in doing so he had for the first time shown the cracks in the Australian psyche.
I did not actually think it at the time but, looking back now, that might have been the moment when it became clear England were going to reclaim the Ashes, writes Fletcher in Ashes Regained, his book on the series. This was an Australian side under enormous pressure. The mental strain was becoming so much that they were grasping any opportunity  however ludicrous  to hit back at us.
Ponting, no longer in English eyes the unflappable embodiment of Australian grit, apologised - My frustration at getting out was compounded by the fact I was run out by a substitute fielder, an issue that has concerned us from the start of this series and one that we raised prior to the series  and was fined 75% of his match fee. The following day, after a run chase that frazzled English nerves to breaking point, Giles clipped Shane Warne away for the winning runs and England were 2-1 up. This was a lead they refused to relinquish at The Oval, where Pratt was given a rapturous reception whenever he emerged from the bench to take the field. The Ashes were back in English hands for the first time since Allan Border had wrenched them away in 1989.
Throughout the celebrations there was a spot reserved for Englands unlikely hero  on the open-top bus, at No10 Downing Street, at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards  and Ponting gave an indication of his character by presenting him with his boots at the teams post-series get-together. A year later, though, Pratt was released by Durham and he has since expressed a degree of regret about the whole Ponting incident, suggesting that his fielding came to overshadow his strength with the bat.
He is now captaining Cumberland in the Minor Counties Championship, a slightly underwhelming post-script perhaps, but one that only adds to the legend. I just picked it up and hoped for the best, was Pratts summation of his big moment.
I could see about one-and-a-half stumps so was just hoping it would go in the right general direction. English cricket will forever be grateful that it did.

Jerusalem issue must be resolved - FM
Following the near-unanimous vote on Thursday by the United Nations General Assembly to declare prior unilateral US recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital as null and void, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka released a statement explaining the countrys vote.
This vote in favour of the resolution was on the basis of Sri Lankas long held traditional and principled position, which is in keeping with the international understanding that Jerusalem in a final-status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both parties - Palestinians and Israelis, and that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states.
The statement continued, qualifying that Sri Lankas vote was not one against the United States or Israel.
The resolution adopted at the 10th emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on December 21,2017 reaffirms this position, and Sri Lankas vote in favour of the resolution was not a vote against any member State of the United Nations.
The MFA then reaffirmed its commitment to a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinein which the countries live side by side in peace, security, and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and Palestine, and with all matters resolved permanently through negotiations.
Concluding its statement, the MFA encouraged all parties concerned to work with restraint, and focus on creating conditions for direct and meaningful negotiations that can resolve all final status issues required for a negotiated settlement.
Every country in South Asia voted in favour of declaring unilateral US recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital to be null and void, barring Bhutan, which abstained from the vote.

Jerusalem issue: World defies Trump
At a special meeting of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) convened to circumvent a United States veto of a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution on the status of Jerusalem which had the support of 14 of its 15 members, an overwhelming majority of states passed a resolution opposing the decision of the United Sates to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The resolution sponsored by Yemen (Chair of the Arab Group) and Turkey (Chair of the Organization of Islamic Countries) received 128 votes for and 9 against with 35 abstentions.
The resolution, though non-binding shows the humiliation and isolation of the United States and Israel from world public opinion. Earlier when the resolution was brought before the UNSC the Ambassador of the United States in the United Nations Nikkei Haley in a letter addressed to 180 of 193 UN members warned them that the names of countries which vote against the decision of the United States will be reported to the US President.
As you consider your vote, I encourage you to know the President and the United States take this vote personallyThe President will be watching this vote carefully and has requested that I report back on those who voted against it, her letter said.
The letter was to intimidate the countries, especially those in the developing world that receives US aid. However, majority of countries refused to be intimidated and rebuffed the United States. The countries that opposed the resolution were the United States, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, Marshal Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo. Those that abstained included Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, El Salvador, Argentina, Latvia et al.
Turmoil in Honduras
Unrest continues in Honduras following the official release of the final results of the Presidential election by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) last Sunday, there weeks after the poll. Though earlier announced results showed the Opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla leading the poll, the Tribunal later announced that incumbent President was leading.
According to the final result the majority of the winner was only 50,000 votes or a meagre 1.6 percent. The Opposition rejected the official results and its supporters have been in the streets protesting against election rigging. The Organization of American States, an Observer in the elections said that there were serious questions about the poll and that the Election Tribunals computer system was manually meddled with. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almegro has called for fresh general elections to resolve the dispute. Opposition candidate Nasralla has warned that the acceptance of the results would lead to civil war.
The United States, Mexico and the European Union, however, seem to accept the results and back the incumbent President Hernandez in a scene similar to their justification of the military coup in 2009 which ousted democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya with the help of the Nationalist Party which is now headed by Hernandez.
Catalans vote for separation
On October 1, 2017 the Parliament of Catalonia, an autonomous state within Spain held a referendum to decide whether it should establish a state separate from Spain or remain within it. The referendum, boycotted by those who wanted to remain in the Spanish Union and outlawed by the Spanish Parliament, nevertheless decided to separate. The Spanish Parliament dissolved the Catalonian Parliament and took over its powers to the center and jailed the Catalan separatist leaders. The Catalan President Puigdemont found asylum abroad. Among the jailed is Vice  President Oriel Junqeras.
A fresh election was held last Thursday to the Catalan Parliament in a bid to resolve the issue. A record 80 percent of the voters took part in it. The separatists, comprising three parties, clinched a majority with 70 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. The anti-secessionist centrists, on the other hand, became the single party with the largest representation of 37 seats.
Though the result could be seen as an affirmation of the peoples desire for separation the future is uncertain. The best result would be a compromise which would give Catalonia more freedom while remain in the Spanish union. Separation would spell doom for Spain and even the European Union for most of the economic wealth of Spain lie there.
Popular backing for Venezuelan Government
At the Municipal elections held on December 10, ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won 308 of the 335 mayors offices and 71% of the vote, representing 6,517,606 voters, as compared to the opposition's 2,749,000.
This was despite claims by the imperialist dominated Western media that President Nicolas Maduro has lost his popularity. Commenting on the violent anti-government campaigns conducted uninterruptedly by the Opposition with the support of the United States Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that just when the violent opposition thought the leadership of the Revolution, the government and President, were weakened, the people reacted and peace was established.
Jorge Rodrguez, head of the Zamora Command running the PSUV election campaign, noted that this is the largest margin of victory any political force has ever achieved in Venezuela's history.
He added that Chavista forces now hold more mayor's offices than ever before, recalling that in 2013, they won 255.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Johan Taylor in Kandy
One of the most experienced coaches Johan Taylor who coached Kandy SC to win the league, knockouts and the sevens many times, with his expert coaching arrived last week to continue his stint with the champion team for about a month. He also coached the national side. It was in 2006, when Kandy was looking for a professional rugby coach that the name of Dan van Zale, the former South African scrum-half and captain in 2000 was proposed and agreed upon, but he was offered the National U20 rugby coach for Ireland and had to decline Sri Lanka's offer. Taylor first came at the end of 2006 and coached the team from 2007 for six years and guided Kandy to win both the knockout and league title for five years. The rugby's double eluded them in 2012. His absence as coach was felt badly. Taylor is a fine coach who has coached the Sri Lanka team as well as Royal College in 2013. He played most of his rugby in Ireland after leaving South Africa. Besides he is a Level 3 qualified rugby coach. He is also a very good golfer winning many awards in golf tournaments conducted by the Victoria Golf and Country Resort.
Deeghayu makes Kandy proud

Kandy AFL AGM still not held
Eight days more for the year to end and still the Annual General Meeting of the Kandy Association Football League has not been held. No domestic tournaments, no promotion of the game, only coaching programs are held for a few to earn a quick buck. In the last eight years football has gone to the dogs at club level in Kandy. This has been a great setback for the sport. It is reliably understood even last years tournaments have not been held.
Kandy rugby academy to camp
The Kandy Rugby Academy are offering academy camp options for 2 days Saturday and Sunday. This development and intensive 2-day Player Development Camps will bring into focus some of the leading coaches who will train you to gain your full potential using tools to continue your development. This academy based in Kandy can be rated as one of the best in the country providing the perfect environment for players to experience a true taste of Sri Lankan rugby.
Indrajith Bandaranayake here on holiday
Indrajith Bandaranayake who led Kandy SC to win the first league title in 1994 is on a brief holiday from Australia. He is a former Dharmaraja College, Kandy SC wing three quarter who is domiciled in Melbourne. As a schoolboy he did well in cricket and karate too. It was at Nittawela he blossomed as a ruggerite. After hanging up his boots he helped his club in coaching in 2005 when Sanjeewa Jayasinghe led the side, and the rugby chairman was Siva Subramanium.
Gearing for inter-school cricket
Kandy schools are gearing up for the cricket amid many hardships and have played a few games. Cricket plays a large part in the lives of school children. At present most cricket playing schools in Kandy are lacking ground facilities and other needs. Spectator interest for school cricket in Kandy is very high. With the help of the spectators backing the cricketers too are compelled to produce their best. St. Sylvesters College has continued to produce good cricketers even without a proper playing field of their own. Vidyartha College is another leading Buddhist school who do not have a ground for matches. Cricket takes pride of place at Kingswood College, another school without a match ground. Dharmaraja, one of the oldest Buddhist cricket playing schools, Trinity College and St. Anthonys College have their own playing fields, Sri Rahula College has become a major force in cricket with limited facilities, Sri Sumangala College too have ground problems. Nugawela Central College are blessed with a ground, Ranabima Royal College is new to cricket and they have their own grounds. Other schools involved in cricket are Madena Central College, Walala A Ratnayake Central College, Al-Azhar College, Akurana and Zahira College Akurana.
Volleyball 76 years old in Kandy
The game of volleyball is the national sport of Sri Lanka. In Kandy at one time volleyball was a popular sport, but today sadly the much needed support for the game is missing. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making big news. The first volleyball league was formed in Kandy in 1941. At one time there were two tournaments annually - one on a league basis and other on a knockout. Volleyball in Kandy needs a fillip. The game was introduced to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1916 by R. W. Camack, then Director of Physical Education at the Colombo Y.M.C.A. The newly appointed governing body should give a hand for Kandy volleyball.
Rajans junior cricket
Dharmaraja under 13 A team playing In Division 1 lost their first game in the second round to Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa. Dharmaraja scored 110-8 in 55 overs with Yasith Dissanayake scoring 33. Joseph Vaz replied with 184-3 in 43 overs with Kavith Sehara scoring 70 not out. Menusha Perera 34, and Nethmal de Soyza 33.
Trinity, Dharmaraja win at hockey
Trinity College playing in Group J won the Golden Star award at the under 14 all island inter school hockey tournament held in Kandy. This was their third win in a row. Trinitians beat Janadapathi Vidyalaya, S. Thomas College Gurutalawa, Mahinda College and drew with D.S. Senanayake College. Dharmaraja College who won three games beat schools like Asoka Vidyalaya Colombo, Hindu College Colombo, Badulla Central College and ended up as the group leaders. They were also awarded the Golden Star.

Minister calls to ensure quality of seafood exports
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed relevant authorities to take measures to export the best quality seafood products to maintain the prevailing demand for Sri Lankan seafood products in the international market.
Addressing a progress review meeting held on Thursday at the Ministry premises, Minister Amaraweera said Sri Lanka has to compete with many countries to get a better market for local seafood exports. Therefore, seafood exporters should consider the quality of export products to get more market opportunities.
According to the Minister, Sri Lankas seafood exports have recorded a 44 percent growth in 2017. This year, the country has earned Rs. 28,685 million by exporting about 18,262 metric tons of fisheries products. The income generated through ornamental fish exports was Rs. 1,678 million.
The country was able to export 5,197 metric tons and earn Rs. 7,853 million after the European Union lifted the ban on fish exports, he said.
The Minister also instructed officials to encourage fishermen to engage in the industry without breaching international laws and regulations.

## Title: A NATIONAL POLL OF MAJOR POLITICAL RIVALRY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, December 23, 2017 - 01:00
A NATIONAL POLL OF MAJOR POLITICAL RIVALRY
With the nominations for elections to all local bodies concluding earlier this week, the stage is set for the local government elections throughout the county on February 10, 2018 under the new electoral system, making it an effective National Poll of deep political significance.
The week also saw a major development on the anti-Rajapaksa Regime corruption drive, with many ministers calling for a Presidential Commission to probe the removal of the Army Headquarters from Galle Face by the Rajapaksa Government, at the cost of an annual rent of Rs. 15 billion for 15 buildings for the defence forces, when Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and many more aspects of corruption involved in this deal. The situation is certainly no Shangri-la for the country.
In the Local Govt. Polls, three leading contenders for the mayoralty of Colombo  the UNP, UPFA and JVP have announced their mayoral candidates. Several nomination lists of political parties and independent groups have been rejected by the Elections Office personnel.
The coming election will be an event of major political rivalry with the fight for control of a majority of local bodies being a race among three political forces  the SLFP with the UPFA led by President Maithripala Sirisena - the official leader of the SLFP, the UNP and United National Front for Good Governance(UNFGG) led by Prime Minister and UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) with the Joint Opposition (JO) unofficially led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was the last President of the SLFP and UPFA. Two other major players will be the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) throughout the country, and in the North and East, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by R. Sampanthan. These major political groupings will draw support from smaller parties aligned with them, and also find opposition from independent groups.
As the campaign builds up, there are all signs of this being projected as a mini-poll or run up to a General Election, with attempts to show which, among the three main political groups outside the North & East, would be able to display strength as the likely winner of the General Election due in 2020, and thereby be the successor to the present unity government of the UNP and SLFP coalition. Of course the JVP is making a strong case of its own, as the party that is without the record of failures and major defeats suffered by the UNP and SLFP-UPFA, and certainly with more experience than the SLPP. But this is no easy task because of its earlier alliances with the SLFP in government, holding portfolios too, as well as its support for Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Poll in January 2015.
Failure of alliance
The campaign for the February 10 poll comes after the failure to bring about an alliance between the Sirisena-led SLFP and the Joint Opposition manipulated SLPP with the dominance of Mahinda Rajapaksa. This will now be a major confrontation between these two rivals, both seeking to gain the advantage of the Blue Flag of the SLFP, as well as opposition to the UNP and its Green Flag. The clash between the blue rivals shows all signs of moving down to the grass roots level of the rural sector, with the Sirisena-led SLFP-UPFA having the advantage of controlling the strings of power in the central government. As the campaign moves on, there is an emerging opposition to the Rajapaksa sibling, Basil, the key organiser of the SLPP, noticeable among non-SLFP members of the Joint Opposition and many SLFP members within the JO too, who have been strongly critical of Basil Rajapaksas contribution to the defeat of the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency and Rajapaksa Regime in January 2015.
As the election campaign moves on there will also be many more situations of political leapfrogging, mainly from the JO to the SLFP, due to the ability of the Sirisena presidency to offer fruits of satisfaction through political office in diverse areas of government. The SLFP also has the advantage of threatening disciplinary action against those formally in that party who contest or campaign against it in support of the SLPP, an electoral rival. Part of this tactic is seen in the move by the UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, to have ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksas photo on the SLFPs electoral posters, as the unofficial leader and key vote drawer for the SLPP remains, for the record, a member of the SLFP.
The UNP clout
The fighting between the SLFP-UPFA and JO-SLPP is also part of the commonality of purpose in being opposed the UNP-UNFGG. The failure of the SLFP and JO-SLPP to form an alliance for these polls was mainly due to Mahinda Rajapaksas demand that the Sirisena-SLFP abandon its support for the UNP-SLFP coalition of unity in government. Earlier plans for several leading SLFP members in government to cross over to the JO, did not succeed, although many of them remain openly critical of the UNP. But the UNPs own strength and its ability to form a majority government within parliament, certainly made those verbally and vociferously anti-UNP SLFP leaders to realize their own weakness if they were out of government office, including positions in the Cabinet.
The rivalry of the Blue camps  has clearly given a major advantage to the UNP, as the partner of the coalition of unity, in the coming election. Its clout comes from unity as a party and the ability to manage or manipulate the economic and fiscal policies of the government, where any weakness or failure, such as the cost of living, certainly a major issue before voters, also strikes the President who is the SLFPs leader, and in this situation the UNPs rival. Its ranks are united both in the urban and rural sectors, and it also has considerable support among the minorities, both ethnic and religious. However, a statement by one of its leaders John Amaratunga, and the continued presence of Ravi Karunanayake in a leadership position, have certainly undermined some of the UNPs campaign; but not to the extent that rivalry has affected the SLFP and JO-SLPP.
However, there is also the situation of the UNP being in a disadvantageous position on the issue of corruption, arising from the Central Bank and Treasury bond scam. As a party that was in the lead in the fight against corruption, that helped elect Maithripala Sirisena in January 2015, the UNP is today facing much public criticism and opposition on the Bond Scam issue. It could get worse with the release of the related Presidential Commission Report by December 31, when the poll campaign gets hotter.
What is seen from the rivalries in the current poll campaign is that politics of Sri Lanka today is largely that of the assurance of the benefits of government office; and very little, if any, of a commitment to serve the people and society. It is the politics of personal profitability and prodigious gain through office, which clearly drives the vast majority of politicians, both in government and the opposition. There are little signs the coming local government election will make any change in this thinking. The public, and especially civil society, will have to play an important role in the continued fight against corruption, in this poll campaign too, if the public call for clean government is to be effective.
No Shangri-la here
The moves by the JO and the Eliya and other majoritarian activists to attack the government through support for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, will soon face a new development, over the sale of the Army Headquarters land at Galle Face to the Chinese Shangri-la hotel builders. President Sirisenas information to the Cabinet on what appears to be serious undervaluing of this land, the speed of sale to the Chinese developer, the cost involved in rent for the several premises occupied by the defence personnel, and many other questionable acts by the former Ministry of Defence, brings a whole new issue that can possibly capture public interest, with much impact against the Rajapaksa Regime.
At a time when there is public concern about political moves to prevent the arrest of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for alleged wrongdoings in meeting the costs of the DA Rajapaksa Museum at Weeeraketiya, amounting to Rs. 90 million, a matter before the Court of Appeal on a petition by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, there will be demands for a proper and thorough probe into this speedy sale of prime value to a Chinese company, which is also considered a threat to the security of Colombo.
This will remain a topic of much political and public interest, both through the Local Govt. Polls and after that. The debate on corruption, both during the past government and the present shows all signs of remaining a key factor in the substance of politics, involving most political parties.

Rejection of SLFP nomination papers:
Organisers responsible - Nimal
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said that electoral organisers should take the responsibility for the rejection of SLFP nomination papers by election officials.
Addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the Minister requested the Election Commission Chairman to ensure that all parties abide by the election rules and regulations to ensure a free and fair election.
He added that the SLFP and the UPFA will extend their fullest support to the Commission to ensure free and fair election.
Minister de Silva said that adopting a new electoral system is a victory to the SLFP and added that they intend to adopt the same system at other elections as well.
He requested the people to make use of this opportunity and elect a person of their choice who shows more commitment and dedication in the service of the people.
Speaking about the partys Colombo Municipal Council Mayoral candidate Azad Sally, the Minister said he was not someone who was suddenly imported to the field.
Responding to a question about the SLFPs political enemies, Minister de Silva said the party cadres and supporters at grassroots level are aware of this situation and would use their votes in a prudent manner. When the Minister was asked, what decisions the President Maithripala Sirisena would take once the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond Issuance is released, Minister Silva said the President would promptly take action on the recommendations of the Commission.
He said that the upcoming election would eliminate racism and strengthen reconciliation among the people.
We have already created the background for the holding of a free and fair election, he said.

Philippines rescues 252 ferry passengers
THE PHILIPPINES: Rescue teams in the Philippines resumed their search for survivors Friday after a ferry carrying more than 250 passengers capsized, with at least five confirmed dead.
The accident occurred in rough waters off the main island of Luzon Thursday as the Mercraft 3 keeled over en route to a remote island.
The 206-tonne vessel had been given the green light to sail as Tropical Storm Tembin gathered pace over the southern Philippines nearly a thousand kilometres away, as there were no storm alerts in the local area, the coastguard said. But a survivor told local radio that the ferry was forced to stop at sea due to large waves and strong winds, before it started taking in water from the bow and tipped over.
Filipino ferries, which seasonally brave rough seas in the Pacific typhoon belt, are notorious for overloading.
Some 252 people have so far been pulled to safety, with the death toll up to five. The coastguard had earlier said only 251 passengers and crew were on board, but confirmed the vessel had a 286-person capacity. Officials gave no explanation for the discrepancy but acknowledged the boat had carried more than the 251 people listed on its manifest. Rescuers are yet to determine how many are still missing, Efren Ritual, a rescue official in the town of Infanta, said. The search will continue because there are still people here looking for their missing relatives, he told AFP by telephone. Local fishing boats and the Philippine navy were assisting in the search, according to the coastguard office in Manila.

Complaints of difficulty in answering O/L Maths paper:
Relief for students after re-evaluation
Examinations Commissioner General B. Sanath Pujitha said a systematic and scientific evaluation will be carried out by the Examinations Department to ascertain whether students faced difficulties when answering the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination Mathematics second question paper.
On the outcome of the evaluation, it has been planned to take measures to provide suitable relief for students, he said.
He was responding to a query by the Daily News about the allegations levelled by certain sectors that the standard of the Mathematics second question paper is rather high and that it had been difficult for students to answer. The Commissioner said a bundle of sample answer scripts, which represents the entire country, will be re-evaluated by a committee comprising the question paper preparing board, chief evaluators and a set of teachers who teach Mathematics at schools.
Measures will be taken according to the findings of the re-evaluation. However, he said he does not personally believe that there is a major issue with regard to the Mathematics second question paper.
The answer script evaluation process commenced last Tuesday and was carried out until yesterday.

Sharma's 35-ball ton leads India to series-clinching win
INDORE AFP Dec 22: Skipper Rohit Sharma equalled the record for fastest Twenty20 century on Friday to set up India's 88-run series-clinching win over Sri Lanka in the second match.
Sharma's 43-ball 118 steered the hosts to 260-5 and then dismissed Sri Lanka for 172 in 17.2 overs, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series in Indore.
Wrist spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav shared seven wickets each as India achieved their 16th series win -- across all three formats -- at home since November 2015.
But it was Sharma's 100 off 35 deliveries, matching South African David Miller's century against Bangladesh in October, that stood out. Sharma smashed 12 fours and 10 sixes after India were put into bat.
His explosive 165-run opening stand with Lokesh Rahul, who made 89, took the steam out of the Sri Lankan attack.
India's 260-5 is their highest-ever T20 total, and just three short of the record score in the format -- Australia's 263-3 against Sri Lanka in Pallekele last year.
Sharma scored his second T20 hundred by mercilessly hitting the Sri Lankan bowlers all over the ground. He got his first 50 in 23 balls, and second in just 12.
He finally fell to fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera, mistiming a slow bouncer to short third man, and walked off to a standing ovation.
Rahul then took over and got his second successive half-century off 35 balls, and put on 78 runs for the second wicket with Mahendra Singh Dhoni (28).
The opener hit five fours and eight sixes in his 49-ball blitz before being caught behind off Nuwan Pradeep.
Sri Lanka responded with a 109-run second wicket partnership between Upul Tharanga, who made 47, and Kusal Perera, who top-scored with 77, but the ever-increasing run-rate proved too much for the chasing side.
Spin twins Chahal and Yadav once again spelt trouble for the visitors as they combined to flatten the opposition batting.
Both Yadav (3-52) and Chahal (4-52) picked three wickets each in the final over of their respective spells to make the islanders slip from 155-2 as wickets fell in a heap.
Angelo Mathews, who suffered a hamstring injury while bowling, did not come out to bat and has been ruled out for the final game in Mumbai on Sunday.

Rejection of Nominations:
SLPP seeks SC remedy SLPP seeks SC remedy
Seven members of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
They are seeking an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the SLPP for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP were rejected on the grounds that it did not contain the total number of women candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
Seven petitioners who nominated themselves as candidates for election for the constituting wards of the Maharagama Urban Council are also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council.
This petition was filed through Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana and Counsel H.M. Tillekaratne.
The petitioners had cited Damayanthi Wanigasinghe, Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of the Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Dumminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva as respondents.
The petitioners maintained that the decision to reject the nomination paper had been arrived at by failing to properly and reasonably exercise and execute the statutory and legal duty vested in the first respondent, Damayanthi Wanigasinghe by failing to examine the nomination paper to ascertain the fact whether the nomination paper contained the required number of women candidates.
They further alleged the she had failed to evaluate evidence before her and misdirected herself in fact and in law, which is also amounts to causing an error of material facts.
They further stated the first respondent failed to give a fair hearing to the authorised agent or consider and do further examination of the material before her, referred to in the submissions made by the authorised agent.

A solution to traffic woes
Rajagiriya, the main city of the Sri Jayawardhanapura administrative capital, is well known for its traffic congestion at virtually any time of the day. With arterial roads radiating from Rajagiriya to Nawala, Borella, Battaramulla, Pita Kotte and Gothatuwa, it is a traffic nightmare for motorists as well as Police. Many temporary traffic control solutions have not offered a way out of the gridlock, which costs time, energy and money for motorists, bus passengers and pedestrians.
Although the previous Government vowed to build a flyover at Rajagiriya to ease traffic congestion under the infamous election-oriented 200 bridges and flyovers programme, only a few were actually built around eight years ago, including those at Nugegoda and Dehiwela. The proposed flyovers for Rajagiriya and Havelock Town fell by the wayside. Rajagiriya is now getting a much better deal  a four-lane, concrete flyover costing Rs.4.7 billion designed to drastically reduce traffic congestion and cut travel times at least by half.
Built with Spanish aid and expertise and fully overseen by the Road Development Authority (RDA), the 534 metre long flyover consists of two parallel bridges with two lanes on each bridge. It was to be constructed in two phases from Battaramulla to Borella along the new Parliament Road and only the first phase of the flyover was to be completed by December 2017. However, the Government requested the contractors to complete work on the second phase simultaneously to minimize the inconvenience caused to the public during construction, which means the entire flyover is now almost complete. It was inspected on Thursday by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and will be opened in January 2018 by President Maithripala Sirisena. Most motorists would have wished for an extension all the way to the Airport Expressway at Peliyagoda, but this is a good start that can point the way to bigger things.
The Rajagiriya flyover is not the only such project currently underway. Two more flyovers are being constructed in Ganemulla and Polgahawela, also with Spanish assistance, to reduce the congestion mainly caused by the railway crossings. The Government is also going ahead with the Central Expressway from Colombo to Kandy, which is due to be extended to Dambulla. Work is already underway. A new 74 Km expressway called Ruwanpura Expressway is to be built from the Kahathuduwa Interchange of the Southern Expressway to Pelmadulla, to provide faster (just 45 minutes) access to Ratnapura.
The Southern Expressway itself is being extended to Hambantota in line with the Governments plans to make the region a shipping and aviation hub using the Magampura Port and the Mattala Airport. The Outer Circular Highway too is being extended. An integrated transport hub is coming up in Kottawa, just a few metres away from the Southern Expressway entry point. An overhead bridge will be built from Kelaniya to Colombo Fort which will be extended up to the HSBC building in Rajagiriya. The Government is also mulling a road from Kandy to Hambantota that will traverse the countrys interior.
Apart from expressways and road works, the Government is going ahead with other major infrastructure projects such as the Colombo International Financial City. All these projects also negate the allegations spread by the Joint Opposition and certain other politicians that the National Unity Government had neglected infrastructure and other forms of development such as power projects.
During his inspection tour, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe explained how traffic congestion hampers the countrys economic development, adding that short term, midterm and long term initiatives have been formulated to solve traffic issues. Traffic in Colombo is already down to around 8 km/h and experts predict a figure of just 3 Km/h by end 2019, based on present rates of vehicle registration.
While building and widening roads is essential to control the worsening traffic, it is even more prudent to build better public transport links that could take some cars off the road at least on weekdays. Indeed, the Western Province Megapolis Plan calls for such Light Rail Transit (LRT) projects on highly congested traffic corridors such as Malabe-Colombo, the groundwork for which will be laid next year. This will be an appealing alternative to the private car  just imagine the fuel and time savings if even 200 cars are taken off the road during the rush hour on this busy sector. Furthermore, the rise of ride sharing services will also reduce the need for having a private car.
There should also be a bigger focus on the development of roads in rural areas. There is nothing wrong about developing city roads, but almost every TV news bulletin has a story about a remote village which lacks even a basic tarred access road. These lacunae in development must be identified and corrective action taken so that the fruits of development can be shared equally among all Sri Lankans. The forthcoming Local Government election will give the voters an opportunity to elect candidates who are committed to fulfill the basic grassroots needs of their villages such as motorable roads and bus services. After all, the road to development should start from the local bodies.

Sri Lanka re-selected for MCC programme
The Board of Directors of the United States Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) re-selected Sri Lanka for its grant programme at its meeting on December 19.
This will enable the MCC to continue developing its compact programme with the Sri Lankan Goverment for which Sri Lanka was selected a year ago.
MCC compact programmes are large, five-year grants for selected countries that meet the MCCs eligibility criteria of good governance, economic freedom and investment in their citizens.
The selections are based on performance indicators compiled by the MCC in an annual scorecard for countries under consideration, a release issued by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister office said.
As required by MCC procedure, the MCC reselects countries already in compact development as part of its annual selection process. Sri Lankas reselection bears testament to the countrys continued progress on policy performance and reforms, including on democratic rights and control of corruption, and the strength of the governments partnership with MCC since 2015. MCCs recognition of Sri Lankas progress provides further impetus to the governments political and economic reforms aimed at achieving sustainable peace and economic prosperity.
Since being selected eligible for a compact programme in December 2016, the government of Sri Lanka and the MCC have been working together to develop projects with the aim of fighting poverty and promoting economic opportunity for the Sri Lankan people.
In July, the MCC announced $7.4 million in funding to support the development of the compact, including identifying and analyzing specific projects for potential investment. This amount is in addition to the total MCC compact funding amount, which will be determined later. Based on an analysis of the constraints to economic growth, Sri Lanka and MCC are currently conducting due diligence on potential projects in the transport and land sectors.
In December 2015, Sri Lanka was selected for an MCC Threshold Programme which are smaller grants awarded to countries that come close to MCCs eligibility criteria, but are firmly committed to improving policy and performance. With Sri Lankas selection for a Compact Programme only a year later, MCC and Sri Lanka began work to transition into this much larger programme.
Created by the US Congress in 2004 with bipartisan support, MCC is a unique U.S. agency that operates on the principle of delivering assistance on the basis of a long-term consultative partnership with recipient countries. Country ownership and country-led solutions for reducing poverty through sustainable economic growth are the underlying principles on which MCC grants are provided. Grants are designed to complement other U.S. and international development programmes, and to create an enabling environment for private sector investment. MCC holds partner countries accountable through rigorous oversight, monitoring and evaluation.
The MCCs Board of Directors is chaired by the Secretary of State. Its members include the Secretary of the Treasury, the US Trade Representative, the Administrator of USAID, the Chief Executive Officer of MCC and four private sector representatives. The Board members are appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the US Senate.

UN condemns Australia's forced return of asylum seeker
The United Nations refugee agency has condemned Australias forced return of an asylum seeker to Sri Lanka without any assessment of his claim for protection, saying the man is at serious risk of persecution in his homeland.
The UNHCR had sought assurances from the Australian government that the man would not be removed from the country and would be allowed to apply for protection.
But on Wednesday, the man was forcibly removed, in handcuffs, from Villawood detention centre and flown back to Sri Lanka.
The Australian government has maintained that the man was removed because he missed his October 1 deadline to apply for protection, and was deemed not to be seeking protection.
However, lawyers for the man said he had a credible claim for protection, based on his Tamil ethnicity, and familial connection to the now-defunct separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil Tigers. It is not suggested he was a member of the LTTE.
The man had struggled to fill out the 41-page protection application form in English unassisted, and was not able to access legal assistance before the deadline.
With assistance from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, he lodged an application for protection in October but was told he had missed the deadline and his claim would not be assessed.
Lawyers and advocates for the returned man have not been able to contact him since he was returned.
A spokeswoman for the UNHCR, Catherine Stubberfield, said the UN was aware of a number of asylum seekers who were unable to meet the governments deadline of October 1 to submit their applications for asylum.
Since July 2012, people who sought asylum by sea were excluded from lodging an application in Australia for up to four years.
While they were all invited to apply by October 2016, some asylum seekers have been unable to complete this process within the timeframe for a range of valid reasons, including a lack of access to legal representation. This was the case for the asylum seeker forcibly returned to Sri Lanka this week.
The October 1 deadline was announced in May by the then Immigration  now Home Affairs  Minister Peter Dutton, who accused asylum seekers of being fake refugees.
Seven thousand asylum seekers, many of whom had lived for years in Australia without ever being allowed to apply for protection, were told they must meet the October 1 deadline. It is understood that all but 71 met the deadline.
The Australias department of immigration declined to comment on the specific case of the man deported on Wednesday, but has commented on the return of Tamils generally, and its non-refoulement obligations.
Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australias non-refoulement obligations, a spokesperson said last week. Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously."

Johannes Voet (1647-1713), the celebrated lawyer from the Netherlands, among other things, is credited with adapting many of the primary Roman legal principles and concepts to suit the spirit of his time and clime. The illustrious jurists well-earned fame long outlived the man, not only in Holland but also in countries with legal systems that have been enriched by the Roman-Dutch law. Going by the annual Bacchanalian homage our legal fraternity pays the great jurist, Sri Lanka is also not without its share of acute connoisseurs of fine legal thinking.
The event oddly is called Voet lights. A more self-conscious temperament would have gone for something like Voet devotees or even Voet wanna-bes, but here in the land of only the best, they will have none if not lights, in other words, points of illumination!
Predictably, the function starts with cocktails during which there is perfect harmony at the bar. Dimly lit, the function area is ideal for consultations in which the parties wish to remain anonymous. Since everybody is in dark suits, the solemn uniform of the lawyers, it is virtually impossible to conduct an identification parade post facto to charge those present for their misdemeanours. Judging by the evidence, the brief for the day is to drink the bar dry. On this matter one need not teach the gentry in black coat to suck eggs. While some gulp down their Black Label whisky with a squirt of soda, most seem to think it criminal to dilute such good stuff.
Being a good Dutchman, Voet would be verily titillated by the bevy of female admirers he has acquired in this little island in the Indian Ocean. Draped in shimmering saris of their land, the gentle devotees of the great Hollander glide through the throng with an air of susceptibility; evoking protective instincts in the stout hearts of their male counter-parts. While they keep a concerned eye on the present day Portias, the men are not overly distracted from the mission of consuming all the amber stuff so freely flowing.
Legal eagles
As the evening progresses the intellectual quality of the conversation assumes truly Voetian proportions. Hardly anybody notices the valiant efforts of the chamber orchestra. Opinions, usually an expensive commodity in this milieu, flow thick and furious. Judging from the raucous laughter emanating from the many circles of lawyers on the floor, there are some outstanding wits present. The celebrations proceed smoothly; drinks, eats and reputations demolished with abandon.
When the liquor becomes increasingly hard to find and all the bites consumed, the gong announces dinner, almost creating a stampede. This is no dignified ceremonial sitting. These legal eagles are too well acquainted with the pattern of life in this island to chance an orderly entry to the dining hall. In the hurly-burly of Hultsdorp, the early bird catches the worm. Why should it be different tonight
The passionate pleaders, now merry, move noisily towards the banquet hall obviously anticipating the impending meal with relish. Menu cards placed stylishly on the tables promise a repast worthy of august epicureans. Cutlery, neatly arranged, warns of a structured meal. The first-timers excitedly sit down to what they expect to be a memorable repast made up of tastefully selected food, good wine, entertaining conversation and scintillating speeches. The old hands too jaded to be concerned about such trivialities, occupy themselves in the learned pursuit of comparing the relative merits of Voet of Holland, with that of Johnny Walker of Scottish fame; the majority pronouncing that the good old Scot has much credit to his name.
Having waited impatiently for the meal to begin, the busy practitioners of the law attack the food with an appreciative violence, which would surely warm the heart of the over-worked and under-appreciated chef. Some activist types who have been complaining about laws delays set an example of not sitting on ceremony by using their soup bowls like a tea-cup, consuming the warm broth in record time. The fierce use of the fork, so like a decisive counter punch to the slow-witted police prosecutor in the magistrates court, gives flight to the well-baked button potatoes and pieces of chicken, which sometimes land in the whisky of their neighbours. The deafening clatter emanating from the tables drowns the feeble efforts of the Scribe to bring order to the unruly proceedings.
Social economic arrangements
Those who, with great efforts of concentration, manage to catch the words of the speakers realize that a lot of ribald, off-colour things are being said about the more successful lawyers, a profession now moulded very much in their own image. This is not a place for brilliant word play or subtle innuendo, things associated with gatherings of the legal fraternity in other lands; broadly learned and sophisticated. But then, we have always prided ourselves on being different.
The lofty legal issues that confronted Voet and the other European Jurists were not matters that occupied the minds of our Kings or their courts, having no relevance in the then existing social economic arrangements here. These alien systems, ideas and methods found their way to these parts only through conquests and occupation by European powers. Although with the passing of time a certain familiarity with the impositions was inevitable, in essence, they lacked authenticity in the adopting culture, which only an evolutionary history and tradition can supply. Where there is no true tradition, ceremony and ritual may be invented, but there is an underlying sense of the contrived; an imperfect mimic of something only half understood and not truly of the soil.
Yes, we have devotees who pay an annual tribute to Voet, never mind, what Voet would have thought of his following in the paradise island!

Wallaby great Ken Catchpole dead at 78
Sydney: Former Wallabies captain Ken Catchpole, considered one of the greats of Australian rugby, has died aged 78 following a long illness, Rugby Australia said Friday.
Affectionately known as Catchy, he played 27 Tests, 13 as skipper, and formed one of the games enduring scrum-half partnerships with fly-half Phil Hawthorne.
Catchpole captained Australia at 21 on his international debut against Fiji in 1961 and went on to become an influential figure in Australian rugby throughout that decade.
He suffered a career-ending injury in 1968 at the age of 28 when he was seriously hurt in a brutal tackle by All Black hard man Colin Meads.
Meads stretched Catchpoles leg in a ruck and, with the other leg caught, it led to a complete rupture of groin and hamstring muscles. Comeback attempts were unsuccessful.
Ken wasnt just a remarkable rugby player but also a remarkable man, Rugby Australia board member and former Wallabies skipper Paul McLean said.
Ken had a real aura about him both on and off the field. He might have been small in stature but you knew when Ken was in the room by the respect he commanded.
Catchpole was inducted onto the Museum of Rugby Wall of Fame in 2004 and is honoured in perpetuity with a plaque in the Walk of Honour at the Sydney Cricket Ground to commemorate his career.
He received the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005.
Upon his induction into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame, then ARU president Paul McLean referred to him as exuding grace and majesty.
Former Wallabies coach Bob Dwyer said what he did in the game are the things of legend.
He was something else, he was a phenomenal athlete. Superb pass, agility, and he was tough, Dwyer added.
To get a full appreciation of the talents of Catchy, youd only need to talk to his forwards. No matter how much you praised them, theyd say: No, no ... we had Catchy.
Former Wallaby forward also Simon Poidevin paid tribute to a fallen teammate, saying: Ken was an extraordinary athlete with blistering speed, amazing agility and a fearless spirit in taking on much bigger opponents.
Catchy was a natural leader and was consistently rated the best half-back in the world.
He was loved by Wallabies young and old and displayed a modesty that defied his achievements and set an example for our sport.
Catchpole is the second former Wallaby to pass away this week following the death of 18-Test prop and Queensland great Stan Pilecki, aged 70. AFP

When Tamil Union bid farewell to Hathu
With Chandika Hathurusingha being appointed as head coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team it would be imperative to reflect back seven years ago when things were not so rosy for him and circumstances led him to migrate with his family to Australia.
On that occasion Tamil Union of which Hathurusingha was a member bade farewell to him at a function held at the club premises at the P Sara Oval on December 6, 2010 where S Skandakumar, a former president of Tamil Union paid a glowing tribute to him.
We reproduce the farewell in full for the benefit of our readers who may not be aware of the travails that Hathurusingha underwent to reach the position he holds today:
The Tamil Union bade farewell to yet another of its outstanding members at a well attended function at the club's premises recently. Chandika Hathurusingha who was widely acclaimed as one of the more successful coaches of national cricket had his services terminated by the Interim Committee on the 10th of August following an independent inquiry, the findings of which were not made public.
He consequently decided to migrate to Australia with his family. The club's former President and one time Hony Secretary of Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, S. Skandakumar, who was also Vice Chairman/Secretary of the first ever Cricket Interim Committee appointed in 1999, paid a glowing tribute to Hathurusingha, recalling his early humble days with the club that began at the tender age of 14 years when he was a student of a relatively unknown school called Veluwana in Dematagoda.
"His school coach, Tom Dep a remarkably fine gentleman once told me that Chandika did 15 minutes of bat drill regularly after dinner, standing in front of a mirror, and would then tuck his bat under his pillow and go to sleep. You can therefore imagine his passion for the game at that very early age, and the kind of dreams he must have had in his adolescent years."
'To improve his chances at cricket, Chandika moved to Ananda College in 1984, but failed to find a place in the first eleven team and yet in 1986, was picked to tour England with the Sri Lanka schoolboys team, creating an unprecedented record where a school boy cricketer represented his country before he did his alma mater. He made such an impact on that tour that in 1988 he was appointed Vice Captain of the first ever Youth World Cup team that participated in a tournament in Australia.' Skandakumar recalled.
'In 1991, 'Skandakumar added,' Chandika got the opportunity of his dreams when he was flown out to replace an injured Dammika Ranatunge on Sri Lanka's international tour of New Zealand and made a half century on his Test debut as opening batsman in trying conditions. He repeated the feat in the following Test as well and went on to register an enviable hat trick of half-centuries in international cricket when he followed this up with 66 on his first appearance at Lord's, when Sri Lanka toured England immediately thereafter. In 1995, Chandika went on tour to Pakistan and made 4 half-centuries in the three Test Match series and yet lost his place in the national team although he was a member of the World Cup squad that toured England in 1999."
Continuing, Skandakumar said, 'Realising that the doors of international cricket were closing on him, Chandika then turned his excellent cricketing brain to coaching and in 2000 qualified as a Level Two coach in Australia. On his return he found that the Moors Sports Club had been relegated from the Premier Division and took up the challenge as Captain cum Coach to get that club back into the major division. His extraordinary skills both as a Captain and Coach became apparent when Moors under his leadership and guidance not only re-entered the Premier Division, but went on to win the Premier Championship just two years after being relegated .This was I understand the first time that the Moors had achieved it in their 99 year history. Chandika won the Player of the Tournament award in the Premier League for three consecutive years starting from 2001/2002, and yet failed to find a place in even the national 'A' team. While playing league cricket in England in the summer of 2003, he pursued his interest in coaching further and qualified as a Level Three coach, the highest standard in coaching in the UK at that time. Upon his return he re-associated himself with the Tamil Union as player cum coach and helped the club to emerge jOint champions in the Premier Limited Tournament that very season. The damage inflicted by Tsunami in 2004, prevented the final from being played. His first major international challenge as a coach came in October 2005, when he was appointed head coach of the United Arab Emirates team and was mandated to help that country secure a place in the 2008 Asia Cup tournament. To do so, the Emirates had to win the Asian Cricket Council tournament held in Malaysia in 2006."
"Chandika was able to guide the UAE team to that championship, adding yet another notable achievement to his string of coaching successes. Sri Lanka Cricket then woke up to the extent of Chandika's coaching talents and offered him a contract to coach the national A team, the feeder to the national team which he accepted with relish.
He was instrumental in rehabilitating the cricket careers of many players including the likes of Thilan Samaraweera and Thilina Kandamby while he also unearthed fresh talent in Tharanga Paranavitarna, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedara,Chanaka Welagedera and Dammika Prasad. Additionally he got the best out of players like Malintha Warnapura Suranga Lakmal and Isuru Udana. He was soon elevated to work with the national team as Shadow Coach and the extent of his effectiveness was common knowledge."
'Given this exceptional background,' Skandakumar said, the sudden and totally unexpected termination of his services sent shock waves not only through cricketing circles and the media, but the national team itself. In that respect I wish to quote to you lines from a letter of appeal that the national captain Kumar Sangakkara addressed to the Interim committee which received wide publicity. The lines speak for themselves.
MY INTEREST IN REGAINING HIS SERVICES IS PURELY SELFISH. I WANT TO BE PART OF A TEAM THAT IS COACHED BY THE BEST. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AFTER THE 2011 WORLD CUP, CHANDIKA HAS THE CAPABILITY TO ABLY HEAD THE COACHING OF THE NATIONAL TEAM. THE WHOLE SQUAD OF NATIONAL PLAYERS RESPECT HIM AND ADMIRE HIM FOR THE WORK DONE".
"Ladies and Gentlemen, you will now be fully aware of the obstacles and frustrations Chandika has had to endure and overcome in his career.
Given this fervent appeal from a very successful and highly educated national captain, tendered on behalf of the entire national squad, the refusal of the Authorities to review that decision defies logic or reason.
That is further compounded by the fact that there were I believe mitigating circumstances attached to Chandika's actions that precipitated the inquiry.
While wishing you, Shivika and the children all that is best down under, I am sure that those genuinely interested in the welfare of the game will hope that your invaluable services will not be Australia's gain and that in the not too distant future, you will be reinstated in your rightful position with the national team. Meanwhile your termination Chandika could well go down in the annals of history as a cricketing tragedy as it is inconceivable that a responsible controlling body of national cricket could turn its back on such expertise particularly when it comes from one of our very own Sri Lankans."
God bless you and your family.
