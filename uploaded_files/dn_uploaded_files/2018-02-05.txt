Australias MyBudget selects SL as its technology innovation destination
MyBudget Pty Ltd, Australias largest and most trusted firm for providing personal budget management services has announced that it will be officially entering Sri Lanka and expanding its operations in November 2018.
The company will set up an offshore development centre subsequently, where a team of Sri Lankan Software professionals will contribute to MyBudgets expanded platform from the Colombo-based technology development center.
Recognized as Australias leader in personal budgeting services, MyBudget was founded by Tammy Barton in 1999 at her residence in Adelaide. Tammy has grown her firm into a national company today with over 250 employees and 15 offices across Australia, covering major business cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Gold Coast.
MyBudget manages more than AUD 1 billion and processes more than 5 million transactions every year, on behalf of over 50,000 customers.
The initial considerations to enter Sri Lanka came into light in 2017 May, when Tammy met IronOne Technologies and BoardPAC Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Lakmini Wijesundera, in Mumbai when attending the prestigious Ernst and Young (EY) Entrepreneurial Winning Women (EWW) Asia-Pacific program 2017. Both of them were chosen for this initiative as top woman entrepreneurs from their respective countries.
Expressing her views on MyBudgets latest venture, Tammy Barton Founder and Director of MyBudget said, After speaking with Lakmini in India, I was able to learn a lot about Sri Lankas ICT industry and the skill levels of local software engineers. That fascinated me greatly to come here and set up a development centre in Colombo  an extended wing of MyBudget. We have been able to find a company who will support us to start our operations and we are looking forward to expanding the staff and our services exponentially in the next three to five years.
Anoji de Silva Partner of EY added EY started the EWW program in 2007, with Asia Pacific region joining this global program in 2015. Sri Lanka joined the program in 2017 with Lakmini Wijesundera as the first EWW from Sri Lanka. EY EWW is a year-long executive leadership program that identifies a select group of high-potential women entrepreneurs with established businesses who are ready to scale operations and grow to become global market leaders and help them achieve their goals.
The MyBudget senior management team visited Sri Lanka to plan the software development centre. The Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) facilitated to identify a local software services company to assist MyBudgets software technology roadmap in Sri Lanka.
Since 1999, MyBudget has been a committed force in Australia in assisting people to live the desired life they seek by freeing them from many uncertainties related to their financials. We have helped more than 65,000 customers to get on the path of financial success. With this set up in Sri Lanka, we have kick started our journey in taking and popularizing MyBudget in global markets. I am so excited about this opportunity to grow MyBudgets journey away from my home country in Sri Lanka, Tammy Barton added further.

The Baby, the Book, and the Bathwater
Around halfway through writing my novel, I read a book that nearly derailed me. As any writer knows, reading while writing is always a risky pursuit. Cadences are easily stolen; we find ourselves singing a lullaby we dont remember being sung to us. But theres something worse than a book that turns us into magpies and mimics: one that squelches our very desire to write.
The book that had this censoring effect on me was called, both innocuously and officially, The Baby Book. It was the first book I read after giving birth for the first time, as sleep-deprived and receptive as any cult joiner.
Beyond birth
I had not read about baby care during my first pregnancy, which ended after eleven weeks, or during the second. Due to an autoimmune illness that could compromise my ability to carry a baby to term, as well as my familys Judeo-magical thinking that links stillbirths to positive thoughts, I refused to imagine anything beyond the birth. But once my own child emerged, gorgeous and awake, a heart beating beneath her thin skin, I was at a loss. I turned to the book all my friends recommended.
Two inches thick, with four naked babies of varying skin tones on the cover, along with the brag MORE THAN 1,000,000 COPIES SOLD, The Baby Book, written by Dr. William Sears and his wife, Martha, a nurse, claims to be the baby bible of the postDr. Spock Generation. And indeed, it offers indispensable advice about every aspect of baby care. Yet I quickly came to fear this book. Although it was pretty much the only book I read at the time, I felt anxious whenever I read it. Even now, ten years later, I still hate being in the same room as this book.
Its not simply a baby manual. Alongside their medical advice, and with the same tone of clinical proficiency and authority, the Searses promote a parenting philosophy they learned from Jean Liedloff. Liedloff was a Cornell dropout who, in the mid-twentieth century, took a diamond-mining trip to Venezuela. She noticed a calm happiness to the offspring of the Yecuana tribe, whom she called, with romantic condescension, Stone Age Indians. She lived with the tribe for two years and wrote a book describing the way their babies were integrated into daily life. After reading her book, William and Martha Sears welded some potentially practical tools for baby carebabywearing, bed sharing, breastfeedinginto a larger theory of an infants need for constant maternal attention as a corrective to disconnected modernity.
Sedentary work
The best way to describe this theory, which they named Attachment Parenting, is as a fable or horror story. There are only two characters in this storythe mother, whom well call Mama, and Baby. The plot is this: Mama gives birth to Baby, and she must not put her down. She must not leave her. She must be with her at all times, if possible, awake or asleep. She cannot do sedentary work or even read for pleasure because Baby prefers movementalthough Mama can, while Baby is strapped to her, perform housework. Only in situations of dire financial need and with great trepidation may she pass off Baby to a caregiver. She must not nourish Baby with a bottle, which, like cribs, strollers, and jobs, will interrupt her bond with Baby and thus diminish Babys prospects for any happiness.
I know several women who easily ignored the grim warnings, who used The Baby Book purely as medical reference. Not me. In those dark winter weeks after giving birth, I became increasingly gripped by the storys central conflict: Mamas desires are dangerous; Baby is vulnerable. Dr. Sears believes that the selfishness of the motherher wish for a defined, separate selfis a symptom of poor attachment, insufficient bonding. Give yourself over to his methods, he insists, and you feel right when you are with your baby, not right when apart. Martha, whose role in the book is to back up his theory with her praxis, adds, I miss my baby if shes been asleep too long in some place other than the sling.
One of the slipperiest moves the Searses make is to demand you eschew parenting experts and trust your instincts and then, often in the next paragraph, to offer expert proofof the studies say varietythat their method works.
Who performed these studies
How large was their sample
Where were they reviewed
Dr. Sears doesnt say.
But he does tell us that these studies suggest that the attachment-parented child is more trusting, competent, sensitive, and empathic; shes better organized, smarter, healthier, easier to discipline, and more bonded to people than to things; she grows better, feels right, acts right, learns language more easily, establishes healthy independence, and learns to give and receive love. Can you read this list without wishing these attributes for your own children
Bleak eventuality
The inverse is never mentioned, but I could see it hovering over the page. If x equals y, then not x equals not y. If you put your child on the floor to play or in a crib to sleep or in a stroller to walk or with a caregiver, she will forever feel wrong, act wrong. She will tantrum, lie, rob; become dumb, sick, selfish, insensitive; bond to things (drugs phones) instead of people; suffer anhedonia or anomie or a horrifying loneliness.
Against this bleak eventuality, how could Mamas time matter
Her sleep
Her sanity
I was vaguely aware of the lack of scientific rigor, but the books power over me was its fictiveness, precisely how well it relied upon imagination and narrative conflict. My baby, whom I barely knew, became Baby, at risk for disconnection and lifelong depression. - Paris Review

Bangladesh force a draw
Bangladeshi cricketer Mominul Haque plays a shot during the fifth and final day of the first cricket Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on February 4, 2018. - AFP
CHITTAGONG: Mominul Haque became the first player from Bangladesh to score a century in both innings of a Test as he steered his side to a draw in the opening match against Sri Lanka on Sunday.
Mominul, who made 176 in the first innings, hit 105 off 174 balls to help Bangladesh reach 307-5 before the two teams accepted the draw with an hour's play left on the fifth and final day in Chittagong.
Skipper Mahmudullah was at the crease on 28 not out alongside Mosaddek Hossain (8 not out) when the stumps were drawn at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Sri Lanka held a 200-run first innings lead after declaring on a mammoth 713-9 in reply to Bangladesh's 513.
The visitors fancied their chances for a victory when veteran spinner Rangana Herath picked up the crucial wicket of Mushfiqur Rahim off the last ball on the fourth day.
But Mominul, 18 not out overnight, and Liton Das, who fell just six runs short of his maiden Test century, shared a crucial 180-run stand for the fourth wicket to frustrate the Sri Lankan bowlers. It was Dhananjaya de Silva who broke their partnership, dismissing Mominul shortly after the left-hander scored his second century of the game with a single off Lakshan Sandakan.
Dimuth Karunaratne took the catch at slip to bring the curtains down on a fine innings, featuring five fours and two sixes.
Man of the match Mominul had nicked a delivery from Herath on 89 but wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella failed to grab a low catch.
Liton also looked confident on the other side but his lavish attempt for a six to complete his century brought his downfall.
Dilruwan Perera ran backward from mid-off to take a fine catch off Herath as Liton departed after hitting 11 fours during his 182-ball stay.
A short ball from Lahiru Kumara struck Mominul on the helmet but he appeared unfazed and scored a single off the next ball, becoming the highest run scorer for Bangladesh in a single Test.
Mominul, who reached 56 with the single, overtook Tamim Iqbal's aggregate of 231 runs against Pakistan in Khulna in 2015. Herath finished with 2-80 for Sri Lanka. The second and final Test will start in Dhaka on February 8. - AFP

In a strange development, rescue centres reveal that most of the abandoned cats they find are black. The black cats are harder to re-home because of their association with witchcraft.
However, according to a story in The Sun, Christine Bayka, 67, founder of The Moggery in Bristol said that it has become harder to re-home them these days because according to people they do not look good in social media posts.
Christine said: Its worse now because black cats dont show up in selfies. Its an increasing problem. Its definitely got harder because of selfies.
Amy Buckle, of the Last Chance Animal Rescue Centre in New Romney, Kent went on to add people do seem caught up in taking photos and putting them on Facebook and Instagram and want a model animal they can put on social media.
Buckle went on to add that it seems black cats get ignored because people find them boring.

Mission of Elections Commission
With the installation of the independent Elections Commission it is satisfying to witness those polls- laws being observed to the letter where the ongoing campaigns of LG election candidates are concerned. We raise our hats to the Chairman of the Commission and his officials for their dedicated efforts supported by the independent election monitors.
However, it is pertinent to state that the real success of an election process finally lies in the valid vote percentage. Historically, unpolled number of votes at our elections has shown the potential to reverse the results. For example, in the last Presidential election in 2015, it was found that the majority obtained by the winner was 449,072 while the number of registered voters who did not cast their vote remained at an astounding 2,780,113!
It is a fact that the unpolled number included lethargic voter community, those employed abroad, other non-residents, patients, disabled and those not holding valid IDs. The irony however is, a substantial number of otherwise- eligible voters were also prevented from voting due to non-registration in the current polls register.
Shouldnt this scenario spur the election officials to find ways and means to make the electorate cast their vote in higher numbers as far as possible In countries like Australia voting at an election is compulsory. In democratic Sri Lanka, they discourage people from voting by showing the Rule book and cast the blame on the voter. Should it be the case
In simple terms, what is required on an election day between 7.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. is to ensure legitimacy of the votes cast by preventing impersonators, foreigners (Non-Citizens) and those citizens below 18 years of age from voting as citizens of Sri Lanka. Simple identification based on appearance, accent, the language spoken and identification by the local polling agents alone will prove that a person is a local or a foreigner. Only if a person is likely to be below 18 years, that the officials should exercise caution by calling for a valid Identity card carrying the date of birth.
In order to fully avoid impersonation, it is necessary to hold any election on one day without holding in installments. It is commendable that the Elections Commission has taken steps to hold local Govt. elections on one day.
Finally, it is necessary to reiterate that the objective is to get more citizens to vote at an election to ensure Democracy.
Thus, theres no gain saying in describing the ultimate mission of the Elections Commission as ensuring maximum polling percentage and minimum rejected poll percentage.

Collective effort to combat corruption
The fight against corruption is the best self defence in a progressive country and nation, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The President addressing the 70th National Independence Day celebrations held at Galle Face in Colombo, said financial discipline should be considered an act of patriotism at a time where corruption has become a major hindrance to a prosperous Sri Lanka.
Despite achievements it has made over the last seven decades, bribery, corruption, fraud and other malpractices have a detrimental impact on economic independence and the future of the country. Thus, all politicians should play a dedicated and exemplary role to survive,the President emphasised.
The President re-iterated that there was a great need for a national movement against fraud and corruption.
This movement, he said, should promote financial discipline among all citizens.
There have been diverse interpretations on patriotism during different eras. At this hour, patriotism means financial discipline, the President added.
He also observed that financial discipline, honesty and integrity should be promoted with a top to bottom approach, where not only those at grassroots level are expected to uphold these qualities.
The President also requested politicians, heads of government departments and all public servants to act with discipline as a part of the national movement against corruption.
The President also pointed out that public opinion against corruption should be promoted and strengthened which will ultimately contribute to the progress of the country.President Sirisena also pointed out that there is a requirement of a national movement against corruption in order to establish a clean political culture and such a collective effort should be backed with the participation of the countrys intellectual community.
He observed that there should be a collective effort for a corruption free country.
The President also pointed out that there have been severe repercussions caused by several previous political leaders by implementing personal agendas in countrys development policy. Thus, the President emphasised the importance of correctly identifying the economic and development goals that will fulfill the aspirations of all Sri Lankans.
The President also paid tribute to the members of Security Forces who made immense sacrifices to defeat the LTTE terrorists.
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Civil Defence Services personnel made the supreme sacrifice on behalf of the future generations in protecting the countrys unity, territorial integrity and soverignty, he said.
President Sirisena pointed out the need for communal harmony among the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and other communities to build the nation.
Pointing out the right of the people to live as equal citizens, the President said fullest commitment and support of every section is essential to achieve true reconciliation. President Sirisena also observed that poverty is another main challenge for Sri Lanka to overcome. He said that several governments over the years had implemented a number of poverty alleviation programmes.
The President observed that these programmes should be made more developed and made more efficient in order to reap better results which would help the country overcome many challenges.
President Sirisena also pointed out that Sri Lanka should not lose its cultural heritage at the expense of digital and technological advancements.
The President said the country should advance while preserving its history and heritage and both public and private sectors have a major say in the matter. Speaking of the dynamics of true freedom, the President said that freedom of animals and natural habitats are equally important just as much as the freedom of humans. He also said that such eco-friendly approach should be promoted and taught from school level itself.

Condolence Messages
Catholic Church mourns the loss of a virtuous disciple of the Buddha
His Eminence Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, in a condolence message expressed his heartfelt sympathies on the passing away of Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera.
In his message, he expressed his sadness at the demise of the Thera.The message adds:
I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Ven.Wimalarathana Thera, who is a learned and virtuous true disciple of Buddha, many years ago. I have had the honour of working together with the late Thera for inter-religious reconciliation and as a close friend, I was witness to his great qualities which has also guided me during my lifetime.
He was a great example to the Buddhist society and clergy while his love for this nation and his service to it should be greatly admired.
While his demise is an immeasurable loss, on behalf of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to our fellow Buddhist brothers and sisters at this time of mourning.
We wish that Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera attains the supreme bliss of Nibbana he wished for.
Standard-bearer of inter-religious harmony
An intense sense of grief strikes me as I take a few moments from my hectic election campaign to reflect upon the passing away of the preeminent, most erudite Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya. I have all along been an ardent admirer of the Maha Thera for his singularly commendable and brave viewpoints and for his formidable preaching and writing as a missionary and educator.
Above all, I always knew him as a principle standard-bearer of the council of inter-religious harmony in Sri Lanka and had the honour and privilege to be a co-speaker at the High-Level Summit of Buddhist and Muslims Leaders in Yogyakarta and Borobudur, Indonesia, recently and in many other forums with him. We spoke at length about how, we as followers of different belief systems were respectively secure and comfortable in our Buddhism and Islam, intrinsic to our Sri Lankan patriotism. It was important for him that we nurture this exquisiteness in our country.
It was not long ago that we were grappling with loss of peace and ethnic and inter-religious tension. Wherever and whenever needed, Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera steadfastly stood his ground to help diminish any chance of perpetually recurring ethnic enmity and tension. In his passing away, as a Muslim political leader, I cannot for a moment doubt, under any circumstance, what would have been the course of this country and what our future holds if we failed to have erudite monks of responsibility such as the Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera. In his work and service are deeply laid the seeds of future welfare, not merely to the Buddhists but also to those of all faiths in this country.
Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera in the true sense of a Buddhist priest, understood the universe, spoke and lived in the most civilized manner, a life with righteous intentions for the larger goodness of humanity. I deem, in his passing away, as his supporters, we have collectively increased our responsibility as a nation to work towards inter-religious amity.

Diabetes -the silent killer
Consultant Clinical and Interventional Cardiologist, Dr. Mohan Jayatilake (MD, MRCP) speaks to Daily News about diabetes and heart health this week.
Q - What is the impact of Diabetes on the heart
A - Brief introduction about diabetes is essential to know about its cardiac complications. Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Insulin hormone in the body helps to control blood sugar level. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin, which is commonly seen in children, teens and young adults. In type 2 diabetes the more common type in adulthood, body does not use insulin well (insulin resistance). Over the time, diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control heart and blood vessels. Therefore cholesterol deposits in coronary arteries in the heart (Atherosclerosis) may lead to heart attacks. Same mechanism in brain (Cerebral) arteries can lead to strokes.
In adults with diabetes, most common causes of death is heart attacks and strokes. Heart attack is 3-5 times more common with diabetes and is the leading cause of death in type 2 diabetes. Another relatively common complication is enlarged heart with poor heart function (heart failure) due to cardiac muscle involvement in type 2 diabetes known as Congestive Cardiomyopathy.
Dr. Mohan Jayatilake
Absolute risk of cardiac disease is lower in type 1 diabetes. Increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure in type 2 diabetes is due to combination of hyperlipidemia. (High cholesterol and high triglycerides), smoking, high blood pressure, obesity and belly fat around the waist, lack of exercises and family history of heart diseases.
Pre-menopausal women who normally have lower rates of coronary artery disease due to estrogen hormone lose this protection once diabetes develops.
Q  What are the symptoms of diabetes and what is the most vulnerable age group
A- Diabetes is commonly genetically determined and run in the family members. Therefore diabetes may be diagnosed in the young and adults for the first time with the symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, increase urination, blurred vision, unusual weight loss. However cardiac symptoms due to coronary artery clogging with cholesterol deposits and thrombosis might take a long time. For some people when the first heart attack occurs it shows a very high sugar level for the first time. Therefore, there is no time period or age limit for the diabetes symptoms to develop.
Heart diseases can be minimized by optimal blood sugar control. Diabetes is commonly associated with other risk factors for heart diseases, such as high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol levels, high triglycerides in blood, obesity and family history of heart diseases.
Prevention and treatment of these risk factors especially lowering LDL cholesterol level than 100mg per dl. (2.6 mmol/L) will be beneficial for the diabetic patient to lower the incidents of heart diseases. Reducing the blood pressure to 130/80 will further reduce the cardiac events in diabetes.
Q - What are the medical tests that should be done by a diabetes patient to make sure that he/she is not suffering from any heart diseases/complication
1. Blood sugar estimation
- Diabetes should be under strict control with frequent random blood sugar level estimations. Preferably monitoring at home with glucometer is advised. For majority of healthy people normal blood sugar levels are as follows,
Between 72- 108 mg /dl (4-6 mmol / L) when fasting. Up to 140 mg / dl (7-8 mmol/L) 2 hours after meals.
High blood sugar levels consistently above 240mg /dl can be more dangerous, and can lead tosemi-conscious state, coma or death.
2. Cholesterol estimation in blood
- (Lipid profile) at least every six months. Preferably LDL cholesterol levels (Bad cholesterol) should be less than 100mg/dl, HDL cholesterol (Good cholesterol) should be more than 40mg/dl and triglyceride should be less than 150mg/dl to minimize heart disease in diabetic patients.
3. HbA1c blood levels
This refers to glycated hemoglobin. By measuring this, one can get overall picture of average blood sugar levels over a period of 3 months. The higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes related heart diseases and other complications. Target HbA1c for diabetes is 6.5 per cent (48mmol/mol).
Research has shown that people with type 2 diabetes who reduced their HbA1c level by 1 per cent are 16 per cent less likely to suffer from heart diseases.
4. Echocardiogram
This test is an ultra sound scan of heart. It gives an image of heart and functioning capacity of heart as ejection fraction (EF). In heart failure heart is enlarged and EF is significantly reduced below 50 per cent. This is medically treatable condition for long time survival of patient. If abnormality is detected, annual echo cardiogram test is recommended.
5. Resting ECG
Resting ECG should be done in every diabetic patient. This may be normal in majority of patients even with heart disease. ECG may be abnormal in silent heart attacks and heart failures when having diabetes.
6. Exercise ECG (Treadmill stress test)
If resting ECG does not show acute changes of heart attacks exercise ECG is recommended. The exercise ECG test reveals whether it is negative (good) or positive (bad). If it is negative coronary artery disease is unlikely. If it is positive with ECG changes and symptoms of angina, coronary artery disease is very likely. If stress test is negative in a diabetic patient, every two years stress test is recommended or whenever he gets angina symptoms stress test need to be done.
7. Coronary Angiogram
Coronary angiogram is the next step of diagnosis if stress test becomes positive. This is a test which gives dye (contrast) through an artery in the arm or the leg to coronary arteries to detect the blockages if any. If so, balloon angioplasty with stent implantation or bypass surgery is recommended.
If angiogram is normal, patient is diagnosed to be having normal coronary arteries. This is not a screening test for diabetes patients who do not have cardiac symptoms. But some people prefer to have CT coronary angiogram as a screening test to evaluate coronary arteries.
8. Other tests
a) High sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP) levels will be useful to determine risk of coronary artery diseases.
b) High Level of calcium score estimated with CT angiogram will also be useful to determine risk of coronary artery diseases.
Q - Are there any precautions or concerns when a diabetes patient has to undergo a heart surgery
A - Management of blood glucose levels in the pre-operative setting is important in diabetic patients. That will reduce morbidity and mortality and improve surgical outcomes especially coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement surgery, heart transplantation and implantation of ventricular assist devices in heart failure patients where heart surgeries are concerned. For all those blood glucose control is essential pre-operatively and post-operatively to avoid further complications. Surgical wound healing is also impaired when blood sugar levels are not very controlled. Usually insulin administration is performed in all these situations.
Q  What is a ` silent heart attack
A- Heart attacks do not always have obvious symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness and cold sweats. In fact Heart attacks can happen without a person knowing it. It is called silent heart attacks.
Some people present with fatigue and problems related to heart a few weeks back may have non specific or subtle symptoms such as indigestion or a case of flu.
This is usually seen in long standing diabetic patients or very elderly people. In this situation also blood flow is blocked in a coronary artery by cholesterol plaques. Risk factors are also the same.
Silent heart attacks are more common in women than in men. Silent heart attacks can be just as dangerous as its more obvious counterpart because it causes damage to heart muscles as patient did not know to seek treatment and no medication was taken, so the impact could potentially be greater.
Treatment is as same as, painful heart attacks, just to establish blood flow to the damaged muscle after doing an angiogram even though diagnosis was too late. However heart failure is the common result of this category as treatment is not given at the correct time.
To prevent silent heart attacks
Be aware of your risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, regular exercise and avoid smoking to decrease the risk of heart attacks.
Silent heart attacks can even cause sudden death in some individuals.
Regular consultation of your doctor with cardiac screening, correct diagnosis in time, and strict control of diabetes over the time with risk factor reductions and proper treatment of heart diseases will certainly prevent or reduce the incidents of silent heart attacks.

Duty reduction on electric  vehicles, a farce - VIAL
The duty reduction on electric vehicles in the last budget has not had any effect and up to now not a single high quality electric vehicle has been imported to the country, said Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL) President Sampath Merenchige.
He said that this is because vehicle importers cannot afford the high price. The duty reduction was first introduced only on brand new electric cars. Upon our request to extent that duty reduction on used electric vehicles the government amended the proposals to cover electric vehicle used up to one year. But this limit is not practical at all,he said.
We are now preparing after six months to gather all data with regard to electric vehicles imported to the country and convince the government that the budget proposals on electric vehicles has not been practical,Merenchige said.
The 2018 Budget proposal to increase the leasing facility for electric and hybrid vehicles (Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) for hybrid vehicle financing from 50% to 70% and up to 90% for electric vehicles) too has had no impact yet. Because even though two months has lapsed since the presentation of the budget that concession has not been enforced yet.
The reason for that is it has not been implemented from one place. The revised leasing facility only takes affect once it is notified to the Central Bank from the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank notifying the relevant financial institutions. The red tape and inefficiencies associated with those entities has delayed it.
Merenchige also said that its a fact that people postponed their dream of purchasing a vehicle until the Budget was presented but today due to the extreme competition in the market, customers alleged that that many frauds take place at the point of sale of vehicles.
In general today there has not been a substantial change in vehicle sales to what it was in the past. But the pattern in vehicle sales has clearly changed with customers opting for vehicles of high quality imported from Japan.
Of course with tariff changes affected in the budget, the demand for vehicles such as the Wagon R which is under the 1,000 cc engine capacity has increased substantially.Similarly, the monopoly enjoyed by one company to import vehicles under the CC 1,000 engine capacity has now got disseminated among several vehicles trading organizations Island wide which is a very good trend. However the sales of over 1,500 cc hybrid vehicle which prices remain to be high has saw a steep decline, Merenchige pointed out.
He said that today customers pay huge amounts to buy a vehicle and there are instances that they get cheated and their organization has been informed about such instances.
As a result of activities of a few fraudsters even honest traders face tremendous embarrassment, he said.
What could be frequently noticed these days is how popular vehicles such as the Wagon R are being advertised in websites and newspapers for low prices very much less than the market price.
This propaganda is carried out purposely by these fraudsters with sinister motives.
It must be understood that no established authentic motor trader will be prepared to sell their vehicles below the market price and incur losses.
What actually happens is, these crooks in the guise of genuine traders sell a few vehicles incurring a loss at first. After winning the confidence of the customers they then collect advances from a group of people with the promise of importing vehicles for these low prices and subsequently fled with the monies collected.
Some others import the vehicles on low promised price and when vehicles arrive at the harbour these scurrilous cheaters lament lame excuses and demand additional sums from the customer which ultimately results in having to pay a price in excess to the market value of the vehicle.
In addition due to the intervention of so called vehicle brokers and their deceitful activities both the customers as well as genuine vehicle traders have to face very embarrassing situations.
The Vehicles Importers Association intervened and has now worked out a scheme to overcome such fraudulent activities, firstly as a service to customer and also to iron out the embarrassment genuine vehicle importers undergo due to roguish activities.
We are going to launch a program wherein customers will be able to identify us. We will display a board at every showroom of members of our association indicating our symbol and membership number.
With this customers will be able to ascertain that the trader is genuine vehicle dealer and member of the VIAL. With this guarantee customers can without any hesitation go about their business.
As the first phase of the project we have issued display boards to the first 25 members who applied for it and on the demand the other members too will get the display board.
Even from showrooms with no display board customers can still check the credentials of the vendor to ascertain whether they are a member of VIAL before going into business. (MFJ)

Female labour force on the rise
By the third quarter of 2017, the estimated economically active population in the country was 8.52 million, the Quarterly Report of Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics released recently stated. Out of this 63.1 percent are males and 36.9 percent are females.
The economically active population is defined as the number of persons aged 15 and above, who are employed or unemployed during the reference week. The report also states that the economically inactive population is 7.37 million.
Further, the Report states that labour force participation by the third quarter of 2017 in the country was 53.6. Of this, the male labour force participation rate is 73.6, while female labour force participation rate is 36.6, indicating 37-point differences between male to female participation rates.
However, compared with a female labour force participation rate of 32.9 in 2012, there is a gradual increase over the years, although male participation in labour has always been higher than that of females.
Labour force participation rate is the labour force population expressed as a percentage of the population aged 15 years and over.
Director General of Census and Statistics, Dr A.J. Satharasinghe said field work for the third quarter survey was conducted from July to September last year and it covered the entire country.
Nationally representative annual samples of about 25,750 housing units were selected for the survey in 2017.
This report is based on a quarterly sample of 6,440 housing units, he said.

Fitch assigns Lankaputhra first-time BBB-(lka)  rating; outlook positive
Fitch Ratings has assigned Lankaputhra Development Bank Limited (LDB) a National Long-Term Rating of BBB-(lka). The outlook is positive.
LDBs National Long-Term Rating reflects Fitchs expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the Sri Lankan sovereign, if required.
Fitch believes the sovereigns propensity to extend support to the bank stems from the states 100% direct holding and LDBs development banking role in supporting the states initiatives for micro, small and medium-scale industries.
However, Fitch sees the potential for state support for LDB as being much lower than for the countrys larger state-owned banks.
The sovereigns ability to provide support is reflected in Sri Lankas B+/Stable rating. The positive outlook on LDBs rating reflects our expectation that sovereign support is likely to increase if the banks operations were combined with those of a larger entity, thereby becoming of greater systemic importance.
Fitch believes smaller state banks such as LDB could be part of the governments broader consolidation agenda amid enhanced minimum capital requirements.
LDB is one of the smallest banks in Sri Lanka with a market share of less than 0.1% of the banking sectors total assets, loans and deposits as of end-September 2017. It has eight branches across seven provinces and mainly relies on non-deposit funding.
LDB was established in 2006 as a licensed specialised bank and had assets of Rs 9.2 billion at end-September 2017.

Fixing the unfixable
The forthcoming local elections are so important. The UNPs presence at the local level following these elections will determine the future of our economy.
Following the passage of the 19th Amendment and the establishment of the Independent Election Commission, we are witnessing a peaceful election free from money power, posters and violence. The amendments to the Local Authorities Election Law proposed by the UNP will be giving, for the first time, women power to deliver for their local area with record levels of female representation. It will also now be possible for everyone to vote for their local representative directly with the new wards system.

We must ensure that everyone who votes in this election can do so peacefully, with a clear mind on their future. Whether it be a father thinking about an improved local road or a mother safe in the knowledge she can provide clean drinking water for her children or a young person enjoying recreational facilities. The UNP want to build up the people of Sri Lanka to reach their full potential.
The UNP in national government is focused on building up the national economy. We have delivered on attracting new investments, creating jobs, more housing progress and building public infrastructure. But there is still more to be done.
This progress has to be brought to the villages and the towns to improve the economic and social standards of all Sri Lankans, more money for local government and a stronger local village economy.
A strong UNP presence in local government means a stronger UNP in national government and a stronger national economy. Voting for the UNP locally guarantees a good deal from the national government for your area. Your local issues can only be fixed if we have a strong national economy. Otherwise there will be no money to do anything.
A strong economy is able to fund activities at a local government level to build better local roads, provide safer drinking water, clean-up our streets, prevent dengue and make local transport more reliable.
At this election, you have a choice. By voting for your carefully selected, educated and honest local UNP candidate, you can guarantee the best deal from national government for your area.
The UNP has demonstrated our ability to deliver for people across the country at a national level. Now we must lift up local communities directly through local government.
Victory at these elections will enable the UNP to build on the progress made since 2015 and means sticking with our plan to build a stronger economy and help us secure an outright victory in the next general election.
So be sure that this election will be close and every vote will count.
Voting for another party or not voting at all - which is effectively the same thing - risks getting a bad deal from national government for your local area and missing out on future development that will make the lives of you and your family better.
Only the UNP has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future. And only voting UNP will deliver funds for your area.

Give a home to an adult dog or cat
Every day the AWPA receives calls to admit adult animals to their shelters. Some people feel their pet will be happiest in a shelter and of courseit is also the easiest way out of their problem. They don't try to find it another home by advertising or some other social media. Dogs and cats brought up in a home will never be happy in a shelter. They will only be secure and receive food. They will just be one of the other dogs/cats at the shelter.
They won't be showered with love and attention they received before. We find it very sad when it is an old and aged animal that has lived in a home and received a lot of love and care. The reasons are many - some trivial (daughter-in-law doesn't like dogs) but some are genuine - moving to an apartment or due to old age and ill-health themselves, they are unable to care for their pet.
The AWPA is looking for foster homes for many adult dogs and cats. You may be unable to take a puppy and make a 15 year commitment but you may be someone who could take in an adult dog/cat with a shorter life span. Please call Iromi on 077 6565181 if you can provide a home and be blessed.

Halfpenny stars as dominant Wales thrash Scotland
CARDIFF, Saturday - Leigh Halfpenny scored two tries as Wales opened their Six Nations campaign with a dominant 34-7 victory against much-fancied Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday.
In an entertaining start to the tournament, Wales banished memories of their defeat to Scotland in last years fixture with a commanding victory courtesy of tries from Gareth Davies and Steff Evans and Halfpennys double.
The experienced fullback added 14 points from the boot for a personal tally of 24.
Scotland had not won in Cardiff since 2002 but arrived in the Welsh capital buoyed up by a superb spell in November that saw them thump Australia and fall agonisingly short of a famous victory against the world champion All Blacks. Wales, however -- without six British & Irish Lions stars -- started in inspired fashion at a fervent Principality Stadium with Davies intercepting a pass from opposite number Ali Price to canter over from 60 metres.
The visitors barely had time to settle in a breathless opening 15 minutes before Halfpenny dived over for his first Wales try since 2013 -- 38 games ago. Scotland, one of the most dynamic and unpredictable attacking sides, were guilty of overplaying at times and found it difficult to build cohesion or put pressure on the Welsh defence. - Agencies

High-flier aces soar on wings of social graces
You may have graduated with the highest honours from some grove of academe but when at large in society and the corporate world your lack of polished accomplishment stands out like a sore thumb. An impressive university degree may come in handy as a door opener for any young executive seeking upward mobility.
Yet academic qualifications are not everything. Large firms mostly seek to hire some of the smartest, most capable people. But intelligence and qualifications are not the only attributes that will ensure your success as a top candidate in the corporate world. All high-fliers must possess far more than basic academic and technical knowledge learned at the groves of academe. Everyone knows that sophisticated corporate leaders are individuals who are aware of the importance of social graces and cultural refinement in their everyday dealings.
They have cultivated and developed the value of social etiquette in every sphere of society and are self-assured of making a great impression wherever they are and whatever they do.
Unfortunately the finer and grosser points of protocol are not part of the curriculum in institutions of learning anywhere. Surprising really, when one comes to think about it. Because to obtain a degree a student has to display fairly acceptable social skills while being helped in research by a lecturer.
Social graces are skills used to interact politely in societal situations. They include manners, etiquette - the specific accepted rules within a culture for the application of universal manners - deportment and fashion. These skills were once taught to young women at a finishing school or charm school.
So why dont schools and universities teach social etiquette and social skills It is apparent that most secondary education and university curriculum are book courses.
Yet, when students graduate, they may be armed and their minds honed with the particular learning disciplines essential for a career. But in any corporate environment what would really matter is how they present themselves and display their social skills.
Yes certainly the older generation was brought up under a much stricter regime. Many administrators are concerned that standards of behaviour in todays generation have slipped below acceptable limits. Everyone should be armed with a code of behaviour and a positive attitude about manners and respect for others. In brief, we all should know about etiquette.
Consider how life would look up for most people if primary and secondary school provided that vanished code of conduct in a disciplined and systematic fashion, by an adult other than a parent and with the use of a textbook to give the code weight and authority. The bitter truth is that we have to make up as best we can for this lack of social refinement.
Never forget that as an executive or a budding managerial prospect you serve as a representative of the company, so it is important they follow proper business etiquette standards. Executives often participate in social events, run company meetings, conduct interviews and work with customers. In each of these settings, the executive must display proper etiquette so that participants take away with them a good impression of the company.
All etiquette demands that you hold yourself answerable for your actions. Whether you action meets with success or failure taking responsibility for it is an expected norm in corporate culture. Accepting responsibility requires graciousness on your part.
Being gracious does not mean pointing fingers at your colleagues or subordinates when plans go awry. Neither does it mean you should crow like a cockerel at daybreak in an effort to draw attention when you feel you have achieved outstanding success. Graciousness considers your response to others.
When things go wrong a good executive will graciously take responsibility by admitting he was wrong and then trying to minimise the damage. There should be no recriminations and no playing the blame game. Make sure you plug the weak points and move on. When your brainchild meets with success you again display grace by attempting to improve on it, and move forward.
Accountability is also a key component to your successful business etiquette inventory. To be accountable is more than being just responsible. You need to have the confidence to put your plans into action without dithering. You may need to go even above and beyond the call of duty.
Business relationships are developed in a variety of settings including lunches, receptions, dinners and fundraisers. The big question is whether you as an executive have the basic social tools so as to avoid falling flat on your face by creating some horrendous faux pas.
It is still deemed courteous in corporate circles to rise from your seat when a senior executive or dignitary or a woman, of any rank, enters a room. In keeping with tradition, most professionals make movements as if they are preparing to stand-up. This permits the official an opening to wave-them-down with a quick hand motion.
When meeting a peer it is critical that you follow proper professional protocol. Wait until they have offered their hand before thrusting your palm in similarity to pointing a gun at him. When shaking hands, you should always use a firm grip. But never squeeze or hold on longer than necessary particularly if it is a dainty feminine hand. Look the person directly in the eye when greeting them.
Similarly when meeting a celebrity or someone of celebrity status you should never offer your hand first and place them in an awkward situation. One of the biggest areas of breaches of professional etiquette is during dining situations, and many major corporations will test job candidates with a meal as an integral part of the job interview. Dining skills have suffered as much as business dress in the past few years. Too much business is conducted over meals to let table manners go by the way side.
In sum, professional manners and etiquette are mostly common-sense, but you must always be conscious that your mannerisms reflect on your personal professionalism and your organisation. Dining skills have suffered as much as business dress in the past few years. Too much business is conducted over meals to let table manners go by the way side.
Your measure of etiquette should be as important when interacting with co-workers and colleagues as they are when you are dealing with clients. Displaying courtesy and respect to your co-workers has a definite impact on productivity and profitability. No matter what your business entails , excellence in etiquette is vital to the company culture. You will win over potential clients and keep your current ones by meeting them on a path that has been outlined and understood for generations.
Your business will attract and retain the respect and loyalty of those who work with you and for you.

HNB enhances 7-day Banking Customer Centres
Bringing greater convenience to their weekend banking customers, one of Sri Lankas private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC, added Personal Financial Services to their already existing 7-Day Banking Customer Centres.
Customers across 12 townships in Sri Lanka could avail themselves of loans even during weekends, in addition to the usual banking services from these fully-fledged centres.
Such centres will manage all over-the counter banking needs plus provide advisory assistance to customers on HNBs unique financial products including personal and housing loans, leasing and credit cards  at an easier, relaxed, weekend pace.
HNB envisages that the Saturday and Sunday offering will be a boon to their customers, most of whom have very tight work schedules during the week. Such customers who have no time to visit the Bank could now visit the closest 7-day Centre during a weekend to discuss all their banking needs from loans to leasing.
HNBs Deputy General Manager, Retail Banking, Sanjay Wijemanne, speaking on the rationale behind the additional services, said, HNB has taken a pragmatic decision to transform our existing 7-Day banking centres to include value added services, such as Personal Financial Services. Now, customers can meet a dedicated Staffer during the weekend for advice and assistance, collect applications, hand-over documents etc, without being rushed.
The Centres are located in Wellawatte, Rajagiriya, Maharagama, Negombo, Anuradhapura, Kiribathgoda, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Ratnapura, Trincomalee and Jaffna will see a further 40 such customer centres, convert into fully-fledged weekend units. Adding to providing exceptional customer service, HNB will also introduce a door-to-door service for customers who have applied for a personal or housing loan.
A dedicated banking agent will visit the residence or business premises to complete necessary documentation.

Today, the necessity of affordable, modern housing around Sri Lanka has become a radically increasing requirement in the country especially in and around Colombo and its suburbs. However, due to the scarcity of available lands and increasing land price in Colombo, it is highly unlikely that an individual could find and afford a land and build a house on their own.
Hence These housing projects is becoming a better option for those who seek a living space as the cost of buying land in a good residential area and building a house seems higher.
Being one of the developers who has recognized this requirement in the society, Home Lands Skyline, with the launch of these two massive projects aims to provide housing units for upper and middle income earning families and once completed will represent a housing solution that will be inexpensive while not compromising on aesthetics and function.

India complete crushing win
Centurion: Indian captain Virat Kohli said after a crushing win in the second one-day international at SuperSport Park on Sunday that he wanted his match-winning wrist spinners to continue to put pressure on South Africas batsmen.
Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav set up a nine-wicket win which gave India a 2-0 lead in the six-match series.
Leg-spinner Chahal picked up a career-best five for 22 and left-armer Yadav took three for 20 as South Africa were bowled out for 118, the lowest total in one-day internationals at the ground.
"We know that their middle order is inexperienced and we want to cash in on that in the future games and put some real pressure on them," said Kohli.
"The way our spinners are bowling I am pretty confident we can continue (with) the same momentum."
Both Indian spinners extracted a surprising amount of turn on a dry pitch which man of the match Chahal admitted was helpful. "We also play in these conditions in India," he said.
Kohli said it had been a complete bowling performance, with new ball bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah setting the tone.
"They didnt let South Africa get away with scoring too many runs," he said. South Africa made a reasonable start, with Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock putting on 39 for the first wicket before Amla was caught behind off Kumar. De Kock fell to Chahal, one of three batsmen to fall with the total on 51 as the spinners took control.
"We knew if we got those two at the top, their middle order is inexperienced and a bit shaky," said Kohli.
"The spinners were outstanding. They were getting bounce and pace off the wicket, which worked in our favour."
With star players Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers both missing because of injury, it was a chastening introduction to the South African captaincy for Aiden Markram.
The 23-year-old was appointed for the rest of the series after Du Plessis broke his right index finger in the first match in Durban on Thursday.
"We are going to have to be really honest with ourselves," said Markram. "Every person will have to see how we can get better."
India came within two runs of winning before lunch when the umpires stuck to the letter of the regulations and insisted on a break after allowing an extra four overs or 15 minutes to achieve a result. India had been 93 for one at the scheduled interval.
Most of a capacity crowd left the ground before Kohli scored the winning runs.
After South Africas mini collapse with the total on 51, JP Duminy and new cap Khaya Zondo both scored 25 and shared a fifth wicket partnership of 48 before the last six wickets tumbled for 19 runs.
India started aggressively, with Rohit Sharma pulling Morne Morkel for six in the first over of their innings.
Sharma fell for 15, caught by Morkel at fine leg off Kagiso Rabada, but Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli put on an unbeaten 91 for the second wicket to secure an easy win.
Dhawan finished with 51 not out and Kohli made 46 not out. AFP

Influx of UNPers joining SLFP at its height: Duminda
No UNPers need to be found fault with. The influx of United National Party (UNP) supporters crossing over to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to join hands with President Maithripala Sirisena, is at its height, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka. He was addressing a local government election rally held in the Rajangane area in Anuradhapura. He said surely, in 2020, the SLFP would form a single government of its own, with Maithripala Sirisena being the President for the second consecutive term.
Dont be hoodwinked, cheated, distracted or stranded by going after other political parties. Voting for the Pohottuwa or the JVP would be politically suicidal. It would also result in the deprivation of the villages that are to be developed, the SLFP general secretary further said.
Today, the President, who is the head of the SLFP, is endeavouring to eradicate corruption, wastage of public funds, bribery and cheating which has been brought to light by the Presidential Commission inquired into the Central Bank bonds issue. He has proved that irrespective of political differences, relationships or friendships, he would not hesitate to enforce the law against such offenders, he added.
The minister said, This has been a novel experience to the whole nation. The UNPers and JVPers, in thousands, are joining the SLFP to strengthen the Presidents anti-corruption move related to the Central Bank fraud. On the contrary, certain SLFPers are backing up the Pohottuwa party under the illusion that Mahinda Rajapaksa would become the president or prime minister of the country if Pohottuwa gained power. Do not be misguided or fooled; MR is legally barred from contesting at Presidential electionshe could become neither. As such, be an SLFPer again and be wise enough to understand the political hypocrisy of G. L. Peiris Pohottuwa, which is conspiring to break the unity of the SLFP, as wished by Mahinda Rajapaksa who seeks revenge on President Mathirpala Sirisena.
Do not cast your vote to a party like the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP); their only plan is to weaken the longstanding SLFP and sabotage the Good Governance of President Mathripala Sirisena, he said.
He said, Would Pohottuwa be able to from a government Think twice as to why the former President is avoiding the SLFP while being an SLFPer himself. Listen to your conscience and then use your franchise, as it is wasted on them.

INTERPOL detains Udayanga in Dubai: Awaiting deportation
Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga has been taken into custody by law enforcement authorities in the United Arab Emirates yesterday.
A deportation order is expected to facilitate his removal to Sri Lanka, according to several police and diplomatic sources with knowledge of the events.
Weeratunga was detained as he tried to board a flight from Dubai International Airport bound for Los Angeles, where he was expected to meet with his cousin, former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Both Rajapaksa and Udayanga are suspects in the investigation conducted by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) into the 2006 purchase and overhaul of MiG fighter aircraft to the Sri Lanka Air Force.
According to court documents, Ukrainian citizen Dmytro Peregudov was brought to Sri Lanka in February 2006 by Weeratunga, who was then a private citizen, for a meeting with his cousin, the newly-appointed defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the Defence Ministry. Following the meeting, which was documented in direct correspondence between Rajapaksa and Peregudov, the Air Force entered into a contract valued at US$ 14.7 million, purportedly with the Government of Ukraine, for the purchase and overhaul of MiG aircraft.
The FCID investigation had revealed that Ukrainian authorities have asserted that the contract signed by Sri Lanka was forged, and that they received less than half of the US $14.7 million paid by the Air Force, with the remainder having been siphoned away through a shell company, Bellimissa Holdings, linked to business associates of Udayanga Weeratunga. Weeratunga was also directly involved in negotiating the contract between the Ukrainian suspect and the Air Force. He was present when the contract was signed in Moscow.
When the deal was exposed in 2007 by the Editor of The Sunday Leader, Lasantha Wickrematunge, Rajapaksa publicly defended the MiG deal on television appearances, and sued Wickrematunge for defamation.
Wickrematunge was killed just days before he was due to testify in the defamation case. According to a confidante of the slain editor, he intended to reveal his evidence against Rajapaksa in open court.That same evidence is now in the hands of the FCID and has assisted them in their investigation.
The FCID in 2016 named Weeratunga a suspect in the case, and the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court has issued a warrant for Weeratunga on charges of cheating and forgery for the purpose of cheating read as offences against public property. The court also ordered his passport impounded. The FCID thereafter assembled a task force comprising assistance from the Foreign Ministry, Attorney Generals department, the Defence Ministry and the Criminal Investigation Department to locate Weeratunga and remove him to Sri Lanka.
INTERPOL assistance was sought to locate Weeratunga in Dubai and he was thereafter placed under surveillance. When the police learnt of his plans to travel to visit Rajapaksa in Los Angeles, action was taken to alert Dubai authorities that his passport was invalidated for travel, allowing the Dubai Criminal Investigation Department to take him into custody when he tried to clear emigration at the airport.
Weeratunga is expected to be returned to Sri Lanka within the coming week. Meanwhile according to law enforcement officials, the FCID is also awaiting the arrival in Sri Lanka of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who is wanted for further investigations. The FCID has learned that Rajapaksa, who left Sri Lanka in December on an American passport, is due to return to Colombo on an Emirates flight on Monday, February 12, after the local government elections are concluded.

A workshop on Value Added Tax (VAT) organized by KPMG was held on the 16th of January 2018 at the Movenpick Hotel. A detailed presentation was carried out by Ms Hasna Hassan, Director  Tax & Regulatory. The workshop covered the fundamental VAT principles including how to recognize the value and time of supply, the appellate procedure and other intricacies of VAT.
Hasna Hassan clarified issues pertaining to valuation of land and real estate issues raised by the audience.
In her presentation she covered the VAT specific rules applicable to the whole sale and retail industry including the calculation of turnover thresholds for registration. She also clarified queries raised in relation to the time of supply applicable for advance payments by customers in the context of hotels and condominium property owners.
VAT is the main indirect tax in Sri Lanka administered by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. VAT gathers the highest percentage of revenue for the Department of Inland Revenue, surpassing the revenue generated from Income Tax.
There is a notion prevalent that VAT rules are complex and burdensome for taxpayers to comply with compared to turnover tax however, the experience in other countries proves that VAT is the most popular tax as over 140 countries have adopted the same.

Lets talk about Anne of Green Gables
As a kid, I loved Anne of Green Gables. I read the entire eight-part series, following Anne-with-an-e and her children all the way to Ingleside.
She talked a bit much for me, but I loved her imagination, courage and intelligence. I also saw a lot of myself in her oddities. Ive quoted her often, swearing that, sure, I sometimes make mistakes, but I never make the same mistake twice.
Then I got a little older, and these things that I related to in Annemy quirksbecame more troublesome and started to truly disrupt my life. For a while it got so bad my mother took me doctor to doctor, swearing there was something wrong with my brain. Like, tumor bad. Finally, we got an explanation, not from a medical doctor but from a psychiatrist: I have ADD-Inattentive Type. It was only then that my own odd tendencies and challenges started to really come into focus.
It wasnt easy. But I was grateful for the label, because it gave me access to a ton of information that helped me understand myselffor example, why I could one day focus for hours on every meticulous detail of a single project, and the next do the wrong homework assignment even though I wrote it down perfectly in my planner.
All of this is a long-winded way to say that, in re-reading the Anne of Green Gables books later in my life, I realized exactly why Anne resonated so strongly for me: We had so many of the same tendencies, both to delight and infuriateand those tendencies are ADD symptoms, one and all.
Daydreaming
Well start with an unwavering Anne classic. No one spins a daydream like Anne. I can relate to this particular callingits one of the reasons writing fiction is such a strong outlet for me. Unfortunately, it tends to call me away on its own schedule, with no regard for what Im supposed to be doing.
Hyperactivity
They used to think that girls did not get hyperactivity. Now we know they just express it differently than the ADHD boy climbing over his chair in the back row. Girls with hyperactivity are often excessively and uncontrollably talkative.
Sound familiar Anne was a girl with no filters. It is her signature charm and her top flaw.
Impulsiveness
This may be the worst of the ADD traits. I cant stand irrational behavior, and yet set off my emotions, and Im going off the rails before I can think. Ive gotten better at feeling these warning signs as I got older, but as a teen, I was a disaster zone.
Anne mostly keeps her cool, toobut once you strike her temper, look out. She can throw a zinger that lands deep, if only because its too true. Just ask Gilbert Blythe.
Charisma
We ADD ladies are a lot of problematic things. But were also charming as hell. Perhaps its because our minds are so active, and were constantly churning through ways to entertain ourselves, which turns to charm and wit when shared. Whatever the reason, Anne had a magnetic personality that could not be resisted, even by Marilla Cuthbert.
Resourcefulness
Look. When weird stuff is always going on around you (okay fine, it was probably caused by you), you learn to McGyver your way through it. Anne is nothing if not resourceful, putting her sharp mind to work to solve whatever problem is in front of her. One of my favorite things about the recent Netflix adaptation was how it emphasized this trait in her.
Bizarre Mistakes
I kept looking for a better word for this trait, but theres no other way to describe it.
I point the raspberry cordial incident. Confuse two little bottles of similar color, and all of a sudden your best friend is drunk and everyones furious. It was perfectly innocent, and when Anne explains herself, almost reasonable. And yet, how exactly did Anne manage that Its just not the type of thing that happens to most peopleit would never happen to sensible Diana, for instance.
Yet I have made real-life equivalents of this incident throughout my life. Even now as an adult, I sometimes find myself tongue-tried trying to explain to my husband some of the bizarre things that go on in my head, and the incidents they cause. - Book Riot

LG polls: little impact on tea estates
Hands in gloves, she selectively plucked the tea leaves. She said her hands hurt when she plucked continuously. Vasantha Rani (48) who has worked as a tea plucker for the last 34 years, said she bought the gloves herself.
She does not believe in any false promises continuously given by the trade unions, estate management or politicians, her dream is to see her children be successful. I only believe in hard work and my ability to make my dreams come true, she said.
The politics of the hill country (Nuwara Eliya especially) is entangled with the lives of estate workers. Votes are gained through promises and the promises made have been the same for the estate workers who have seen very little progress in their day-to-day lives.
With the Local Government Elections coming closer, many around the country have asked that their local bodies be corruption free, have services delivered on time and be in tune with the needs of the people, but in the estate, very few are aware of what their rights or demands should be, having been denied even the most basic facilities for decades.
Denied basic facilities
Sri Lanka in general is not a friendly place for the differently abled but R. Jivajosi (61), who has a differently abled daughter who just turned 27, said her biggest wish was for a toilet for her daughter.
Even I am sick. My son is the breadwinner. The only thing that I need is a toilet. My youngest daughter is differently abled, she said.
She was determined to look after her daughter until her final breath.
Till I die, I will not let anyone look after her. It is very hard to take her to the toilet. She hardly understands anything. I have to carry water buckets to the toilets and the toilet is 150 metres away from my house, she added.
Vasantha Rani in the meantime complained that she received water only two hours a day, one hour in the morning and another hour in the evening.
not reaching estates
Given these issues, it is at the local government that solutions to many of their problems lay, but Jeganathan Yoganathan from Pedro Ward who is contesting in the upcoming elections said many people at times do not realize the importance of local government elections.
He said the number of school dropouts was also on the rise and added that some parents preferred to send their children to work in vegetable plantations rather than school. Yoganathan further observed that there was a new trend prevailing in the estates where youth easily got addicted to drugs. As a consequence, the youth choose to work instead of pursuing education - to buy drugs.
He however emphasized that basic facilities of the people need to be addressed.
These people have health issues, there is no proper hospital or sanitary facilities, no housing facilities and the huge problem is garbage disposal, he said.
But according to Yoganathan, there are legal restrictions which deny access to the local government authorities to fulfill their duties.
The Pradeshiya Sabha Act of 1987 was written to devolve more power to local governments. But estates and, by extension, estate workers were explicitly written out of the law. Even today many estate workers do not have even the most basic level of government accessible to them.
Nuwara Eliya, National Union of Workers (NUW) MP Mylvaganam Thilakarajah has made it his mission to amend Section 33 of the Act but to this day the estate exemption remains in place.
Why are we always deprived of our basic rights asked Suppiah Rajasekaran (68), a teacher from Watagoda in Nuwara Eliya.
Pedro Estate Manager Anura Senanayake in the meantime said that already a large number of the estate workers, especially from the age group between 25-40 years, have started leaving the plantation industry and moving towards urban areas in search of better employment. R. Krishan (27) who currently works in a private firm in Nuwara Eliya said that he was working in Colombo for the past five years and moved to Nuwara Eliya recently. The youth, he said, have no support or future in the estate and there is no one to support them to even run their own vegetable plantations.
There is no bigger difference between the people who live in the estates under the management and the others who own lands. The living standard is the same, he claimed.
First awareness, then rights
Elizabeth Mary (48) is well aware that the elections are coming up soon, but she said that she has not decided whom she would vote for.
She loved talking about tea, but politics, she said, was a subject she was not interested in.
Mary knew of the good qualities of tea but not of the politicians. She further said that she was not aware what changes the upcoming elections would make in their lives.
It has always been the same. I do not know what will happen, she said.
In the meantime, Marys mother Sandana Paapu (73) does not work anymore. She said that she is sick and her daughter takes care of her.
She did know about politics and she was open about whom she was going to vote for in the election.
Although many people did not know the politicians, they were very well aware of the party that they are going to vote for.
The character or the service rendered by the person was not important, the party was more important, they said. In the meantime, Rajasekaran claimed that trade unions were very selfish - they will not let anything good happen for these people. They are leading happy lives by pointing out the difficulties of this vulnerable group, he said.
The trade unions claim that they support estate workers, but that is not true. What have they done for the betterment of these people NOTHING, he said.
Rajasekaran argued that even though the politicians are willing to do something good for the people, they were unable to do anything because trade unions have had greater voice in decision making than the politicians in power.
At the end, nobody does anything for the betterment of the people, he said.
He said the pathetic situation is that the people do not know anything about this  they knew neither politics nor their rights.
According to Rajasekaran, the only way to bring about change in the lives of these people was to change their mindset and for that they needed to think beyond their estate managers and trade unions.

Tribute to Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera
A life well lived
Not so long ago (one week back, to be precise) did we have this very same column allocated in memory of a national icon. The sudden departure of Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja shocked the nation. By coincidence, one week later, we have to fill the very same space with an obituary of another national figure, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera.
They both roamed in different paths but strived to make their voice count in the national interest. With a sound academic background, both Venerable Wimalaratana Thera and Dr Pathiraja illumed the seats of learning they represented. Every now and then, they had the courage to step out of their comfort zones. If Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja introduced a radical vein to the local cinema, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera syringed an out-of-the-box cadence to the Sri Lankan standing of Buddhism.
The Sinhalese Buddhist community scattered around the globe have placed the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara on a higher pedestal of reverence. Perched in the outskirts of the city of Colombo, in the village of Bellanwila, the temple is one of the most looked-up-to religious sites next to Kandys Sacred Tooth Relic and Anuradhapuras Sacred Jayasri Maha Bodhi. The much-blessed abode is where the majority of the upper-middle-class Sinhala Buddhist community seek solace mostly in times of trouble. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera was the Deputy Incumbent of this Vihara.
Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya
April 14, 1942, remains a date to recall for those versed in the cost of Ceylon in World War II. That April 14 was celebrated as the Sinhalese New Year auspicious day is obvious knowledge. This day of 1942, in particular, was not so looked forward to. The Ceylonese were already alarmed with the Japanese planes bombing the city of Colombo. It was to this world that a baby boy named Omattage Gilbert Perera was born. Becca Fitzpatrick was quite apt when she said that sometimes bad things have to happen before good things can. That said, this memorable day of 1942 will be remembered with much esteem.
Gilbert entered the Sangha Order on February 28, 1956, at the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya. Then onwards he was to be known as Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera. The Thera studied under the guidance of Venerable Molligoda Sri Ariyawansa Thera.
His life as a student is worth a note. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera has studied at many revered seats of learning such as Pravachanodaya Pirivenas in Molligoda, Wadduwa and Vidyalankara Pirivenas at Peliyagoda and Dematagoda. Upon completion of the secondary education, the Thera secured admission to the Vidyalankara University. At Vidyalankara, Venerable Wimalaratana Thera had encounters with colleagues such as Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who would later make waves in the country.
Having obtained the BA from the Vidyalankara University, Venerable Wimalaratana Thera joined the teaching staff of Sunethradevi Pirivena in Pepiliyana in 1965. He was also the Principal of Parama Dhamma Chetiya Pirivena, Ratmalana, from 1966 to 1969. In 1980, Venerable Thera obtained the PhD from the University of Lancaster, United Kingdom, for his doctoral thesis on the Maha Purusha concept in Buddhist literature and sculpture.
The Sangha Order is twofold with urban and forest traditions. The forest monks are more attentive to seeking solitude in meditation, while the urban monks focus on studying the Buddhas teachings and safeguard it for posterity. Both traditions are vital to sustaining the Masters teachings. Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera belonged to the latter tradition that fostered the Buddhas teachings.
Venerable Dr Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera entered the University of Sri Jayewardenepura as a lecturer. Following the demise of his mentor, Venerable Bellanwila Somaratana Thera, on August 2, 1984, Venerable Wimalaratna Thera became the unofficial Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara. Venerable Dr Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thera, his lay brother who was to succeed Venerable Somaratana Thera, was serving as the Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera in Singapore at the time. The Thera became a professor at Sri Jayewardenepura University in 1987.
Social and religious projects
The Thera was appointed the Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura on two occasions: first by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 2000, second by the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. He was also a Visiting Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London, United Kingdom.
The Venerable Thera was a busy figure. Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya, of which he is the Deputy Chief Incumbent, is one of the most crowded places, for one. He was the guiding figure behind the Pilgrims Rest, the 1200-student Dhamma School, the Bellanwila Community Development Fund and many other social and religious projects.
The Bellanwila Community Development Foundation provides training in 14 vocations to youth in the area, especially those who miss university entrance. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera also ran a day care centre for elderly parents of working couples, in addition to free medical clinics for residents in the area. The Bellanwila Perahera was also held under his supervision. The Thera used to walk the entire length of the Perahera.
Despite his busy schedule, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera tried his level best to offer a helping hand to the needy.
Among the various books in both Sinhala and English, authored by the Thera, are Buddhism, Society and Environment, Buddhism among other Religions, Concept of Great Man and Buddhist Literature and Iconography. His writings appeared in the Press as well.
Venerable Wimalaratana Thera was known more for his controversial views.
He stood the ground whenever he deemed it a national concern. Whoever takes the highest office of the political authority paid obeisance to this great Sangha figure. He employed his Sangha civil power to campaign for peace as well as reconciliation.
Coincidences are hard to believe at times. But what is even harder to believe is when the greats leave us without warning. Let us keep our fingers crossed that we may not have to run another premature obituary next week while praying for a comfortable Sansaric journey for Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera.

Lynn, Maxwell hit out in Australia T20 win
SYDNEY, Saturday - Power hitters Chris Lynn and Glenn Maxwell propelled Australia to a convincing seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in the first tri-series Twenty20 match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.
Lynn (44 runs from 33 balls) and Maxwell (40 not out from 24 balls) shared in a scorching 77-run stand from just 53 balls to steer Australia to the rain-reduced total of 95 from 15 overs with 21 balls to spare.
Despite a top-order wobble, in which captain David Warner and the debutant DArcy Short fell inside the first three overs, the belligerent power of Lynn and Maxwell swamped the Kiwi bowling attack.
Australias victory was earlier set up by towering paceman Billy Stanlake whose fierce pace justified Warners decision to bowl first after winning the toss, as he wrecked New Zealands top order with three wickets in the space of his first eight balls.
Stanlake startled Colin Munro with his high bounce for debutant wicketkeeper Alex Carey to race out to point to complete the catch.
Martin Guptill was then flummoxed next ball by a perfect-length seamer that flicked the top of off stump.
Stanlake narrowly missed his hat-trick as Tom Bruce clipped an attempted yorker through the leg side for three.
Andrew Tye claimed four wickets as Australia restricted New Zealand to a below-par 117 for nine off their 20 overs.
Tye mopped up the Kiwi tail to finish with four wickets for 23, while towering paceman Stanlake claimed three wickets inside the powerplay to dismantle the Kiwis top order.
Australia had New Zealand at 60 for five before Colin de Grandhomme hit an unbeaten 38 from 24 balls with three sixes and a four.
De Grandhomme launched two massive sixes off leg-spinner Adam Zampa with the Black Caps managing just four sixes in the entire innings.
Stanlake, who has had a storming Big Bash League season for the Adelaide Strikers, underlined why he is one of the hottest prospects in the country and has been locked up on a Cricket Australia central contract.
Tyes first wicket owed much to Warners catch, running backwards to make the grab and remove Kiwi captain Kane Williamson for eight from 21 balls.
Australia play England in the second match of the tri-series in Hobart on Wednesday.

Markets recover to 6,500-levels

Nestle followed suit, accounting for 8.46% of turnover (value of LKR0.29Bn) while Softlogic Holdings contributed LKR0.28Bn to account for 8.16% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR3.39Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR4.01Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR0.85Bn (-5.73% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.80Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 1.06% W-o-W (or LKR 31.26Bn) to LKR 2,983.46Bn cf. LKR 2,952.20Bn last week.
Liquidity(in value terms) 
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 49.87% (or LKR 1.69Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Janashakthi Insurance, Central Finance, Amana Bank, Ceylinco Ins. (NV) & Commercial Bank which accounted for 84.66% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 16.57% (or LKR 0.56Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Softlogic Holdings & JKH which accounted for 84.97% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 11.35% (or LKR 0.38Bn) to the market driven by Nestle which accounted for 74.57% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms) 
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 44.34% (or 79.46Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.69Bn.

Point of view
Equities retained their positive momentum this week, surging ~64 points over the course of the week to push past the key 6500-mark after a 2-week hiatus.
Despite a marginal 2 point drop at the start of the holiday-shortened trading week, investor sentiment turned bullish over the remainder of the week, driven largely by news of the sale of JINS General Insurance business and interest in index-heavy weights such as CARS and NEST. JINS accounted for 13.92 Index points as news of global insurance giant Allianz acquiring the Groups General Insurance business for a cash consideration of Rs. 16.4Bn pushed the stock price up by ~72% W-o-W.
Despite the general recovery in appetite for risky assets, turnover levels on the Colombo bourse remained mostly flat over the week, gaining just 6% W-o-W to remain at Rs.0.85Bn cf. Rs. 0.80Bn last week; YTD turnover levels so far this year have remained at Rs.0.89Bn, 2.2% lower than the Rs.0.92Bn recorded in FY 2017 but 39% higher than the Rs. 0.64Bn recorded in the comparable period last year.
Institutional and HNI participation over the week however, declined from the high 60-65% levels witnessed so far in 2018, to remain at just 26% over the week.
Net foreign inflows to the CSE meanwhile fell from the notable Rs.1.4Bn recorded last week to an inflow of Rs.259Mn over the week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the beginning of the Dec17 corporate earnings season which has just begun.
Urban inflation falls sharply in Jan18
Urban inflation levels in Jan18 fell to a 6-month low of 5.8% Y-o-Y, down sharply from the 7.1% Y-o-Y recorded in Dec17.
The significant decline in headline inflation was driven largely by base effects and a general reduction in F&B prices (from 14.4% in Dec17 to 10.5% in Jan18).
Core inflation levels meanwhile, continued to ease from its high of 6% Y-o-Y in August to record a level of 3.5% by Jan18. Lower inflation levels in January are likely to support the CBSLs current monetary policy stance (ie: less pressure to increase rates) particularly in the context that the LKR has remained largely stable over 2017 and YTD 2018.
The LKR has depreciated ~0.6% against the USD so far this year, compared to a total depreciation of 2.0% during 2017.
Support for the LKR in 2017 stemmed from a stronger B-o-P position on the back of continued financial inflows mainly in to G-Sec markets and the tourism industry.
Foreign investments to G-sec markets continued to draw net inflows between Mar-Nov17, while long-term loans to the government increased on a net basis during Jan-Nov period and foreign investments in the CSE remained a net positive cf. the net recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.
Despite a higher trade deficit on the back of higher imports offsetting the double-digit growth in exports therefore, the BOP over Jan-Nov17 recorded an overall surplus of ~$ 2.0Bn while gross official reserves increased to $7.3Bn billion (equivalent to 4.2 months of imports) cf. $6.0Bn recorded at end-2016.

Media freedom sans militarization
Friend of mine was disturbed when I said media freedom here is better than in Pakistan. Even in Lanka, it is hard to criticize the military. The military gets venerated by state leaders as saviours of the nation, while Tamils are fighting with them daily against militarization. Even the leaders of the government are afraid to hold them to account. The military thrives with impunity. Even former military political bosses like Gotabhaya lives untouched.
The government that agreed to military sector reforms does not carry it. In Sri Lanka too the military is a state within a state. No journalist writes against the military. They only have respect to them. Read these news items to see how the military goes unpunished for grave crimes, with the blessing of the government leadership. He said with despair. All this started with my statement to the press about the threat of abduction faced by Taha Siddiqui of Pakistan.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called on the Pakistani authorities to do whatever is necessary to guarantee the safety of Taha Siddiqui, a well-known and courageous freelance journalist who narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt recently in the capital, Islamabad. Taha Siddiqui was on his way to the airport in the morning; a vehicle blocked in front of his taxi and forced it to stop. Ten or twelve gunmen got out of this and another vehicle pointed a rifle at the taxi driver and pulled Siddiqui from the taxi. They then threw him to the ground, beat him and threatened to shoot him if he continued to resist.
Lack of security for journalists
Siddiqui nonetheless managed to get away by running across the expressway and flagging down another taxi in which he rode for a few kilometres and then sought refuge in a police station. This kidnap attempt is extremely worrying in a country where the lack of security for journalists and impunity for crimes of violence against them is a structural problem, said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSFs Asia-Pacific desk.
I said However according to RSF calculations on safety of media people, Pakistan placed at 139 while Lanka is below at 141. Lanka is today much safer, but it was a bad place for journalists during the previous fascistic regime of Mahinda. Perhaps the rating is still low as investigation and judicial processes are not yet completed for the murder of Lasantha and the disappearance of Pradeep Eknaligoda. On the other hand, though Siddiqui has been harassed and threatened for months; as a courageous journalist whose investigative reporting, has implicated the military when appropriate.
In Pakistan criticizing the armed forces is very dangerous for journalists. It was similar during the Mahinda regime, but we have come out of such military violence at least in the south. Hence we must urge the RSF to reassess the situation in Lanka.
This comment of mine was answered by the note that I mentioned above. I had to agree with my friend that Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka (JDS) were dismayed to learn that Sri Lankas top notch national intelligence person is allegedly accused of serious crimes against journalists during the final stages of its civil war, was on the Sri Lankan delegation that met with the United Nations Committee against Torture (UNCAT) in Geneva recently.
Political agenda
It is the duty of all democratic organisations in Lanka too, to urge the Pakistan authorities to make every effort to guarantee his safety. We are told that last May, Siddiqui received several threatening phone calls from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), an interior ministry offshoot, in which he was repeatedly ordered to report to the FIAs counter-terrorism department for questioning. However Siddiqui avoided. This recent events show that step was well-founded.
A very well-known reporter, Siddiqui is the Babel Press bureau chief in Islamabad, a position that includes being the correspondent of France 24 and World Is One News (WOIN). Unlike in Lanka, the army is a state within the state in Pakistan. It is often impossible for the media to cover a story properly with mentioning the military; because of frequent cases of intimidation of journalists.
Pressure from the international human rights movement brought human rights and press freedom increasingly to the political agenda of numerous countries and diplomatic negotiations.
All countries in the Indian subcontinent, SAARC also were pressed to improve press freedom and human rights conditions. Originally, most such pressers came from France and the UK. In the 1970s American organisations moved beyond rights for Americans to partake in the international scene, and around the turn of the century the movement became so global in character that it was no longer possible to ascribe leadership to any particular country.
The global human rights and press freedom movement has become more expansive since the 1990s, including greater representation of womens rights and economic justice as part of the human rights umbrella. Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights gained new prominence while press freedom became a corner stone of such movements.

Migraine linked to heart problems
Suffering with migraines could be a sign of underlying heart problems, a 19-year investigation involving more than half a million people has suggested.
Cardiovascular problems including heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and irregular heart rates are all linked to migraine, according to the research published in the British Medical Journal.
The researchers found that people who suffer from migraines were more likely to have a heart attack than those with no major headache symptoms. Forty five in 1,000 migraine sufferers also experienced a common form of stroke, 20 more than those who dont get migraines. And the number of strokes related to haemorrhages was higher in the migraine-suffering cohort (11 compared with six), while 13 compared with 11 suffered peripheral artery disease.
Danish and American researchers collected data from patients between 1995 and 2013. Of the people assessed, over 51,000 had been diagnosed with migraines and more than 510,000 hadnt.
Researchers found that the average age someone was diagnosed with a migraine was 35 and 71 per cent were women. In this nationwide cohort study, migraine was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, researchers said.
This suggests that migraine should be considered a potent and persistent risk factor for most cardiovascular diseases in both men and women.
But as the study was observational, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Migraines are more severe than normal headaches. They regularly involve nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and noise, low energy and an intense, throbbing headache. For some people they last just a few hours but for others they can last up to three days. Each year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience a migraine, more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.

Mobitel pioneers 4.5G (4G Plus) network to revolutionize SL mobile telecom industry
Sri Lankas National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel, is the first to initiate the roll out of the 4.5G network to revolutionize the industry and to significantly enhance user experience for its valued customers.
This strategic initiative by Mobitel positions the company to be the pioneer in the industry to upgrade its technology to offer the best possible service to customers.
Mobitel customers can now avail of more bandwidth and high data speeds for a superior online experience and to enjoy downloading music, videos and games at stable speeds.
It also provides a seamless user experience for Mobitel Enterprise Solutions and enables the company to cater to the growing demand in the corporate sector for customized solutions.
Upholding its reputation as the most progressive telco in Sri Lanka, Mobitel continues to invest in infrastructure developments to support its latest technological needs.
This move positions Mobitel to further solidify its leadership in the marketplace.
This 4.5G rollout deploys Carrier Aggregation technology (900Mhz + 1800Mhz + 2100Mhz), which enables Mobitel to add more frequencies to result in more bandwidth, which enhances data speeds.
Further, by upgrading to 4x4 MIMO (Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output) which uses greater signal strength than before through the use of more antennae, the signal is more powerful and stable for every user depending on geography.
Finally, in this rollout, Mobitel has accelerated its QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) from 64 to 256, thereby greatly increasing data speeds.
4.5G will act as a bridge for the eventual adoption of the 5G standard, while bringing significant improvements to Mobitels existing 4G networks by allowing them to handle more data-intensive applications.
Since Mobitel demonstrated 4.5G speeds at the 2017 Techno Exhibition, its loyal customer base has been eagerly awaiting the launch of its 4.5G network to enjoy a one-of-a-kind user experience.

No positive investments  for North yet - Chief Minister
No positive investments have taken place in the North East and the flow of cash to the region is inadequate, lamented Chief Minister of Northern Provincial Council, C. V. Wigneswaran.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the 9th edition of the Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF) he said that this may be because the process of reconsolidation also still not completed and a political solution not offered. Till a permanent political solution is brought about investment would not come to the North, he cautioned.
Wigneswaran said that in contrast to here, as soon as the conflict in South Africa ended it was followed by a permanent political solution and the investors in the world acknowledged it and went there.
Commenting further he said that though the A9 road was re built the other roads leading to the A9 were not renovated. Due to this situation the benefits one could derive of the A9 has become limited.
A. Natarajan, Consul General, Consulate General of India, Jaffna Sri Lanka.
The Chief Minister also said that no development is taking place at the Palali regional airport which can be easily converted to an international airport. The government has shown no interest in giving approval for it, he alledged.
Wigneswaran said the Board of Investment office in Jaffna too has been lethargic in wooing more investments to the Jaffna peninsula.
The Chief Minister said that as a solution to the Polythene issue Jaffna based entrepreneurs have come up with a solution to it. These entrepreneurs will soon introduce packaging material made out of plantain and Palmyra leaves as a substitute and this material would be available in the market soon.
Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage speaking at the event appreciated the efforts by the Northern people to uplift their lives, and said his Primary Industries Ministry has made many plans to develop Jaffna and other districts in the province.
State mediation is insufficient, and the state officials should assist in getting private sector contributions towards that end, he said.
Meanwhile, A Natarajan, Consul General, Consulate General of India, Jaffna Sri Lanka too said that even though business delegations from India visit JITF they do not invest in Sri Lanka.
He said that in contrast the Indian government is assisting the development of Jaffna since 2010 and will invest US$ 45 million to upgrade the KKS harbour. In addition one of the best cultural center in the island is being built adjoining the Jaffna library with Indian aid amounting to Rs. 2 billion. The foundation for this was laid by Indian premier Narendra Modi in 2015.
He also said that the Indian government is further investing Rs. 300 million for rain water harvesting projects to assist Agri farmers.

North Korea to send head of state to Seoul for first time in years

North Korea will send its nominal head of state and other senior officials toSouth Koreathis week, as the neighbours push through with attempts at rapprochement ahead of this months Winter Olympics.
Kim Yong-nam, the head of the Norths parliament, will be the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since the North sent then-No. 2 Hwang Pyong So at the close of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Kims trip touched off immediate media speculation that direct contacts between Pyongyang and Washington may be possible during the Olympics, with the US sending vice president Mike Pence to the games that start on 9 February.
On Sunday night, the North sent a message via a cross-border communication channel saying its high-level delegation will visit South Korea from 9 to 11 February, the Souths unification ministry said in a statement. It said the Norths delegation includes Kim and three other officials but gave no further details like its itinerary.
Kim chairs the top decision-making body of North Koreas rubber-stamp parliament, and his official title as president of the Presidium of the Supreme Peoples Assembly as the Norths nominal or ceremonial leader. Kim, 90, has been frequently seen on state TV making propaganda-filled speeches with deep, booming voices on key state anniversaries or receiving visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of leader Kim Jong-un and his late dictator father Kim Jong-il. Some experts say Kim Yong-nams actual influence in state affairs has been diminished gradually over the years largely due to his age.

A protest urging the authorities to ensure the civil rights of estate workers, was staged yesterday before the Bo tree in Fort, yesterday.
The protest had been organized by the Estate Workers Centre and the Workers Struggle Centre.
Workers Struggle Centre Organizing Secretary Duminda Nagamuwa said the struggle was to compel the government to ensure that estate workers get a plot of land, a house, an address of their own, and a salary of Rs. 1,000 per day.
He said although the country celebrated its 70th independence day, the issues of estate workers numbering nearly one million, have not been solved for over a 200 years.
He added that those workers dwelling in the Central Province in the Ratnapura, Kegalle, Matara, and Galle districts, do not have an address of their own, and receive their letters through the Superintendent of their respective estates. They do not come under a local government authority administration. He further said that those people have been given pledges from time to time by politicians, but no action had been taken. He also added that the politicians have to address those workers issues without delay, as they contribute one of the major export products of the country

Revolution in reverse
On the evening of November 21, 2013, Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian reporter, posted a thirty-one-word comment on his Facebook page that led to the toppling of the Ukrainian government. Nayyem was angry about President Viktor Yanukovychs failure to sign an association agreement with the European Union. He goaded his Facebook friends to protest on Kyivs main square, the Maidan. He did not want the demonstration to be virtual. Likes, he typed, dont count.
And so began one of historys first smartphone uprisings, powered by photos captured on thousands of tiny cameras and hurtled around the globe onto millions of miniature screens. In The Ukrainian Night, Marci Shore describes the events as a revolution. Her history entails an extraordinary declaration of the power of human will and self-determination.
Maidan became a historical event when Ukrainian special forces, the Berkut, fired on the small group of protesters who responded to Nayyems plea. The gunshots immediately ricocheted across social media. Hundreds of thousands of outraged citizens headed for the square. Shore describes how the Maidan occupiers made an impromptu alternative society, setting up tents, soup kitchens and a stage. They organized an Open University and a library, held concerts, and rolled in an upright piano painted yellow and blue.
Civilisational choice
Food, clothing and medicine were distributed free of charge. The homeless were welcome. No one got drunk. The Maidan was so clean you could eat off the asphalt, a protester named Misha Martynenko told Shore. Theirs was a civilisational choice, Shore writes, to be free of Russia, to be part of Europe, where Ukraine had been three or four centuries ago.
Shore claims that she is not interested in politics but in the lived experience of these events. She uses mini-biographies of several dozen Ukrainians, most of them pro-Maidan intellectuals, to recount the first days of the uprising, its metamorphosis into a revolution and devolution into civil war. The biographies give a lucid, human dimension to the conflict. To justify her approach, she quotes the philosopher Stanislaw Brzozowski: What is not biography  is nothing at all.
That is one of a number of either/or statements that crowd into this history. Shores pro-Maidan Ukrainians look towards youth, the future, Europe and democratic civilization over a nostalgia for a socialist, authoritarian East. They choose plurality and tolerance over their opposites.
After a months experiment in anarchic self-organization, the Berkut attacked Maidans village. A battle followed of David and Goliath proportions. The rebels fought with paving bricks, Molotov cocktails and conventional weapons. They also deployed their cell-phones, live-streaming death. Yanukovych and Vladimir Putin won the propaganda war in the official media, Shore writes, but they lost in the social media because of a transparency that was unimaginable in earlier revolutions.
How quickly things have changed. That observation now appears obsolete in the wake of revelations that Russian trolls used Facebook and Twitter to subvert the American and British elections. By choosing to tell individual stories, Shore relies on oral testimony, yet as parties fought to control the image of Maidan, fake news abounded. Shores account would have been more valuable had she sourced her subjects accounts to sort fact from fiction.
Tent museum
The military phase of the revolution gave pre-eminence to strongmen: their courage, strength, pyrotechnic power and PR skills. As many mostly young and male protesters died, they were reimagined as hallowed martyrs. A tent museum quickly materialized on the Maidan, exhibiting the bike helmets and garbage-can shields that protesters used against the Berkuts deadly bullets, also on display. Dozens of memorials to the fallen heavenly hundred peppered the city.
They were framed with candles and embroidered rushnyki in the way saints are depicted in Ukrainian Orthodox churches. Ukrainians of all political stripes could embrace this message of defence of the homeland. It was a narrative of national martyrdom that had deep roots in the Soviet memorialization of the Great Patriotic War against fascism  an official commemoration uncomplicated by histories of collaboration, mass rape, mass incarceration and genocide.
The battle over the Maidan and the ensuing conflict in the Donbas cleansed the taint of wartime collaboration from right-wing protesters who held aloft portraits of leaders of the one-time Nazi ally, the Ukrainian Resistance Army. After Maidan, these leaders became the forefathers of the heavenly hundreds. In commemorating Maidan and the Donbas, the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian trident was finally free to fly. And fly it did.
A Harvard University mapping project shows the spread of Ukrainian nationalist images that until 2014 had been considered unacceptably right-wing in many parts of the country. Maidan was a godsend for this militant brand of nationalism. There is a long tradition of commentators using Eastern Europe to elaborate the polarities of East and West in order to define slippery abstractions such as freedom and democracy. Deploying Ukraine as a canvas for political allegory can be a useful exercise, but perhaps the model of freedom revolution is off target. For some Ukrainians, Europe and freedom meant simply good roads and warm radiators. For others, they meant the ability to speak ones mind.
Fifth column
Following the successful ousting of Yanukovych and the election of the pro-European President Petro Poroshenko, neither promise has materialized. On his blog, Nayyem, whose tweet started Maidan, complains that citizens who criticize the government are smeared as a Russian fifth column. Poroshenkos administration, he opines, only listens to bankers and media magnates.
From the perspective of early 2018, Maidan appears as a very modern, digitally nimble event that shares some features with the Occupy movement but for which we dont yet have a proper term. Maidan was a city square and also a social-media space. To occupy the Maidan meant to take charge of the messages that flowed from it. The contest involved discrediting ones adversaries headlines and projecting ones own. People tended to follow their own news stream. Optimization logarithms, matching likes to likes, helped that trend along, as did trolls generating fake news. For a price, Facebook, Twitter and their Slavic equivalent VKontake directed news updates and political advertising (the two often indistinguishable) to people most likely to believe them. As crowd-sourcing grouped opinion into warring camps, it became difficult to determine the lines of reality, or to agree on a common future. The state, weakened by leaders whose main goal in power appears to have been to elevate corporate profits by emasculating the judiciary and bankrupting federal coffers, encouraged social divisions.
Government, left in shambles with a combative and paralysed legislature, had to rely on a powerful executive and local warlords. Lost in this confusing blitz, many citizens turned to nationalism as an ideology that provided, if not answers, then at least villains to blame for the morass.
What if we stop thinking of Eastern Europe as a template where events play out at a delayed pace following Western liberal models What if Maidan is not a snapshot of the past, but a portent of the future, or a wild reflection of the present If so, then this version of Maidan looks frightfully familiar as I write from Washington, DC. What is the name for a freedom revolution in reverse

Science says daughters are dearer to daddies than sons
The gender of your baby could never affect or influence your parenting or behaviour. Whether it's a baby boy or baby girl, your brain would respond equally to their desires and needs. But there are researches that have a different take on this.
According to a study published in the American Psychological Association's journal Behavioral Neuroscience, fathers often treat their baby girls differently than the baby boys. Researchers have found out that their brain responds differently when they interact with their toddler girls.
It also revealed that dads do respond differently to their daughters' happy facial expressions when compared to their toddler sons.
The study was done on 52 fathers and MRIs showed that they reacted differently to pictures of their daughters than their toddler boys. The study also found out that fathers sang more to their daughters and were open about their emotions. On the other hand, with their young sons, they used more words which were related to winning and achievements like 'top' and 'proud'.
The researchers also concluded that when it comes to responding to a crying child, fathers of daughters paid more and quick attention than fathers who had sons. The study is a clear indication for fathers who have sons, that without even realizing they might get less attentive and emotionally less involved to their needs. Hence, they need to understand that even they do not know it but the way they are responding to their sons might not be a healthy practice for a father-son relationship.

Sexton breaks French hearts with last-second drop goal
PARIS, Saturday - Johnny Sextons last-second drop goal earned Ireland a dramatic 15-13 away victory against France in their Six Nations opener as Les Bleus suffered an agonising defeat in coach Jacques Brunels first game in charge on Saturday.
Sextons 44-metre drop goal almost three minutes into injury time stunned the Stade de France as the hosts thought they would prevail after a splendid late try by wing Teddy Thomas.
But Sexton, who scored all his teams points as he also slotted home four penalties, had other ideas.
When (Sexton) struck the drop goal I was just willing it had enough distance to go over, said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt.
France had stayed in contention thanks to Maxime Machenauds two penalties before Thomass dazzling run and Anthony Belleaus conversion had put them ahead for the first time.
Les Bleus, who have not won in their last seven games, lost teenage sensation Matthieu Jalibert after the flyhalf suffered a knee injury in the first half.
Brunel, who took over from Guy Noves after a poor November series, banked on Jalibert to instil some life into the French team, but the 19-year-old limped off the field after half an hour.
Replacement scrumhalf Antoine Dupont was also injured.
We have to wait for the medical exams but it seems to be serious for Antoine Dupont, and possibly for Matthieu Jalibert, Brunel told a news conference.
France were penalised for offside early on and Sexton coolly slotted home the penalty as Ireland got off to a lively start.
The hosts were often pinned back to their own half with Connor Murrays kicks proving tough to handle, but they enjoyed a good spell after 15 minutes as Jalibert showed a lot of pace.
But Ireland defended ferociously and never allowed Les Bleus into their 22 metres.
Another Sexton routine penalty earned Ireland a 6-0 lead.
Jalibert left the pitch to be replaced by Belleau on the half hour after hurting his knee.
Machenaud reduced the arrears five minutes before the interval with a penalty France won at the breakdown, only for Sexton to restore the six-point lead after a Sebastien Vahaamahina foul on Murray in the scrum.

Six Africans injured in Italy drive-by shooting
ITALY: A shaven-headed far-right supporter wounded six Africans on Saturday in a brazen drive-by shooting in central Italy and was later arrested.
After the morning assault in the town of Macerata, the suspect got out of his car, made a fascist salute with a tricolour Italian flag draped over his shoulders and shouted Viva Italia, or Long Live Italy, and Italy for Italians, media reports said.
The wounded included five men and one woman and came from Ghana, Mali and Nigeria, the Agi news agency said.
He opened fire in eight areas in the town and also targeted the office of the centre-left Democratic Party in a two-hour terror spree in the sleepy town of 43,000 people, press reports said.
Six people were injured and all of them are foreigners, said town mayor Romano Carancini. Police confirmed in a tweet that the wounded persons were of foreign nationality, adding that the presumed author of the attack is Italian.
One victim was seriously injured in the thorax, press reports said. The other five had lesser injuries.
A Nigerian man who was shot in the thigh while buying cigarettes on the street told a television channel from his hospital bed that he was in great pain, adding: Its very serious.
Television footage showed the suspect being arrested at the towns war memorial. Police also posted a photo of the capture.
Italian media identified the man as Luca Traini, 28, and said he was a member of the far-right anti-immigration Northern League party, who had run in local elections last year.
Media reports said police found a gun in the mans vehicle, a black Alfa Romeo.
Someone who shoots is a delinquent, irrespective of the colour of his skin, said Northern league chief Matteo Salvini, in full campaign mode ahead of legislative elections on March 4.
Im in a hurry to be in government to bring back security, social justice and serenity to Italy, he said.
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni meanwhile made a pitch for unity, saying: Hate and violence will not divide us.
The attack comes a day after a Nigerian asylum-seeker and drug dealer was arrested in Macerata over the gruesome killing of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose dismembered body was discovered in suitcases earlier this week.
Police found the clothes of the victim, Pamela Mastropietro, in the house of the 29-year-old Nigerian as well as a bloodstained knife.
However, no official link has been made between the two incidents.
Italians head to the polls in national elections next month, with immigration shaping up to be a key issue.
The country is a favoured landing point on Europes southern coastline for migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, often aboard unseaworthy boats, to enter the continent. - AFP

SLR collects over Rs. 20 m through fines
The Railways Department has collected a record income of over Rs. 20 million as fines from errant commuters, through mobile ticket inspections and sudden raids made in trains during last year.
According to officials attached to the Sri Lanka Railways Investigation Unit, the total number of detections made during the period was 14,809. These mobile raids were carried out covering the three railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya, and Anuradapura.
Ticketless travel, travelling in class one and class two compartments with class three tickets, and travelling beyond destinations specified in their tickets, were offences committed by the fraudulent commuters.
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) is a public transport service. The provision of an efficient and effective service to commuters would be the main objective of the department, SLR authorities said.
The Railways Department is being deprived of a large amount of income due to these malpractices, authorities added.
With the aim of minimizing these offences, fines imposed on fraudulent train travellers have been increased from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000. In addition, mobile inspections and sudden raids in trains have currently been further intensified, SLR Commercial Superintendent G. W. S. Sisira Kumara added.

The media had earlier reported that the Venerable Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera had been attacked by the Temples tusker Miyan Kumara but these claims were refuted by Venerable Dr. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thera.
Ven.Dhammarathana Thera explained that Ven. Prof. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thera was in the habit of feeding the elephant with a bunch of fruits in the mornings when the elephant reached into the prelates room.
On the day of the incident, however, the Thera had visited the elephants stable to feed him and the elephant had accidently struck the Thera and he had fallen. Later, on the request of the Thera, the Thera had been admitted to a private hospital where he passed away.

Sharing your home with a pooch from the street will reward you with a lifetime of unconditional love and loyalty. If you find a puppy or street dog and you want to take it into your home, make sure you take the animal to the nearest vet to ensure it is healthy and that all vaccinations needed are given.
You can also attend one of Embarks Adoption Days, held multiple times a month, to adopt a puppy or adult pooch that has been treated, vaccinated, and is ready to find a forever home. It is important to understand the responsibility and commitment that comes with caring for street dog. They are born with the same right to live a life of freedom, safety and happiness as we are. They must not be caged, chained or isolated for prolonged periods. They should be given regular meals, clean water and medical care whenever necessary. They are not accessories, and are entitled to just as much love and compassion as family members.
When you choose to buy a dog from a breeder, instead of adopting, a homeless street pooch is deprived of the opportunity to find a loving home. Breeding for profit is a cruel and unnecessary industry that is growing day by day, which puts many pedigree dogs in danger of being stolen from their homes. Dogs are forced to live in cages as profit machines, in isolated conditions, for your purchase.Please take the time to learn more about the breeding industry in Sri Lanka.
If you would like to adopt your very own Sri Lankan street dog, you are welcome to drop by our next Adoption Day event at Embark Headquarters on 27 January at No. 73, Jawatta Road, Colombo 05 or call us at 0777 740 129.

Stronger economy for a brighter future
Home is the place where we congregate as a family and share our experiences, a safe haven for us to return to after our busy days in the outside world. Housing is important to the well-being and security of families.
Our governments mission is to ensure that all Sri Lankans have shelter by 2025. While in government, the UNP has invested over Rs. 22 billion into housing during the past two years. We are proud to have helped over 260,000 families to secure homes. In addition, in 2018, we have proposed the construction of 650 model villages, investing Rs. 9.5 billion for the purpose, which will benefit a further 36,651 families, in addition to the 507 whose homes are already under construction.
The investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Without a strong economy, we cannot provide necessary funds to local governments. We are working towards fixing past mistakes and building a stronger economy for a brighter future for all Sri Lankans.
Soon, we have our crucial local government elections. The UNPs presence at the local level following these elections, will determine the future of our economy. A strong UNP presence in the local government means a stronger UNP in the national government and a stronger national economy. A weak UNP presence in the local government would result in the opposite. Therefore, the choice is clear, voting only for the UNP locally, guarantees a good deal from the national government for your area.
In the national government, the UNP has a track record of delivering to the people. We have created over 400,000 jobs and have committed to bringing more jobs to your area. Fuel prices have been reduced by 22 percent to help low-income families with the cost of living. We have provided Rs. 20,000 to pregnant women so that the next generation arrives safely. Serious crime has been cut by a third, making Sri Lanka safer for our families. Public sector salaries have increased by Rs. 10,000 so public servants could make ends meet.
Victory at the local elections will enable the UNP to build more upon the progress made since 2015it means sticking to a plan to build a stronger economy and help us secure an outright victory in the next general election.
Rajapaksa and his acolytes have nothing to say; they are void of any positivity or genuine ideas for our country and are only able to criticise the UNP. If we are not successful at the local level, we would provide an opportunity for Rajapaksa to consolidate his position and threaten our countrys future.
So I truly hope you understand that these elections will be close and every vote will count. Therefore, not voting is the same as voting for another party and not voting for the UNP locally, jeopardises the future of your respective local areas.
Housing is a human right, and we are providing homes for our hard-working citizens. Presently, there are more homes, a stronger economy, and we are building a better Sri Lanka. Let us keep on track!

Try Marmite pasta!
Nigella Lawson, national treasure and culinary powerhouse, is forever causing commotion with her quirky recipes.
Who can forget the time she upset pasta aficionados by putting cream in carbonara Or when she put an egg on a leaf and called it a Caesar salad. No bad thing, just lacking in ingredients. Purests were livid.
Not that she would mind. Nigella has always proudly called herself a home cook  never a chef. Her repertoire focuses on food thats accessible, but that impresses at dinner parties.
Today, Nigella shared one of her more unusual and divisive dishes: Marmite pasta.
Nigella first published her Spaghetti with Marmite recipe in 2009. She starts by melting the yeast extract with butter, before running it through fresh pasta with that important ladle-full of the salted pasta water to amalgamate. A heady grating of Parmesan completes the dish.
Nigella claims shes not yet found a child who isnt keen. Considering a vast proportion of the nation hates Marmite, we imagine there might be a handful. For Marmite fans, the meal is apparently dreamy.
Thismummycooks said: Was sceptical about this recipe but one day in the early stages of pregnancy when I was too tired to cook a normal meal, I tried Marmite spaghetti and oh my goodness, what a treat! Still cook it as my go-to quick fix supper.
Sunita added: Ive made this and its so tasty.
Nigella discovered the recipe in Anna Del Contes memoirs, Risotto with Nettles. Del Conte was a prolific food writer, and helped the English discover Italian food is more than bolognese and pizza. And yes, shes Italian. Marmite
I know the combination of pasta and Marmite sounds odd to the point of unfeasibility, Nigella writes.
But wait a moment, there is a traditional day-after-the-roast pasta dish, in which spaghetti is tossed in stock, and I have eaten shortcut versions of this in Italy (recreated guiltlessly in my own kitchen) which use a crumbled stock cube, along with some butter, olive oil, chopped rosemary and a little of the pasta cooking water to make a flavoursome sauce for spaghetti.
If you think about it, Marmite offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might. Im glad this recipe is here, and I thank Anna for it. Mirror

United take advantage as Manchester City held at Burnley
LONDON, Saturday : Manchester Uniteds new signing Alexis Sanchez scored on his home debut in a 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town as they took advantage of a slip by cross-town rivals and Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday.
After City had been held 1-1 at Burnley, their daunting lead over United was reduced to 13 points when Jose Mourinhos side eventually overcame a defensive Huddersfield side.
It took 55 minutes before Romelu Lukaku broke the deadlock after which Sanchez won a penalty, had it saved by Jonas Lossl, but tucked away the rebound in the 68th.
We had to be patient but had to keep the intensity high and the pressure, Mourinho told the BBC.
We had to break down the Berlin wall organised so well by David Wagner.
City paid the price for missed chances as they drew at Turf Moor with Johann Berg Gudmundssons 82nd-minute equaliser earning Burnley a point.
City had dominated possession but, after taking the lead with a fine strike from Brazilian Danilo in the 22nd minute, the visitors failed to press home their advantage.
We are frustrated in terms of the result but the performance was outstanding, said City manager Pep Guardiola.
City have 69 points, ahead of United on 56 with third-placed Liverpool (50) at home to Tottenham Hotspur (48), who are fifth, on Sunday, while Chelsea (50) visit mid-table Watford on Monday.
Sixth-placed Arsenal (45) led Everton 4-0 at halftime and won 5-1 as Welsh international Aaron Ramsey scored the first hat-trick of his career. Record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also among the scorers.
RELEGATION BATTLE
Huddersfields defeat at Old Trafford dropped them into the bottom three for the first time since they were promoted as Southampton and Swansea City both moved above them.
Bottom club West Bromwich Albion lost 3-2 at home to Southampton on an emotional day at the Hawthorns, where there was a minutes applause for the home sides former striker Cyrille Regis, who died aged 59 last month.
Albion led early on through Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi but were rocked by three goals in a quarter of an hour either side of halftime.
Southampton held on after Salomon Rondons goal to secure a first win in 13 league games, leaving Albion four points adrift at the bottom with 20 points.
Improving Swansea earned a valuable point with Federico Fernandezs equaliser at Leicester City, for whom Jamie Vardy scored his 13th goal of the season in all competitions.
Bournemouth consolidated their place in the top 10 by coming from behind to beat Stoke City 2-1 and, on a good day for the south-coast sides, Brighton & Hove Albion beat West Ham United 3-1 to draw level with them on 27 points.

U.S. sets 4x800m record, Miller-Uibo equals fastest 300m
NEW YORK, Saturday - Bahamian Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo matched the fastest time ever recorded in the rarely run womens 300 metres and an American team broke the world record in the womens 4x800m relay at the NYRR Millrose Games on Saturday.
Miller-Unibo, the 2016 Rio Games 400 metres champion, sped to a runaway victory of 35.45 seconds around the indoor track in New York as she equalled the 25-year-old mark set by Russias Irina Privalova.
Coach wanted me to come out her and run a pretty good time and it was a world record, Miller-Uibo said of the event which is not recognised for world record purposes.
Its a great feeling.
A world record did fall in the womens 4x800m relay, however, thanks to an inspiring anchor leg by Ajee Wilson.
Chrishuna Williams, Raevyn Rogers, Charlene Lipsey and Wilson clocked 8:05.89 to better a 2011 Russian quartets mark of 8:06.24.
It was insane, Wilson, who ran her 800 metres in 1:58.37, told NBC Sports. I could feel the crowd. They really pushed me, encouraged me to keep digging.
Greek Olympic gold medallist Katerina Stefanidi won a highly anticipated womens pole vault that lost much of its lustre after American rival Sandi Morris pulled out due to back spasms.
Stefanidi, who is also the reigning world champion, claimed her 15th consecutive victory by clearing 4.71m on her second attempt.
American Katie Nageotte matched the Greek womans vault but lost out on countback after registering more failures at an earlier height.
Young Kenyan Emmanuel Korir sped to the years fastest 800m, cruising to victory in 1:44.21, and Scotlands Chris OHare posted the leading mile time of 2018 with a 3:54.14.
Americans Ronnie Baker and Devon Allen, and the Ivory Coasts Murielle Ahoure also defeated quality fields.

Waiting for Sunrise
The crowd stood stationary. No one dared even one step ahead. They were not bothered about the tired night they had spent climbing up to the peak. This sight was larger than life, and they were imbibing it.
Finally it dawned.
Sun slowly began to rise.
Almost everyone forgot their weariness at that moment. The dark sky was marked with a golden boundary at first. The climbers savoured that moment selfieing themselves in the backdrop of the rising sun. The path was soon teeming with the travellers selfieing, photographing and videoing the slow sunrise.
I was feeling sleepy and tired, but now I am feeling fresh, said a smiling Magiline. She made the pilgrimage with her granddaughter. The time read 6.20 in the morning of December 25, the day after the Unduwap Poya.
Magiline was one of the old, but not worn out, ladies who took steps in a surprisingly energetic style. Most pilgrims had the determination to reach the peak somehow and pay homage to the rising sun.
Sarath, a 60-year-old government servant, made the pilgrimage after a lapse of seven years.
If not for my determination, I would have never made it. I felt tired more than the last time. But I had a strong will to see the sacred footprint, worship God Samans abode and pay homage to sun. Physically I am exhausted, but mentally I am excited and elated. I am thinking of making this pilgrimage every year, if possible, Sarath muttered between trembling lips.
Coldness is something you cannot miss here, but the climate was not freezing like it used to be during the past years. Is climate change slowly taking a toll on Sripada as well
Commonly termed as Ira Sevaya  loosely translated into English as homage to the sun  it is an age-old tradition linked with Sri Pada. Of course it is a unique experience when you get to experience the slow rise of sun at 4888 feet above sea level. That figure, 4888 feet, is no cakewalk. Climbing to the peak of Sripada means you take 5000 steps for about five hours. The duration depends basically on your climbing speed.
If you are a steady walker, you can reach the peak within two hours. A steady walk with lesser breaks (as much as possible), unless you are frail, is the best way to walk this tough journey. The slower your climb gets, the more tired you will get in the end.
Some travellers choose the off-season to climb the Sripada. But if you want a real pilgrims experience, you should make it during the season. The season exposes you to numerous hardships of the pilgrimage. The night climb often introduces you to a packed queue at the sunrise. The peak gets crowded with the pilgrims paying homage to the Buddhas sacred footprint, God Saman and the sun.
Even at this day and age when technology is given such prominence, surprisingly the path that leads to Sripada has not made much progress. Is it simply in a bid to retain the age-old charm of tough journey or because no one in the authorities want to develop it With ubiquitous steep steps, Sripada path looks quite the old world.
Sripada journey, though infrastructure has improved quite a lot now, is still arduous and the baggage makes the journey heavier. However it is not so for the pilgrims. Even if they feel honest, they would not dare say that. They fear the wrath of deities and consider it as a verbal misgiving if any such thing comes out of your mouth. Whatever said and done night trek is the most enduring as well as enjoyable journey. Especially in season, you wouldnt be alone. Backtrekkers would keep the climbers spirits lifted by hosannas.
The pilgrims never climb the mount alone. They are always in groups which have a chief each. The group chief is normally handpicked from the elder generation. They always kept tabs on what came out of their lips. They entertained fears for divine forces that reigned over the territory.
Lieutenant Malcolm narrates an interesting story on beliefs of divine forces. During the British rule the monks in the vicinity of Sripada had a belief that no White could climb the mount without impediment. Malcolm wanted give the lie to this local Tutankhamuns Curse attitude.
He started the journey at 11 at night. No rains stood in the way as they were warned. Lieutenants team stumbled upon many things including dilapidated army castles. It took four hours to climb one hill of the whole range. The climbers somehow reached the peak at eight the following morning.
They proved the monks wrong, and came the most celebrated event hot on the heels. They fired three gunshots to mark their victory. Still they did not seem to have any idea of islanders fame for sanctity and calmness. Malcolm was regretting that he could not bring the Union Jack to hoist in the territory. Such was the thought of invaders by then; Sripada was only a joyride, it was no spiritual voyage in the least.
But now things are different. A major portion of the pilgrims include westerners. They have a great respect for this holy mount. Sometimes their respect has greater heights than the locals. Whatever nationality they belonged to, the pilgrims were engulfed in utmost joy as they sighted the rising sun.
As the rising sun slowly turned into a giant fireball unbearable to the naked eye, the pilgrims turned back albeit with fresh hopes: the sun will rise again tomorrow.

A well-articulated vision
Just nine years ago, terrorism was the greatest threat faced by Sri Lanka. Now, in the post-conflict era and on the cusp of the 71st year of independence, there is another ominous threat  fraud and corruption. In a stirring speech delivered yesterday to mark the 70th anniversary of Independence President Maithripala Sirisena alluded to this threat, saying financial discipline should be considered an act of patriotism in a time where corruption has become a major hindrance to a prosperous Sri Lanka.
Addressing Sri Lankans live on television from Galle Face Green, President Sirisena also said that bribery, corruption, frauds and other malpractices have a detrimental impact on economic independence and the future of the country. He made a clarion call for the formation of a national movement against fraud and corruption. This movement, he said, should promote financial discipline among all citizens.
President Sirisena requested politicians, heads of government departments and all public servants to act with financial discipline as a part of this national movement against corruption. He called for a top to bottom approach on integrity where not only the grassroots levels are expected to uphold these qualities. This will help efface the common notion that only the small fry are affected by anti-corruption measures while the big fish go scot free.
During the last few weeks, we have seen positive results of the anti-corruption drive, coinciding with the Bond Commission report and the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC). Several high profile arrests have already been made. President Sirisena has also appointed a Presidential Commission to probe malpractices and corruption at SriLankan and Mihin Lanka airlines. Special courts are to be established to expedite the hearing of corruption cases. All these are welcome moves.
Corruption is directly linked to the prevalence of poverty. If someone pockets the funds that can be used to develop the country and alleviate poverty, the poor cannot be uplifted. President Sirisena was right to note that poverty is another main challenge for Sri Lanka to overcome. He called for new thinking to expand the poverty alleviation programmes.
Indeed, corruption and poverty can rob us of our true freedom. The equitable distribution of wealth is essential to tackle poverty. Closing the door to corruption should help expedite our development drive and make more Sri Lankans self-reliant. As a country too, we should strive for self-reliance and reduced imports. Our goal should be to leave a prosperous, harmonious, corruption-free nation to the future generations. That will be our main challenge for the next 70 years and beyond.
A great loss to the Sasana
Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 77, was a lifelong advocate of peace and reconciliation, for which President Maithripala Sirisena made an impassioned appeal in his Independence Day speech yesterday. His passing away is thus an irreparable loss to Sri Lanka, which is emerging from years of conflict and seeking peace and reconciliation.
Ven. Wimalaratana Thera was one of the leading proponents of inter-religious and ethnic harmony. He had a good working relationship with leading Bhikkus and other religious leaders. In fact, he worked closely with the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera to achieve a dialogue with other religious leaders. His views were sought by the rulers of the day in matters pertaining to religion, society and development.
Ven. Wimalaratana Thera had the ability to explain even complex tenets of the Dhamma to laymen in simple language. He was a true Dhamma Dhuta (Messenger of Dhamma) who spread the word of the Buddha in many world capitals. His many books on Buddhism have become compulsory reading for lay and Bhikku students in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.
Although not publicized as such, Ven. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera was a prominent educationist who has made a significant contribution to Piriven and school education. He was bothered by the fact that most students who pass the A/Ls could not enter State universities. Along with Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thera (his own brother in lay life), he was instrumental in starting a vocational school affiliated to the historic Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya, where students can pursue courses in 14 vocations. The Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya Dhamma School is also helping to mould a pious new generation. The Ven. Thera was a live wire in the Bellanwila community, having initiated the Bellanwila Community Development Fund.
Ven. Wimalaratana Thera did not hesitate to express sometimes controversial views in public meetings and on television about various matters affecting the public. Though not overtly political like some of his contemporaries, he was held in high esteem by both rulers and the public alike for his forthright views. He was aghast at certain incidents that impacted on religious and ethnic harmony and made a fervent appeal to the rulers and the public not to let history repeat itself.
The greatest tribute that we can pay thus erudite Bhikku is to make his dream of a peaceful, harmonious Sri Lanka come true by eschewing petty differences and political divisions. May He attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

With Sri Lankan port acquisition, China adds another
pearl to its string
When Sri Lanka's government first looked to develop a port on its southern coast that faced the Indian Ocean, it went not to China, but to its neighbor, India.
Then-Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said he urgently needed funding to transform the harbor of his home town and asked Indian officials for help with the project.
New Delhi showed little interest in funding a costly and massive port construction project in the underdeveloped fishing village of Hambantota, a district that had been crushed by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.
"It was offered to India first. I was desperate for development work, but ultimately the Chinese agreed to build it," Rajapaksa said in an interview with Singapore's Straits Times in 2010.
Beijing invested $1.5 billion in 2010 to build the port.
A Chinese worker at the construction site of a Chinese-funded $1.4 billion reclamation project in Colombo, Sri Lanka in October 2017.
Flash back: Sri Lankan dancers perform at the site of the Hambantota port during a ceremony marking the first phase of construction, August 15, 2010.
The venture was considered economically unviable and indeed, in the years that followed, the port sat empty and neglected, and Sri Lanka's debt ballooned.
But India's economic foresight might have cost it in terms of strategic geopolitics, since the debt incurred on the port and the surrounding infrastructure undertakings now belong to its great rival.
China's official licensing of the port in December last year gives it yet another point of access over a key shipping route, and the prospect of providing it with a sizeable presence in India's immediate backyard and traditional sphere of influence, bringing China closer to India's shores than New Delhi might like.
Moreover, Sri Lanka's decision to sign a 99-year lease with a Chinese state-owned company for the Hambantota port to service some of the billions it owes to Beijing has some observers concerned other developing nations doing business with China as part of China's One Belt One Road initiative might fall into similar financial straits.
A trap, they warn, that may well have them owing more than just money to Beijing.
"China is, in many cases, the only party with the interest and the capital to deliver on these projects," said Jeff Smith, a research fellow on South Asia at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. "The relevant question for everyone is: at what cost"
'A determined strategy by China'
China has for decades invested in Sri Lanka, particularly during moments in recent history when much of the international community held off.
As the European Union sought to punish Sri Lanka over human rights abuses during the decades-long civil war between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, China acted on its behalf diplomatically at the United Nations. It also supplied the Rajapaksa government with military aid and it promised to spend to rebuild the country's damaged infrastructure. India had also sent in military help, but nowhere near the levels Beijing dispatched.
The civil war ended in 2009. Between 2005 and 2017, China spent nearly $15 billion in Sri Lanka. By comparison, the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank group, says that between 1956 and 2016, it invested over $1 billion.
Jeff Smith points out that along with the Hambantota port investments, Beijing loaned Sri Lanka $200 million in 2010 for a second international airport and a year later a further $810 million for the "second phase of the port project."
There was more. $272 million for a railway in 2013 and more than $1 billion for the Colombo Port City project, ventures that hired mostly Chinese workers (one Sri Lankan report put the number of Chinese workers dedicated to projects in 2009 at 25,000), and all with money Sri Lanka could barely afford to repay.
By 2015, Sri Lanka owed China $8 billion, and Sri Lankan government officials predicted that accumulated foreign debt -- both owed to China and other countries -- would eat up 94% of the country's GDP.
After an equity swap, an IMF bailout and more control over the projects ceded to Beijing, the terms of the debt were restructured, giving Sri Lanka some breathing space.
In 2017, however, the Hambantota port proved too costly for Sri Lanka to sustain.
"They (the Chinese) called in the debt, and the debt has been paid by Sri Lanka giving them the (Hambantota) port. That port then gives them not only a strategic access point into India's sphere of influence through which China can deploy its naval forces, but it also gives China an advantageous position to export its goods into India's economic sphere, so it's achieved a number of strategic aims in that regard," said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Sydney.
"This is part of a determined strategy by China to extend its influence across the Indian Ocean at the expense of India and it's using Sri Lanka to achieve it," he said.
Details of the new agreement between China and Sri Lanka have not been made public.
The port is an "important project aimed at spurring local economic growth based on equality and mutual benefits," according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It declined to answer further when asked by reporters.
'Creating demand for Chinese goods'
China's claiming of controlling stakes in strategic ports along critical shipping lanes -- what analysts have taken to referring to as its "string of pearls" -- beginning at the Straits of Malacca and dotting the Indian Ocean, should signal Beijing's ultimate ambitions, said Davis.
"There's a bigger picture here, that the more you invest in the Belt and Road initiative, the more the Chinese are in a position to force your country to align politically in terms of policy," Davis told CNN.
"So you become dependent on their investment and their largesse, and you're less likely to be critical of them and you're more likely to accommodate their interests strategically."
China launched its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) development strategy in 2013, investing in projects that include thousands of miles of highways in Pakistan, an international airport in Nepal and a rail link between China and Laos. The initiative would come to span more than 68 countries and encompass 4.4 billion people and up to 40% of global GDP. Consisting of two distinct parts, the Silk Road Economic Belt would stretch from China to Europe and include a host of trade and infrastructure projects, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road would be a sea-based network of shipping lanes and port developments throughout Asia and the Pacific.
Beijing's other potential partners are finding difficulty with some of their own joint projects.
Last November the government in Nepal scrapped a $2.5 billion deal with a Chinese company to build the biggest hydropower plant in the Himalayan country because of "irregularities" in the award process. The current Nepalese government, which had replaced the cabinet that had approved the earlier deal, announced the contract would instead go to a state-owned Nepali company.
In Myanmar, a $3.6 billion dam project has stalled. The then-military backed government suspended work on the Myitsone dam in the north of the country in 2011, with talks regarding its future ongoing.
Pakistan withdrew from a $14 billion agreement with China for a dam last November because the conditions of the deal included China taking ownership of the project and were "not doable and against our interests," Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority chairman Muzammil Hussain was quoted as saying. Like Nepal, Pakistan has since indicated it would also look to shoulder the cost of the dam rather than go to an outside investor.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed to be unaware of this when asked about the situation by reporters in Beijing in December. The country's top economic planning agency later said that the two countries were discussing cooperating on the dam project but that there'd been no discussion of proposals to move it forward. The agency said "Pakistan media's reporting on this project has been inaccurate, or only represented the views of certain officials."
But China is still spending in Pakistan. It is building a hydroelectric power station in the Rawalpindi district, and it is developing the port of Gwadar, strategically located on the Arabian Sea.
In Malaysia, China is spending $7.2 billion on a new deep sea port in the Straits of Malacca and working on infrastructure projects on the country's eastern seaboard.
China's trade deal with the Maldives government included investments in developing the international airport and a bridge, but the Maldives in return has taken on a significant number of controversial loan obligations.
Last July, former President Mohamed Nasheed said the loan interest the traditionally Indian ally pays to service its foreign debt to China is more than 20% of the country's budget. He said that part of the deal included China's receipt of 16 "strategically located islands" in navigation sea-lanes.
Dean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, said that the initial wave of Chinese investments in the Indian Ocean, the so-called string of pearls, was largely driven by economic considerations. The investments, he said, "would facilitate economic growth, which would benefit Chinese companies. Moreover, the construction projects would entail Chinese workers (a feature of most Chinese projects abroad, bringing their own work force), and create a demand base for Chinese goods."
At the same time, he said the Chinese are clearly intent on creating a friendly political network of states. "There's nothing inherently dangerous about political considerations in economic investments," he told CNN. "It would be foolish to think that any state is wholly driven by economic considerations."
Whither India
The ever-encroaching Chinese presence into India's sphere of political and economic influence has been noted, but so far, says Manoj Joshi, New Delhi purports to be unruffled, as long as Hambantota remains a commercial port, and no Chinese naval vessels suddenly appear in the vicinity.
"In 2014 a Chinese submarine was spotted in Colombo harbor and that was the first time we saw that and the Indian side was a bit concerned," said Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. At the time Indian defense officials expressed "serious concern" to their Sri Lankan counterpart, and naval chiefs from both countries met to discuss the incidents. Then-Defense Minister Arun Jaitley said the government "keeps a constant watch on all developments concerning our national security and economic interests and takes necessary measures to safeguard them."
A Chinese submarine and a Chinese warship were allowed to dock at the Colombo port in November 2014, just under two months after another Chinese submarine called into the same port. At the time both China and Sri Lanka dismissed New Delhi's concerns, saying the vessels were on refueling stops during anti-piracy missions. Colombo port regularly hosts ships from numerous navies, including the US. But as China's own navy becomes more 'blue water' [as in, able to move in open oceans around the world and not just in its own surrounding waters] these appearances will be more commonplace.
"It's geopolitical competition and India sees itself as the foremost nation in Asia and with the Chinese building a port, building and airport, building roads in Sri Lanka, they've emerged as big investors there and the Indians are obviously feeling somewhat nervous because India doesn't have those kind of resources to compete with," Joshi told CNN.
"What we worry about is, we already have a border problem with China and now that competition goes to the Indian Ocean region. That could be against our interests."
India and China share a 2,500 mile-long border, and have regularly faced off over perceived intrusions on each other's terrain as well as activity in uninhabited territory claimed by China and Bhutan, an Indian ally.
"Everybody talks about China and India being major rivals, I think China doesn't see India as a genuine long-term rival, I think it looks at India and sees a classic case of democracy gone wrong," said Yvonne Chiu, assistant professor in the politics department at the University of Hong Kong.
"India is incredibly corrupt, its infrastructure is terrible, and it is riddled with religious and demographic problems," she told CNN. "Except it is very large. It does have a big population as well and it's on the border. So it's a regional rival, but I don't think they take India seriously as a global rival."
For its part, India is now taking an active interest in Hambantota. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to be in talks with Sri Lanka about taking over the airport near the port, which was built using Chinese funds that Beijing itself wants to manage and is pushing for control with the Sri Lankan government. During a media briefing last November, Raveesh Kumar, an official spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, would only say that New Delhi has "a lot of developmental projects" going on in Sri Lanka and declined to elaborate further. Colombo has yet to make a decision involving the airport.
And New Delhi continues to actively participate in large-scale naval exercises in regional waters alongside allies Japan, and the US, and into the future, possibly Australia too, all to Beijing's continued consternation.
Last year's Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal involving the US, Japan and India were the largest the region has seen in more than two decades.
"India, of course, remains highly influential in Sri Lanka, and would not look kindly on any effort to pressure the government on matters related to defense and national security," said Jeff Smith. "Nor would the Sri Lankan military, which values its exchanges with the US."
Modi will be in Singapore in June, attending the Shangri-La dialogue, an annual meeting of defense ministers, military chiefs and defense officials from the Asia-Pacific. His keynote address will be carefully watched for words on China's maritime expansion.
White House unable to compete with China
South Asia's problems are not on Washington's radar right now, says Hong Kong University professor Chiu. The White House has much of its focus -- along with a substantial naval presence -- directed towards the Korean Peninsula and the ongoing crisis there. And while the US is distracted, China is slowly and incrementally changing the seascape in the Asia Pacific. China claims disputed islands in the South China Sea as part of its territory and has been militarizing some of those islands, reclaiming land on others and turning sandbars into islands to assert sovereignty over the area.
"Everything that they do, like building these islands (in the South China Sea) and stuff that is illegal internationally, but nobody wants to get into a conflict over, it adds up and you have a new status quo and it's too late to do anything about it," Chiu said.
"China can't afford to go to war over anything ... it would most likely lose against a major power ... but these kind of small incremental things, people will let them get away with. As long as they're patient, it could have the same effect as going to war."
Even as China has taken the long view, Dean Cheng argues it's never too late for the US and its allies to do something to counter Beijing's ambitions.
"The US, in cooperation with India, Japan and possibly the European Union, could offer alternative financing," Cheng said. "They could help train local officials, lawyers, etc, to become better negotiators. They can push for transparency, especially in Chinese-sponsored institutions to make clear the terms of the loans, payback processes, as well as how contracts are rewarded."
As 2017 wrapped up, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua published a dispatch from Colombo, describing how the Hambantota port was "now racing along a developmental fast-track."
Chinese and Sri Lankan workers were building a highway north of the port, along with a bridge, and the Chinese Harbor Engineering Company is negotiating with the Sri Lankan government to develop a Logistics Zone that will include a natural gas power plant and refineries, the agency reported.
On the first day of the new year, the Chinese flag flew beside Sri Lanka's at the port for the first time ever.
The Chinese Harbor Engineering Company began 2018 with a $1 billion investment to build three 60-story office towers in Colombo.
Rather than resist getting into further debt, Sri Lanka's government appears to be making more deals with China that it will may yet struggle to pay back. (CNN)

Time traveller claims to have been to the year 6000
Step aside Doctor Who, this man says he has been to the future and has a photo to prove it.
The bizarre video shows the time traveller, whos face is blurred, meeting a reporter at an undisclosed location to reveal what he knows about secret technologies and what the future holds for humanity in the year 6000.
The self-appointed whistleblower, who has his voice distorted, claims to have been part of a secret program to send people forward in time in the 1990s.
He says advances in medicine, government and new technology will make modern life seem primitive, and humankind lives in peace under the benevolent rule of an AI overlord.
To prove his point, in the middle of a rambling speech he produces a photo of what an unnamed city. Unfortunately it is so blurred it has more in common with a Monet watercolour painting than a futuristic cityscape.
But hold your horses - he claims: In the time travel process pictures tend to get distorted, as well as many other things.
He adds: I know a lot of you are going to find my story extremely hard to believe and I dont blame you and if I was watching somebody claim these same things I myself would most likely not believe them. It is not my intention to deceive anybody, I simply want to spread a message about the future of humanity and where the world is heading. I have seen the way the worlds changed and the technologies that have emerged it would blow your mind if you only knew the technologies that exist in the year 6000.
In a bizarre twist, the time traveller begins weeping as he reveals he left a close friend behind who can never return. I know hes in a good place. In a way the future is like a utopia but sadly when we attempted to travel back we couldnt. I just wanted to see him one more time.
In an apparent reference to the film Downsizing, he adds that in the future technology will allow people to shrink down so space wont be a problem.
Whether you beleive him or not you wont have long to wait - he says time travel will become common knowledge by 2028. The vid, was uploaded earlier this month to ApexTV, a channel specialising in mysteries and the paranormal . It already has more than 3 million views.

Protecting freedom harder than winning it
Protecting the freedom we have won is harder than winning it. We need the commitment of all ethnicities to protect it, Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said.
The Governor was addressing the gathering at an Independence Day ceremony organised by the Central Provincial Council together with the District Secretariat.
"As we marked the 70th Independence Day yesterday, we remembered those who sacrificed their lives to win us the freedom after we were under the foreign rule for five centuries .
Having attended an event organised by the Kandy Municipal Council to garland the statue of D.S. Senanayake, next to the Maha Maluwa of the Temple of the Tooth Relic, the Governor attended the main event held at the Bogambara Grounds.
This year marks 200 years since Monarawila Keppetipola rebelled against the British rule in 1818 and the historic Kandyan Convention was signed as the island was completely taken by the British rule, she said.
The President took the first step to correct the mistake made by the British by declaring Keppetipola and others national heroes, Ekanayake said.
"A countrys freedom is ensured when there is unity among its communities. The government is taking steps to bring about ethnic and religious reconciliation," she said.
As D.S. Senanayake united all races to win independence, we must come together to build the nation, the Governor said.

True freedom dawns only with sound economy
True freedom dawns only when people can earn a living through a sound economy which provides them with jobs and livelihoods. No matter which party is in power, they have to focus on this and have a programme to achieve it, Sabaragamuwa Province Governor, Presidents Counsel Marshal Perera said at the Ratnapura District Independence Day celebration yesterday.
The event was organized by the Ratnapura District Secretariat under the directive of the Secretary Malani Lokoupothagama.
Many think that we won the independence without bloodshed. They should remember that between 1018 to 1242, national heroes such as Weera Puranappu, Gongale Bandara, Keppetipola and the Maha Sangtha had sacrificed their lives for independence, he said.
The 1978 Constitution has mentioned the right to protest as important for freedom, but it has not included a persons right to life, I hope that the new constitution will include this clause, he said.
The Governor noted that every Wednesday, his office was similar to the OPD section of a hospital. Graduates and professionals queue up for jobs at my office, he said. In the recent past, graduates were employed through the Provincial Council System. But more are waiting for jobs. More focus needs to be taken to create jobs and develop the economy, he said. Religious leaders, Disaster Management Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankanda and other government officials participated.

Allianz to acquire Janashakthi General Insurance
Allianz, the global financial services leader, announced that it has entered into an agreement with Janashakthi Insurance PLC to acquire 100% of its subsidiary Janashakthi General Insurance Limited for Rs 16.4 billion.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2018. This acquisition makes Allianz Insurance Lanka (Allianz Lanka) one of the countrys largest general insurers, with a market share of approximately 20%. The acquisition will deliver a range of strategic benefits to all stakeholders.
Janashakthi Insurance PLC will continue to focus on its life insurance portfolio to strengthen its presence in the Sri Lankan life insurance industry, and remains committed to its vision of lighting the lamp of insurance in every home and workplace.
The consideration represents a multiple of 2.2x JGILs adjusted net asset value in 2017.
Janashakthi Insurance has been operating in Sri Lanka for over 23 years with a focus on motor, fire and health protection for individuals and corporates.
This transaction also represents one of the largest investments into Sri Lanka, demonstrating Allianzs confidence in this market. The Sri Lankan general insurance market has posted a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1% between 2010- 20161. This is expected to accelerate to 12.5% by 2020, driven by improving trade and macro-economic conditions, as well as increased insurance penetration.
George Sartorel, Allianzs Regional CEO for Asia Pacific, said: This transaction provides a highly attractive opportunity to transform our market presence in Sri Lanka, while accelerating our growth agenda in the Asia Pacific region.
Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka, said: Were excited about our future ahead, and look forward to welcoming Janashakthi customers and employees to the Allianz family.
Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director, Janashakthi Insurance PLC, said: I am convinced that this amalgamation with Allianz represents the natural progression of JGILs evolution from a small, home grown general insurance business to a leader in the industry, while reflecting the strength of the business weve built over the last 23 years.

[APPRECIATIONS - (05-02-2018)]
Rev. Bro. Stephen Modestus
An indelible influence
It is with sorrow that I write this appreciation of Rev. Bro. Modestus FSC, who passed away peacefully on February 7, 2003. Bro. Modestus was the first old boy Director of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, and in addition, he later became Director of St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, as well. Bro. Modestus hailed from Katukurunda in Moratuwa and was the son of Joseph Peiris and Inez Bastiana Fernando. He was the second Moratuwite to join the La Sallian Institutethe first being Rev. Bro. Cassim Charles. He joined the juniorate in September, 1930, and after a brief period, went to the novitiate in Penang.
In August, 1932, Bro. Stephen entered the scholasticate at Mutwal and took his vows as a Christian Brother. In January, 1934, he joined De Mazenod College, Kandana, as a teacher and at the end of that year, joined St. Mary's School, Pettah. ln 1939, he was transferred to the De La Salle College, to be in charge of the kindergarten department. He was also involved in various activities relating to the primary school.
He took over the St. Benedict's College branch at Veyangoda as principal and was also in charge of its boarding house. ln 1945, he was re-transferred St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, as the prefect of boarders and the junior classes. From 1947 to 1954, he served as the principal of the primary school, prefect of boarders and prefect of games at De Mazenod College. Subsequently, he was appointed as the principal of St. Andrews College, Puttalam.
In 1956, he came back to St. Sebastian's College as the principal of the primary department and sub-director of the College. In 1959, he became the director and thereby, created history as the first past pupil to become the director of the school. Due to his efforts, the number of students enrolling rose to 1,500, with 99 percent of them being Catholics. It was also he who formed the scout troop, which brought many a glory to the school.
During this period, Bro. Modestus winning ways earned himself the invaluable assistance of the then Moratuwa parish priest Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernandothe Bishop of Badulla. He found many ways to raise funds for the college. In 1964, he returned to St. Benedict's College as head of the primary department and prefect of boarders and ultimately became the acting director. In 1977, he went into retirement, yet in 1978, returned to St. Sebastian's College. The government recognized his services in the sphere of education and appointed him an All-Island Justice of Peace.
May his soul rest in peace.
P. Perera
Dr A. J. M. J. B. Walalawela
charismatic man
Nirvana is not the blowing out of the candle. It is the extinguishing of the flame because the day is come.- Rabindranath Tagore.
Walale, as he was known to his friends, was a charismatic, soft-spoken, young medical student when we first met him at the Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Sciences Faculty of the Peradeniya University on January 18, 1972the date he referred to as the jour de gloire in his editorial for the souvenir published at the reunion in October, 2016.
On being awarded his medical degree, the young Dr. Walawela was posted to the Badulla General Hospital, where he undertook his early training, followed by a tenure as a medical officer at Minipe and then at Deltota in the Central Province. Towards the end of 1983, he travelled to Oman for a brief spell as a general practitioner, and on returning to Sri Lanka, he was betrothed to Nilani Ratnayake, a school teacher whom he later married on September 19, 1985. Attracted to the specialty of medical administration, he took up the position of deputy director at the Peradeniya University Hospital, serving the people of Kandy his place of birth.
He took special responsibilities for the education of professions allied to medicine, especially the area of nursing. He was then promoted as the medical services regional director for the Monaragela district, ensuring the smooth functioning of government institutions. He was skillful and fair, but a firm administrator with an affable personality whose admirable qualities held him in good stead to uphold the ethos contained within the national policy of providing a free medical service to the people of Sri Lanka.
He was subsequently appointed by the Health Ministry as the National Quarantine Services director, taking charge of preventive health with the main focus on the ports of entry, playing a vital role at the peak of the avian AHIN1 flu epidemic. He represented Sri Lanka at the ASEAN Conference held in Manilla, Philippines, in 2009; chairing some of the plenaries addressing the challenges posed by the avian flu epidemic in the South East Asian region. He was also called in to manage the crisis that followed the scandal in connection with the importation of digestive biscuits from India, around the same time.Walale retired from the national health service in 2010, at the compulsory retirement age of 60. Being a workaholic, he was unable to decline an offer as the company medical director for a private sector establishment, the Ihala Kothmale plant based in Talawakalle, where he spent the next two years, by which time he had spent most of his working life serving the nation away from Kandyaway from his family. His failing health at that stage meant that he was unable to continue his job. He returned to Kandy to spend his remaining days at Katugastota, in his family home, with his wife and children.
Jayananda Bandara Walalawela was born on November 9, 1950. He was one of six children. His father was a direct descendant of Dingirirala, who while dwelling in the village of Walalawela in the Hangurangetha district, rebelled alongside Puran Appu and Gongale Goda banda, against the British in the mid-18th century.
He received his primary education in Kandy at Vidyartha College, moving on to St. Sylvesters. With academic achievements at both schools, Walale entered the Ceylon University, as it was then called, in 1972, opting to read medicine at the historic and scenic Paradeniya campus.
A modest man of ethical principles focused on simple living, he defied many of his contemporaries during the 1983 civil unrest and the ensuing turmoil often referred to as
Black July, treating the victims of violence with compassion, no matter which ethnic background they belonged tosomething his son Niluksha recalls with pride.
An avid reader, a linguist with an aptitude for Sinhala, English, and French, Walale was a great admirer and follower of the late Prof. Ediriweera Sarathchandra, the renowned playwright and dramatist. Gifted with a liberal mind and incisive analytical skill, he was a caring father and a loving husband, never prescriptive towards his children. His daughter, Chamalka, reminisces how Walale discouraged them from sitting their year five scholarship exams, for he believed that children should learn, but not be compelled to compete at this young age; a view that is shared by many contemporary western educationalists promoting equality.
Walale was a grateful servant of his alma mater, actively contributing to the OBA functions. He had an interest in tennis, rugby, and cricket, volunteering as a sports medical officer to various organisations. He accompanied the SAARC team to India in the early 90's as its medical officer. He wrote to newspapers in his spare time and also organised several blood donation camps.
Although a quite and an unassuming introvert, he was a raconteur of class, fondly remembered by his batch mates as the great networker who brought them together to Kandy in October, 2016, to celebrate a reunion 40 years since graduationa remarkable feat, given that this batch is now scattered all around the globe. Many of his friends will recall the trouble he took to attend the event with Nilani despite his poor health, for he wanted to be among us, celebrating the big day. Little did we realise that it was going to be our last meeting with him in person!
A nominal Buddhist with an altruistic attitude towards humanity, Dr. Walalawelas legacy could be described in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once said, The quality, not the longevity, of ones life, is what is important.
May his soul rest in peace.
Dr. Jayananda Bandara Walalawela was called to rest on the Dec 25, 2017, and is survived by his son, Niluksha; daughter, Chamalka; and wife, Nilani. Dr. Chandra Abrew, Dr. Gamini Jayasekera, Dr. Nanda Wahalawatte, and Dr. Sathi Ariyanayagam
Gamini Iryagolla
Honest patriot
Gamini Iryagolla was the son of late veteran politician I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla. He was educated at Royal College, Colombo 7.
He was a constitutional lawyer, writer, political critic and civil servant, and was also a patriot who took an honest effort to eradicate the country's ethnic conflict.
Dear Gamini, you always strove to create a rapport among the various nationalities in or country. As a Buddhist, you always followed the ways of the Buddha.
May you attain he Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
Lalitha Bopearatchy, Dalugama, Kelaniya
M. J. Tissainayagam
Man of integrity
I consider it a great honour and privilege to have been given the opportunity of paying a tribute to my one-time colleague and friend late M. J. Tissainayagam and to commemorate his exemplary life and illustrious career.
Tissainayagam lived a healthy, fruitful and blissful life of nearly 97 years, which in itself is ample testimony to the sober, principled and disciplined life he led. The secret of his longevity lies in the fact that he did not over-indulge in the temptations of life. He did not over-eat, over-dress or overspend. He shunned ostentatious living. The net result was that he was not afflicted by debilitating diseases.
He was born on July 12, 1920, into an aristocratic Tamil family from Jaffna. His father was the late G. S. Tissainayagam, who was one of the earliest Ceylonese to hold the post of district engineer in the Public Works Department (the forerunner to the Highways Department). Thanks to the spread of missionary education under the British rule, Tissainayagam was able to obtain a wholesome and liberal education from three of the best known educational institutions; namely Trinity College, Kandy, St. John's College, Jaffna, and St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. His educational pursuits earned him two degrees from the London University; namely BA in Arts and BSc. in Economics, which at that time, was a rare feat.
After graduation, he chose a journalistic career and served with distinction as a columnist and sub-editor at the Times of Ceylon in the late 1940's. His writing caught the eye of the Times Editor Frank Moraes, who sent him to England for further training in 1947. He worked for the Manchester Guardian, among other newspapers in England. He returned to Ceylon in 1950 and entered what was his most productive period as a journalist. He wrote the column Not that it Matters for the Times of Ceylon. He then moved from the Times Group to its rival, Lake House, as leader-writer, columnist and a sub-editor for the Observer and Daily News. There, he wrote a column known as Men and Matters under the pen name Thissayan.
In October, 1953, Tissainayagam entered the Government Civil Service by joining the Government Information Department as an assistant director. He was promoted to deputy director in 1968 and reached the top as the Government Information Department (D.G.I as its known today) director in 1977. He retired in 1978 after serving in the Department for 25 years. He also functioned as the Government Film Unit (GFU) director between 1972 and 1974.
I first met Tiss (as he was fondly called) 55 years ago in 1962, when the Information and Broadcasting departments were amalgamated and brought under one roof under one Director General. At that time, radio broadcasting was a state monopoly and I held the post of Broadcasting and National Service director and Tiss was the Government Information Department assistant director. During his tenure of office in the Government Information Department, he was called upon to function as the chief co-ordinator and press liaison officer during Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ceylon in 1954, The Asian Prime Ministers Conference in 1955, and the Non-Aligned Heads of State Summit in 1976. Whilst holding the post of Government Information Department assistant/deputy director, Tissainayagam was also appointed as the competent authority on press censorship at various times of national crisisprominent among them being the assassination of former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in 1959, the aftermath of the failed military coup d'etat of 1962, and the first JVP insurrection in 1971.
He also headed the first Ceylon Government Press Delegation to China in 1958. During his tenure in the department, he was the Ceylon Today editorthe monthly journal of the Government Information Department from 1954 to 1972, in addition to being the editor of numerous other publications as well.
Even though Tissainayagam retired from government service in 1978, he was too good a public treasure to be allowed to wither away into oblivion. Thus in 1979, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa called him back into the administrative service by offering him the post of assistant secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, which he accepted. For Tiss, this marked the beginning of another long innings of 15 years. Once again, I had the privilege of working with him when I assumed duties as the Prime Minister's secretary in 1983.
For four decades, from 1953 to 1994, Tissainayagam was impeccable in communicating information in readable, lucid prose. He was never found wanting in his job, for he was intelligent and far-sighted. His non-abrasive, kind and genial personality enabled him to win friends and influence people. Above all, his honesty and integrity were beyond reproach.
His allegiance and service to the government were good as those to God. He always acted as the guardian deity of his family; especially his wife, Ratnaleela and children Jeyaprakash and Romesh, who treasured him and now, sadly miss him.
May his soul rest in peace!

Albert Fernando
Courteous individual
It has been 21 years since Albert Clarence Fernando entered eternal glory to be with his maker. February 11, 2018 will be his 21st death anniversary. He was the clerical staff chief of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, which was also my alma mater.
He was a loyal old boy of the college, an active member of its OBA, as well as a live-wire of the college teachers guild for many years. During his period of tenure, he served the college administration without any fear.
Albert was the college OBA treasurer for over 15 years continuously, and also its vice president, the teachers guild president and treasurer, a welfare society member, and also served in almost all committees in various capacities. In all projects organized by the OBA to raise funds for the college, he was the person who was entrusted with the responsibility of handling large sums of monies collected from the public.
I remember well that at several carnivals organized to raise funds, he was there at the office until late hours. In whatever capacity he worked, he gave his best while performing his duties.
Albert, who was always smartly dressed in immaculate white, was one of the earliest to arrive and commence work, patiently and silently. Likewise, he was the last to return home after work, often after 5 p.m. His integrity and dedication to the work entrusted to him was unique. He never looked for positions or perks, but performed his duties, leaving no loopholes.
He gave his wholehearted co-operation to all the Rev. directors under whom he worked. Albert Fernando was one who always stood by the La Sallian Brothers. My association with him began from my school days and I can proudly say that he never uttered a word to hurt the feelings of others and was courteous and kind to all those who came seeking his assistance.
May his soul rest in peace in the presence of his maker.

Tribute
Emmanuel Cecil Sandrasegara
Charming centenary
I am delighted to send my greetings and congratulations to dearest Emmanuel Cecil Sandrasegara of Mathagal, Jaffna, born on January 24, 1918, who celebrated his 100th birthday this year. All his beloved children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, relatives, and friends, both here and abroad, celebrated the God-gifted precious day at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Emmanuel's parents, late Muthiah Sandrasegara and late Victoria Chellammah Sandrasegara, both orthodox Catholic parents, were blessed with four sons and two daughters. Emmanuel, as the third son in the family, received the love and affection of all and was everyone's pet.
After completing his secondary education at St. Henrys College in Illavalai, Emmanuel joined the Bank of Ceylon very early in life and served with exemplary records, retiring in September, 1976, after serving his full term. His honesty, punctuality, and hard work were appreciated by his superiors, who presented him with promotions. He earned the highest respect of his colleagues and juniors. Mathagal is a village in the Jaffna diocese where St. Joseph Vaz preached the word of God and converted many to Christianity. The Catholic inhabitants of the area built a church in honour of St. Anthony there. Emmanuel, having inherited his faith in God from his parents, became deeply religious.
Emmanuel married Mangairkarasy, and they were blessed with a daughter, Ratneswary and two sons; Raveendran and Pullendran. Being a devoted husband and affectionate father, he educated his children and brought them up in the fear of God and instilled in them noble qualities to blossom in their lives. A man of sound character with virtuous qualities, ever cheerful with a pleasant and charming disposition and greeting every one with his radiant smile, he is always there to serve others voluntarily in their needs and never spoke ill of others. He is also talented in entertaining his friends with witty jokes.
His priority in life is to attend all weddings and funerals of friends, relatives, and every known person in the village. His life was not all rosy; he lost his beloved wife, Mangai and his daughter Ratnes, but his faith in God and St. Anthony sustained him through all his trials and tribulations.
Late Augustine Sandrasegara, elder brother of Emmanuel, who was working as government officer in Kayts, often visited our home in Karampon to renew family relationships with my mother, Thangarasam Soosaipillai. In fact, his mother, late Chellammah Sandrasegera, called akka by my mother, brought the marriage proposal for my sister Clinett to Dr. Joe Peter from Green Shade, Mathagal.
As an Extraordinary Eucharistic Minister of Holy Communion from St. Lawrences Parish, I was privileged to visit Emmanuel in the Elders' Home in Wellawatte and offer him holy communion on first Fridays.
May the Lord Almighty shower his blessings on Emmanuel and grace him good health and long life!
