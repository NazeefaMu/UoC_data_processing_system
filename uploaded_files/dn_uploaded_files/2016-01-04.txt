N. Korea opens "Sci-Tech Complex" in Pyongyang
KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has opened a science and technology complex in Pyongyang, the North's state media said Saturday, adding another ostentatious building to the impoverished country's showcase capital.
His attendance at the ceremony on Friday marked his first public appearance since his New Year address, when he vowed to raise living standards in the struggling one-party Stalinist state.
Inspecting the complex, he said it was "a great centre" open to everybody for study and "for disseminating [the] latest science and technology in which the party's plan has been materialised", Pyongyang's KCNA news agency reported.
He said the completion of the complex was testimony to the great importance the Worker's Party of Korea attaches to the development of science and technology.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits the newly opened Sci-Tech Complex in this photo released on October 28, 2015.
"It is the party's firm determination to ... advance the establishment of a rich and powerful fatherland through the locomotive of science and technology", Kim said in his New Year speech. The complex is located on a "propitious site" near the Taedong River in the capital, Prime Minister Pak Pong-Ju said during a speech at its opening ceremony.
Pyongyang's Korean Central TV broadcast footage of Kim cutting the ribbon to the gleaming structure amid rapturous applause from thousands of participants gathered in front of the building, as balloons floated into the air and a band struck up a tune, "Happy Tomorrow".
He was filmed touring the building, which a TV commentator said was modelled on the structure of a nucleus. A mock-up model of the North's Unha rocket that put a satellite into orbit in 2012 was on display in the complex.
Pyongyang has a myriad of monuments and pompous edifices of dubious purpose spawned by the personality cult of the ruling Kim dynasty, for which money and resources have been syphoned from its threadbare economy. - AFP

P.I. Pieris of Cambridge University fame was twice SLC president
Percival Ian Pieris who died on Friday at the age of 82 following a long illness was twice president of Sri Lanka Cricket and in both circumstances it was certain forces within the Cricket Board that ensured his exit.
Pieris first term as president of the Cricket Board in 1989 lasted just four months. He resigned on principle on an issue involving the submitting of names to the then Sports Minister Nanda Mathew to form the national selection committee. He and the Cricket Boards executive committee did not see eye to eye on the need to follow the instructions of the Sports Minister. Pieris decision to resign was the first by a Cricket Board president in Sri Lanka.
It took everybody by surprise, recalled Pieris in an interview. They couldnt find a suitable person for the post because no one was willing to become president. Then they appointed a politician Lakshman Jayakody. Jayakody lasted for six months before Pieris was again elected president for a second term in June 1990.
I had a lot of support from the clubs and they wanted me to come as president and persuaded me to stand again for election against Jayakody. Lakshman was a perfect gentleman.
He never used political influence to get votes which politicians can do. Eventually I beat him and became president again but after one year they got rid of me, Pieris said.
During his second term Pieris along with S Skandakumar who was secretary did a lot of ground work to get international tours started to Sri Lanka for since the Pettah bus stand bomb blast in 1987, no team was willing to tour the country due to the security situation at the time.
We worked hard to convince a touring side to come again to Sri Lanka. Skanda was a very able administrator and talker and we eventually managed to convince the Australian Cricket Board to send their Academy side in 1990. It broke the five-year drought.
The manager of the team Cameron Battersby from Queensland gave a good report about us which convinced the ACB to send their senior team to Sri Lanka in 1992 with Battersby as manager, said Pieris. My period as president was bad times. It was during the JVP insurrection in 1989 and we didnt have any money.
No one was willing to come forward to sponsor a tournament. We had a simple scheme to take cricket out of Colombo. Michael (Tissera) and I travelled the country and spoke to people but we ran short of money, he said.
Pieris represented his country from 1953 till 1967 and had a distinguished cricket career playing as a top order batsman for S. Thomas College, Mt Lavinia and as a right-arm opening bowler for SSC, Cambridge University and All-Ceylon (as the national team was then known).
At S. Thomas College, Mt Lavinia for whom he played first eleven cricket for four years from 1950 Pieris was considered primarily a batsman who could bowl, but by the time it came to his final year his bowling had developed so much that he was considered a bowling all-rounder and opened bowling for the school.
Pieris best years at S Thomas was in 1952 and 1953 when they beat traditional rivals Royal College by eight wickets and by an innings and 34 runs respectively. Pieris had a match bag of eight wickets in 1952 and the following year as captain he took six wickets in the match and scored a brilliant century (123) sharing in a record fifth wicket stand of 187 with Geoff Wijesinghe (64).
While at school Pieris made his international debut for his country when he was picked to play against Lindsay Hassetts Australian team in 1953. He later joined SSC, but one of his ambitions was to play on the hallowed turf at Lords.
With the help of Gamini Goonesena, a top class all-rounder who played for Sri Lanka, SSC and Cambridge University, Pieris who had enough academic qualification managed to secure a place at Cambridge University.
He played cricket three years for the University from 1956 under Michael Melluish, Gamini Goonesena and Ted Dexter.
Among his team mates were Bob Barber and Roger Prideaux who later went to play for England and Ian McLachlan who played for Australia. Pieris didnt play in the traditional match against Oxford University at Lords in his first year, but in 1957 and 1958 he was a member of the side that beat their rivals.
Pieris graduated with Honours degree in Economics and joining Richard Pieris Company served them for 40 years before retiring in 2002 as its Deputy Chairman/Managing Director.
Pieris best contribution for his country was as a batsman at No. 11 when he scored 46 not out (1 six, 7 fours) in an entertaining last wicket partnership of 110 in 53 minutes with Neil Chanmugam (72) in the unofficial Test against West Indies at P Sara Oval in March 1967.
Recalling that innings Pieris said: I was angry with the captain, the selectors and with everybody because I was sent to bat at no. 11. I felt that there were many who were sent before me. I was so angry I thought to myself that I am going to show these chaps that I can bat.
Fortunately for me Neil also stuck there. Thats how I scored 46 not out fuelled in cold fury.
Reflecting back on his career, Pieris once said, All my life was memorable. Wherever I went I did many things in many spheres on the cricket field and off it which were delightful memorable days. The four years at S. Thomas of course is very special. The Royal-Thomian match in this country is very special so I would say they were memorable.
If there is one thing that Pieris regretted doing in life was to stop being active in sports. Apart from cricket he also played golf and tennis. However a back problem which he developed forced him to stop all sports in 2003 and it plagued him till his death. He was married to Gunvor (Gun) of golfing fame.

Police in a hard fought 24-7 win over Air Force

Police SC romped to a rather underperformed win against a fighting Air Force outfit by 24 points (2 tries, 2 conversions) to 7 (1 try, 1 conversion) in their Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby match played at Air Force grounds, Ratmalana yesterday.
The winners led 7-nil at the breather.
Police got their act together and the momentum rather late in the second half by scoring a total of four tries to which the Air Force replied with only one.
For Police flanker Chanaka Harishchandra opened scoring and the other tries came from flanker Radeesha Seneviratna, Joel Perera with nippy scrum half Sudan Sooriarachchi touching down for the final try off a brilliant three quarter move. Full back Reeza Mubarak put over two conversions.
The solitary try for Air Force was scored by their full back Nuwan Perera who also made the conversion. He had an outstanding game with his booming kicks to touch to go along with his safe collection and sizzling runs down the line while also manning the last line of defence.
Army trounce CH 50-6
In another game played at the Army grounds in Diyagama the rejuvenated Army side virtually thrashed the hapless CH and FC by 50 points (8 tries, 5 conversions) to 6 (2 penalties). Army led 17-3 at lemons. - (WAI)

Stokes puts South Africa to sword

Cape Town, Sunday: England all-rounder Ben Stokes hit a thrilling double century as he and Jonny Bairstow battered the South African bowlers into submission on the second day of the second Test at Newlands on Sunday.
Stokes slammed 258 and Bairstow made 150 not out before England declared on 629 for six. The pair shared a world Test record sixth wicket partnership of 399. Stokes' score was the highest by a number six batsman in Tests.
Stokes followed up by having South African opening batsman Dean Elgar caught at point as South Africa reached 141 for two at the close, still 488 runs behind.
The left-handed Stokes thrashed 30 fours and 11 sixes in a 197-ball innings. He reached his double century off 163 balls, the second fastest in Tests behind Nathan Astle's 153-ball effort for New Zealand against England at Christchurch in 2001/02.
He reached 250 with a six off Kagiso Rabada to become the fastest to the mark in Tests, beating Virender Sehwag's effort for India against Sri Lanka in Mumbai in 2009 by 11 balls.
With a declaration imminent, Stokes pounded the next delivery into the stands for another six before, in trying to hit a third, he skied the ball to AB de Villiers at mid-on. De Villiers dropped it but ran out Stokes with a direct hit to the bowler's end.
The South African bowlers had no answer to a relentless assault, which started with 45 runs scored off the first four overs of the day, bowled by Morne Morkel and Chris Morris.
The left-handed Stokes needed only 12 balls go from his overnight 74 to his third Test century, which he made off 105 deliveries with 16 fours and a six. He quickly went past his previous highest Test score, 120 against Australia at Perth two seasons ago.
South African captain Hashim Amla was soon forced to place fielders on the boundary on both sides of the wicket but Stokes continued to power the ball past them.

Sumathipala sweeps the board at SLC elections

Sri Lanka's World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga and his brother Nishantha Ranatunga suffered humiliating defeats at the Sri Lanka Cricket elections where former president Thilanga Sumathipala swept the board with all the candidates his team fielded being elected to their respective posts.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga under whose captaincy Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996 was one of four who contested for the two posts of vice-president but the 80 votes he received was insufficient to guarantee him a place as two others from the rival camp Jayantha Dharmadasa (102 votes) and K Mathivanan (90 votes) were elected. A fourth contestant Asanga Seneviratne received 18 votes.
Former secretary Nishantha Ranatunga contesting the SLC presidency for the first time was easily defeated by Sumathipala by a majority of 32 votes. Ranatunga received 56 to Sumathipala's 88.
It was the fourth time that Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala has been elected SLC president after 1998-99, 2000-01 and 2003-04.
The post of secretary went to Mohan de Silva, a former SLC president who was elected uncontested when rival candidate Hirantha Perera withdrew.
CCC president Shammi Silva received the highest number of votes at the election garnering 115 votes to defeat Easman Narangoda (28 votes) for the post of Treasurer.
Former Panadura SC fast bowler and assistant secretary Ravin Wickremaratne also received a thumping 113 votes to be elected assistant secretary. He beat former SSC and Sri Lanka fast bowler Nilantha Ratnayake who received 30 votes.
Lalith Rambukwella was elected assistant treasurer with 108 votes defeating Nihal Lewke who managed only 36 votes. Two other contestants for the post Aruna de Silva and Sujeewa Lokuhewa withdrew.
"It gives me great pleasure, honour, privilege and an enormous amount of satisfaction to be in front of you this morning as the duly elected president of Sri Lanka Cricket," said Sumathipala addressing a media conference soon after his victory.
"It has been a long journey for all of us to be together. I am glad that the entire committee whom we had proposed got duly elected and we are one big team going to give the leadership to transform Sri Lanka cricket to the next level."
Sumathipala said that the pattern of voting by the various levels of representation in the country allowed them to choose the people who are best to transform the country's cricket.
Sumathipala thanked President Maithripala Sirisena and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera for laying the foundation to hold a free and fair election in the spirit of the game and to the letter of the Sports Law and the SLC constitution. He also thanked the Director-General of Sports K.D.S. Ruwanchandra for conducting the elections in a 'professional and meaningful way'.
"In the past 10 years there has been time and again interim committees appointed to run cricket in the country. We need put an end to interim committees and have elected bodies running cricket. Even the ICC does not recognized interim committees. We must thank the Minister of Sport for preparing the ground work to hold this election," Sumathipala said.
Elaborating further Sumathipala said, "We have made our plans - a six pillar five-year business plan in place for international cricket. Our first priority is to transform our national team into a consistently winning side and sustenance at the top."
"We need to have a national coach and our priority is the national team. Everything else like development and domestic structures can wait but the national team cannot. We are already behind schedule and we have wasted a lot of time, energy and efforts."
Sumathipala said that they have already designated Jayantha Dharmadasa to be in charge of international cricket, K Mathivanan to handle domestic cricket and Mohan de Silva - administration.
He also revealed that SLC would like to change its constitution in keeping with the Sports Law of the country.

'Tender procedure will be revised to eliminate corruption'
The tender procedure of drugs and medical equipment will be revised this year to eliminate corruption, malpractices and irregularities, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He made this observation recently at a function at the Colombo National Hospital to distribute medical equipment worth Rs. 3.8 million for the Orthopedic Surgical Unit of the hospital.
The minister also said that immediate measures will be taken to end the medical equipment shortage. Measures will also be taken to develop physical and infrastructure facilities of hospitals.
Special attention will also be paid on the discard of unused drugs as it is also a type of business. Around 300 million drugs are being discarded annually.
The pharmaceutical companies have agreed for a price formula on drugs. The Health Ministry annually import drugs worth Rs. 4 billion.
A software has been introduced to avoid the shortage of drugs.
"Doing health tests from the private institutions have already been banned for government hospitals and a procedure to do all the health tests at government hospitals will be implemented," he said.
National Hospital Director General Anil Jasinghe, State Pharmaceutical Corporation Chairman Sayura Samarasundara and Managing Director P. Sundaralingam also participated.

US-led strikes in Syria, Iraq hit IS middle-management
LEBANON: US-led strikes against Islamic State group officials in Iraq and Syria are robbing the jihadists of one of their most valuable resources: experienced mid-level commanders.
Ten of the group's higher-ups, including one with direct ties to the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks, were killed in air strikes in December alone, the US military said.
According to analysts, these deaths chip away at IS middle-management -- seasoned and skilled commanders within the group.
Because of their operational role and their experience, these figures are an invaluable human resource and a huge loss for IS, said Mathieu Guidere, a jihadism expert at the University of Toulouse.
Instead of focusing on IS's political chiefs the US-led coalition has targeted technical cadres and the mid-level commanders who, though they don't take the decisions, execute them, said Guidere.
Without them, nothing could be done on the ground.
Most of the commanders were killed in Iraq, where Washington is working with government forces, but others were targeted in Syria.
The dead include Charaffe el Mouadan, who had ties to the Paris attacks cell leader Abdelhamid Abaaoud and was killed in a coalition strike in Syria on December 24, according to the Pentagon.
Yunis Khalash, IS's deputy financial emir in the group's Iraqi stronghold Mosul, was killed on December 9, it said.
His death will burden senior ISIL (IS) cadres to find a technically skilled and trustworthy replacement, said US-led coalition spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.
Also killed in Iraq earlier this month was Khalil Ahmad Ali al-Wais, IS's emir of Kirkuk province, according to the Pentagon.
Iraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashimi said Al-Wais, known as Abu Waddah, also headed IS's internal communications and mail service. He named several other IS operatives killed in December, including leading members of the Hesba -- the force that implements IS's strict religious and social code. On the one hand, IS has lost its operational and executive capacity. On the other hand, it has lost its ability as a structured hierarchy to work together as a team, Hashimi said.
IS has also been dealt a series of military blows on the ground in recent weeks.
Earlier this week, Iraqi forces pushed the group out of the city of Ramadi, while an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria rolled the jihadists back across the Euphrates River.
Yezid Sayigh, an analyst at the Carnegie Middle East Centre, said IS's recent losses could be a sign that the United States is receiving better intelligence on the group's activities.
But it may also be a result of weakening security practice among IS personnel as more experienced cadres are taken out of action, he said.
The cumulative impact of these deaths could be a turning point in the war against the jihadist group, he said.
What the trend really reveals is that IS reached the full extent of its potential in 2014 and was unable to expand its resource and socio-political base or maintain high levels of mobilisation.
Analysts say IS has benefited from its decentralised structure, but may now be forced to close its ranks, leaving it more vulnerable as it struggles to push forward. IS has transformed over the past year from a decentralised organisation to a highly centralised one, relying on total control, which will cause it to erode further, Hashimi said.
The jihadist group will also have difficulty finding replacements with enough institutional knowledge, added Guidere.
It's not so much the replacement itself that is a problem, since there are plenty of candidates, he said.
The problem is not the quantity but the quality, which is at risk of becoming rare.
The vacuum could result in more brutality, said Mia Bloom, a jihadism expert at Georgia State University.
The strategy of divide and conquer, in which one aims to foster splinters and divisions within terrorist groups, is a double-edged sword, Bloom said.
With the loss of a leader there are incentives for the up-and-coming middle management to distinguish themselves and this is often done in very bloody and violent ways, she said.
Candidates could try to outbid each other with deadly attacks with newly-promoted leaders seeking to establish their street cred, she added. - AFP

2016 economic outlook more positive
The world is looking at 2016 with much more confidence in terms of economic outlook than 2015, according to market research firm WIN/Gallup's end of the year survey published on December 31, 2015.
The research has found that an average of 45% of over 66,000 people interviewed in 68 countries had a positive outlook towards the economic situation in their own country in 2016, expecting it to be better than in 2016, and only 22% thought it was going to be worse (the remaining 33% didn't expect changes or had no opinion). This is an increase of 3% compared to 2015-and a signal that people might feel things are getting better.
Leading the world in terms of economic optimism are West and South Asia, where 60% of people have a positive outlook, East Asia and Oceania (53%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (45%).
Sticking out for negativity-despite finally having started growing again- is the EU, where only 14% of people are optimists.
A look at the results shows that the negative sentiments are found mostly among the richest countries: in prosperous economies (which the survey defines as G7 economies) only 18% of people think 2016 will be a good year for the economy, while in emerging economies (defined as G20 economies minus the G7) and aspiring ones (everyone else), 54% and 40% of people respectively have good expectations for the coming year. The most optimistic country is China-65% of people are looking forward to what the economy of 2016 has to bring.
But while the macro results show that those who have more wealth (G7 nations) tend to be the most pessimistic, the opposite is true when looking at the micro results: demographic-wise, it's the advantaged who have the most optimistic outlook on 2016.
Men under 34, with medium-high income and a university degree are the most positive-although overall no one beats Hindus: with 61% of positive responses, they are the group with the best outlook on 2016. (QZ.Com)

Aid groups create huge peace sign of life jackets on Greek isle
GREECE: Rights groups briefly transformed a mountain of discarded life jackets used by refugees who crossed the Aegean Sea into a huge peace sign on the hills of the Greek island of Lesbos.
The giant symbol, which was made out of around 3,000 flourescent orange life jackets, was created on a hillside overlooking the 10-kilometre (six mile) stretch of water between the islands northern shores and the Turkish coastline, the Greenpeace website said.
It was formed on New Years Day by around 100 volunteers from Greenpeace, Doctors Without Borders, Sea-Watch and the Dutch Refugee Boat Foundation as well as the local community group, Starfish.
The groups created the peace sign on New Years Day to bring in 2016 with a message of hope, with Greenpeaces Florian Schulz telling AFP it took three-to-four hours to create the giant symbol, which measured 10 metres from side-to-side.
But it was later removed as the group did not have permission to leave it there.
We had no permission for the sign to stay in the hills so we dismantled it and cleaned up the dump, Schulz told AFP.
UN figures show that more than half a million people have crossed Aegean Sea to Lesbos alone over the past year, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the 850,000 who reached Greece by boat in 2015.
The vast majority were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, with the life jackets they used left at a dump near the village of Molyvos, Greenpeace said.
The dump site stands as a statue, a silent reminder of the risks and that so many more still hold out hope of a safe crossing. It also includes the life jackets of those who never made it, of those who lost their lives at sea and can never return home or continue their journey north, it said.
More than one million migrants and refugees have entered Europe this year, four out of five of whom reached the continent via the Greek islands. Although the arrivals has declined since the autumn, around 60,000 arrived on Lesbos in December, UN figures show.
Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei on Friday said he was planning to create a memorial on Lesbos to the plight of refugees, many of whom have died trying to reach Europe.
A lot of people have lost their lives under the waves... we need a memorial, he told AFP after a news conference on the project. I already set up a studio in Lesbos. Next year we are going to be involved with different projects, he added.

Angry Klopp urges Liverpool to raise game
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said that his side must improve their commitment levels if they are to make progress this season following a 2-0 defeat at West Ham United.
Klopp has identified this month's games as crucial to Liverpool's campaign, with a League cup semi-final against Stoke City and an FA Cup trip to Exeter City while there are also potentially tough league meetings with Arsenal and Manchester United.
And he has demanded immediate improvements after seeing his side undone by headed goals from Michail Antonio and former Liverpool striker Andy Carroll at Upton Park on Saturday.
"It's no day for being disappointed, it's a day for being angry," said the German, who has now overseen four Premier League defeats in his fledgling Liverpool tenure.
"We had the ball and possession and bad luck in a few situations, but that's not what I want to see, to be honest. You have to be there in the decisive moments.
"I know about the things in football and today (Saturday) it's our responsibly. My English is not good enough to process all the information that's going around me in this moment.
"It was bad, I told the players after the game. Summary: 'Not enough.'" Klopp was particularly unhappy with his side's defending after they conceded both goals to headers and struggled to deal with the aerial threat of Carroll throughout the afternoon.
"We could have done much better," he said. "If you fight in these moments, but at 100 percent -- 95 percent is not enough. Who wants to see 95 percent -- that's what we have to do.
"If you know in the other team there's Andy Carroll, then how can you allow crosses There was bad defending from my side. It's about my responsibility. I am really angry about myself today.
"When I talk about defending I don't want to use words like nasty and ugly. It's football, defending. I was a defender and I enjoyed it. "Nice part of the game, you get dirty afterwards, that's not a problem. You don't have to wash your clothes by yourself."
Bilic challenges Carroll
West Ham completed a first league double over Liverpool in over 50 years and manager Slaven Bilic singled out Carroll for praise afterwards.
The one-time England striker has scored in successive games after returning to full fitness and Bilic says that it is up to Carroll himself to maintain those levels. "Andy was brilliant, not just because of the goal, but for his performance, everything: defending, holding the ball up," said the Croatian.
"I think every ball that (goalkeeper) Adrian kicked up, he went to head it or to flick hit. And he was defending, tracking back, and when he had the chance to press the centre-backs, he took it.
"Now he looks fit to me. And basically we are talking a lot about him -- 'Andy England', 'Andy that' -- but now he is fit and it is all about him now. -AFP

Auckland draw kind for Venus Williams
WELLINGTON, SATURDAY: Former world number one Venus Williams begins fine-tuning for the Australian Open against a player barely half her age when the WTA Auckland Classic begins on Monday.
Williams, the defending Auckland champion, found herself on the right side of the draw released on Saturday with a first-round match against 18-year-old Russian Daria Kasatkina.
The other former world number ones in the tournament, Ana Ivanovic from Serbia and Dane Caroline Wozniacki, are both in the bottom half of the draw. Wozniacki, who lost to Williams in the final last year, will play big-hitting American Sloane Stephens in the first round with Ivanovic's opponent to be drawn from this weekend's qualifying tournament.
Williams, who arrived in Auckland on the comeback trail last year and ranked 47th in the world, has since regained a place in the top 10 for the first time since 2011 and returns at number seven in the rankings.
She turned professional in 1994, three years before the 75th-ranked Kasatkina was born.
Ivanovic is another former Auckland champion, winning in her only previous appearance here in 2014, while Williams beat Wozniacki in the 2015 final 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.

Botham blown away by 'magnificent' Stokes

LONDON, Sunday - England great Ian Botham hailed a "magnificent" display by Ben Stokes after the Durham all-rounder smashed his record for the fastest England double century against South Africa.
Stokes, 24, reached the milestone from 163 balls on the second day of the second Test in Cape Town on Sunday, obliterating Botham's mark of 220, set against India in 1982.
Stokes was eventually run out for 258 -- the highest ever Test score by a number six batsman -- as England declared on 629-6.
Analysing the match for Sky Sports, Botham said: "It was magnificent, one of the best examples of Test cricket I've seen in a long time.
"Ben Stokes is box office. We knew he'd got it, and this is the tip of the iceberg. He'll get it wrong once in a while, but he is a guy that wins matches, and they don't come along very often.
"You're just king of the castle. No boundary's big enough, no bowler's quick enough. It really is a moment to enjoy."
Stokes's innings was also the second-fastest double ton in Test history, surpassed only by Nathan Astle's record of 153 balls for New Zealand against England in 2002.
Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said: "All those thousands of England supporters who've come out here for a bit of a holiday, a bit of sunshine, see some cricket -- you've seen something special." AFP

China restructures military as Xi eyes strong army
CHINA: China has unveiled changes to the structure of its military, adding three new units, described by President Xi Jinping as a major policy decision to realise the Chinese dream of a strong army, state media reported.
The formation of the new units, which follows Beijing's announcement that it was building a second aircraft carrier, comes with China acting more aggressively in territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, drawing the ire of its neighbours and the United States.
Beijing in November said it planned sweeping changes in a move intended to enhance the ruling Communist Party's control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
The latest reforms announced late Friday will see a new army unit set up to oversee China's arsenal of strategic missiles.
Besides the Rocket Force, the PLA also unveiled an army general command to serve as the headquarters for land forces and a support unit to assist combat troops, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Xi, who is chief of the Communist Party and also serves as head of the military, has previously announced plans to slash China's number of troops by 300,000 to roughly two million to craft a more efficient fighting force.
China's Central Military Commission, which Xi chairs, on Friday also released guidelines to help build the country's vision of a modern military before 2020 by cutting troops and improving the quality of combat personnel, Xinhua said.
The announcements come with China also expanding its naval capacity by building a second aircraft carrier. The nation's first such vessel, the Liaoning, is a secondhand Soviet ship built more than 25 years ago that was commissioned by China in 2012 after extensive refits.
The Global Times newspaper, known for its nationalistic editorial stance, said new conditions required a strong army and cited the United States as a reason.
If China has a big gap with the US in terms of military prowess, this will affect its international position and other countries attitude toward China, it said in an editorial posted on its website Saturday.
With a strong army, China can be more politically appealing, influential and persuasive. Beijing's forces have been involved in sometimes tense confrontations with Japanese and Philippine units over maritime disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively, prompting fears that the disputes could result in armed clashes.
The new PLA Rocket Force, meanwhile, is tasked with maintaining conventional and nuclear weaponry with the ability to both deter and strike, Xi told a ceremony for the founding of the three new organisations, according to Xinhua. But a spokesman for China's Ministry of Defence denied any shift in the country's nuclear weapons policy. - AFP

The government's proposals for a new constitution have several dangerous clauses, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Speaking to the media in Colombo yesterday, Gunawardena said that government members were trying to hide these clauses while only highlighting popular proposals such as changes to the executive presidency and the existing electoral system.
He said that some proposals in connection to the unitary state, giving prominence to Buddhism and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution were highly questionable.
On the two matters, Buddhism and unitary state, Gunewardena said that there was no clear reference in documents presented by the government.
Gunewardena said that the government should tell the truth to the people about these without just trying to hide behind the two popular slogans - executive presidency and a new electoral system.

Easy to win general elections than SLC election, says Arjuna

Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga commenting on yesterdays election defeat said that it was easy to win a general election than an SLC election because of the mafia involvement at SLC elections.
Upto Saturday night we were assured of 90 votes from the membership but something had gone wrong overnight. This cricket mafia has to be stopped and the only way to do it is to change the constitution, said Ranatunga. Explaining what this cricket mafia was Ranatunga stated that buying of votes was one of them although it cannot be proved.
A good example is I won a parliament seat contesting with three different parties but in cricket you cannot do that because of the cricket mafia, he said. I dont blame the membership for our defeat. I thought I come forward and serve the game but if the membership doesn't want me it is the cricket that will suffer.
Ranatunga stated that it would be interesting to see who will represent Sri Lanka at future ICC meetings.
He also blamed the Director-General of Sports K.D.S. Ruwanchandra for not being fair by all in accepting nominations and that he would seek legal opinion before taking the next step. As a government official the way the Director-General has acted is rather disappointing. It is not good for the government to have such officials, Ranatunga said. [ST]

Fame of good governance government on steady upswing - Rajitha
Reputation and the strength of good governance government led by President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are rising as of the steady increase of marks on the score board when well-formed batsmen are at the wicket, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the relocated State Osu Sala outlet of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation at Karapitiya, Galle on Tuesday.
"We could satisfactorily complete the 100 days programme of the United National Front government with just 45 parliamentarians in support while over 100 were in the Opposition. Some reactionary forces are exerting a futile effort to hinder the forward march of the government. They acted with the hope of an eminent collapse of the government in the passage of Budget 2016. Nevertheless 2016 Budget was passed with two thirds majority in the parliament. The 150 votes cast in favour of the budget in its second reading were increased up to 161 at its third reading. We could easily introduce the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with the majority approval. In future there would be more cross overs from the Opposition to the ruling party. Hence the national unity government of good governance will continue as a formidable government until 2020 fulfilling all aspirations of the people," Senaratne said.
Commenting on the government's efforts in providing medicinal drugs to people at fair prices, the minister said his ministry had already formulated rules and regulations for the establishment of a National Medicinal Drug Regulatory Authority, which was essential and sent it for the approval of the Attorney General's Department.
"According to National Medicinal Drug Policy, establishment of the Regulatory Authority is vital and essential. Firm and sturdy rules are required to fight the drug mafia. A policy frame work is needed for the control and regulate the medicinal drug trade. People charge us for the delay in initiating the National Policy on medicinal drugs. We have done what we have to do on our part. Now the delay is in the process of the policy through the Attorney General's Department," he said.
I would like to appeal to all those who accuse us for the delay in reducing prices of medicinal drugs to be patient for some time as we have initiated every step for the purpose," the minister asserted.
"We could introduce the National Medicinal Drug Policy even before the expected time frame. Some queried about the swiftness in introducing the policy. Some tried to hinder our effort. Medicinal drug trade is one of most thriving global businesses. There is a robust mafia connected to the business worldwide. Many who tried to voice and act against this mafia had to face untimely deaths. There were attempts for the National Medicinal Drug Police since 1971 in our country. Initiators of this were Dr. Senaka Bibile and Dr. S. A. Wickramesinghe who were both leftist leaders. There were similar attempts in 1991 and 1996. However, all these endeavours did not reach the final stage. Although the initiators of the policy were from left parties it could not be implemented during leftist governments. However, it could be implemented during a UNP led government," Senaratne said.
He said he is personally pleased over his success in implementing the NMDP during his tenure as the respective minister for Dr. Senaka Bibile, the architect and mentor of the policy was his teacher of Pharmacology at Peradeniya University.
"I feel it as a destined obligation of mine. I still remember his comments on the drug mafia. Our National Policy on Medicinal Drugs is globally acclaimed. Even UNICEF has acknowledged our policy as an authentic move to regulate and control the drug mafia," he said.
"Profit margin of some drugs exceeds 3,000 to 4,000 per cent. Medicinal Drug trade of SPC should be both a profit and service oriented business. So I requested them to reduce their profit margin to 75 per cent, to which they hesitated and urged for a profit margin of at least 88 per cent. Subsequently I compromised for an 85 percent profit margin over all SPC products. So the Osu Sala prices are much lower than of other private firms. We can bring down the prices even lower for which we need a secured strategy under the existing law of the country.
"Some question whether our government could bring all criminals and crooks to book. They charge over the delay in executing punishment on them. We have to do all such things according to the law of the country. The delay is in swift execution of law procedures. The execution of the law in our country is at times very strange and has a dual function. When a common man is caught with a locally made Gal Katas, the law enforcement agencies take swift action and bring the person before courts. However, when the same agency detected a person with over 3,500 arms, they simply refer the case to the Attorney General's Department without applying the procedure they used on the common man," he alleged.
Although we could change the government, we were unable to change the state. Still many powerful state agencies are dominated by officials who enjoyed many rewarding privileges and benefits from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa . Still they seem to be loyal to him. We changed the previous regime through a peaceful and democratic process. However, we too have to launch a second phase of revolution to change the state," he pointed out.

Federer looks to Brisbane as 2016 launch-pad
BRISBANE, SATURDAY: Roger Federer said Saturday he was looking at defending his Brisbane International title as a launch-pad to the new season.
The 17-time Swiss grand slam champion arrived in Australia Saturday with Sunday's Brisbane International tournament as his lead-up to this month's Australian Open in Melbourne.
Federer, 34, who won six titles including Brisbane last year and reached the final of both Wimbledon and the US Open, is up against world No.8 Kei Nishikori, No.14 Milos Raonic and No.28 Grigor Dimitrov in this year's Brisbane tournament.
"The likes of Nishikori, Raonic and Dimitrov want to move now finally into the top four or five and for us, the top guys, it's about hanging on where we are right now," Federer told reporters.
"I've been playing really well for over one and a half years - ever since I came back from my back problems in 2013.
"That's been very encouraging and now I'm just more confident than I was maybe a year ago as well."
Federer won the last of his 17 grand slam crowns at Wimbledon in 2012 and he still believes he has another major title within him. Novak Djokovic dominated last year with three grand slam titles, and while the wait for an 18th slam title is stretching out, Federer said he was not voverly concerned.
"I've come so close, I've played very well, but I don't feel any frustration because of it," he said.
"I'm still happy with how I'm playing. It was Novak's year, he played so well there's only so much (you can do) if somebody's so dominant and he's got sky-high confidence.
"It's unfortunate, a pity for me, but at the same time I don't feel sorry for myself. I've won so much throughout my career, I feel like if I keep pushing forward it might happen.
"If not, it's okay."
It is Federer's third trip to the Brisbane International and not only did he win last year's title but he joined rare company by picking up the 1000th match win of his ATP career in the process.
Federer has a bye into the second round this year where he is due to face either Australian wildcard Ben Mitchell or a qualifier. AFP

Koscielny sends Arsenal clear, Rooney lifts United

LONDON, SATURDAY: Laurent Koscielny's goal saw Arsenal pull two points clear of second-place Leicester City at the Premier League summit on Saturday, while Wayne Rooney scored a milestone winner for Manchester United.
Koscielny stabbed home a flick-on from France team-mate Olivier Giroud in the 72nd minute at a rain-lashed Emirates Stadium to earn a below-par Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Newcastle United.
Leicester drew 0-0 at home to Bournemouth and now have just a one-point lead over Manchester City, who produced a rousing comeback to win 2-1 at Watford via late goals by Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero.
"We were not at our best, but we had to dig deep and we can do that when needed," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. "It was about solidarity, tired legs and taking a chance from a set-piece.
Leicester have now gone three league games without winning or scoring after their stalemate against 10-man Bournemouth at the King Power Stadium.
Manchester City looked to be sinking to a sixth defeat of the campaign after Aleksandar Kolarov's 55th-minute own goal saw them fall behind at Watford.
But Kolarov teed up Toure to volley in an adroit 82nd-minute equaliser and Aguero then brilliantly headed in an 84th-minute winner from Bacary Sagna's cross as Manuel Pellegrini's side reignited their title challenge.
At Old Trafford, Rooney gave United a 2-1 win over Swansea City with a fine 77th-minute back-heel that made him the outright second-highest goal-scorer in both Premier League (188 goals) and United (238) history.
After Anthony Martial's header was cancelled out by Gylfi Sigurdsson, Martial teed up Rooney to score a goal that ended United's eight-game winless run and further eased the pressure on manager Louis van Gaal.
The result lifted United to fifth place, two points below fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Everton on Sunday.
West Ham United are a point back in sixth after Michail Antonio and Andy Carroll scored headed goals in a 2-0 home win over Liverpool.
Aston Villa spurned another chance to close on safety after losing 3-1 at second-bottom Sunderland, with Jermain Defoe scoring twice to leave Remi Garde's side seven points adrift at the foot of the table.
Jonny Evans's stoppage-time goal earned West Bromwich Albion a last-gasp 2-1 win over Stoke City, who had Geoff Cameron sent off after an altercation with Claudio Yacob.
Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama was dismissed as Southampton went down 1-0 at Norwich City, where Alexander Tettey scored a 76th-minute winner. AFP

We were not at our best, but we had to dig deep and we can do that when needed, said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. It was about solidarity, tired legs and taking a chance from a set-piece.
We were not at our best today, but over Christmas in four games we took nine points so we can look back and say we did 75 percent of our job as we lost at Southampton.
Arsenal were far from their best against Newcastle, with Georginio Wijnaldum drawing smart saves from home goalkeeper Petr Cech either side of half-time and Aleksandar Mitrovic volleying over from close range.
But with the home fans growing restless, Koscielny supplied the breakthrough, sneaking in behind Ayoze Perez to toe the ball past Rob Elliot after Giroud had got his head to a high ball.
Leicester have now gone three league games without winning or scoring after their stalemate against 10-man Bournemouth at the King Power Stadium.
Leicester striker Jamie Vardy hit the post in the first half, while Riyad Mahrez saw a penalty saved by Artur Boruc on the hour after Simon Francis had been sent off for a last-man foul on Vardy.
However, Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri was eager to underline the positives, pointing out that his side have now reached the 40-point mark usually required to avoid relegation.
A draw is not OK, it is only one point, but it is OK as we have 40 points, which was the goal, said the Italian. It's champagne for my players!

I am very happy for the players because they had to play under big pressure and now we have won, Van Gaal told the BBC.
I hope this is a fantastic starting point for us in the New Year and we can continue against Sheffield United (in the FA Cup).
The result lifted United to fifth place, two points below fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Everton on Sunday.
West Ham United are a point back in sixth after Michail Antonio and Andy Carroll scored headed goals in a 2-0 home win over Liverpool.
Aston Villa spurned another chance to close on safety after losing 3-1 at second-bottom Sunderland, with Jermain Defoe scoring twice to leave Remi Garde's side seven points adrift at the foot of the table.
Patrick van Aanholt put Sunderland in front with a deflected effort and Villa were momentarily level courtesy of a superb Carles Gil volley in the 63rd minute before Defoe took centre-stage.
It's a great relief, said Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce, whose side closed to within four points of safety.
Hopefully it will give us confidence going forward. We're still very much in trouble, but this win was critical.

Lyon spins Australia into strong position

SYDNEY Sunday : Nathan Lyon claimed his 100th Test wicket in Australia with the dismissal of top-scoring opener Kraigg Brathwaite late on the opening day of the rain-hit third Test against the West Indies in Sydney on Sunday.
Brathwaite had defied Australia's bowlers and two rain delays before he gave away his wicket late in the day to Lyon for 85.
Brathwaite, one of the few shining lights in a dismal Windies tour with 94 in the first Hobart Test, was in sight of his fifth Test century before he fell to Lyon. It gave the Australia off-spinner his 100th Test in Australia and 184th scalp overall.
At the close, after 75 overs were squeezed in around two lengthy rain interruptions, the West Indies were 207 for six with Denesh Ramdin on 23 and Carlos Brathwaite not out 35 after winning the toss. Australia have already retained the Frank Worrell Trophy after huge wins in the first two Tests and are chasing a 3-0 series clean sweep.
Brathwaite, who along with Darren Bravo has been the best-performing batsman in the series for the struggling visitors, was deceived by Lyon's extra bounce and attempted to steer the ball past slip.
But instead he dollied a catch off his glove to Steve Smith at slip.
His dismissal was quickly followed by the wicket of skipper Jason Holder, who was instinctively caught by Joe Burns at short leg for one off left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe. -AFP
