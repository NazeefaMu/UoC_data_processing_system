Vidyaratnes irresponsible act lost opportunity to provide solutions
Uma Oya project issue:
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he regretted the high handed and irresponsible action taken by Provincial Council Member Samantha Vidyaratne on July 3 by issuing a veiled threat to him when he went on an inspection tour of the Uma Oya project to look into the grievances and problems of affected people in the Bandarawela area.
Amaraweera said this action taken by Vidyaratne prevented a fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems caused by the Uma project to the people in Bandarawela.
Amaraweera toured the villages in the entire affected area accompanied by Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
Later Minister Vijayamuni Zoysa also joined them and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had intimated his inability to join them due to another urgent official matter.
Amaraweera said while they were looking into the problems of residents in Uda Peruwa where a large number of houses had been damaged, Samantha Vidyaratne arrived on the spot.
After talking in an amicable and friendly manner Vidyaratne took him to a nearby house and threatened to hold him prisoner until a categorical statement was made to halt the project completely.
Amaraweera said he told Vidyaratne that they had come to gather ideas and views of the people to be submitted to the cabinet and thereafter a decision would be taken on the basis of expert views rather than political grounds.
Even through officers of the building research organization repeatedly told him to move out of the house as it would collapse at any moment, Vidyaratne pressed his hands to his (Amaraweeras) chest and insisted that he would not be allowed to go until a firm decision was announced. At this point, security personnel intervened and allowed him and his team to move out of the house. Amaraweera said he considered Vidyaratnes behaviour with total contempt as he (Amaraweera) was a peaceful person who did not want to get involved in any controversy.
A fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems of people in Bandarawela was lost due to the irresponsible actions of Vidyaratne. The impression he had about Vidyaratne as an exceptional and clever politician was completely lost and tarnished due to his latest action.
Amaraweera said people in the area represented their problems and issues in a peaceful manner.
The Uma Oya problem required both short term and long term solutions. According to the external and internal situation in the affected area, it was dangerous to keep the people there any longer. As such they should be evacuated urgently.
To resolve this it was decided to acquire a 50 acre plot from a plantation company and re-settle them in it.
As a solution to the drinking water problem it was decided to distribute 3000 water tanks with 500 litre capacity each among the villages and ensure filling of water to them on a continuous basis until a pipe borne water scheme was launched. It was decided to implement a mass scale water supply project to cater to 15,000 families later.
During the discussions he also said that a programme should be implemented to pay compensation towards damaged houses and cultivable land in a fair manner. The government had provided relief to people affected by the Uma Oya project during the last few months. A sum of Rs 197.6 million had already been paid in respect of 1968 damaged houses. Another Rs. 370.4 million had been paid in respect of damaged crops. Almost 440,000 litres of water were being distributed among 2600 families daily utilizing 45 bowsers.
A large number of doctors, professors and intellectuals participated in the inspection tour and the final meeting. But an opportunity to obtain their valuable observations, ideas and views at the final meeting was lost due to the high handed actions of Vidyaratne.
The public was not invited for the meeting scheduled to be held at the Bandarawela Divisional Secretariat, because it was intended to obtain expert views for a final solution. But it was cancelled at the last minute as intelligence sources reported that Vidyaratne was planning to disrupt it with a group of people by hooting and jeering.
As such the meeting was later held at the Irrigation office instead.

AG says there is a possibility of arresting Prof. Samarasekara
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo High Court there is a possibility of arresting former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General made this observation when a revision application filed by Prof. Samarasekara was taken up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe.
Meanwhile, the inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrates Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for August 24 by Colombo High Court.
Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing for Prof. Samarasekara informed court that his client has undergone heart surgery.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
At a previous occasion, former Colombo chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen.
On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof. Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrates Court order to refuse him with anticipatory bail.
Prof.Samarasekara denied allegations leveled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Counsel Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the Attorney General.

AG trying to prevent GMOA from presenting Govts stand on SAITM to judiciary
GMOA states in letter to President:
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to President Mahinda Rajapaksa stating that the Attorney General is trying his best to prevent the GMOA from presenting the Governments stand on SAITM to the judiciary, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said in the letter, the GMOA requested the President to intervene to prevent Sri Lanka from violating norms, ethics and traditions.
Such a violation is a black mark on Sri Lanka at international level.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the Supreme Court judgement given allowing the GMOA to present facts on the SAITM issue is a victory for all who stand for justice and ethics. The judgement also confirmed the GMOAs right to intervene in the SAITM issue and the GMOA is connected to the issue. The Secretaries of relevant Ministries had not informed the Attorney General about the Governments stand on SAITM.
The political fury which acts against all parties which stand for protecting world order,world accepted ethics etc should be defeated and the GMOA will take all possible steps to present the truth about SAITM to the judiciary, he added.

## Title: Amid praise and blame

Amid praise and blame
The Brahmajala Sutta is the first of 34 suttas in the Digha Nikaya. The sutta starts with the Buddha travelling with his disciples between the cities of Rajagaha and Nalanda. At the same time, a Brahmin called Suppiya, with his young apprentice, Brahmadatta, was also travelling in the same direction, tailing the convoy of the sangha. Suppiya uttered some insulting words about the Buddha, his teachings, and his disciples. However, Brahmadatta praised and revered the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The duo continued debating until they arrived at the King's resting place in Ambalatthika.
Hearing this conversation, some monks discussed the nature of conflict the next morning. The Buddha arrived and asked what they were discussing. As a monk finished telling him, the Buddha responded:
"Monks, if anyone spoke words which insult me, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, don't let this thing prompt you to hate, take revenge, and turn against them. If, because of this, you become angry or annoyed, then it will become an obstacle in your quest to liberate yourself and cause you upset.
However, if someone speaks insulting or false accusations about me, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, then you should state which is wrong and point out the mistake by explaining that because of this proof and that, then that is not true, or it is not like that, that kind of thing is not us or occurring in us."
Final liberation
"But if someone praises me, the Dhamma, or the Sangha; don't let this thing make you feel proud, joyful, and happy. If you act like that, then it will become an obstacle in your efforts to achieve your own final liberation. If someone speaks like that, you should state which is right and show the fact by saying, 'Based on this and that fact, it is indeed so; that thing does indeed exist in us, or is true about us.' Even only due to small matters, worthless, or even due to the Precepts (Sila)."
This is a vivid account in one of the earliest Buddhist texts describing how the Buddha guided his disciples in responding skillfully to both praise and blame.
The story is full of his wisdom about how we can avoid harming ourselves or others through our speech and how we can navigate through life while maintaining (sati) mindfulness and (upekkha) equanimity.
Feedback
In Dhammapada under Kodhavagga: the Buddha says, O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed
As the Buddha says, blame is universal. Its quite natural that all of us want to be appreciated for our generosity, noted for our courage, and lauded for our acumen. We generally prefer being told that we are adored. But how about the blame factor
If we are only happy when universally, uniformly, entirely praised - if we are not happy when theres any disagreement, or a single frowning face, or a random slur coming our way - it appears we wont be happy very often.
As yourself few questions: Can I accept in humility, the negative feedback and reproach and disapproval, rather than just disavow it in a fit of irritation At the same time, can I look at the blame with an open mind for what I might learn while also holding it in the larger context of wisdom - There is always blame in this world
Can I look toward my motivation to speak or act to determine the worthiness of my action Can I be discerning about whether or not I acted skilfully, without deciding that praise means I have nothing to learn, or any blame means Ive failed If I cannot, I have an issue. I will continually give your heart over to a shifting world of praise and blame that I can never finally control. I will continue to get your heart broken as my expectations are thwarted and my measures of success are challenged.
Anger
When we are blamed we feel under attack, and defensive instincts kick in physically and emotionally. Our stomachs tighten, our mouths become dry, our shoulder muscles tense - but we usually dont notice these responses, and we often dont even notice consciously that we are feeling angry, resentful or upset. Our attention is drawn instead to the thoughts that spring up in our mind in response to the attack. We think to ourselves, He hurt me, he abused me.
The answer is in the reason the Buddha gives for not getting defensive: That would only be a hindrance to you. In other words, the emotional hooks that join us to emotions like anger or disappointment also fasten us to painful and reactive ways of thinking and, in the end, these will hurt us (to say nothing of the people with whom we are angry).
The Buddha taught that we are constantly being pulled in one direction or another by things or conditions we either want or hope to avoid.
These include praise and blame, pleasure and pain, success and failure, gain and loss. The wise person, the Buddha said, accepts all with upekkha, without approval or disapproval.
Theravada monk and scholar, Bhikkhu Bodhi, says the word upekkha means is to not be ruled by passions, desires, likes and dislikes.
The Bhikkhu continues, "It is evenness of mind, unshakeable freedom of mind, a state of inner equipoise that cannot be upset by gain and loss, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. Upekkha is freedom from all points of self-reference; it is indifference only to the demands of the ego-self with its craving for pleasure and position, not to the well-being of one's fellow human beings."
Upekkha
In the Lokavipatti Sutta, the Buddha points out, Now, gain arises for a well-instructed disciple of the Buddha. He reflects, 'Gain has arisen for me. It is inconstant, stressful, & subject to change.' He discerns it as it actually is. Pain arises. He reflects, 'Pain has arisen for me. It is inconstant, stressful, & subject to change.' He discerns it as it actually is.
His mind does not remain consumed with the gain or the loss or with the status or the disgrace or the censure or the praise.
He does not welcome the arisen gain or rebel against the arisen loss. He does not welcome the arisen praise or rebel against the arisen blame. He does not welcome the arisen pleasure or rebel against the arisen pain. He is released from suffering and stress.
Kinds of happiness
The Buddha teaches us that there are three kinds of happiness: Sense pleasures (amisa sukha), Mundane meditative pleasures (jhanica sukha) and Nibbanic (niramisa sukha)
Amisa sukha is the pleasures all of us are familiar with. We like to indulge in sense pleasures. We like to see beautiful pictures or people; hear soothing music; taste good food, etc. The drawback with sense pleasures is that they lastsonly while one is satisfying the particular sense faculty; as soon as we finish eating, for example, the pleasure goes away.
Niramisa is opposite of amisa; thus niramisa sukha does not arise due to material things. It is totally mental, it is, in fact, the happiness due to release or dissociation from material things.
It is more of a relief sensation rather than an enjoyment. It is like the feeling when a pulsating headache goes away; a sense of calm and peacefulness.
The niramisa sukha of a Sotapanna (or above) is never lost. Even before the Sotapanna stage, one can start feeling the niramisa sukha by systematically removing greed, hate, and ignorance.

Slams Dinesh for speeches with no basis:
The Anunayake of the Malwathu Chapter Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Thera told former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa that opposition to the proposed Constitution has no basis.
It is akin to making a horoscope for an unborn baby, the Anunayake Thera said, stating that the opposition to a Constitution for which a draft has not been finalised is futile.
Rajapaksa met the Prelate to recieve blessings yesterday after visiting and paying homage at the Temple of the Tooth Relic and thereafter visiting the Mahanayakes of the Asgiriya and Malwathu Chapters.
The Anunayaka Thera said it was futile protesting a proposed Constitution for which there is no draft let alone it being adopted.
The Anunayaka Thera further said that he watched Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena speaking aggressively in Parliament and that the speeches made by him lacked substance.
We met the President and we infomred him that they should pay heed to the sufferings of the common man. The cost of living has risen and people cant afford food, the Anunayake Thera said.

Are the Ashes really under threat
Australia pay dispute:
What a mess. Theres no other way to describe the fact the deadline has passed for Australias cricketers to pen a pay deal with the board and no agreement is in place.
The result Unemployment with immediate effect. The implications Vast. The Ashes Who knows.
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
Cricket Australia (CA) has to craft a Memorandum of Understanding with the players - represented by the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) - every five years.
It is, essentially, a contract between the games governing body in Australia and its players.
After months of public disagreements, a deadline was imposed for a deal to be reached and it has now passed without resolution.
With the previous agreement now formally expired, it means more than 200 players in CAs employment are out of contract.
HOW DID THE DISAGREEMENT START
The bitter seeds were sown as far back as December.
Then, CA responded forcefully to the players union highlighting draft contract documents suggesting women cricketers would be obliged to disclose pregnancies before being signed.
It suspended talks with immediate effect, saying it would come back to the table in January.
It was an initial foray that lasted the duration of Decembers Brisbane Test match. It reflected that bad blood was brewing. Really bad blood.
SO ITS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST SALARIES
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland wants to divert more money to grassroots cricket.
Yes. What got the players and their representatives irreversibly offside from a more enduring policy perspective was CAs formal offer, issued in March, removing a key tenet of industrial agreements since 1997 known as the revenue-sharing model.
Under this, anywhere from a fifth to a quarter of all CA incomings has been returned to players above their annual retainers.
In CAs proposal, that arrangement was wound up for state cricketers - both men and women - with a version retained for international players.
Administrators believe revenue sharing is now unsustainable and want to re-route more money to grassroots cricket at the expense of additional windfalls for state players, who - they argue - receive salaries as good as any in Australian sport.
International and female state players also stand to receive sizeable salary increases as part of the reallocation.
Australian representatives, for example, will see their pay jump to $180,000 (106,239) a year if CAs proposal goes ahead, a boost of 125% on the current average.
Meanwhile, male state players - those playing in the Sheffield Shield - are still due to have their annual salaries jump from $199,000 (117,453) to $234,000 (138,110) across the 2017-2022 window.
NOW THEYRE UNEMPLOYED, WILL THE PLAYERS BACK DOWN

That seems unlikely at present.
The players, from national captain Steve Smith down, are adamant their state colleagues should be entitled to exactly the arrangement they have always had, not least because they are central to the T20 Big Bash League, which has become a huge success during the Australian summer.
The threshold issue, as the players see it, is if administrators want to find money for other laudable pursuits, then there is plenty splashing around in CA coffers compared to previously.
CAs position was tempered slightly last week, as it said players could share in profits (as opposed to revenue), the amended offer also including another boost to state retainers.
That was, however, promptly rejected by the ACA, which argued near enough wasnt good enough.
ARE CRICKET AUSTRALIA LIKELY TO CAVE
It doesnt appear so. The latest chapter in the unflattering battle saw administrators again flexing their muscles.
Rejecting repeated requests for mediation, they instead insisted players would be banned for six months if exhibition games were played by the now freelancers in their time away from national deals.
CA says the million-plus dollars a fortnight saved in player wages will now be redirected into funding for club facilities in need of a facelift.
Theres no candour or contrition here. Theyre on a war footing as well.
ARE THE ASHES UNDER THREAT
When an email was circulated to the players from CA chief executive James Sutherland detailing the stark reality that players would not be paid beyond 30 June, David Warners words made headlines across the cricketing world.
He suggested there would be no Australia team to pick from for the Ashes.
Theres still a long way until that first Test against England on 26 November, with Australia due to play a Test series in Bangladesh from 27 August before a limited-overs trip to India.
An A team tour to South Africa also gets under way in the next fortnight. Its difficult to see how that can proceed.
In the short term, a meeting with the ACA is scheduled for Sunday.
The ACA has said it will begin seeking sponsorships for the separate company it has established to collectively manage players intellectual property rights in the absence of CA arrangements.
Deadline day may have passed, but the Ashes is the true marker of disaster.
If that tour is cancelled, heads will roll. And rightly so.  BBC

Army laboratory near Negombo Hospital becoming popular
The Army established medical laboratory near the Negombo Hospital premises for free screening of blood samples for Dengue have so far tested blood of more than 1500 civilians who volunteered, Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps (SLAMC) said.
The Army with the support of Navy personnel with funds, provided by the Presidential Secretariat within three days erected this makeshift laboratory to assist medical authorities at the Negombo Hospital as incidence of Dengue has dramatically increased in the areas.
The President during a sudden visit he made recently to the Negombo Hospital found that facilities for Dengue patients were not adequate and requested Army support for enhancement of laboratory and ward facilities.The Army and Navy Commanders within four days set up two extra wards in the premises and instructed the Corps of Engineer Services (CES) and SLAMC troops to equip the wards with medical accessories, nurses and all other paraphernalia.
The opening of a separate laboratory took place immediately after construction of the two new wards. The unit has become popular as more and more civilians with symptoms of fever were now seeking the free of charge service on a daily basis.

Beacon of light and hope
Jaffna Jaipur Centre celebrates 30 years:
If there is one principle that has been at the core of the services that the Jaipur Centre in Jaffna had held fast for over thirty years, it is the belief that a persons disability does not define them.
While providing prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, mobility vehicles and other services to those who have suffered loss of limbs over the years, the Jaipur Centre never forgot that there was a person attached to that artificial limb. The care provided has always been holistic in nature which is why those who have been beneficiaries have nothing but praise for this centre that remains a beacon of excellence in the war-scarred landscape that is the north.
Many great things are forged in times of adversity and the Jaipur Centre in Jaffna was no different. The outbreak of war in the country and the desperate toll it took on lives and limbs, was the motivating force for the visionaries who helped establish this centre on June 1, 1987. Using cost-effective technology for prosthetic limbs pioneered in Jaipur in India, the centre was able to successfully alleviate the suffering of many men, women and children who lost limbs due to the limb-destroying effect of land mines and other weapons of war. Despite the end of the war in 2009, there is still a great need for these services, in view of the loss of limbs caused by road traffic accidents and diabetic foot infections.
As a surgeon working at the Teaching Hospital in Jaffna, it was my unhappy duty to care for victims of land mine and shrapnel injuries as well as those with advanced diabetic foot infections resulting in the need for limb amputation.
For me as a surgeon, there was no operation that I found more soul-destroying than having to remove a persons limb because of the finality of the procedure and what it would mean to the patients life. However, one saving grace was knowing that there was hope for these people to lead normal lives due to the services provided by the Jaipur Centre. Equally, I valued the visits by the physiotherapists from the Jaipur Centre to the hospital who would examine those people who had been amputated and allay their fears concerning their future by providing them with the positive information about the prospects of artificial prosthesis and advising them how others had successfully transitioned to normal routines and activities.
I considered it a great privilege when I was asked by Dr. Ganeshamoorthy and Dr. Theivendran in 1998 to help the centre by visiting it occasionally to ascertain and examine those who had suffered loss of limbs and to be able to advice the physiotherapists and workshop staff regard them.
I did so for four years until an orthopaedic surgeon arrived at the Centre and I was able to hand over that responsibility. However, I will always remember with gratitude the opportunity provided to me to serve the Centre and establish long lasting links with the Centre and its staff.
Many are the achievements of this centre in terms of the services and help it continues to provide to hundreds of people. During its thirty years of existence, it had produced and fitted over seven thousand artificial limbs. It had also made and supplied over a thousand tricycles and wheelchairs for mobility as well as provided thousands of crutches. Nearly six thousand patients have benefited from physiotherapy with multiple visits. Children with cerebral palsy and physical disabilities were also examined and helped. These are just the hard facts. As important, if not more, is the concern, care and close attention provided to all those who come through the Institutions gates. That was what makes the Jaipur Centre special.
When I first became aware of the Jaipur Centre, one of the first things that struck me concerning it was that the management board was made up of entirely women volunteers! I found this to be so surprising in what was, unfortunately, still a male dominated society. All staff members had served with such selflessness and dedication and it was an example to others to emulate. The management had happily not rested on its laurels, but had continuously strived, with the help of many willing donors, to modernise the services and provide what was best for those who needed their help. Most importantly, the centre had maintained its humaneness and its personal touch at a time when we see this lacking in other areas today. That is a testament to those who work in and direct this marvellous institution.
To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe. - Anatole France.
The Jaipur Centre has done that and more. May the Jaipur Centre continue to successfully serve our community in the coming years and remain a beacon of light and hope.

Buddhist perspective of good governance
Some of his recorded words would come like a distant echo through two thousand five hundred years ago.
Jawaharlal Nehru, first Indian Prime Minister in The Discovery of India
The Buddha delivered Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, his first discourse on the Esala Full Moon Poya Day to the five ascetics, Ven. Kondangna, Vappa, Bhaddiya, Mahanama and Assaji, at the deer park of Isipathana in Benares. It consists of the central theme of the Dhamma. At the end of the preaching, the eldest of the five, Kondangna Thera attained the first stage of sainthood or Sovan. According to history, many other important events had taken place on the Esala Poya Day. Among them, the conception of Siddartha in Queen Mahamayas womb, and Prince Siddartha leaving the palace at the age of 29 in seeking the truth, after giving up all royal comforts.
The drafting of Sri Lankas Independence Constitution appears relatively diluted in its nationalism. The 1948 Constitution, under which the Colonial rulers transferred powers of self-rule to Ceylon, was designed mainly by the twosome DS Senanayake and Sir Ivor Jennings, the Constitutional expert.
They shielded the Constitution drafting from nationalists on two sides: the anti-colonial nationalists, the Young Turks in the Ceylon National Congress, such as Dudley and JR who wanted to make Ceylon a free republic and communistic nationalists who sought special protections for the islands Sinhalese majority and non-Sinhalese minority.
Buddhist clergy
DS was under pressure to include a special clause for Buddhism from the leading Buddhist clergy. A few days before, the two Mahanayakas of Asgiriya and Malwatta threatened to boycott the inauguration ceremony in Kandy. Prime Minister D S Senanayake did not succumb, but he himself took the initiative of handling the matter diplomatically. He travelled to Kandy and convinced the two Mahanayaka Theras of the importance of not introducing special provisions on the foremost place to Buddhism in the new Constitution. He said, If equality is a provision, then you cannot give primacy to one religion.
DS who was well prepared for the summit had explained to the prelates quoting from the chronicle a few stanzas where Buddha emphasized the fact that the State or the Ruler should treat all his subjects, irrespective of race, caste and religion as equals and treat all with no special privileges or rights granted or conceded to a selected group. You cannot treat other people differently because they are members of that political party, or they are from that race, or from that culture. Dhamma forbids such special treatment to a section of the community, DS enlightened and transformed the two Mahanayaka Theras who gave up their protest and participated in the ceremony to bestow the blessing of the triple gem on the new constitution and the independent nation.
The concept of Good Governance (GG) seems unclear for many people. Some have expressed their own views, others have written policy papers. But it is one of the main themes which have been discussed by different international organisations, foundations and political leaders worldwide.
The concept remains ambiguous and without an exact definition. Scholars who carried out research on Buddhist ideals of GG believes, Buddha who did not engage in politics associated the Kings of his day giving them instructions on Ten Royal Duties (Dasa raja dharma) which leads to GG by creating social and economic prosperity and maintaining harmony, tolerance and peace.
Democratic governance
Former President of America Ronald Reagan had said, "A nation is destroyed through racists." Martin Luther King Jr. has said that racism is being blood-thirsty.
Heroes, who have been deflated in the presence of the people, yell and scream to somehow, in any dastardly way regain power.
Original Buddhist manuscripts contain quite a lot of guidelines and obligations to be fulfilled to achieve corruption free democratic Governance. Several Jataka stories give hints on establishing rule of law, the righteousness of the ideal ruler, and how such leaders should abstain from the four wrongdoings (Agathidhammas) such as malice, excitement, fear and dilution. A good ruler, it says, should behave with Sila high moral character and dasa kusala.
They should refrain from, taking life, taking what is not given, adultery, telling lies, slander, harsh speech, frivolous talk, covetousness, evil-mindedness and hearsay. The Pali Canon, in addition to the above, speaks of characteristics to be maintained by good rulers. They are honesty and sincerity, dedication and commitment selfless service high morals, respect of law, consensus agreements for national interest, equanimity and impartialness, solidarity and respect to obligations.
Buddhas teachings on philosophical and spiritual matters are well-known, but his teachings on social, economic, and political issues are less known. His attitude on good governance is narrated in important discourses dealing with it. Today there are unprecedented incidents of crime, violence, and immorality in society.
Basic requirements
Due to the hardship of life, without seeing any solution to the problems they face and to protect social identity, people commit theft, cruelty, hatred and violence. According to Kuutadanta Sutta, the state making an effort to suppress such action by punishment is futile and should not be encouraged. Buddha suggests a series of alternatives to eradicate crime and violence. He proposed educating the people who commit wrongdoings and economic development of the concerned by proving basic requirements of the farmers; granting of financial support to traders at the reduced rate of interest as alternative strategies.
The increase in salaries and wages of employees, opportunities in professional fields for the educated without political interference; high-quality administrative services. Buddha says when such methods are applied by a king or ruler, the people will be happy and contented, fear and anxiety will disappear; as a consequence, the nation would be free of public protests against the government.

Chile salmon industry swims against current
CHILE: Salmon are leaping in their millions from Chilean fish farms to US, Japanese and European dining tables -- but surging demand and environmental concerns have Chile wriggling on the hook.
The world's second-biggest producer of the juicy pink fish after Norway, Chile earned $3.8 billion from farmed salmon last year -- but campaigners warn the environment is paying a high cost.
The demand for salmon is unsustainable, says Liesbeth van der Meer, director of environmental group Oceana Chile. There is an ecological burden that the system can no longer endure. Beyond a certain quantity of salmon, it collapses. She calculates that for every 190 grams of salmon produced, a kilo of local fish is used to feed the farmed salmon.
To make the industry sustainable, Chile should halve its current salmon production, she says.
Yet the industry estimates that demand for salmon is rising by 10 percent a year.
And 70,000 jobs in Chile depend on it.
Last year, red algae infested the waters off southern Chile, killing other sea life. Environmentalists blamed it on waste emissions from fish farms.
The algae wiped out a fifth of Chile's salmon production in 2016.
It fell from 883,000 to 728,000 tonnes -- most of that exported to the United States, Europe, Brazil and Japan.
Chile's size in the market is such that the fall contributed to a 40-percent rise in world salmon prices.
Producers are recovering from that blow. But the president of the SalmonChile trade association, Felipe Sandoval, acknowledges they are having to think and take steps to ensure medium- and long-term stability and reduce costs.
Separately, the industry has been criticized for pumping antibiotics into the salmon, prompting warnings that this could promote drug-resistant super-bacteria.
In 2016 the Chilean salmon industry used 382.5 tonnes of antibiotics.
That was 700 times the amount used in Norway.
The government in 2007 had to reduce the intensity of salmon farming due to an outbreak of infection.
Any further health alerts will hit production, warned Eugenio Zamorano, head of aquaculture in the fisheries ministry.

Compensation for Uma Oya victims
UNDER SUPER LARC SYSTEM:
Owners of 52 houses to be compensated:
The Government will introduce the Super LARC system of compensation to those affected by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
The Land Acquisition and Re-settlement Committees (LARCs) were introduced in 2013 to decide on compensation for those who were to lose property during road development and railway development projects.
Those affected thus can appeal to the Super LARC body for higher compensation than normally given by the Valuation Department.
The government has recognised a total of 52 houses which are not suitable to live in due to the project and they are being granted compensation. We have also given them money to rent houses on a temporary basis until permanent land can be allocated, Minister Amaraweera said. The residents had requested land from the Greg Watte in Badulla but the estate company which leases out the land from the government has objected to land being given from there,
That land belongs to the state and no matter the objections, the government will make arrangements to give that land to the people or we will take it back from the company, the state minister said.
Thus far the government, he further explained had paid a sum of Rs.197.6 million for those in the affected houses and a further Rs.367.9 million as compensation for crop damage.
We have also written off their agricultural loans and provided more time to repay their other loans, he said.

An additional Rs.300 million has been released to the Badulla District Secretariat to settle compensation claims, he added.
The Valuation Department is faced with a staff shortage and the President has ordered that retired personnel from the Department be used to speed up the process, the minister said.
The biggest problem now is the shortage of drinking water. This has been a longstanding issue in Bandarawela but because of the project, the situation has worsened, the Minister said.
We have allocated Rs.325 million for two separate water schemes to resolve the matter. One is to be complete by the end of the month and the other in the next two months,
Amaraweera said.
President Maithripala Sirisena has stressed that these people need to be in a better situation from what they were before the project commenced and we are working to achieve that; no matter the cost,the minister said.

A conqueror conceived
If Vesak is important because Prince Siddhattha was born, then Esala is equally important as the prince was conceived in Queen Mahamaya. If Vesak is important because of the Buddhas awakening, then Esala is equally important as Siddhartha left all his luxuries for an ascetic life; this is when his son Rahula was born.
Queen Maya was born to King Anjana and Queen Yasodhara of the Koliya caste. That night she dreamt of gods, arrived from four directions, take her to lake Anotatta. She was bathed and donned in heavenly garb and jewellery. A white baby elephant, after circling around her three times, entered her body. As it is famously known, King Sudhodhanas prophets predicted this as a sign of a great beings arrival. The baby was conceived while the queen was on the way to her mothers.
The queens death, which occurred seven days after the princes birth, has caused contention. Some misunderstand that this took place as a result of the princes birth. The prince verified five factors, which included the mothers age-span, before expiring for his last birth. Queen Mahamayas life was anyway spanned only up to 40, and when a princely sage is born, that particular womb would not be suitable for another being.
Rahula, the son of Siddhartha and Yasodhara, was born after long time the couple got married. When the news was brought, the prince uttered: A fetter (rahula) has been born, a bondage has been born," and this is how the wee prince got his name. Some scripts believe he was named after a lunar eclipse (rahu) that might have occurred around the time of his birth. Whatever it is, the little prince made his father take that giant leap, and life to become harder later on. Towards evening Siddhartha finally decided to leave, taking one last look at Rahula and his mother in a peaceful slumber. But mothers arm was covering the childs face protectively  just as if to inspire him to go ahead with the decision.
Leaving the mansions
King Suddhodana did not ever want his son to leave the throne. It is common knowledge that the prince was given three palaces to spend the different seasons and the common mans life is kept out of his sight. Siddhattha was already surrounded by the sights of pleasure: beautiful women, dancers, singers and musicians.
But all this only made the prince curious about life.
One day while sentries are in deep slumber, the prince is said to have taken a tour in the city with his ally Channa. Then, the scriptures state, deities have sent him the four ominous signs. And then he was determined to leave for sanctity. Another day, the day his son was born, Siddattha renounced. Legend has it that he cut off his hair and threw it up to the sky. Deities from the thirty-three heavens got hold of that and offered saffron robes worn. He exchanged his royal garments with a deity, as scriptures relate. Prince Siddhatta thus became an ascetic. The little prince in the meanwhile knew his father was in robes, but his grandfather took every step to give him proper education. No one can say the Buddha neglected his fatherly duties. He was particularly concerned about the moral education of his son in robes. He put him directly under Sariputta and Moggallana. Genes do wonders, and Rahula could grasp anything in a second. He was always concerned about his teachers instructions. The Buddha was happy about him, and named him as the monk most concerned about training. He gave his entire heritage, no matter how little his son is.
Prince Siddhattha is much scoffed at, mostly among non-Buddhists, for leaving his son and wife when they needed his warm company. The question is what would happen, if he did change mind seeing his own babys face  Siddhartha, by all odds, was a 29-year robust young man. Some say the prince left the palace in the broad daylight when everybody was up. In that case, everyone must have attempted to make him stay. Suddhodanas palace would have looked like a funeral. Becoming a monk, ironically or sadly, is still considered a bad option in many families, unless they have financial issues. Siddhartha had no hard feelings about his small family. A poet sees the Buddhas giant step in that way:
Twas not through hatred of children sweet,
Twas not through hatred of His lovely wife, Whether he left in the broad daylight or at the night in secrecy, is still mystery.
First discourse
Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta comes in the 56th chapter of Samyutta Nikaya of Sutta Pitaka. In English Dhamma can mean nature or the Buddhas teachings. In this case it is the Buddhas teachings, and Dhamma Cakka is the wheel of the Buddhas teachings. Pavattana is setting in motion. The sutta is thus named because it was the Buddhas first discourse, hence its the starting point of a long mission. Wikipedia introduces a list of English translation by authoritative scholars:
1. Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 18437)
2. Setting in Motion the Wheel of Truth (Piyadassi, 1999)
3. Setting Rolling the Wheel of Truth (anamoli, 1993)
4. Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion (Thanissaro, 1993)
After enlightenment and the invitation to preach his teachings, the Buddha scanned the world for a being who should be taught first. This is his show of gratitude. He realizes his first teachers - though their teachings did not help in the enlightenment - Alara Kalama and Uddakaramaputta are dead. Then he examines the five ascetics who helped him.
The ascetics accept only the extreme of self mortification. This is why they left Siddattha when he took up the middle path. They saw their erstwhile companion approaching towards them, and they had a resolution not to attend to him.
But things took a different shape, when the Buddha got closer.
They noted something different, positive. They just forgot about their resolution, and attended to him with care. In the discourse the Buddha warns the ascetics against the two extremes: pleasure and mortification, and praised the middle path.
The Buddha introduces four noble truths and noble eight-fold path to explain the middle path. The path leads to right path of the journey of which the destination is enlightenment and nibbana.
The revelation was simple - basically the four noble truths - yet it was so deep to grasp. The truths, the Buddha explained, must be achieved in three aspects: recognizing, pursuing and fully achieving.
Only Kondanna, of the five ascetics, could attain the first sainthood.

'Constitutional reforms would bring instability to country'
Constitutional reforms would bring about many disputes and instability in the country, Buddhasasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya (BKSM) Secretary Most Ven. Thirikunamale Ananda Mahanayaka Thero said. He said so speaking at a media briefing at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress premises yesterday. The Thero said that the country did not need Constitutional reforms and it would create a controversial situation in the country.
He also said, Suspicion arises as to whether the new Constitution will not prioritize Buddhism and conserve it for future generations. Foreign forces seek to restructure the place received by Buddhism in the country and it would only create disputes which would also affect the archaeological value of the country. This would ultimately result in destruction of the country as a whole.
BKSM President Saddharma Keerthi Sri Thripitakacharya Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Nayaka Thero said the Sangha community would fight again to protect the Sinhala Buddhist country and to establish reconciliation among all irrespective of any partiality.
Presidnets Counsel Manohara de Silva said that not even one Bhikku or any Buddhist representative had been appointed to any of the steering committees engaged in reforming the Constitution.
The Presidents Counsel also said Constitutional reforms would permit the propagation of any religion and it would be a threat to Buddhism as well as to other religions in Sri Lanka. There would also be no limitations to propagate any culture according to Constitutional reforms, he added. Manohara de Silva further said that unity of the country would be adversely affected if the powers would be further delegated to Provincial Councils by the Central Government by Constitutional reforms.
Ven. Balangoda Sobitha Thero, All Ceylon Buddhist Womens Congress Secretary Kanthi Abeynayake, Damrivi Foundation President Prof. Asanga Thilakeratne, BKSM Members Jagath Sumathipala and Suren Abeyagunawardena also participated.

'Farmers should resort to inter-crop cultivation'
Uncertain weather:
Farmers should resort to inter-crop cultivation due to uncertain weather during the next Maha season.
They need to be aware of the variety of seeds that can be cultivated, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister and Mahaweli Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister said so at a meeting at the Welikanda Residential Project Management Office in Mahaweli B Zone, recently.
The minister said farmers received a good harvest from paddy cultivations in the Walawe Mahaweli region in the Yala season despite drought.
A type of lowland paddy which needed less water was cultivated in the region.
A bountiful harvest was received from there, the minister said. Farmers can be provided support for fish breeding in a cage culture system replacing paddy cultivation in case of drought, he said.
Our farmers are not aware of such sectors. A large income can be earned through inter-crop cultivation, the minister said.
We cannot rely on meteorological data and reports about rains during the next Maha season.The Meteorological Department says that the weather pattern is uncertain. During the past three years, less rain was experienced in the areas beyond the Central hills. Paddy was not cultivated in Hambantota for three seasons.
The situation in the North Central Province is similar. Paddy cultivation in the North Central Province had been curtailed for five seasons, Minister Amaraweera said.

Then I played for the under 14, 17 and for the first eleven teams. My first captain was Chandana Mahesh in the under 12 and 14 teams and Saman Grero led the under 19 team. My first eleven captain was Chandranath de Alwin in 1983/84. I played under Chandana Mahesh in 1984/85 and Saman Grero captained in the third term of 1985. I continued from 1986 January and in 1986 and 87 I captained the team. I got the opportunity to captain in two big matches. Altogether I played in four Big Matches. During this period there was no one-day games at our school.

After returning I went to my school to donate some cricket gear and the Principal was Mr. Mervyn Ruberu. During this period there was no permanent cricket coach at school and Mr. Ruberu requested from me to take over the coaching stint.
I obliged to his request. I never had an idea of becoming a cricket coach. In 2006 I got through the Level One Coaching Exam and I continued upto 2014 .
From 1998 to 2002 I coached my alma-mater free of charge. In 2014 one of my friends requested me to join Mahanama College, Colombo as the head coach. So I took over and served up to June 2016. On a request made by several Old Vidyalians I assumed the coaching stint at my alma-mater again.

Q - Who is the best all rounder produced from Moratu Vidyalaya
A - There were several all rounders produced from time to time during the past. But in my opinion Sarath Fernando comes to my mind. He played in the Big Match at the age of 14 years and joined Prince of Wales College. It was Cambrians gain and Vidyalians loss. He went onto represent Air Force, Moratuwa Sports Club and later Sri Lanka. Next comes Sanka Ramesh who is a very fine all rounder produced by our school during my time. He scored 1000 runs twice and at the same time claimed 100 wickets twice.
Q - How about Ajantha Mendis
A - He joined our school from St. Anthonys School Kadalana, Moratuwa and played for the under 15, 17 and 19 teams and captained the under 17 team.

Also we became under 13 Division Two champions and Division Two Under 15 champions. In 2011 we won the Under 19 Division two and in 2009 again we won the Division two Championship 2012. Both these seasons we won the Division Two Best Team Awards.
Q - Who were the people who were behind these achievements
A - The Principals. I have worked under five Principals, Masters in Charge and Members of the Staff and the Old Boys and Old Girls. The present Principal H. Athauda, the Prefect of Games, Najith Jayaweera and Master in Charge Rashika Chaminda are helping me. I should be failing in my duty if I do not mention about Lakshman Fernando for his unstinted support at all times. Our former MP and Minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga gave us a turf wicket and the present Colombo District MP and former Minister Gamini Lokuge built a boundary wall. Recently on a request made by me the District Coach Chaminda Jayasinghe gave us a boundary rope and a turf cover. We urgently require two sight screens and we are working on that project too.

LONDON AFP July7, 2017
Kei Nishikori suffered fresh Wimbledon misery as the Japanese star crashed out on Friday, while Victoria Azarenka stepped up her bid to become the first mother to win the All England Club title for 37 years.
Former US Open finalist Nishikori had hoped to finally advance past the fourth round at Wimbledon after years of underachievement.
But the world number nine didnt even reach the last 16 as he was over-powered 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 3-6, 6-3 by Spanish 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.
Nishikoris third round exit means Wimbledon remains the only Grand Slam he has failed to make the quarter-finals.
It was the 27-year-olds earliest departure from a major since his first round defeat against Benoit Paire at the 2015 US Open.

Govt. to take firm decision on Uma Oya project soon: Harin
The Government would soon take a firm decision on the Uma Oya multi-purpose project on the directives of international experts scheduled to visit the country by next month, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando.
The minister said so while addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday. He said that though the project had commenced during the last regime, it was the responsibility of the present government to bring an acceptable solution for the issues of the project, since the people of several areas Uva, have been affected by the project.
With the recommendations of the experts, the decision on whether to stop the project or to introduce measures to minimize the damage would be taken by the Government. He added that the affected people of the Uma Oya project have already been compensated. Accordingly, 2,400 affected families have been compensated with Rs 500 million. Besides, a sum of Rs 352 million have been allocated for a drinking water project for the affected people.
However, the Minister admitted that there were certain defects in the compensation process. Minister Fernando said that when the present government came to power, over 48 per cent of the project had been completed. Both the President and Prime Minister on a common stance to solve the issue as it is a burning problem to the people of Uva, he said. He said the President had appointed a Cabinet Sub Committee to look into the matter.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation would also be carried out to inquire into the misconducts of the project.
The investigation would draw attention on tender frauds, fake environmental impact report etc. The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry has announced a temporary suspension of the drilling operations taking place in the Uma Oya Project for ten days, until a solution was found for the water leakage that had taken place, he said.
Under this move, the project was temporarily suspended and all drilling machines would be withdrawn from the lower level of the tunnel within ten days. The suspension came after President Sirisena called those involved in the Uma Oya Project for a meeting to attempt find a solution to the situation that had arisen in the area surrounding the project. During the meeting, the decision on the temporary closure of the project was taken as an initial step to control the situation. Minister Fernando said the he was happy with the decision in a way. But if the drilling was suspended and the drilling machinery were to be removed, it would not be restarted in years, he said.
The Minister added that during the meeting held with the President, he had ordered for a sum of Rs.300 million be allocated to the Badulla District Secretary's office to provide relief to the people of the area after initiating an estimate done on the damage caused as a result of the project.
He further added that certain people were trying to receive political gains through this project. During discussions the representatives of the affected people had with the president, no one requested him to stop the project, but these very people say entirely different versions after going to Badulla, the Minister said.

Green August launches Green Walk
The Green August, a socio-environmental activist group, is to launch a Green Walk voicing the importance of environmental protection on July 8 and 9 from Kandy to Colombo.
They are to leave Kandy at 8 in the morning to reach Colombo by the next day. The walk is to begin at the Kandy Wewa Rawuma and the interested can join the 'Green August' team on July 8, at 7.00 a.m.
The Founder of Green August, Mohomed Farshan, speaking to Daily News said the immediate reason for organising the Green Walk is because Sri Lanka is at a eco-crisis.
While we raise our voice against environmental pollution, we do not just stop there.
We continue committing to raise awareness, and experiment to find solutions for short and long term environmental issues within our own communities, he said.
Farshan said several programmes such as collecting plastic bottles thrown either side of the Kany-Colombo road, planting trees in appropriate places by the side of the same route, distributing plants among people who are interested in growing trees, cleaning mosquito breeding places and reporting on illegal garbage dumping by the side of the road will take place corresponding to the Green Walk.
An eco friendly concept promotion will also take place along with the Green Walk together with schoolchildren, he said.
We recently launched a programme aiming the Yagoda-Gampaha railway track, among several other similar programmes under the theme Dont dump waste while travelling.
We collected mounts of plastic bottles from the sides of the railway track within just one km.
We are planning to launch similar programmes aiming to clean island wide railway tracks. Farshan said.
He requested to hand over plastic bottles to the Green August team. "For each kilo of plastic bottles you give, we will give a plant," he said.

Japan provides Rs. 358 m to continue scholarship programme
Two Exchanges of Notes between Sri Lanka and Japan, and Grant Agreements between Sri Lanka and JICA for the implementation of the Human Resources Development Scholarship Programme were signed at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry on June 30.
The documents were signed between Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media R. H. S. Samaratunga on behalf of the Sri Lankan government, Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma on behalf of the Japanese government and Chief Representative of JICA Tanaka Fusato.
The Japanese Grant Aid for Human Resources Development Scholarship (JDS) Programme was introduced in Sri Lanka in 2010 by the Government of Japan to provide opportunities to the executive level public sector officials to undergo Master Degree Programmes in prominent universities in Japan. Accordingly, under the first framework (2010-2013) and the second framework (2014-2017) of this programme opportunities have been provided to 120 officials (15 per year) for this purpose.
The second framework of this programme is scheduled to be completed in 2017 and the selection process of the final batch of the second framework has already been completed. The selected officials are scheduled to commence their studies in September 2017. In order to facilitate these officials, Japan has offered a grant assistance of Japanese Yen 208 million (approximately Rs. 282 million) to Sri Lanka for 2017.
In response to the request made by the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of Japan has agreed to continue this programme for a further period of four years. Accordingly, the third framework has been designed for the period of 2017  2020 to provide 15 scholarships per year to undergo Master Degree Programmes in Japan. After considering the necessity of further career development of JDS fellows, the Government of Japan has agreed to offer PhD programmes at most two slots per batch.
The selection process of the first batch of the third framework will commence in September 2017.
In order to facilitate these officials, the Government of Japan has offered a grant assistance of Japanese Yen 262 million (approximately Rs. 358 million) to Sri Lanka for 2018.

## Title: Jobs for graduates
## Supertitle:

Jobs for graduates
Colombo witnessed yet another demonstration on Thursday, this time by unemployed graduates. The very term unemployed graduates sounds like an oxymoron and in a way, it is. In the normal course of events, all graduates should find suitable employment once they pass out of university. But judging by Thursdays events, this does not always happen and there are many graduates who cannot find any form of employment.
There are several factors that lead to this unenviable situation. The most basic reason is that the graduates are not armed with skills and qualifications that match the requirements of the job market. Overall, Sri Lanka has a very low unemployment rate for a developing country. Still, plenty of vacancies exist if the applicants have the right skills and qualifications.
If you go through the Employment Opportunities section of our sister newspaper the Sunday Observer, you will see hundreds of jobs advertised by various companies here and abroad. The question arises as to why our graduates cannot apply for at least some of these jobs. The simple answer is that they cannot  their qualifications do not tally with those required by the world of industry and commerce in the wider world. In fact, this is a malady that pervades the entire education sector, which is still not geared to produce students who are properly oriented and equipped for the job market.
Another major factor is the graduates lack of English knowledge. Most private sector jobs (and even many Government ones) require fluency in English. Unfortunately, many negative connotations prevail among students on learning the much-feared Kaduwa (university parlance for English). These days should be over now. Today, one cannot move ahead in life without a good knowledge of English, which is vital for day to day work in the private and public sectors.
The third factor is fairly obvious  the Government just cannot provide employment to every graduate. Sri Lanka already has a bloated public service that employs more than one million people. Yes, public servants form a staggering one twentieth of the total population. Since only a few public entities actually earn any income (such as the Customs, Inland Revenue etc), all other public sector institutions have to be funded by the Government. In many departments and agencies, the approved cadre has been exceeded and until more people retire, it is not possible to employ newcomers. The only exception so far is the medical profession, where almost all interns get a permanent appointment in the Government health sector. This may not be possible a few years down the road due to the above-mentioned reason.
Most graduates know that there is no demand at all from any employer, public or private, for some of the subjects they follow. They should not assume that the Government is in a position to employ them all. This attitude must change. Most foreign Governments do not grant appointments to graduates, doctors included. They have to find jobs on their own.
The best way to address the graduate unemployment problem is to tailor the entire education curricula from Ordinary Level to University to suit the job market. More attention should be paid to the teaching of vocational subjects which are in high demand in the industry. There should also be an emphasis on English and other foreign languages to catch the overseas job market too.
Some years ago, the private sector initiated a programme called Tharuna Aruna where graduates were placed in private sector companies for around six months to give them a practical idea of corporate culture and work, in addition to English in a business environment. Some of the graduates were then inducted to the companies concerned. This programme should be revived to at least partially solve the graduate unemployment issue.
More graduates should also be directed towards self-employment and Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs). One unfortunate result of free education is that students are conditioned to get everything from the State without ever striving to do anything on their own. However, there are many paths to employment other than the Government sector. The graduates can be guided towards self-employment and SME projects by a relevant institution in partnership with the universities.
Another lacuna in our university education system that the students are locked-in to their initial course for the duration of the degree programme. In many other countries, students can switch courses midway if they feel that an alternative course has better job prospects. The possibility of introducing such an arrangement here should be explored.
All university students and degree holders, including those who protest against SAITM and graduate unemployment, must remember one vital fact: university admission is a rare privilege in this country. Only 26,000 students are enrolled into Government universities per year and around 150,000 students who gain the minimum entry qualifications are left out with little options for higher education. All university students and graduates must therefore make the best out of that opportunity without necessarily trying to depend on Governmental support for the rest of their lives.

## Title: Joe Root: Swann, Anderson, Woakes on Englands new skipper
## Supertitle:

Joe Root: Swann, Anderson, Woakes on Englands new skipper
On Thursday, Joseph Edward Root walked out at Lord's to toss the coin as the 80th man to captain England in Test cricket and made it a memorable one when he also followed it up with a century.
Tipped for the top job long before Alastair Cook resigned in February, a quirk of the fixture list has meant a five-month wait for Root to lead his country against South Africa.
The 26-year-old is a prolific run-scorer, a proud Yorkshireman and a new father - that much we know.
Here, those who have been with Root at key moments in his life reveal what has made him into a leader; from the baby with a bat in his hand, to teenage prodigy, a cheeky chappy who became a captain.
HE HAD A BAT IN HIS HAND THE DAY HE CAME OUT OF HOSPITAL
Root's grandfather was one of five boys, all of whom played cricket. His father Matt, good enough to represent the MCC at Lord's, turned out for Sheffield Collegiate, the club that produced former England skipper Michael Vaughan. Root's younger brother Billy currently plays for Nottinghamshire.
I made him a little cardboard bat and he had it in his hand on the day he came out of hospital, said Matt. As soon as he could walk, we put him into one of those things where he could wheel himself around and he was whacking furniture with a bat.
When he was old enough, he would field when the Sheffield Collegiate first team were netting, then he would insist on having some throw-downs until it went dark or the thrower got tired. On Saturdays, I'd be playing, Joe and Billy would put their stumps in on the other side of the boundary and have their own game all day.
When Joe was about eight, I was playing for the Yorkshire League against the Bradford League. We were fielding and the ball went towards the boundary. He ran on to the pitch, picked it up and threw it in, straight into the wicketkeeper's gloves. He got a round of applause from the crowd.
He was opening the batting in under-13 cricket at the age of nine or 10. He was very small, so the ball was always around his shoulders. That's probably why he's so good off the back foot now.
Joe just used to grind out runs. He really, really didn't want to get out. He loved batting at a really early age. More often than not he'd be run out, either because he didn't cover the ground very quickly, or team-mates would get fed up with him occupying the crease all the time.
There was always cricket, but Joe also played football for Nottingham Forest under-eights. He packed it in because it interfered with his Sunday morning nets.
When he was about 11, I asked Joe what he wanted to when he grew up. He said he wanted to play for England. Someone has got to do it and, maybe because he'd seen Michael Vaughan do it, he didn't see any reason why he couldn't be one that got the privilege.
IF I HAD KNOCKED HIM OUT, I WOULD HAVE LOST MY JOB
At 13, Root became the youngest player to be given a scholarship by Yorkshire. As part of his introduction to the club he went to Headingley one winter evening to meet batting coach Kevin Sharp. Before the meeting, ex-Tykes batsman Sharp had been working with Anthony McGrath, who played four Tests for England in 2003.
The way he talked, he could have been an adult, said Sharp. He knew the strengths of his game, what he needed to work on in order to get better. It was quite remarkable. I thought if he can bat as well as he can talk, he's going to be very good'.
He said he wanted a challenge, the same session that [former Yorkshire captain] McGrath had just had. I'd been training McGrath for Championship cricket, bowling with a new ball off only eight yards. I said to Joe we can't do that, I'll hurt you'. He just smiled and said that he'd be all right. I said put all your protective equipment on, because I'm coming for you'.
We had 20 minutes of very quick, very intensive stuff and Joe dealt with it unbelievably well. He had a great technique. He knew when to play, when to leave.
He loved the short ball. I bowled a bouncer, which I shouldn't have done because if it had knocked him out I would have lost my job. It clipped his helmet grille. He just smiled and said that was a good ball'.
He always challenges himself to get better, practises out of his comfort zone, as if he is getting ready for the next level. He makes training harder than matchplay, so he is prepared for whatever may come.
Once, when he was about 17, we were on a pre-season tour to Barbados. We were at the Three Ws ground [named after Windies legends Frank Worrell, Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott] and there was a dark indoor school with a concrete floor. He went in and set up an eight-yard pitch, put his gear on and then came to me with a new ball.
He said coach, we're going to play Test cricket for 15 minutes. All you have got to do is run in and hit me on the head'.
I did as he asked. I hit him on the head, the chest and the throat.
He just kept smiling and nodding at me. After 15 minutes, I said I've done what you asked. I've hit you on the head four times'.
He said I know, but you haven't got me out'.
WHERE HAS THIS COME FROM
Root made his Yorkshire debut in 2009 at the age of 18, scoring 63 in a one-day game against Essex. Less than two years later he was opening the batting for England Lions in a side captained by fellow future Test batsman James Taylor.
When people say that he arrived in the England team as a fully formed batsman it makes me laugh, because we never saw it with the Lions, said Taylor. When he went on to play for England, we were thinking where has this come from'.
I didn't see that period of progression from Lions to England. When I saw him playing for England I was thinking how's he got this good We were all baffled because we didn't see him growing up and all the hard work that went into it. We saw a guy that, in the Lions, was technically good but didn't score too many runs. Underneath that, the talent was unbelievable.
We played with him a fair amount and never saw him being that good. It was phenomenal how quickly he learned and progressed.
I'm a big believer that the best players are the quickest learners, and Joe is an exceptionally quick learner. He went on England's tour of India in 2012 and that's where he made massive strides forward, making huge progress in the nets.
He didn't play in the first three Tests. Some people, when they are out of the side just think oh, I'm carrying the drinks and they sit on their backside wishing they were playing.
Others use that time to learn, work hard, get better and fitter. Joe did that and that was the difference between having the potential to be exceptional, and actually being very good in the England team straight away. Not many people perform on debut and Root did it.
BRILLIANT, WE'VE GOT A MASCOT
Root, aged 21, had only played two full seasons of first-class cricket when he was called into the England squad for the tour of India in late 2012. His selection was more on potential than weight of runs. That summer, he had managed 738 in Division Two of the County Championship.
He joined a team full of Ashes winners that had topped the world rankings the 12 months beforehand - the likes of Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Graeme Swann. He was such a rookie, that some of them barely knew who he was.
I'd never come across him before that tour, said Swann. I knew his name, but knew nothing about his game. When he turned up I thought brilliant, we've got a mascot to take on tour with us, because he looked about 16 at a push.
When you haven't seen anyone before, you sum them up the first time you bowl at them in the nets. Straight away I thought wow, this kid can actually bat'. Instantly he was the best player of spin in the team. He was very confident, punchy and almost arrogant in a good way.
I think all the bowlers were chivvying Andy Flower, the coach, saying that we had to get him in the team because he was brilliant. I certainly was.
In the dressing room, it was like having your cheeky little brother around. He was always there being a pest, doing stupid little jokes, or getting stuck into the cake trolley. He was a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of youngsters who were straight-down-the-line robots.
From the first time I saw him in the nets I thought he would be an England player for the rest of his life. That was confirmed after he had faced about 15 balls in his first Test.
HE'S NOT THE GUY TO BOWL AT WHEN YOU'RE GETTING READY FOR A TEST
Root made 73 on debut in the final Test as England secured a first series win in India for 27 years, and was in the side for the back-to-back Ashes series that followed. However, with England having a miserable time down under in 2013-14, he was left out of the final Test in Sydney.
His return at the beginning of the following summer sparked a remarkable period of run-scoring. Just over a year later, he was ranked as the number one Test batsman in the world.
It wasn't like he was getting dropped and being tossed aside, said England fast bowler James Anderson. It was pretty obvious he was going to play a big part in the future of English cricket, but he was still very young. It was probably a clever thing to take him out of the firing line in order to look after him.
Clearly, it wasn't a great trip. When you're 20 years old, all you want to do is go out there and play cricket. At the same age I was at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa and we had all the distractions of whether we should go to Zimbabwe or not. It was probably a shock for Joe that international cricket isn't just turning up and scoring runs.
I remember how hurt he was when he did get dropped. He has always been desperate to play for England and to get a taste of that and then have it taken away can be difficult to deal with. I think that showed in the way he went away and worked on his game. He went to the relevant coaches and picked some brains to figure out what he could do to develop his game.
I like the way that he prepares individually for series - he knows who he is going to come up against, so he'll tailor his game. That's something you think is a given in a lot of players, but even in international cricket you'll see some that, once they have had a few good scores, they will keep practising nicely at the things they are good at.
Joe is someone who takes himself out of his comfort zone in practice. It's tough to bowl to him in the nets. I always think I can get him out, but then there are times when you can see how good he is. He's probably not the best guy to bowl at when you're trying to build confidence in preparation for a Test.
People talk about Joe, Virat Kohli, Steve Smith and Kane Williamson as the best four players in the world. If Joe was to rank them, he'd put himself at number four. He's that sort of person. Because he's quite shy, I don't think he likes that praise too much.
THEY WERE CALLING HIM CASPER THE GHOST

Root was named England vice-captain in the summer of 2015, confirmation that he was Cook's successor-in-waiting. When Cook resigned in February this year, Root's elevation was close to a formality. He was made skipper a month after the birth of his first son, Alfred.
He's always been the cheeky chappy off the field, in the dressing room and even on the pitch, said England all-rounder Chris Woakes. He's always smiling and joking around. I think that's his way of staying in the zone, not getting too serious.
People talk about him being a prankster, but that's not what I see in Joe, it's more the banter. He's very happy to give it out in the dressing room, but he also occasionally keeps himself to himself, especially on tour.
You might not see him for a couple of days and you might think where's Rooty been There was one tour when he was in his room for a couple of days and the lads were calling him Casper the ghost.
Then, all of a sudden, he's at the forefront again. He probably needs to take himself away, have his little bit of me time, then come back champing at your heels again.
Being a dad has matured him a fraction. From a social side it does change your life a bit - you're not always going to be the first one in the bar.
You have other duties. Still, he's very much a team man and will try to spend as much time with the team as possible.
Fatherhood will help his time away from cricket. As an international, you're always thinking about cricket, so that might be good for him to get away from it. It might even help his batting.
He hasn't changed in the months since he was made Test captain, but that will probably have to come because captains need to have difficult discussions with players. I think he'll embrace the job and I'm sure he'll pick the brains of Alastair Cook. The more he stays himself, the better he'll be. - BBC

Kohli leads India to series win over West Indies
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Thursday: Virat Kohli stroked a commanding, unbeaten 111 to lead India to a series-clinching eight-wicket win over the West Indies in the fifth and final one-day international at Sabina Park on Thursday.
Responding to the home side's modest total of 205 for nine after captain Jason Holder chose to bat first in Jamaica, the visitors skipper ensured there was to be no upset with the target reached in the 37th over to give India a 3-1 series triumph.
Stung by an 11-run defeat in the fourth match in Antigua, when they failed to reach an even smaller target of 190, the Indians were in no mood to let their opponents off the hook this time around.
An early strike by fast bowler Alzarri Joseph in removing Shikhar Dhawan at the start of the chase ushered in Kohli who immediately set about the bowling.
He put on 79 for the second wicket with Ajinkya Rahane before the opener fell leg-before to spinner Devendra Bishoo. It was his first score under 50 in the series.
Dinesh Karthik joined his leader in the 19th over and was prepared to play the supporting role to a rampant Kohli, his 28th ODI century coming up off 108 deliveries with one six and 12 fours decorating his authoritative innings.
Karthik reached an unbeaten 50 in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 122 just before Kohli finished the match with his second six off Roston Chase.
Earlier, opening bowlers Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav shared seven wickets in restricting the West Indies after they were well poised at 76 for one in the 16th over.
Seeking victory to earn a share of the honours from a campaign in which they entered as huge underdogs, the home side's only substantial contributions came from the Hope brothers, Shai and Kyle.
Shai topscored with 51, his second half-century of the series, while Kyle contributed 46 at the top of the order.
All-rounders Holder and Rovman Powell got to 36 and 31 respectively but failed to capitalise on decent starts as India tightened the screws on their opponents with disciplined bowling from the two frontline seamers towards the end of the innings.
Shami finished with four for 48 while Yadav completed his ten-over spell with three wickets at a cost of 53 runs. India conclude this brief visit to the Caribbean on Sunday when they take on the West Indies in a solitary T20 international at the same venue.

Lanka on the verge of first ODI series win in two years
HAMBANTOTA: Sri Lanka are on the verge of winning their first One-Day International series since November 2015 when they take on Zimbabwe in the fourth match of a five-match series at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Sooriyawewa today.
Sri Lankas last win in a bilateral ODI series against a full member was in November 2015 if their win over Ireland (who were recently granted full ICC membership) in June 2016 is not to be seriously considered.
Since that win over West Indies at home Sri Lanka has struggled to perform consistently in this format and it shows in their current rankings where they are placed eighth and struggling to avoid qualifying for the 2019 Cricket World Cup where only the top eight ranked teams automatically qualify and, the teams ranked lower than eight will have to come through a qualifying tournament.
A series win over Zimbabwe who are ranked lower than Sri Lanka will not fetch them many points but help them to marginally improve their points rankings as only three points separate Sri Lanka and seventh and sixth placed Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Todays game is a must-win for Zimbabwe if they are to keep the series alive. They began on a high chasing down the highest total ever by a winning team in Sri Lanka  317 in the first ODI at Galle by scoring 322-4, but have been outplayed in the next two matches with Sri Lanka raising their bar to win by seven wickets and by eight wickets.
Its very important for us to win this series. I dont want any complacency creeping in and we want to finish it off, said Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews.
What we need is consistency. We cant score 300 everyday. We can lose one or two games, but if we bat well every day thats great. Some days we dont do well. If we want to improve we need to be consistent, he said.
Mathews praised the batting efforts of openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka who made their maiden ODI centuries in laying the foundation for Sri Lankas successful run chase of 311 with a double century partnership.
Its very pleasing to see the way they batted. Very encouraging to see them not getting 50s and 60s and throwing it away. They did exactly what the team wanted. Pity they couldnt finish it through, but that was good job, said Mathews.
We have backed him to bat the way he wants. We have told him that when he gets a 30 or 40 to bat long and everyone will benefit. It looks like everyone is learning. Niroshan is a fearless cricketer and he wants to take on all the bowlers, great attitude to have.
With the crosswinds and a flat batting pitch the bowlers of both sides had a tough day on Thursday. The conditions are not expected to change today and another high scoring game is on the cards.
Sri Lanka will be without Nuwan Pradeep their most consistent bowler in the series although his efforts are not reflected by the figures. Pradeep has strained his right quadricep during the seventh over of the 3rd ODI on Thursday and has been ruled out of the series. Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara has been drafted into the squad in his place along with another young fast bowler Asitha Fernando who impressed at the recently concluded Super Provincial tournament with 12 wickets in 6 games at 30.75. Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer blamed his bowlers for allowing Sri Lanka chase down 311 and win.
On the bowling side we need to bowl better. I thought we bowled both sides of the wicket. We needed to go shorter or fuller. Theres not much you can change in one day. We will keep positives and try and stay positive. Try and restrict them, said Cremer.
Zimbabwe were also let down by some crucial catches being dropped where Dickwella and Gunathilaka were let off early within the space of two balls. The positive for them was the return to form of opener Hamilton Masakadza who scored his fifth ODI century and laid the foundation for Zimbabwes total which in the end proved to be insufficient.  ST

Lawsuit challenging SLFP Chairmanship fixed for order
The Colombo District Court yesterday set August 3 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised against a lawsuit that sought an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the chairman of the party once again.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary through his counsel had raised objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
This lawsuit had been filed by two plaintiffs K.D.Aruna Priyashantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Elections Commission Chairman as defendants.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC in January 2015 over the appointment of a new SLFP Chairman.
They plaintiffs further alleged that the executive committer of the party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.

Manek-Sands horror injury puts Djokovic, Federer in shadow
LONDON, Thursday - Colourful US star Bethanie Mattek-Sands suffered an horrific knee injury at Wimbledon on Thursday which left her screaming in pain, pleading for help and officials accused of freezing in her desperate moment of need.
The distressing drama on Court 17, where the 32-year-old lay stricken for at least 20 minutes, pushed the title campaigns of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer onto the sidelines.
Please help me! Please! Please! screamed Mattek-Sands as she clutched her right knee after collapsing running to the net in the first point of the deciding set of her second round match against Romanias Sorana Cirstea.
The womens tour said Mattek-Sands had suffered an acute knee injury and had been taken to hospital.
Cirstea questioned why it took so long for the medical team to arrive at Court 17 which is right next door to the tournaments famed Centre Court.
She was in shock. Her knee was in a very weird position. Ive never seen anything like this except in the movies, said Cirstea.
And, yeah, I panicked a little bit, as well. I called for help, but no one was coming.
Everyone froze and I screamed something to the chair umpire. Bethanie was saying Sorana, please help me. But I felt useless. I wished I could have done more.
It felt forever for help to come. It was me, her husband Justin and my physio. I dont know for how long she was on the ground, but I would say 10, 15 minutes.
The All England Club defended their response, claiming: The first response to Court 17 was within one minute, by a qualified ambulance technician.
In a statement, they added: The player was kept on court while pain relief was given.
The player was then transferred directly to an ambulance and taken under emergency conditions to a hospital.
Meanwhile, Djokovic shrugged off sweltering 30-degree heat to breeze past outclassed Adam Pavlasek 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round.
The three-time champion brushed aside the 136rd-ranked Czech to make the last-32 for the ninth year in succession.
Djokovic, the second seed whose shock third round loss to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon 12 months ago precipitated a worrying decline in form, will next face Ernests Gulbis.
Gulbis, a former top 10 player, sprang a surprise as the world number 589 defeated former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
Third seed Federer continued his campaign for a record eighth Wimbledon title by seeing off world number 79 Dusan Lajovic 7-6 (7/0), 6-3, 6-2 to reach the third round for the 15th time. The Swiss star next faces German serve-and-volleyer Mischa Zverev.
US 17th seed Jack Sock suffered the biggest upset of the day, losing to 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-2 to Austrian world number 217 Sebastian Ofner who had never played at the majors before this week.  AFP

In memory of Ven Welivita Saranankara Sangharaja Thera
The pioneer of the present Buddhist revival, Ven Welivita Saranankara Sangharaja Thera will be commemorated at Malwatte Maha Viharaya presided over by Ven Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Maha Nayaka Thera of Malwatte Chapter on July 8 at 1.30 pm. This will be followed by the Sri Sangharaja Perahera to be held for the 71st successive year parading the streets of Kandy.
Patronised by the Malwatte Chapter Maha Nayaka Thera and Central Province Governor, Niluka Ekanayake heads the organizing committee with Sri Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya President L H Harischandra, Secretary Sarath Perera, Treasurer Chapa Weeraratne, Kantha Sangamaya President Kusuma Weeraratne, Chief Ministers Secretary Tissa Karunaratne and various Buddhist societies and traders of the city, Kandy Municipality, Sri Sangaraja Daham Pasala and Sri Dalada Maligava. This perahera, as usual, will be held under the guidance of the Ven Mahopadyaya Agga Maha Panditha Aluthgama Dhammananda Nayaka Thera and his chief pupil Ven Ketayapatane Piyadassi Nayaka Thera.
Ven Welivita Saranankara Sangharaja Thera was born in the village Welivita near Thumpane in the Kandy District on June 18, 1698. His father was Mudliyar Kulatunga and was given the name Kulatunga Banda. He was ordained at the Suriyagoda Raja Maha Viharaya by the Viharadhipathi Kithsirimevan Rajasurendra Gaumnanse who was also the Viharadhipathi of Poya Malu Viharaya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya.
There were no bhikkhus who had higher ordination during the time and only the novices called Ganinnanses were in the viharayas.
It was Rev Jacome Gonsalves, Goan missionary to Sri Lanka, Father of Sinhala Catholic literature of the Catholic Church, who predicted the complete eradication of Buddhist doctrine within two years. As the king Weera Parakrama Narendrasinghe (1707-1739) who ruled the country during the time was in close association with this father and other priests of the church, Saranankara Samanera could not get the help of the king to foster the sasana, but he was successful in getting the help of the king to inaugurate the first pirivena of the present Buddhist revival at Niyamakanda in Udunuwara.
Ven Welivita Saranankara Samanera Thera did not like the ways and manners of the Ganinnanses who were married and kept views and children in viharayas. He organized a separate Bhikku  clan called Silvath Samagama. The church did not like this Silvath Samagama and was in a murder spree by poisoning many samaneras of this Samagama. A conspiracy by the chief priest of the Christian church to poison the Sangharaja through Kafirs was exposed and was taken by the Dutch Governor who ruled the coastal areas who deported the priest to his homeland. This was narrated in the prose book Mandaram Puwatha.
All aspirations of Venerable Saranankara Thera were fulfilled after King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1782 AC) ascended the throne.
The king could get the help of the Dutch to provide a ship Tharka for the emissaries to travel to Siam (Thailand) to bring Bhikkhus for higher ordination.
King Dharmika of Siam sent 21 Bhikkhus, eight novices and three Siamese Ministers by a Siamese ship which landed at the Trincomalee Harbour on Esala Poya Day in 1746 AC. Sri Lankan Ministers returned to Colombo by the Dutch ship. The historic Upasampadawa was held at the Visumgrama Seema Malakaya.
Uposathagaraya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1753, by Venerable Upali Maha Thera of Siam establishing a clan of Bhikkhus called Shiampali Maha Nikaya (combination of two words Shiam and Upali became Shiampali.)
Ven Aluthgama Dhammananda Thera of Malwatte Maha Viharaya inaugurated the Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya, Kandy on May 15, 1947, at a meeting held at Sri Pushpadana Hall presided over by Ven Rambukwelle Sri Sobitha Maha Nayake Thera of Malwatte Chapter, assisted by G O D College, Kandy and decided to hold an annual perahera to commemorate the Sangharaja, along with some other activists.
The first Sangharaja perahera was held on July 25, 1947, starting from Daluggolla Raja Maha Viharaya, Ampitiya where the remains of Sangharaja were cremated and a Chaithya constructed by King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe enshrining the ashes of Sangharaja along with the relics of the Buddha.
The Sangharaja statue was unveiled by Pananwala Basnayake Nilame of Srimath Upulwan Devalaya while a perahera organised by C B Nugawela, Diyawadana Nilame coalesced with this perahera near the Sri Dalada Maligawa and paraded the streets of Kandy to end up at Malwatte Maha Vihara.

Mind full, or mindful
There are over ten verses in the Citta Vagga of Dhammapada on the theme of mind.
One example is how the wise man should straighten his mind as a fletcher straightens an arrow. The mind quivers and throbs like a fish out of water. A tamed mind brings happiness. The mind wanders afar, is solitary, formless and rests in the cave of the heart. Those who subdue it are free from the bonds of Mara (death). Neither mother nor father nor any other relative can do a greater good than a well directed controlled mind. An ill-directed mind is one's greatest enemy.
Mindfulness is an alert state of mind that has to be cultivated constantly as the foundation for understanding and insight. It is not an inert state of mind. Insight is discriminative knowledge or intuitive appreciation, translated as wisdom in Buddhism. Mindfulness is mainly analytical in contemplating the diverse factors in the body, the sensations, the thought-process, and phenomena, but goes further in a higher synthesis of consciousness in the deep trance (Samadhi). In Buddhist terminology, this deep state of trance is called one-pointedness concentration or composure of the mind and is the outcome of the meditative focus on a single wholesome object.
Hindrances
In the discourse with Ganaka Moggallana the Buddha describes the way how he used to train the disciples in a stepwise manner. He has mentioned about training in morality, sense-control, moderation in eating, vigilance, mindfulness and clear consciousness, overcoming of the five hindrances (covetousness, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubt) and jhanas.
By getting rid of these five defilements or obstructions one reaches the first stage of meditation characterised by mental rapture and joy. Then he reaches a stage of tranquillized fixed mind on one point. This is the second stage. The third state is reached when the mind is in a stage of mindful equanimity.
By getting rid of anguish and going through one's former pleasures and sorrows ones mind becomes completely purified without anguish and joy-equanimity and mindful. This is the fourth stage of mindfulness.
In the Dantabhumi Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya), the Buddha explains to the Venerable Aciravata Thera why Prince Jayasena living in sense pleasures could not be convinced in the Dhamma. The Buddha strikes a simile of taming a wild elephant. The tame comes again in the Cattuka Nipata (Anguttara Nikaya) the Buddha declares the types of thoroughbred steeds among men in the world who require four different types of training for training in mindfulness.
Calm
The Satipattana Sutta implies the setting up of the mind in mindfulness. It describes the fourfold meditation exercises to control of calm the body, feelings, the mind and mental objects. The method of investigation into the observation of the mental processes is essentially induction on cognition of a single moment of consciousness. It is introspective mindfulness or attention (sati).
In The Questions of King Milinda, King Milinda who was perplexed over the concept of mindfulness poses several questions to Venerable Nagasena Thera. Venerable Nagasena Thera observes that the distinguishing mark of mindfulness is the nature of non-drifting.
When mindfulness arises one does not drift in regard to mental states that are wholesome, unwholesome, blameable, blameless, low, lofty, dark, bright or evenly mixed. There are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five spiritual faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path which come into focus. When mindfulness is arising one examines the salient qualities of one's mental states. Venerable Nagasena Thera compares the function of the store-keeper of a wheel-turning king (Chakravarti) who continually reminds the king of his glories and wealth.
He also makes another simile of the advisor-treasurer of the king who advises the king of the beneficial and detrimental functions of good governance. The Elder states that there are sixteen ways how mindfulness arises.
Welfare
Personal experience as observed in Venerable Ananda Thera and the female devotee Kjujjuttara, outside influence to remind a forgetful subject, consciousness of woe, consciousness of welfare, a similar appearance (seeing a person resembling one's brother becomes mindful of one's own brother), a dissimilar appearance (symbolic representation of an object by colour, sound, feeling etc), understanding due to speech, identifying a distinguishing mark (a brand mark), urge by others, training, calculation, learning by heart, mental development, reference to a book, association of ideas and previous experience. It has been stated in 'The Question of King Milinda', that the Buddha's analysis of the human mind has been a difficult task than analysing the different types of water in the ocean.
The failure to achieve full knowledge of one's own nature is the worst and greatest loss' declared the Buddha. Lust, hatred, jealousy, pride so forth are unwholesome states of mind. These are called defilements which are based on ignorance and these spoil the smooth working of the mind. These arise because of unmindfulness of the mind. Mindfulness means vigilance.

North Koreas birthday gift
On July 4th, United States National Day North Korea successfully tested an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile Hwasong -14 and called it a birthday present to the United States. The missile with a range of 550 miles reached altitude of 1,740 miles. It is said that it could reach Alaska or Hawaii. The United States retaliated with a joint military manoeuvre with the South Korean Army shooting a shower of missiles.
This heightens tension in the Korean peninsula. What more it has the potential of developing into a confrontation that would amount to a second edition of the Korean War that ended in the middle 1950s. The two Koreas are still technically at war since no Armistice treaty has been signed.
The United States has announced that it will consider all options, including military means to contain the nuclear development programme of North Korea. However, the first option seems to be the imposition of more and stringent sanctions on North Korea. The United States has also announced that it would impose sanctions on countries that trade with North Korea, thereby hinting at China. Whether the United States could pressurize China to do so is a moot point. United States maintains that China has not adequately pressurized North Korea to refrain from developing its nuclear arms programme. At the same time it knows that China cannot do so beyond a certain point.
In a frantic response the President Trump has taken a series of unfriendly measure against China during this week. They include sanctioning a Chinese shipping company, placing China as a Tier 3 country trafficking in persons in its annual report on the subject, sending a US Navy destroyer to pass close to a Chinese island in the South China Sea and notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan.
On the other hand, the United States has not taken any steps against nuclear arms development by Pakistan and Israel, both of which have not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The United States has the largest stockpile of nuclear arms and therefore its stand against North Korea seems morally unjust.
Both China and Russia are sure to veto any Security Council resolution that will contain stringent sanctions on North Korea. They will weaken the sanctions as far as possible. A joint statement by Russia and China called for a halt to military action by both sides and engage in talks.
The actual fact is that there is no military solution to the Korean issue. What North Korea is doing is to use nuclear deterrent to guarantee its security and territorial integrity. A military confrontation would spread to the entire North East Asia and involve all major world powers.
The only solution is through negotiations. What is urgent is to re-summon the six- nation Committee comprising the United States, China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas through diplomatic efforts. North Korea is insisting on direct talks with the United States. It demands the removal of the US military from South Korea and a guarantee of North Koreas security, which is understandable.
Meanwhile, Japan has not signed any peace treaty with either of the two Koreas following its defeat in the Second World War. Hence, Japans alliance with the United States in any military alliance or action has the possibility of complicating an already complicated issue.
New chapter inIndia-Israel relations
A new chapter was opened in India-Israeli relations with the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel. It was the first time that an Indian Prime Minister had visited Israel in its 70 year history. Israel was so pleased with the visit and Prime Minister Netanyahu accompanied the Indian Prime Minister during most of the visit.
During the visit the two countries agreed to enhance their cooperation in several fields including agriculture, industry and defense. India will be buying military hardware from Israel and the two countries will jointly produce some defense equipment.
Prime Minister came to Israel after a similarly successful visit to the United States where he was welcomed warmly. The two visits together show a new orientation in Indian foreign policy. It is a shift away from the non-aligned foreign policy which was followed earlier. This shift is further evidenced by the proposed joint military exercises by India, the United States and Japan.
This fits into the American strategy of containing the influence of China in South and South East Asia and weakening any pan-Asian unity or alliance. Taken together with United States defense cooperation in North East Asia and South East Asia it gives the United States entry into the maritime regions of the Asia-Pacific region.

Handing over varsities to private sector: 'Proposal not even discussed'
The Government has not decided to hand over Colombo and Peradeniya Universities to the private sector by removing them from the University Grants Commission (UGC), Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
The minister made this clarification when JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayathissa queried the veracity of the news reports that the Government has proposed to make the Colombo and Peradeniya Universities independent and profit making institutions, by taking them off the UGC.
MP Jayathissa pointed out that the proposal had come out at a meeting of the Oversight Committee dealing with Higher Education and headed by UNP MP Prof Ashu Marasinghe.
The oversight committee may discuss various proposals, but those do not reflect the Government policy. The Higher Education Ministry has not even discussed such a proposal, the Minster explained.
Speaker, Leader of the House at loggerheads over question raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardena
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday, had a dispute with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that the question under the Standing Order 23 (2), which the latter permitted MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena to raise in Parliament, did not carry any national importance. The Leader of the House pointed out that Standing Order 23 (2) is clear enough that only matters of national importance could be raised under it. MP Gunawardenas question was related to relocation of families whose lands were taken over for the construction of the Ampara Urban bus stop. MP Gunawardena said the people who were evicted to construct the bus stop, were residing in those lands since the commencement of the Gal Oya Development Board. He added that those families had faced severe inconveniences as alternative lands provided by the Government were far away.
Objecting at this point, Kiriella said, The matter regarding the Ampara bus stop is not of national importance. Allowing the MP to raise it is a violation of Standing Orders. If this continues, one might also raise a question on the Ampara toilet under the same provision.
MP Gunawardena replied that the Speaker had given permission to raise the question. Speaker Jayasuriya, while stating that he would take extra care hereafter before approving the statements, however allowed the MP to continue as it has already been listed in the agenda. Intervening at this point, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said, The Speaker has been challenged by Kiriella. Standing Orders are interpreted by the Speaker and not by the Leader of the House.
MP Gunawardena said he had to bring the attention of the House to the matter as the Urban Council does not function due to the delay in holding LG elections.
At this point, Kiriella was seen quipping at MP Gunawardena over the question.Joint Opposition MP Shriyani Wijewickrema could be heard shouting at Kiriella (without microphone) asking him not to make a mockery of peoples problems. UNP backbencher MP Heshan Withanage was heard retorting (without microphone), then lets cry from today, to which MP Wijewickrama was quick to reply, Yes, people have now been compelled to cry.
Kiriella said the question would be referred to the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister for a reply at a future date.

Piyasena Gamage allowed to intervene in Geethas appeal
The Supreme Court yesterday allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage to intervene into the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep also decided to name Piyasena Gamage as the fifth respondent in the Appeal.

Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by five residents of the Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka. Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment.
On May 15, a divided three-judge-Supreme Court Bench had granted special leave to appeal with the petition filed by Geetha Kumarasinghe. In his petition, former MP Piyasena Gamage observed that Interim order granted to Geetha Kumarasinghe should be set aside or vacate as the intervenient petition had not been named as a respondent.
The Chief Justice had nominated a fuller bench comprising five judges of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal filed by Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
In this petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L.Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Secretary General of Parliament and several others as respondents.

The former President and his team could not bring reconciliation, but President Maithripala Sirisena did it, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara yesterday said.
The governor said he salutes the former President, the former Defence Secretary, and the armed forces for ending 32-year-long terrorism and President Sirisena for bringing in reconciliation.
"The former President should have asked the people living in North and East what type of development they required and provided it building brotherhood. As an adviser to the former President at that time, I advised him and the former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa in this regard," he said. .
Nanayakkara said the President started the reconciliation process from the very first day he assumed the presidency. He started it with the Prime Minister. The reconciliation is not the ripping off the rights of the Sinhala Buddhists. It is not trampling Sinhala Buddhists living in their motherland with a historical culture of over 5,000 years old.
"Even after murdering hundreds of Sinhala Buddhist devotees at the Jaya Shri Maha Bodhi, bombing Shri Dalada Maligawa, and massacring 33 Buddhist Bhikkus at Aranthalawa, Sinhala Buddhists did not take arms against the LTTE. All ethnicities want reconciliation,", he said.

Sri Lanka has no room now for dictatorial or military rule: President
President Maithripala Sirisena says it was a dictatorial, military rule he ended on January 8, 2015 and the country has no any room for such a rule again.
The President was speaking at a ceremony held on Thursday to open the newly built administration building at the Irrigation Training Institute in Galgamuwa.
The people today has understood the conspiracies by some persons to come into power by showing a fantasy world, he said.
The government is ready to reveal the fraud and corruption committed by the persons in the pretext of development. They are fabricating fairytale on the development while trying to convince that the current government is an incapable, failed government, he said.
The President said a cheque worth billions related to the Gin-Nilwala Ganga Project had been issued on January 7, 2015, a day before the Presidential Election, when no government office was working. Some persons challenged us to reveal if any fraud had been occurred. By now the matters regarding the fraud were revealed. We can show the people what happened to that money, the President said. He said the Uma Oya Project, which commenced according to political decisions without any capacity evaluation, devastated the country.
Everybody should get together not to change the government, but to free the country and the people from poverty, free the country from the millions worth credit burden created by the former government and take the country towards development, the President said.
I have a humble happiness that the media today can criticise the government and anybody can protest freely, he said.
Every political party spoke about the water requirement to Wayamba. But it is the current government that resolved thet issue through the Moragahakanda Project. The Wayamba Ela Project and the Moragahakanda reservoir will result in renovating over 300 tanks in the Kurunegala district. It will transform the irrigation sector and the lives of the people in the district, he said.
The President opened the building and inspected the premises.
He registered three students for the Irrigation Training Institute by symbolizing the admission of students to the institute.
The diploma holders received certificates from the President. Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, State Ministers Palitha Range Bandara, T. B.

Sri Lanka picks three countries to import 200,000 MT of rice
A four man team of Lankan officials was scheduled to leave for Pakistan yesterday to pick rice varieties for the domestic rice market.
On July 12, the team will head to Myanmar from Islamabad to test Burmese rice varieties for the Lankan market.
The Yala seasons failure and the floods created this rice shortage, said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, during his progress review with officials.
He said, We have picked Myanmar, Pakistan and India and the country that did not get in was Indonesia.
Minister Bathiudeen added: The officials team, after checking the Pakistani and Myanmar markets, will decide whether to choose Pakistan or Myanmar (or both) to purchase the 100,000 MT rice. Whether it is finally supplied by one or both countries, the purchase shall be at Government to Government levels.
The team of officials is led by Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Commerce Chinthana Lokuhetti, and two officials from the Finance Ministry and a food technologist from ITI.
More than 50% of this 100,000 MT rice would be par-boiled (Nadu) variety with the rest in white raw, and samba.
Sri Lanka is also purchasing another 100,000 MT rice from India immediately. This is not at Government to Government levels but from the Indian private sector (Government to private sector). Tenders from Indian private suppliers are being received and the winning Indian supplier is expected to be picked by July 17. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has also commenced Government to Government rice purchase talks with Thailands Ministry of Commerce this week. These talks are conducted to procure stand-by buffer rice stocks for any future emergencies and not for immediate use (as done with India, Pakistan and Myanmar).
A Sri Lankan team of officials is scheduled to fly to Bangkok next week to meet Thai officials and decide on varieties, possibly around 100,000 MT of rice which will include par-boiled (Nadu), white raw, and samba.On June 22, Minister Bathiudeen met the Ambassador Designate of Thailand to Sri Lanka Mrs Chulamanee Chartsuwan, Ambassador of Indonesia to Sri Lanka Gusti Ngurah Ardiyasa and Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan Dr.Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra at the Ministry to call for government to government rice supplies to Sri Lanka. All the Ambassadors present pledged immediate support to Minister Bathiudeen and President Maithripala Sirisenas efforts to procure the rice tranche. The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) will be in charge of the local distribution work of imported rice. Minister Bathiudeen added: The officials team, after checking the Pakistani and Myanmar markets, will decide whether to choose Pakistan or Myanmar (or both) to purchase the 100,000 MT rice.

They didnt want me  to disclose the truth : Pan Asia Bank DGM
Treasury Bond issue :
In a shocking revelation at the Bond Commission hearing yesterday Richard Dias, the Deputy General Manager of Pan Asia Bank, said that Arjun Aloysius and former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank Nimal Perera had called him on multiple occasions to pressure him into  not disclosing the truth during evidence.
Giving evidence before the Commission for the second time yesterday, Dias said that Aloysius called him on June 29 following a news item on the electronic media. He (Aloysius) pleaded me to meet with him. I showed him my dissatisfaction (about being a part of the issue) because Im a professional and my career is at stake, Dias said giving testimony led by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathillake.
Giving further evidence, Dias said that Aloysius insisted that the two of them met and accordingly on June 30, Dias went to the home of Aloysius.
Aloysius asked me what I would like to drink and I asked for a glass of water. Dias said the two spoke of the news item that was telecast.
Aloysius told me that even if I was told to walk out (of the current job) that I will have a place in his (Aloysiuss company.
Justice Jayawardena asked Dias as to why he went to meet Aloysius at his home. Dias said following the media report, the PABC has raised some concern regarding the matter and that he ( Dias) was worried about the possibility of being fired.
I wanted to know if the former Chairman Nimal Perera has discussed anything regarding my job with Mr. Aloysius. That is why I went to his place.
I also expressed my dissatisfaction regarding the whole matter. My career and my reputation are at stake. I am very worried as to what my family and relatives think of me as well. Dias added.
Thereafter Dias said he received three telephone calls from Arjun Aloysius on June 3 and 4, 2017. According to the evidence lead, Dias has received calls at 9.12 pm on June 3 and at 6.31 am and 3.48 pm on June 4. Dias said he refrained from answering any of the calls.
Asked as to what Dias assumes regarding these communications and the attempted ones, he said, They probably would have been trying to prevent me from revealing truth at the Commission Asked as to what he refers to as the truth, Dias said it means the revelations he is making regarding the intermediary role the PABC played under the directions of former Chairman Nimal Perera in consultation with PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius.
I then received a call from my former Chairman Nimal Perera on June 4, 2017 in the evening around 3.21 pm. I was leaving the Treasury bond Commission after giving statements to the police team. Since I received the call while I was traveling, I told him that I will call back. Then after reaching my office, I called my former Chairman, Dias said.
Dias was then requested to describe the content of the conversation that transpired between himself and Nimal Perera.
His initial call was a shock to me. He asked me whether I have been summoned by the Presidential Commission to testify. I told him No. I explained to him that I was only there to give a statement to the police. But Nimal Perera said that I will be summoned before the Commission to testify. I did not know about it by then. Dias explained.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena directed the Attorney Generals Office to look for legal provisions to take action against Aloysius and Perera for interfering with witnesses of the Commission. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera consented.
Dias further went on to say that Nimal Perera assured him a place in his moneybroking company if he had to walk out of his current working place. Dias said it was only later he received a call requesting to come before the Commission to testify.
Commissioner Justice P.S.Jayawardena asked whether the witness knew Arjun Aloysius before. He said he had met him several times at former PABC Chairman Nimal Pereras residence. Asked as to why he went to Nimal Pereras house, Dias said he was requested to come to meet PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius regarding secondary market transactions of February 27, 2015 bonds and the issued PTL faced in not being able to settle the Intra Day facility provided by the CBSL to Primary Dealers on March 2016.
According to evidence given by Dias, the PABC purchased the February 27,2015 Treasury bonds in the secondary bond market under the instructions of former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera.
The quantity and the prices were decided by the PTL, it was also said. In March 2016, when the PTL was short in liquidity to settle the Intraday Liquidity facility provided by the CBSL, the Former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera again instructed Dias to purchase assets from the PTL as a means of injecting money to the PTL to settle their issue.
I thought it was a very risky thing to do from the part of my bank and my career. I was the one who should take the decision in doing as requested by former Chairman Nimal Perera. So I refused to do as instructed, Dias said.
Dias said he once met Aloysisus when he was visiting Pereras house regarding a matter mentioned above. I met Aloysius in the lift. I cannot remember if PTL CEO was in the lift as well, Dias said.
Commissioner Justice P.S.Jayawardena then questioned Dias regarding the lift he was speaking about.
You keep referring to a lift. Where were you meeting Nimal Perera Justice Jayawardena questioned.
I met him at his residence, Dias replied.
Do you mean to say there is a lift in Nimal Pereras house Justice Jayawardena asked. Dias confirmed so.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera voicing his views following Justice Jayawardenas remark that isnt it a normal house said it should be a palace then, to the much amusement of those who were present at the hearing.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake produced contact details of Aloysius and Nimal Perera to the Commission.
He also produced deal tickets relating to transactions where PABC has acted as an intermediary between the PTL and the EPF at the February 27,2015 auction.
Justice Jayawardena reflecting on a document produced asked as to why an image of a crown similar to British Monarchs appear above Nimal Pereras contact details. I am baffled as to why a crown appears there. Justice Jayawardena said. It is the British Crown! he pointed out.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda rose to say since his friend De Livera suggested Nimal Pereras house seem to be a palace a crown is rather matching as well.
The telephone call recordings relevant to the 27 February 2015 auction that have taken place between the PABC, PTL and the EPF will be produced before the Commission next Monday (10).
PTL counsel Nihal Fernando PC requested the presence of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to get instructions regarding the call recordings if necessary to which the Presidential Commission granted permission.

Timeless teachings
The Buddha the supreme, Thathagatha the Perfect One the universal teacher the great Master, the fountain of love and compassion blessed the humanity with the absolute truth for the solace of the living, their wellbeing and their ultimate goal of eternal emancipation. The enlightenment of the Buddha achieved with great hardship led to the emergence of Dhamma the doctrine the sublime truth he discovered with this overwhelming wisdom. He decided to proclaim it to the world it was offered in the greater interest of the mankind for the benefit of generations to come.
He, in turn, expected them to give his doctrine the foremost place, protect and foster the Buddhas teachings that later spread peacefully across the face of Asia. His faithful followers did preserve the age old spirituality the universal law of existence which he and we call Dhamma. The great Master wanted it to be disseminated in lightning speed to the entire globe which we are witnessing at the moment.
Having attained Buddhahood he set on foot to Benares, the capital of Kasi Kingdom with a determined mind to deliver the truth to the five ascetics, his former companions. Though the five ascetics were reluctant to welcome the Buddha, they just could not give into their wishes. Their persistent efforts failed. As the sacred one approached their relationship was enriched at first sight due to their realisation that he is now an outstanding human being with full of love and compassion unparalleled and full of human values having realised the noble truth.
Their devoted efforts culminated in understanding the sermons delivered by the great Master. His vision and Philosophy and innermost feelings saw the light of the day as Buddha Dhamma to the entire universe. He was the top-most being the wisdom and insight who performed miraculous feats alight and walk immediately after birth and various marvellous events came to their minds. They were reminded of the vital role played to forbid evil to attain the ultimate goal of liberation.
The Buddha delivered the first sermon and Ven. Kondanna attained the eye of Dhamma due to his meritorious deed in his previous births and became the first disciple. The others listened with faith and they too became Arahants and finally with the Dhamma Chakka Pavathna Sutta honoured by the Devas Brahmas and mother earth he sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma to achieve liberation from all samsaric ills.
All these took place at Isipatana Migadaya on Esala full moon day. His words, his desana are timeless and immortal. He who follows the Dhamma and lives with a tranquil mind. The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble one (The Buddha) The Dhammapada.

True democrats, speak up, please!
In the past, Lankan rulers ignored even the minimum fair play introduced in the first constitution, which resulted in them failing to achieve the objective of a united developed nation. Thereafter went on to introduce two new constitutions prepared in the dark without consulting the people, that resulted in many amendments and the country was in chaos plunging it into a bloody civil war that ended in 2009 with the intervention of India and few western nations; followed by a fascistic rule up to 2015, when the democratic upsurge replaced the rulers. A fact to date not well understood by the people, in spite of disasters popping up like mushrooms all over the island, these are mostly caused by their bad governance.
The previous rulers were voted back to parliament and are sitting in opposition, who simply create trouble making life difficult for the present rulers to work; in an uncertain political dynamics. This conspiracy is not possible, because people here irrespective of nationality or religion have pressing their leaders without mercy. After all the leaders are only human like any other citizen; people can change the behaviour of these leaders for change that comes from within the conscious mass movements.
Violation of constitution
It is claimed that at the time of independence in 1948, to resolve the ethnic problem many safeguards for the minorities were provided in the first constitution of Lanka. Yet the backward mentality of the majority of people enabled the leadership to work in violation of the constitution by excluding the protective provisions that gave safeguard to the minorities.
These provisions were systematically removed in the second constitution and went out of the way to include protective provisions for Buddhist Sinhalese, not needed for the majority community under true democracy. Then came the present constitution with certain obnoxious features. Subsequently introduced amendments are bluntly discriminatory to the minorities. This led the country to a civil war and with the intervention left movement the 13th Amendment to the present constitution was introduced in 1987 to devolve power to the peripheries with the Provincial Council system intended mainly to protect the rights of the Tamil speaking minorities. Unfortunately, that was never implemented properly and helped only to prolong the civil war. Today, the Tamil speaking people are expecting at least, the core of the 13th Amendment to be drafted into the new constitution in full, excluding the concurrent list that provided overlapping responsibilities between center and the peripheries making it difficult to implement the Provincial Council system.
Mahinda group
At a time when the people, in particular the poor are unable to make ends meet, it appears to them that the Mahinda group legislators are hell bent on sabotaging the new constitution. Both the President and the Prime Minister have repeatedly said that unitary status and pride of place for Buddhism will be retained in the new constitution. Many suggests government needs only to include clauses in the constitution to enable the followers of other religions to practice their faith without hindrance in any part of the country and the new constitution will only come into operation if it gets accepted by the people in a referendum. Even Marxist can agree to such a set up as Buddhist philosophy rejects supernatural creations and accept dialectics of nature.
Many believe that a golden opportunity now exist and the President and Prime Minister has demonstrated to the people that they are different with their respective legislators; hence to assist them to go ahead with the new constitution.
They must use every opportunity to explain to the people of the need to get the nationality conflict a thing of the past; making it clear to the people of their policy to resolve the national problem. In this scenario referring to non-governmental organisations Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stated They have been very active under every government.
When they sense a change of any incumbent government, they throw their weight behind the emerging force ahead of the elections. Then they try to become heroes soon after the formation of the government, staking a claim for it.
Purawasi Balaya
This organisation called Purawasi Balaya, boasts of playing a role in the formation of the government. It cannot get even10, 000 votes single-handed, in reality. They cannot get even a member elected to a local authority. Vickramabahu Karunarathne has been in politics for such long years. Yet, he cannot get elected even to a local body. Though these NGO fellows crow over, they do not have public support. We are the ones elected by the people. We command their support. These elements always try to project a chaotic image of the country, as a point to raise funds internationally in terms of US dollars. They depend on dollars.
This intervention of Minister Wijeyadasa came as a shock to those stood firmly against racist fascistic politics. The problem of Wijeyadasa is that he speaks without proper information. In the case of Christian religious places discriminated, harassed or attacked, he did not want to investigate the complaint; instead depended on Catholic Cardinals statement and concluded that Lakshan is a liar and he should be punished. This action is totally unfair to both to the Cardinal and the lawyer. In the above statement too, he refers to Purawasi Balaya and Vickramabahu as NGOs. This is ridiculous; Purawasi Balaya is a mass organisation with a social democratic programme which was published and distributed properly. They participated in the democratic campaign that brought Yaha Palanaya to power.
I belong to the registered political party- Nava Sama Samaja party; a Marxist party. We were in a joint action front with the UNP since 2008. Under difficult conditions we participated in the campaign against the fascistic Mahinda regime. We do not want fascistic rulers back and we support the proposed constitution with substantial power to minorities. I have been a member of Colombo Municipal Council from 1995 to 1999, when I became a member of western Provincial Council. Later I became a member of Dehiwala Mt Lavonia Municipal Council until last year. Also, after the presidential victory there was a National Executive Committee for general supervision and I was appointed as one of the 15 members. Surely, that means some section of the democratic mass movement stood by me. Thus I am a political leader funded by supporters.
As a member of the Fourth International I am supported by Marxists world over. On the other hand Western bourgeois governments do not support Marxist parties in the world! Only other resource I have is the money his government payed as back wages, for my position as a teacher in engineering mathematics in the Engineering Faculty at Peradeniya!
On this subject of NGOs; Minister in charge, Mano Ganeshan said On the subject of regulating the NGOs, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe must be having his own reasons. But as the Minister for this subject I dont see any serious reason to regulate NGOs in this country. I even dont want to use the word, Regulation but Facilitation as long as they meet the lawful requirements. After I took office and the National Secretariat for NGOs brought under my ministry, I have taken very many steps. I have eased the pressures in them. NGOs were considered as traitors and the INGOs were considered as enemies then. It was once upon a time. Now I have given strict instructions to the Director-General of the NGO Secretariat and his staff under me to consider NGOs and INGOs as partners in the state building. They are the civil society organisations who stood with us during the, hey days. I was there all alive with Civil Monitoring Commission, Vipakshaya Virodhaya and Samagi Peramuna. In fact I played sizable role in such struggle movement since back as year 2005 with Raviraj, Lasantha, Bahu, Siritunga, Britto, Nimalka, and Priyani when even the traditional CSOs and politicians backed due to fear. I cant drop or ignore them. I call them as Civil Society Organisations (CSO) rather than NGOs.
Nation building
I have the blessings of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on this. President Sirisena has told us in the Cabinet in general to get all the forces to build the country. Taking the clue, I am now establishing nation-wide, district-wide, division-wide CSO councils. Even some CSOs misunderstand this. But its an independent network. My ministry is doing the facilitation part. I am going to get them official placements in the district and divisional DCC meetings to have their say in the development and nation building affaires with the elected representatives and state officials. We require all actors of the nation including the civil society at every DCC meetings, where decisions are made on the spending of state funds. This will reduce the levels of corruption, wastage, mismanagement and identify the priorities of the poor masses.
Minister Rajapakshe says that some NGOs are detrimental to national reconciliation and religious harmony. But we are political tendencies within the democratic movement that defeated Mahinda regime. If such sabotage is done by an organisation whether NGO or otherwise, Wijeyadasa can take action through police or the relevant ministry without behaving in an inappropriate manner.
There are wrong doers in the parliament too. There are violators in all branches of the state. The Yahapalanaya should identify them and clean the institutions in the best interest of the country.

Uma Oya project to go ahead: Minister
The government will go ahead with the completion of the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project as the majority of work has already been completed, Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
The project would resolve water issues in the Moneragala District and while the last government also planned to take water to Hambantota through it, due to protests, we have limited the project to Moneragala, the Minister said.
We also expect it to serve the Badulla district, the minister said addressing a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resouces Ministry.
He stressed that contrary to various reports, almost 45 percent of the project had been completed when the government took over office in 2015.
According to the State Minister, it would take another three years of remedial measures to bring back the water table to normal after the project had dried up many of the brooks in the area.
At this point, it is better to complete the project and resolve the environmental problems than stop it all together,the Minister said.
Amaraweera who is part of a three member Cabinet Sub-Committee to look into the issues surrounding the project undertook a tour of the area and recently submitted his findings to the President.
On Thursday evening, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development released a statement stating that drill machines at the lower sector of the tunnel will be removed within the next ten days and excavation work would be suspended until a water leak is fixed.
The Swiss team which was consulted for the project has recommended that we use a more modern machine for excavations which can seal the leaks after drilling. We should have used such a machine from the start but that was not done. We are going to bring down the parts needed for that, Amaraweera said.
A team from Norway too is set to visit the country on July 31 and the Minister added that the government take further action based on their report which is expected to be submitted by August 15.
We will seek both local and foreign expertise on it. But thus far it has become clear that a project of such nature and magnitude needed a more in depth environmental impact assessment than what had been done, he said.
Our reports also indicate that these drilling machines were more suitable for desert conditions and not sensitive environments like ours. If we used the right machinery, such water issues would not have arisen, he added.
The state minister also revealed that the Iranian company; FARAB Energy and Water Project Company contracted to undertake the project had no experience in this area and it was their first such project.Perhaps they were recommended by the Iranian government. We are not sure, but all this would be looked into by the Parliament Select Committee appointed to investigate into it,he said.
Iran, said Amaraweera had initially provided a loan of USD 50 million for the project in 2008 but the funds had dried up later on.
The project is now fully funded by the government and was expected to cost Rs.80 billion in total but with the recent environmental disaster, costs are expect to increase significantly, he added.
We have thus far spent Rs.67 million,Amaraweera said.

What is the best way to promote football
Kandy Sports Round-Up:
The newly elected FFSL committee must undertake an initiative to make football a sport of choice. In the famous city of Kandy, where rugby rules the popularity charts, the Kandys football lovers are making an attempt to make football the No 1 sport. Incidentally, the move comes after the popularity gained by the supporters. Sad to say for the first time Kandy FL was not entitled to attend the FFSL AGM, because they had not held their AGM.
However the Kandy FL president was made a vice president of the FFSL at the AGM. Thus the man who failed to conduct tournaments in the proper way for the last couple of years and also failed to hold this years AGM was elected as one of the Vice Presidents of FFSL. That is the sporting friendship that exists at present in football. Today the Kandy FL is run by coaches they only want their coaching seminars and coaching classes, no tournaments. At the moment Kandys football is in a mess and run by coaches who have misbehaved and were punished by the law. Kandys football lovers expect a lot from the new committee.
Iswan back as head
Iswan Omar former Trinity, Kandy RFC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla ACC, Uva, Dickoya MCC, Up-Country and Sri Lanka Presidents XV forward continues as the president of the CPRFU after being elected once again at the AGM. He is a man who has been there with CPRFU since its formation in 1992. The committee is formed by members from the following, Kandy SC, Dimbulla ACC, Dickoya MCC, Peradeniya University, Kandy Youth SC, OTSC, Old Antonians SC, Old Kingswoodians SC, Matale RFC and OTSC but only the first named club plays the game, while the others have forgotten it. The Office bearers: Patron Dharmasiri Madugalla, Trustee Malik Samarawickrema, President Iswan Omar, Past Presidents Mohan Samarakoon, Trevor Nugawela , Vice President Tuan Dole, Secretary Gerald Rasiah, Treasurer C.P.P. Raj.
Two from Kandy schools
The FFSL has picked a 30 player pool for the AFC U16 Championship 2018 Qualifiers for the South Asia  Japan Four Nations tournament. Of them two are from Kandy schools M. Akram of Berawerts College and Vishalka Sulakshana of St. Sylvesters College.
A football tournament for Chief Ministers trophy
Plans are afoot to organize a football tournament called the Chief Ministers knockout 11-a-side football tournament in Kandy. Eight teams will be invited which will be a straight quarter-finals that will be followed by the semi-finals and final. The organizers are hoping to invite the President Maithripala Sirisena for the final along with some of the veteran footballers living in Kandy like Tuany Amidon. M. Jamaldeen, B.D. Alfred and R. M Shafeek Nizam. The champion team will get the Chief Ministers trophy and Rs. 150,000 and the runner-up Rs. 100,000, the two losing semi-finalists will get Rs. 50,000 each and the four quarterfinalists Rs. 25,000 each. The veteran players too will be benefited.
Mahamaya girls champs
At the 44th all island age group aquatic championship Mahamaya Girls College won first place with 518 points for the 19th time in a row and in the junior event were placed 5th with 432 points. In the individual championship Girls High Schools K.U. Kulatunga won in the under 19 category. In the under 19 team championship Mahamaya Girls with 178 points emerged champions and their under 17 with 192 points were also champions.
All schools did well though failing to win a trophy
Out of seven schools from Kandy in the inter school rugby sevens, two entered the cup semis, three were in the lower segment quarters and semis. Trinity for the first time beat Royal College this season in the sevens quarters, and in the semis went down to S. Thomas College 14-21. Kingswood College who beat Science College in the quarters was beaten by Isipathana College 14-19 in the semis. St. Anthonys College came up to the quarterfinals and lost to Isipathana College and in the plate semis went down to Science. St. Sylvesters in the Shield semifinals went down to Moratuwa MV, and in the Bowl semis Vidyartha were beaten by St. Joseph's. Dharmaraja were shown the exit door in the Bowl quarters by Wesley.
KSC had their first meeting
Kandy Sports Club who had their AGM a few Sundays back, are forced to call for a SGM due to an accounts mess up. They had their first committee meeting last evening at the club house and the day before the meeting a selected crowd met for a dinner, to decide the date of the SGM. The president of the club was a worried man over the accounts matter appearing in the media.
Kandy Rugby Academy to help CPRFU
The Kandy Rugby Academy under the chairmanship of former Zahirian A.W.A. Rasheed is going all-out to give a helping hand to the young ruggeirtes. Today this rugby academy can be rated as one of the best in the country, which gives a big hand for the young ruggerites.
There are however moves to undermine the work done by this academy with moves to start another rival academy. This is sports promotion in Kandy today.

What chances for constitutional reform
Is the proposed new Constitution to be pushed into the political garbage
Progress on the new Constitution is certainly the major issue the government will have to face in the coming weeks and months, while the garbage issue remains an explosive social and political matter that transcends the attachments of party politics, posing a danger to peace in society.
The Government has to now deal with a major opposition to the new Constitution that has come from a prominent section of the Buddhist clergy, reflecting the opposition to proposed constitutional changes that have been announced by the governments political opponents in the Joint Opposition (JO), and strongly backed by nationalist and communal, ethnic and religious forces that are stoking fears of the proposed constitutional changes leading to federalism, and challenging the position of Buddhism in the country.
The statement by the Sangha of the three Nikayas that there is no need for a new Constitution or any amendments to the present Constitution, raises the issue of how the government could remain committed to implementing the pledges given to the people to bring in a new Constitution that will abolish the Executive Presidency, in the campaign for the Presidential Poll in January 2015.
This major issue of government policy made President Maithripala Sirisena to meet members of the Sangha who informed him of their decision arrived at the Sangha Sabha held last Tuesday. This meeting at Kandy will certainly be important on matters of constitutional change, as well as other matters that has been addressed by this section of the Sangha, such as the SAITM issue with a call for a settlement soon, and opposition to the Bill on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, which has already been presented in Parliament.
Goodwill
Possibly as a gesture of goodwill to the position of the Sangha and other critics, the government did not go ahead with the debate on this Bill in Parliament, which was due on Tuesday, but held it back. With such a gesture, President Sirisena will certainly seek to reach some understanding with the representatives of the Sangha on the major issue of constitutional reform. But, the politics within the government, and among opposition forces in the country will certainly make this no easy task.
The statement by Cabinet spokesman, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, that it is the responsibility of the government to fulfill the peoples mandate  given by 6.2 million of voters, does not readily meet the issues raised by the Sangha on the issue of constitutional change. It is correct that the proposed constitutional changes will have to be adopted by Parliament, before it goes for endorsement by the people at a referendum. But, the issues of constitutional changes, especially the abolition of the Executive Presidency, and the very matter of a referendum, have been matters of important rivalry within the government itself.
There is a considerable number of SLFP members in the present coalition of National Unity who are opposed both to a referendum and the abolition of the Executive Presidency. They have been falling in line with the JO on this matter and showing support for the new tactics of the Mahinda Rajapaksa strategists on the emerging political situation. These SLFPers, the sections of the Sangha, and nationalist groups who are now opposing any constitutional change, and especially the abolition of the Executive Presidency, were all supportive (or never opposed) the removal of the Executive Presidency when it was in the three election manifestos of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and proposed even earlier by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The change in the nature of the presidency, from that of Executive status to a more ceremonial one, is a matter that was before the public of this country for at least three decades. It has been and remains one of the key aspects of opposition to the constitutional changes introduced by JR Jayewardene in 1977/78 that brought in the right wing authoritative rule, which has shown increasing signs of dictatorial rule, the worst aspects of which were seen in the final years of the Rajapaksa Regime.
The opposition by this section of the Sangha, no doubt from all three Nikayas, raises important questions for the government on how it is to implement at least one key proposal of the manifesto that saw the election of President Sirisena in January 2015, and later led to forming the National Coalition after the General Election in August that year. It is the promise to abolish the Executive Presidency, and bringing a new and more democratic constitution.
The government certainly has itself to blame, to a very large extent, for the opposition to constitutional change that is making a major impact on the politics of the country. This has to do with the absence of a peoples campaign led by the government, and supported by the civil society organisations that helped its victory in January 2015 on constitutional reform. The UNP-SLFP divisions within the government may have led to this lethargy on necessary political action. It is now faced with a situation that may even compel it to abandon these constitutional changes, which would lead to a major political setback to the coalition of National Unity, but much more to the section of the SLFP that is within the government and not playing games with the JO and the Rajapaksa strategists.
SAITM and GMOA
Referred to by the section of the Sangha that has opposed constitutional change, SAITM remains a pressing issue for the government. The GMOA was compelled to take a step back from its threatened continuous strike due to public concern, protests by sections opposed to its continuous strike weapon, and the call by the Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjth, asking doctors to give consideration to the spread of Dengue among the people. But, the issue of SAITM has clearly become one of political opposition to the government, much more than an issue of the education of medical students.
While awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court on the SLMCs objection to the Court of Appeals decision on registering SAITM students (which petition is now being supported by the GMOA), it is necessary for the government to decide on a clear action on dealing with the SAITM issue, and the entire issue of the role of the private sector in medical education. The GMOA, in claiming that its interest in opposing SAITM is because of its interest for the future safety of patients, is caught in the midst of many contradictions on the selection of students for state university training in medicine. The need for more doctors, and the need to give a fair opportunity to all students who qualify to enter state universities, to be admitted for such training, even in different institutions, is an issue that cannot be delayed any further.
This reality of serving the interests of the student population who are qualified to enter university medical facilities (without the District Quota advantage) is the key issue of the SAITM-GMOA dispute, and it is best if the government takes this up as a public issue, which will make the public at large understand the growing crisis in medical education, the role of doctors in state hospitals and their role in private hospitals, too. This is an important issue for public debate that could well expose the wrong or unfair lines that the GMOA has been following on this matter so far.
The garbage bin
If any lessons are drawn from the debate in Parliament earlier this week on the garbage issue, it is clear this is a matter that cannot be pushed aside with political slogans, and promises of speedy action. Colombo city alone is a major location of a garbage crisis. There are ministers making rival claims on how it could best be solved, and about who would or could solve it. Judging from what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on the matter, there are also signs of a possible clash between the Executive and Judiciary on the matter of garbage. This is certainly to be avoided.
Although this crisis that has come down from the last regime, there is little benefit in continuing to blame it on the previous government. The public caught in the midst of all this garbage, and the necessity to fight Dengue, is certainly not prepared to listen to the tossing of blame from one to another. What are needed are quick and clear action, with the public informed of the plans being made, with community discussions on the actions that could be taken, and a clear timetable on future action.
The statements of Ministers and public officials, especially from local government bodies, on reasons for the failure to address the crisis are not sufficient, and not useful. The public needs better proof of action, if this crisis is to be contained and resolved with a proper plan of action. The Government will of course have to face criticism over the continued delay in local government elections, which is part of the political garbage of today.
