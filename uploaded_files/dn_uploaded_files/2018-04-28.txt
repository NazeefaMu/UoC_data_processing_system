10 Instances of how much cricket has changed in the last 10 years
The last week of the IPL just showed us a massive amount of runs being chased successfully, something we didn't think was possible 10 years ago. And don't be surprised when you are told that there was a lot more that we never saw coming.
1. Sachin Tendulkar became the first man on the planet to score a 200 in ODIs.
Before 2010, nobody even thought about this seriously. Surely, many came close, but nobody could ever cross that fine line, until, 'The Superman from India' did it for the first time in Gwalior against South Africa.
2. There have been 13 scores of 400+ since 2008.
10 years ago, before T20 started, scoring 400 in a 50-over game would have made national headlines for at least a couple of days.
3. AB de Villiers obliterated the previous record of fastest century when he scored a 100 of 31 balls. (use AB de Villiers pic)
ABD smashed 16 sixes on his way to becoming the fastest centurion in International cricket against West Indies in 2015.
4. Rahul Dravid hit a hat-trick of sixes on his T20 debut.
If you had told people some 10 years ago that Dravid would step out and slog Samit Patel for 3 consecutive sixes, they would have called you a nutcase.
5. England winning a World Cup.
They invented the game and yet hadn't won a World Cup until Kevin Pietersen found a way for them to lift the T20 World Cup in 2010.
6. Mitchell Starc bowls the fastest delivery of this decade, clocks at 160.4 kph. (use
Mitchell Starc pic)
With the retirement of Brett Lee from International cricket, we believed that a great generation of fast bowlers had come to an end. I mean, sure, there were a lot of them that could consistently hit 140-150 kph but there were hardly any, who would even dare to go beyond that speed and risk getting injured. Well, Mitchell Starc had different ideas.
7. Where many batsmen fail to score double centuries in tests, Rohit Sharma has the unqiue record of scoring two of them in ODIs.
There was a time when 264 was a good total for a team to score. I mean, sure, Sharma had previously scored a 200 against Australia but this was something different. The Hitman hit 33 boundaries during his innings. Meanwhile, chasing India's score, Sri Lanka was bundled out for a mere 251!
8. Chris Gayle's destroys Pune Warriors with a 175* in a T20 game. (use Chris Gayle pic)
The West Indian legend scored the fastest century in any format of the game in just 30 balls. But he didn't stop there. He hit 17 sixes on his way to scoring 175* against Pune Warriors. In response, Pune was bundled out for a mere 133 runs.
9. Chris Gayle became the only man to score 10,000 runs in T20 cricket.
Admittedly, not all of these games were international matches but that does not take away the credit from the Carribean maestro. Gayle also has the world record for most centuries (20) and fifties (68), highest individual score and the joint fastest fifty (12 balls), the most sixes (823) and fours (842) in the shortest format of the game.
10. The Cricket All-Star in America gave us chance to see legends from different generations playing against each other.
10 years ago, if someone had told you that you would get to see a Warne vs Sachin or a Wasim Akram vs Sachin one more time, you would have probably nodded with a sarcastic smile. But in 2015, in order to popularise the game in the USA, two teams that consisted of legends like Tendular, Warne, Lara, McGrath, Wasim akram and Courtney Walsh among others played in two friendly games against each other.
There is a saying in cricket which implies that the game isn't over until the last ball is bowled or the last run is scored. So the game can always spring surprises out of nowehere, which is exactly what it has managed to do in the last decade. - Scoopwhoop

Avant Garde Vessel Operations Manager remanded till May 3
Galle Chief Magistrate A Nishantha Peiris remanded the Operations Manager of the Vessel MV Avant Garde until May 3, when he was produced before him on Tuesday by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) .
The remanded Operations Manager Millaniyage Sumudu Nilupul who is an ex-major of the Sri Lanka Army, had on April 13, submitted an application for anticipatory bail to the Magistrate's Court, citing the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Attorney General as respondents.
However, the Magistrate on April 23, rejected the application in consideration of the preliminary objections raised by the prosecution and subsequently he was arrested by the CID.
The ship MV Avant Garde was seized by the Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015, for allegedly keeping a firearm depository on board and handed it over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for subsequent investigations.
On production of the suspect before the Magistrate, the prosecution told Court that Vessel MV Avant Garde which was arrested in September 2015, for allegedly maintaining a floating armoury on board, that the suspect, Operations Manager was apprehended on charges of keeping in his possession unlawful firearms and explosives and transporting same.
Hence, the prosecution pleaded Court to remand the suspect as the investigations over the incident were still being carried out.
However, the defense argued that the case of Avant Garde was a quite pathetic experience that the arms detected on board the disputed ship belonged to Rakna Lanka Ltd., which was a government owned firm and administered by the Defense Ministry.
The Defense Lawyer further said that the suspect was an ex-Major of the Sri Lanka Army and had become incapacitated in war and requested the Magistrate to issue an order instructing the suspect to be admitted to the Prison hospital.
The Magistrate in response to the defense pleadings, said that he had no authority to issue an order for the admission of the suspect to the Prison hospital as the Magistrate Court had no authority to grant him bail.
However, the Magistrate ordered the Prison Superintendent to arrange for a medical investigation on the suspects health conditions.
Harith Hettiarachchi, Attorney at Law appeared for the petitioner and IP Lasantha Rathnayake and Wasantha appeared on behalf of the Criminal Investigation Department.

Bon voyage Bryan Habana and thank you for the memories
Bryan Habana had the speed and skill to evade trouble and wreak havoc on a rugby field but ultimately he couldnt outpace age and injuries which forced him to call time on his career on Tuesday.
Habana 34 announced that when the current French domestic season ends in June he would retire from all rugby.
The KES boy who fell in love with rugby as a spectator at the 1995 Rugby World Cup final would eventually make his own mark on the tournament and become South Africas greatest wing.
The inevitable moment has come knocking on my door and Ive welcomed it in for a drink Habana posted on social media.
Its been more than a year of hoping trying pushing and willing to get back on the field for one last time to taste the sweet victory or encounter that gut-wrenching despair.
To hear the roar of the crowd or grab the pill out of the air. To make that last bone crunching tackle or score that last game-winning try.
But its unfortunately just not to be. I like most would have liked my career to have ended differently but sometimes things dont turn out quite the way we hope for.
Habana started rugby life as a scrumhalf before making it into the pro ranks as a centre for the Lions.
He was selected as a centre for the SA Under-21 team in Scotland in 2004 but was moved to wing for their third Pool game against New Zealand.
Habana scored a hattrick in a 46-27 defeat.
Later that season Jake White Bok coach at the time picked Habana from nowhere to be part of a Bok training squad for the Tri-Nations.
A few months later Habana was capped for the first time against England at Twickenham.
He came off the bench and scored a scorching try to announce his arrival on the world stage. Another 66 Test tries and 123 caps would follow.
For the past two years Habana has struggled to remain a first choice player at club Toulon while he also never gave up hope at one more tilt at playing for his beloved Springboks again.
Habana played the last of his 124 Tests on a fateful November 2016 day in Florence when the Boks lost to Italy for the first time.
Typically in what would be his last outing in green and gold Habana scored his 67th and final Test try. Equally typically he wouldve traded any personal glory for a Bok win.
In retrospect it was an ignominious way to sign off what had been a stellar Test career that made Habana the most sought after property in world rugby at one stage.
Before that match Habana spoke passionately about his love of the game and of the Boks but also of the pressure he was under at Toulon to play more rugby for the club that was paying him a princely wage.
When I first moved to Toulon they knew that I still wanted to play for the Springboks which I stipulated in my contract Habana said on the eve of the Florence Test.
Toulon are a little unhappy with me. Over the past four years I have missed about 32 games due to my Springbok commitments. I understand their frustration because Im never involved in the first part of the season.
Since then Habana has stayed loyal to Toulon as former Bok coach Allister Coetzee looked to locally-based players.
Bryan Gary Habana named after Manchester United legend Bryan Robson became world rugby player of the year in 2007 after scoring eight tries at the World Cup in France.
His scoring exploits which included a brace in the semi-final against Argentina was a huge factor in the Springboks march to the world title.
Habana played two more World Cups and holds the record for most tries at the tournament with 15 which he shares with the late Jonah Lomu. A hattrick against the USA at the 2015 tournament equalled Lomus record.
His 67 Test tries are also a record by a tier one Test player three more than Australias David Campese and only two short of the overall record of 69 held by Japans Daisuke Ohata.
We have been privileged to have witnessed the career of Bryan Habana who will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the great legends of Springbok rugby said SA Rugby president Mark Alexander.
During a career that spanned more than a decade and a half he stood out as one of the most professional players ever to don the Springbok jersey and over the years Bryan has been central to many of the most memorable occasions in the era of professional rugby.  Sunday Times SA

VESAK MESSAGE:
Buddha dispelled illusion, ignorance
Buddhists all over the world celebrate the Vesak Festival with much religious fervour and enthusiasm to commemorate the important events that took place in the life of Gauthama Buddha on this day, namely the birth of Siddhartha Gauthama, Siddharta Gauthamas supreme attainment of Buddhahood and the Mahaparinibbana.
The Buddhas teaching which reflects a great vision of a superior religious age and a humanitarian philosopher have an eternal appeal to the human civilization.
Siddhartha Gauthama, the Buddha, was born in a complex era where the Indian society, embraced various beliefs and religions. The religious orthodoxy had a strong impact on that society, which also had various divisions within. Women were considered as weak beings and they enjoyed limited rights in a male dominated society.
The Buddhist teaching demolished that traditional immoral ideals and myths prevailed in that society, which was rooted in ignorance and blindness, and moved forward with scientific thoughts.
The Buddha addressed the mindset of the people directly. The right of understanding the truth in our own mind after investigating the validity and truth was bestowed to ourselves by the Buddha.
Therefore, a spiritual human being emerged dispelling illusion and ignorance.
Buddha preached that a human becomes a worthless person or a great person, not by his birth, but only through his actions. This noble concept became a strong binding force of the entire humanity.
Bestrewing metta on minds of enmity with immense kindness and pure joy, Gauthama Buddha awaked the wisdom of human to show the absolution of existence and this blessed period of Vesak gives an ideal opportunity to recall the great teachings of the Noble One. I wish for a great Vaisakhya celebration for all the Buddhists around the world.

For 500-per-share from consortium led by Sky's David Gower:
Cricket fans given chance to purchase land at Lord's
Cricket fans around the world are to be offered the chance to buy parcels of land at Lord's, the home of the sport.
This remarkable opportunity launched on Wednesday will make possibly tens of thousands  or even more if the initiative is a success  part-owners of cricket's iconic ground for a cost of 500-per-share.
The consortium, who will be selling shares in the strip of underground tunnels that stretch the entire Nursery End of the ground, is being led by former England captain and Sky cricket presenter David Gower and former MCC chief executive Keith Bradshaw.
Other well known cricketers, including former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd and England batsman Alan Lamb, are expected to come out in support.
The scheme that is set to seriously divide the 18,000-strong MCC membership, one of sport's most famous private clubs, has nothing to do with the Lords's management as the land being sold is owned by property developer Charles Rifkind through his company Rifkind Associates.
And it is Rifkind's Plan B after his ambitious blueprint for the Nursery End that would have paid MCC 150million was rejected by the MCC membership last September by a landslide margin of over 90 per cent in favour of the club going it alone out of their own resources without any property development funding.
That was seen by MCC as final closure in a civil war that has been ongoing since 1999 when Rifkind bought a 999-year lease on the two defunct railway line tunnels under Lord's from Railtrack for 2.35m.
MCC chairman Gerald Corbett said of the vote: 'This is an unequivocal outcome that closes the door on the residential debate. The club will now move on to update the MCC Masterplan.'
But just six months later Rifkind, rather than disappear to oversee other areas of his property empire, has smashed open the Lord's door again to present the members as well as global lovers of cricket with another unprecedented option.
Rifkind calls it is a one-off opportunity to own an historic part of London which your grandchildren might benefit from.
Gower said: 'Although I supported redevelopment at the Nursery End, this is not a protest or reaction to the members voting against it last September. I should like to have a friendly association with MCC. I want Lord's to regain its status as the finest in the world.
'There is no sense of confrontation from my point of view and if I receive any flak, it cannot be as bad as what occurred to me when we lost the Ashes in 1989.'
The big sell will be accompanied by a huge advertising campaign with those buying into the Nursery End through the consortium named www.NewCommonwealth.com receiving a cryptocurrency coin as proof of purchase.
It is a long-term property play however  more likely to benefit future family generations of investors  as Lord's still have an 119-year lease on the top 18 inches of land above the tunnels.
However the belief is that if this project takes off, MCC will be forced to the negotiating table sooner rather than later by the sheer weight of numbers. And MCC members are likely to be offered a discounted price to buy a share or shares in the Nursery End.

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, announced the commercial deployment of South Asias first embedded SIM (eSIM) technology, a reiteration of its promise to deliver the future, today.
The pre-installed eSIM in wearables, now offers customers the ability to have a connection for their devices independent of a smartphone, eliminating the need for pairing devices and to be within a range of distance for connectivity.
The introduction of the cutting-edge eSIM technology and eSIM enabled wearable devices will deliver multiple benefits to customers such as eliminating the need for a physical SIM,empowering the subscriber to remotely sign up for services by activating the profile over the internet. This will enable many technologically advanced applications in the areas of smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT).
The Dialog eSIM profile can be downloaded on to the device by scanning a QR code which will be sent via email to the customer upon registration. Further the Dialog One Number solution can be activated between the phone and wearable device - enabling the device to operate independently from the phone whilst using the same mobile number.
Along with the launch of the eSIM technology, Dialog will be introducing the Huawei Watch2 smart watch as the first eSIM enabled device in Sri Lanka.For device manufacturers, the eSIM technology provides a significant space saving in the device and enhances design flexibility.
Commenting on the launch of the eSIM technology, Dr. Rainer Deutschmann, Group Chief Operating Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said,Dialog continues to deliver the very latest in technology and the eSIM launch marks yet another milestone for Dialog as the technology leader in the South Asia region.

He added, eSIMs have been introduced in to machine-to-machine (M2M) applications including remote monitoring, smart watches,smart cars with onboard entertainment and performance monitoring, and are expected to be adopted for upcoming smartphone releases by handset manufacturers.
With this development, Dialog is capable of enabling any device with an eSIM that complies with Remote SIM Provisioning Phase 2 Standard, which is the most recently released eSIM standard by GSMA.

Dollar strengthened due to US economic resurgence: JSS
The Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) Vice President and Media Spokesman Sunil de Silva said yesterday, that the Dollar had strengthened due to economic resurgences in the United States, while this had become a problem to currencies of Germany, China and India and many other countries.
Therefore, we should have a proper method to direct our economy in the proper manner. Even though many political opposites are saying that the rupees depreciation against the dollar has caused severe economic problems, not even economic experts had provided a proper solution to the matter.
However, a rupee had devalued only by 2 percent last year. But during the former regime, a rupee had depreciated by 110 percent in 2011, 127 percent in 2012 and 130 percent in 2014.
He further said a rupee was forcibly held during the former regime. But, after this government came into power, it was allowed to float.
This generally led to the depreciation of a rupee. Although a rupee depreciation is not affected to local trade, we have to spend more to import goods. The only solution to this problem is moving towards the export oriented trade and re-export sector. We should not only increase agricultural production, but also enhance the service sector.
JSS Chief Organiser Suranga Naullage, said the country should move towards a production based economy. In 2012, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took steps to devalue a rupee by 3 percent. Due to it, the economy suffered heavily as the dollar was artificially kept stable.
He further said that nobody uttered a word regarding a huge price reduction of vegetables during the festive season.
Commenting on the moving of May Day celebrations for May 7, he said the government rescheduled the May Day celebrations to May 7, as it was duty bound to the protection and fosterng of the Buddha Sasana. Therefore, we have given the utmost place and priority for Buddhism as mentioned in the Constitution, rather than May Day celebrations,  he added.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Has Trinity lost their love for rugby
Last Saturday night Trinity College ruggerites returned home licking their wounds inflicted on them by Royal College who played like men possessed in front of a capacity crowd in the first leg of the Bradby Shield. Taking a beating in the Bradby is anathema - for any Trinity sports fan, but the result has softened big talkers. The present Trinity rugby players are not concentrating on the game like the way they did in the past. The Trinitians have wonderfully talented and charismatic players. They were cheered when they won the first game of the season against rivals Antonians, but ignored the winning signals in the rest of the matches. Trinity lost all three games, the under 18 played for the C.E. Simithrachchi trophy (Royal won 14-8), the under 16 game (won by Royal) and eventually the Bradby first leg 39-7. In this game, most of the Trinitians thought that, their school might pull off a major upset. At play Trinity were nowhere, the Royalist used their superior speed and quickness in scoring six tries, three conversions and a penalty. The Trinitians forgot that rugby is a team game.
PT Rajan hockey
Hockey lovers in the hill capital are glad with the news that the 3rd PT Rajan memorial trophy six-a-side hockey tournament organized by the Playgrounds Department of the Municipal Council will start on May 2 and will conclude on May 6 at the PT Rajan playgrounds at Mahiyawa.

Illegally imported medicine, footwear in Customs net
The Sri Lanka Customs had seized a stock of medicine and womens and mens footwear valued at around Rs 12.8 million that was being illegally imported as fabrics from India.
The consignment imported as lose cargo was packed in 99 packages weighing 4000 kg in total.
The consignee is registered as a person from Colombo, while the goods which had arrived in February were examined at the Pettah warehouse by the Customs officers.
The packages included 200,000 Tramadol tablets valued at Rs. 1,600,000, ladies and gents slippers (8,500 pairs) valued at Rs. 7,200,000 and 4,000 pairs of ladies and gents shoes valued at Rs. 4,000,000.
Customs Director and media spokesman H.K.M.S. Jayaratne said imported footwear is being taxed in order to safeguard the local footwear industry and it is being illegally imported as fabrics as fabrics are duty free.
Around 45% tax is imposed on imported footwear in addition to the around Rs. 600 cess charged on every pair of shoes. There are many cases of illegally imported cases that are being detected on a daily basis. Some try to import goods with higher import duties under the disguise of duty free items to evade paying import taxes.This is a great loss of revenue for the country and also impacts negatively on the domestic industry.
He said this consignment of pain killers and footwear has been imported as fabric, due to fabrics being classified as duty free. Tramadol is a pain killer and is sometimes used by drug addicts. Initial investigations have revealed that the fraudulent importer of these goods had imported them using a legitimate importer's name. Initial investigations are currently underway, he said. The Customs Director noted that the stock of tablets would be destroyed while the footwear would be auctioned subsequent to the completion of investigations.

An industry in peril:Salvaging Sri Lankas tourism:
Continued from yesterday
Meanwhile, Beach parties which continue beyond the legal time cause more harm than good to the tourist industry and the environment alleged tourist hotel owners and environmentalists. There are Beach Parties seven days a week on the Mirissa Beach which go on till dawn during the peak of the tourist season and it is at one such beach party that a group of Dutch tourists were harassed and later assaulted by a group of local miscreants.
Locals are not welcome at most beach parties unless they accompany tourists, said an operator of one such establishment. Local guests try to get too familiar with female tourists and result in incidents like this, he added. As a result, some establishments even displayed Foreigners Only notices which resulted in much controversy in the past.
At the Mirissa tourist zone where Beach Parties are held seven days a week during the tourist season the parties start off at around 8.30 or 9.00 pm and go on until 2.00 am or 3.00 am. High powered laser beams light up the waves while the sound of DJ music could be heard for miles.
Marine life on the shoreline is at risk due to the use of high powered laser beams and high decibel music that emanates at night at some of the tourist attractions which are advertised as Beach Parties, cautioned an environmentalist. The tourist industry should be developed but not by harming the attractions that draw the tourists to the country. If the authorities do not take immediate action to control the situation the tourist industry is going to suffer further, he added.
Sri Lanka losing its reputation as a family-friendly destination
I planned to stay in Mirissa with my family for five days but there was so much noise at a nearby hotel last night which went on till 4 am this morning that we decided to leave. I complained to the hotel management and even to the Police about the noise but no one stopped it, complained a disgruntled tourist who was loading her bags into a vehicle. Mirissa was a quiet and calm beach at night when I came to Sri Lanka five years ago. I loved to watch the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs but I am told that they stay away due to the lights and noise, she added.
Guests come to Sri Lanka to get away from their hectic work schedules and relax. They cherish the serene and quiet locations. Mirissa beach is an ideal location at the day where tourists can take in the sun and swim without being bothered by beach boys, vendors or beggars. There are over 3000 hotel rooms within the Mirissa tourist zone but only a few tourists attend these beach parties. In-house guests complain to us every day and we, in turn, complain to the police but no action is being taken as the authorities concerned are paid large sums by those who organise these events to turn a deaf ear to the happenings on the beach, said a hotel owner within the Mirissa tourist zone who did not want to be named.
There is certainly a reduction in the number of families visiting the Unawatuna and Mirissa areas in comparison with the past. However, I market my hotel as a family hotel and I do get lots of families, old people, people with disabilities etc. However, the idea is to have a mix where you cater to all types of people and attract a mix of tourists both young and old, single and families, said Paloma Scott.
Unlicensed hotels ruining the upmarket tourist industry
According to Paloma Scott, as most of these unlicensed tourist places keep reducing their prices, which they certainly can afford to do as they dont pay any of the overhead charges, then the rest is also forced to keep their prices down in order to stay competitive. As a result, the tourism industry will suffer in the long run as the country will tend to attract more of the backpackers rather than the high-end visitors. I am not saying that they should not be welcomed, but the authorities must be mindful of not deterring the high-end tourists by attracting only the backpackers. There must be proper standards maintained. If you want to attract more respectable types of guests with families and high spenders, Sri Lanka needs to market itself as an upmarket destination. Not all luxury but as a middle and upmarket destination. You cannot stop the backpackers and certainly no one wants to stop it but currently, Sri Lanka is going too much into the backpacker way. The rates are being pushed down due to the competition posed by the unlicensed tourist spots while the cost of labour taxes etc. and other costs of the legitimate businesses are skyrocketing. Hence, there is no level playing field for all engaged in the tourism industry. Therefore, there is the danger that such legitimate businesses will not find it profitable to operate and before long the country will serve only as a backpacker destination that will deter the high spending tourists that will benefit the country, she noted.
However, she regretted that the countrys labour laws are draconian for an employer and the days of cheap labour is no more. This is fine as people need to be paid well I accept. So the whole operation has become so expensive. I sometimes wonder why I keep going when I barely have enough left after I pay all my taxes and expenses. But I see this country as my country and I go on as a service to my country as I have a birthright. But Sri Lanka needs to look at itself carefully. The problem is the megalomaniac ministers who seem to be grabbing everything and controlling everything. There needs to be a wholesale change. All the issues the country faces is symptomatic of the rot that is sitting at the top, she said.
Meanwhile, Minister of Southern Development and Youth Affairs Sagala Ratnayaka noted that the government is determined not to lose out on what has been developed in Mirissa, Kamburugamuwa and Weligama over the last few years.
Several meetings are taking place to bring this situation back into a positive. All the Provincial Councillors of the area, Pradeshiya Sabha officials members of the Provincial Councils and all members of the responsible government officers met with the members of the tourism industry in these areas to have a discussion where we take collective responsibility without waiting for the law and order situation to be put in place. We want all to take responsibility to have a clean tourist industry in this area. We have also agreed to meet as a group, the police, government institution officials, pradeshiya sabha and provincial council, urban council members etc. and the representatives of the various tourism associations and the politicians to discuss issues and find proper solutions for these issues. It will start with Mirissa but we will extend it to Kamburugamuwa and Weligama as well. We need to come up with a system to self police themselves and bring law and order into the area, he assured.

London Stadium set to miss out on Cricket World Cup party
The London Stadium is set to miss out on the Cricket World Cup party next year when the schedule is unveiled on Thursday.
Hopes that the 60,000 seater stadium could play host to the plum fixture of India v Pakistan appear to have been dashed with Old Trafford expected to host arguably the biggest game of the group stage.
Spiralling costs and a concern over the height and quality of the floodlights for what would be a day/night match are the main reasons for the troubled arena missing out, although there is still set to be a test event at the ground this summer.
With Lord's confirmed as the venue for the final, there is a traditional look to the 11 grounds that will stage the 48 games of the tournament with the Oval, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge, Headingley, Old Trafford, Taunton, Bristol, Chester-le-Street, Southampton and Cardiff completing the set.
The ICC have been meeting in Kolkata where the news has been dripping out with the suggestion that England's opening game will be against South Africa at the Oval to kick the whole thing off on May 30.
Despite never winning a 50-over global event, England will head into their home tournament as one of the favourites thanks to their stunning recent white-ball form, but the lack of depth to their red-ball batting is something new selector Ed Smith will need to grapple with.
At the moment I could reel off 12 to 15 names of batsmen who could play in England's one day team, said selector Mick Newell, who is hoping to work alongside Smith. But in Test cricket we don't have that. We don't have the depth. There is a number of players who have done well and then faded. All we see to do is talk about numbers two, three and five, so we need to find more consistent players.
With the conditions no-one is putting numbers together at the moment that is going to threaten the players in the side but the next three weeks will be really important for people to put their hands up.
The ECB have formed a new working group to look at the structure of men's domestic cricket away from 'The Hundred' with the first-class county game feeling marginalised, while the player's union have also expressed their concern at plans. - Mirror London

Plans to map, computerise countrys irrigable landscape
Plans are afoot to map the country's entire irrigable landscape to create a computerized database of land resources.
Once the task is completed, zones will be demarcated on the growth of varieties of vegetable and other crops, fruit etc. to uplift the livelihood of farmers and to increase productivity.
The programme is initiated as a pilot project in the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts first and will be expanded countrywide, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The minister said so inaugurating the Let's rise up together - let's win the Yala cultivation season special Yala cultivation programme at Padikaramaduwa paddy fields in Galenbidunuwewa DS division.
The Minister participated in the ploughing and sowing activities with the farmers. On the occasion, farmer families were distributed with manioc saplings and seed soya to attend to Yala 2018 cultivation.
Referring to the drought, the Minister said under the 2018 Yala cultivation programme, it was targeted to educate 100,000 farmers regarding the task of successfully facing the drought and the proposed water management and cultivation pattern.
We are offering solid fertilizer at Rs. 500  the subsidized price for farmers and the fertilizer subsidy is granted for additional food crops at Rs. 1,500 per 50 kg bag available in the open market. The government is thus offering a subsidy of Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 2,000, incurring a cost of Rs. 40 billion annually to provide fertilizer, Minister Dissanayake added.
He said without recovering any subscription, a new crop insurance scheme has been introduced under which a free insurance cover worth Rs. 40,000 per acre is offered. The government contributes Rs. 3,600 per acre to the scheme on behalf of the farmers.
The Mahasangha also attended the religious rituals at the ceremony. Agriculture Secretary P. Wijerathne was also present.

World Intellectual Property Day:
Powering change: Women in innovation and creativity
World Intellectual Property Day is observed annually on April 26. The event was established by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 2000 to raise awareness of how patents, copyright, trademarks and designs impact on daily life and to celebrate creativity, and the contribution made by creators and innovators to the development of societies across the globe. April 26 was chosen as the date for World Intellectual Property Day because it coincides with the date on which the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization entered into force in 1970.
This years World Intellectual Property Day campaign celebrated the brilliance, ingenuity, curiosity and courage of the women who are driving change in our world and shaping our common future.
Every day women come up with game-changing inventions and life-enhancing creations that transform lives and advance human understanding from astrophysics to nanotechnology and from medicine to artificial intelligence and robotics.
And in the creative sphere, whether in the movies, animation, music, fashion, design, sculpture, dance, literature, art and more, women are re-imagining culture, testing the limits of artistry and creative expression, drawing us into new worlds of experience and understanding.
The important and inspiring contributions of countless women around the globe are powering change in our world. Their can do attitude is an inspiration to us all. And their remarkable achievements are an invaluable legacy for young girls today with aspirations to become the inventors and creators of tomorrow.
More than ever before, women are taking up leadership roles and making their voices heard in the science, technology, business and the arts. This is good news. With women and men working together, we strengthen humanitys hand, and improve our ability to enrich our shared cultural wealth and develop effective solutions to alleviate poverty, boost global health, and safeguard the environment.
The time is ripe to reflect on ways to ensure that increasing numbers of women and girls across the globe engage in innovation and creativity, and why this is so important.
This years World Intellectual Property Day celebration was an opportunity to highlight how the intellectual property (IP) system can support innovative and creative women (and indeed everyone) in their quest to bring their amazing ideas to market.

Significance of Vesak
Of all the paths the Eightfold Path is the best; of all the truths the Four Noble Truths are the best; of all things passionlessness is the best: of all men the Buddha is the best. (Maggavagga, Dhammapada)
Buddhists worldwide will mark the Birth, Enlightenment and the Passing Away (Maha Parinibbana) of the Buddha tomorrow. This Thrice Blessed Day is known internationally as Vesak, which is a UN-sanctioned holiday. Rather unusually, Vesak this year has fallen at the tail-end of April instead of May, but there had been at least a couple of times in the last century where this has happened. What matters is not the date per se, but reflecting on the significance of Vesak and taking the Buddhas message of compassion to heart.
Ours is a society that sorely needs compassion, judging by some recent events. These incidents, based on completely man-made divisions such as race and creed, would not have happened if the perpetrators had actually listened to the Buddhas timeless words on compassion to all beings, human and animal. Buddha eschewed such divisions and enunciated that we all belong to one race  humanity. This is the lesson that we should heed as we strive to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in our island emerging from a 30-year conflict.
Vesak is primarily a Buddhist celebration, but in our multi-ethnic, multi-religious milieu it has become a truly national event. Non-Buddhists actively participate in and organise many Vesak events such as pandals and dansals. Religious coexistence is as important as ethnic harmony and they are often intertwined. Vesak, just like the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrated just two weeks ago, is an event which strengthens the bonds among various communities.
The world has moved on since the days of the Buddha more than 2,600 years ago. We see much material development  from skyscrapers to airplanes, there are thousands of things that did not exist at the time the Buddha lived in India. But have we developed spiritually That is the question we have to ponder on, this Vesak. The Buddha too asked the same question all those years ago and discovered that the route to emancipation lay through the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Fold Path. His solution was simple  end the circle of suffering through the Samsara to seek emancipation.
We are all mortal beings and it is not quite possible to give up all attachments of life. The key to understanding the Buddha's philosophy is realizing the virtue of getting away from Lobha (Greed), Dosha (Hatred) and Moha (Delusion). These are the evils that keep us in the Samsaric journey. This may seem difficult, but why not strictly adhere at least to the basic Pancha Seela (Five Precepts) at first This will make a difference to our lives and moral values will emerge naturally.
Hence, on this Vesak Day, we should focus on acquiring more merit instead of material goods. We cannot take any material things to the grave  rather, only the good that we have done will follow us through the Samsaric journey. But this does not mean that we should think about death and not enjoy life. In fact, the Singalovada Sutta contains advice to lay persons on how they should conduct themselves in life. The crux of the Buddhas advice is that we should always follow a middle path in every aspect of life. To give just one example from real life, one should not eat like a glutton, but should not also eat very little. The correct amount is somewhere in-between. This example is applicable to every other thing we do.
Unfortunately, most Buddhists have been veering away from the words of the Buddha. One of the main reasons for the rise of vice in our society is the huge gulf between religion and individuals. The temple used to be the focal point of the village  it should once again be. There are many values that our society has lost sight of in the relentless pursuit of material wealth. This is not surprising in a highly commercialised world, where money is generally regarded as the only thing worth striving for.
In fact, the Vesak festival itself is commercialized to such an extent that many have forgotten its very purpose and foundation. We see the glitter and glamour in the illuminations and the pandals but fail to turn the light inwards to our inner selves with a view to purifying our thoughts, words and deeds. This is the rationale behind the Governments move to urge pandal operators not to light them up on Vesak Poya Day itself, when devotees should be more focused on spiritual offerings. We should indeed see beyond the decorations and strive to understand the Buddha Dhamma and how it relates to our day-to-day lives. This Vesak, all Buddhists must be determined to engage in more meritorious acts. It is the only path to salvation.
To avoid all evil, to cultivate good, and to cleanse one's mind  this is the teaching of the Buddhas.

SIXTEEN MPs WANT OPPOSITION SIDE SEATS
Sixteen SLFP members, who supported the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, have requested that they be allocated seats with the opposition side in Parliament.
The letter was handed over to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake yesterday morning. Former State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told the Daily News that nine MPs submitted the letter to the Secretary General at the Parliamentary Complex on behalf of all 16 MPs.
He said they would sit in the Opposition benches on May 8 as Parliament meets for the Policy Statement of President Maithripala Sirisena. We will not stage a cross over in the well of the House. We will take our seats in the Opposition when sittings begin, he said.
Six former Cabinet Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Anura Yapa, S. B. Dissanayake, Chandima Weerakkody and John Seneviratne are among the group of 16 SLFP members. Others include former Deputy and State Ministers Dilan Perera, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake,
Susantha Punchinilame, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena and T.B. Ekanayake as well as Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
However, the SLFP group of 16 has stated that they would not join with the Joint Opposition, but remain as an independent group in Parliament. The composition of Government and Opposition in the Second Session of Eighth Parliament will change with this move.
Parliament officials said they were not in a position to exactly say the head count of Government and Opposition as at present because the lines are blurred. According to rough calculations, the number of Government MPs will be 131 while 93 MPs will be in the Opposition benches. The SLFP members in the Government ranks will come down from 41 to 25.

The summer that changed tennis forever
By the time the Open era of tennis dawned 50 years ago it was fair to say that the performances of leading British player Mark Cox had not hugely enriched him.
For making the doubles semi-final at the 1966 Wimbledon, for example, he received a 10 voucher to be spent at a London sports goods store of his choosing.
Having played on the Sixties circuit with only his expenses covered, that was quite a treat. He went out and used it to acquire several pairs of the newfangled Terylene shorts, which if washed at night could be hung up and dry by the morning.
The breadline status of many players all began to change on April 22, 1968. It was the time of mass protests and rebellions around the world, and it coincided with a revolution in the more sedate sphere of tennis, which was to change the course of the sports history.
It began in the unlikely setting of the West Hants Club, Bournemouth  at the British Hard Court Championships. It became the first tournament to abolish the barriers between so-called amateurs and the professionals who had been excluded from the biggest tournaments up until then, including Wimbledon.
Cox, now 74, carved out his own piece of this history by becoming the first amateur to beat a professional when he defeated the fiery American veteran Pancho Gonzales.
At the time it caused a huge splash, putting him on the front page of national newspapers alongside the student riots flaring up in France.
He went on to beat the great Australian Roy Emerson before losing to the peerless Rod Laver in the semi-finals. The eventual winner, Ken Rosewall, took away 1,000 while Cox, who had yet to make the switch into the professional game, had to be satisfied with some meagre daily expenses plus a daily lunch and tea ticket.
The draw sheet is something of a collectors item. The names in it, aside from some of the great Australians, include Stanley Matthews Jnr and a 19-year-old JPR Williams, who came close to pursuing a professional tennis career prior to becoming a Welsh rugby legend.
Cox played by far the more significant role that week, at an event where there were still clear divides between amateurs and pros.
We stayed in the row of B&Bs that were near to the courts that cost about 10 and six per night, he recalls. I think the pros were in hotels in the centre of Bournemouth. I didnt really know them at that point, although I dont remember there being any particular atmosphere between us.
If there was a tension then it was probably on their part as they felt they were on a hiding to nothing when they came up against us.
Until then the professionals had been excluded from the biggest events in the game, the Grand Slams and the Davis Cup. It is why, for instance, Laver won all four majors in 1962 and then did not appear at Wimbledon again until 1968. It is also why so many tennis achievements are often branded as being in the Open era.
Contrary to their stodgy reputations, the All England Club and the Lawn Tennis Association led the way in breaking down barriers.
After the 1967 Championships, Wimbledon held a separate event for professionals. It was a big success and, significantly, very popular on TV. It was made clear by Wimbledon and the LTA that the 1968 fortnight at SW19 would welcome both amateurs and those transparently earning a living on professional circuits.There is no doubt that a certain amount of hypocrisy had been going on, said Cox. For instance we all knew that the Americans and Italians were paying their players to play in the Davis Cup, which was considered then as important as the Grand Slams.
I was one of the players making hardly a living and you used to have to write to tournament directors requesting help with expenses. I got a letter back from Hungary once saying, Dear Miss Cox, we are sorry we cannot help you.
The players tea room at Wimbledon was always full of tournament promoters, trying to entice players to their events.
The era of the shamateurs was nonetheless a serene one at many of the tournaments. The teas at Budleigh Salterton were legendary, as was the cocktail party at Frinton. Players always socialised with each other.
Cox was to become a top professional in his own right, and played when Britain reached the Davis Cup final in 1978. He modestly attributes his win in Bournemouth largely to the conditions.
The surface was shale there and I dont think Pancho had played on it much before, while I was quite used to it, he says. The publicity was quite extraordinary and something I had never known. Against Emerson I just had one of those purple days when everything went right.
He then met the great Laver and was beaten comfortably. What was so good about a player often mentioned in the same bracket as Roger Federer
The single biggest thing that made him different was that as a left-hander he had a topspin backhand which he could use as a weapon, which was very unusual back then. He was brilliant at the net and a fantastic athlete, very nimble around the court, a bit like Novak Djokovic at his best.
And while he was a humble man he was a very strong competitor. Actually, most of those Australians were very impressive people.Virignia Wade won the womens event and the 300 first prize which she could not accept as an amateur. The womens game evolved at a different pace, en route to achieving financial parity in the Grand Slams.

Suranjaya shatters 200 metres mark
South Asian Games gold medalist Vinoj Suranjaya (Mercantile Athletic Federation) broke a 20-year-old record and also established a new Sri Lanka record in the 200 metres events on the opening day of the Senior athletic trials held at the newly laid Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday.
Suranjaya clocked 20.68 seconds to erase the previous record of 20.69 seconds set by Sugath Thilakaratne at the Asian Games in Bangkok 2008.
Anitha Jagatheshwaran winning the womens Pole Vault. 
He also qualified for the Asian Games later this year by finishing well within the qualifying standard of 21.70 seconds. Suranjaya is coached by former Sri Lanka boxer and current boxing and athletic coach Vimukthi de Soyza.
Speaking to Daily News on his record breaking run Suranjaya said, I am very happy to break such an old record. I trained with my coach Vimukthi for the past six months on a heavy practice schedule. My target is the Asian Games in Indonesia this year. Coach Vimukthi de Soyza also shared a word and said, Some hard training has paid off in the end and our main target is the Asian Games. I was boxing coach when I became Suranjayas athletic coach. I also coach the Para athletes.
Himasha Eshan representing Sri Lanka Army finished second to Suranjaya in the 200 metres clocking 21.24 secs. Another senior athlete Dilip Ruwan came third with a time of 21.37 secs.
Eshan is also the holder of the 100 metres national record and South Asian record with 10.26 seconds.
Jaffnas vaulting queen Anitha Jagatheshwaran who shone in the junior athletic championships concluded on Thursday with a new Sri Lanka mark of 3.55 metres failed in her attempt at the senior trials when she managed to clear only 3.30 metres in the womens Pole Vault. Her poor performance was due to a shoe cut injury.
She however won the event ahead of KLSK Perera (3.10m) and Herina Chanthirakumar (3.10m) who finished second and third respectively.
This two-day trial will be used to select athletes for the forthcoming Asian Games 2018 in Indonesia this year.

Vesak Messages : May all resolve to lead spiritual life
The dawn of Vesak Pasalosvaka Poya Day in the Buddhist calendar, marking the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha, is an important occasion for Buddhists throughout the world, said Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
In a message marking Vesak, the Thera said: The commemoration of Vesak Day began in India during the dynasty of King Dharmashoka after the Sambuddha Parinibbana. This festival began in Sri Lanka with the arrival of Arhant Mahinda to Sri Lanka during the rule of King Devanampiyathissa.
Our chronicle says that this festival was celebrated on a grand scale in Sri Lanka during the rule of Kings Dutugemunu, Walagamba, Maha Parakramabahu and Maha Vijayabahu.
Buddhist all over the world engaged in meritorious deeds that include offering alms to the members of the less privileged community and organizing meditation programs. They lead lives with a special focus on spiritual development.
The incumbent government, following the footprints of our ancient Kings, has made arrangements to hold the State Vesak Festival at Bingiriya Rajamaha Viharaya on a grand scale. This festival is organized by the all-Island Shashanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya, together with the Buddhist Affairs Department and Buddhasasana Ministry.
May all resolve to lead a spiritual life with the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem on this day.
Greatest day of significance to Buddhists
Vesak Pasalosvaka Poya Day, which marks the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinibbana of Siddharta Gauthama Buddha, is the greatest day of significance to Buddhists throughout the world, said Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera.
The Mahanayake Thera issuing a message in view of Vesak stated, the word Buddha means comprehension. The world Thathagatha means the realization of the truth.
The Most Venerable Mahanayaka Thera said, Siddharta Gauthama Buddha, who worked with unmatched courage, self sacrifice and non-violence, completed ten-fold perfections from the time He made a determination to attain Buddhahood and rendered a great service to humankind and world peace for 45 years.
There is no greater service than this in the history of the world.
May one and all resolve to lead a prosperous life while making arrangements to propagate the dhamma throughout the world, the Ven Thera said.
Let light of reconciliation shine
It is a great privilege to extend my good wishes to all Buddhist devotees, commemorating the three most significant events in the life of the Buddha, stated Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan, in his message marking Vesak.
The Buddha made a vast social change eliminating various disparities and divisions that prevailed among the communities, treating equally all human beings ensuring that no one gets superior or inferior status by birth.
We should get together to free this land, which was made sacred by the Buddhas visits, from war, conflict and suffering and establish permanent peace providing equal rights and justice to every community living in our country.
Let us illuminate our land through the light of reconciliation enriched with peace and solidarity on this great Vesak Day.
I wish you all a happy Vesak celebration!

Wisdom unexcelled
Young ascetic Sumedha was steadfast in his attempt to achieve the highest spiritual realm - something only a few could reach. That day he heard Dipankara Buddha was visiting the town. What he wanted was a definite prophecy that he would be a Buddha in aeons to come.
The locale, however, was congested with people and the young man could hardly think of seeing Dipankara Buddha. When he spotted the muddy road, his thoughts worked on so fast in a different plane.
He requested the great teacher and his retinue to walk over him. Dipankara Buddha saw the young man's thought in his divine eye and knew the youth's wish will materialise in uncountable aeons to come.
Dipankara Buddha prophesied ascetic Sumedha would be a Buddha named Gotama in the future. The day the Buddha declared the solemn prophecy to his twenty-fourth successor was a Vesak Full Moon Poya day. Since then Sumedha had been reborn in many existences. He had to complete the thirty perfections, paramitas. And before his final birth, the Bodhisattva, or Buddha-to-be, was born in Thusitha heaven.
The divine creature inquired five affairs before expiring for the final birth: right time, right area, right continent, right cast and right mother. Then, as any Buddhist knows, the fully mindful divine being entered the womb of Queen Mahamaya to be sired by King Suddhodana.
A prince was born on a Vesak Poya and was named Siddharth, one who has found the meaning of existence. The queen passed away seven days after the prince's birth.
The whiz kid declared the glorious verse, customary for all Buddhas, just after the birth: I am the chief of the world. There is no equal to me. I am supreme. This is my last birth. No rebirth for me. The teacher worshipped the teacher of the world, and then father worshipped the son.
Aspiring for enlightenment
Siddharth Gotama's life was spent in royal luxuries until he realised life's true nature. Moments later Siddharth renounced the princely life on a Vesak Poya. Yet ascetic life was not a simple thing for the prince.
Gotama in robes, was trained in various mental skills under many teachers, only to get disillusioned that they do not have the truth he looks for. The right way to achieve the truth dawned on him one day. He directed the mind in the right meditation path. Moments later he reached enlightenment and conquered the world of sorrows on a Vesak Poya.
The Conqueror was heading to the city of Kusinara when he met Pukkusa. Pukkusa listened to the Dhamma and offered the Buddha two golden robes: one worn by the Buddha and the other by his assistant Ananda.
When the Conqueror was robed, his skin became clear dazzling the robe. Monk Ananda was amazed and the Buddha declared that the skin of a Buddha will be remarkably bright on two occasions: the night he attains Enlightenment and the night he passes into Parinibbana.
Third visit to Sri Lanka
The Buddha visited Sri Lanka on three occasions: first to Mahiyangana in January, second to Nagadipa in April, and third to Kelaniya in May, Vesak. On the second visit made to Nagadipa, King Maniakkikha invited the Blessed One for a third visit to Kelaniya. And he visited Kelaniya three years after his second visit, with 550 arahants.
However, Nishantha Gunawardena, a Sri Lankan historian resident in the United States, mentions an interesting find in his The Lost Dynasty: The Buddha was not invited by King Maniakkhika but by a king named Panitha and his daughter princess Abhi Upaliya. Nishantha cites rock inscriptions at Balaharukanda and Bambaragastalawa that corroborate this find.
...the rock inscriptions are more accurate due to the difficulty in changing or forging them. It was the national King Panitha who invited Gautama Buddha the second time. The regional King Maniakkhika is mentioned in a few other records.
But it was not until the December 2004 tsunami hit, the king reintroduced himself. Tsunami tore through the island exposing several rock inscriptions. Two of them bore the names of King Maniagiya and his mother. This is, in fact, King Maniakkhika. (82pp)
King Maniakikha is commonly mistaken as a Naga king; naga means serpent in oriental languages. But scholars believe the king belonged to a clan named Naga. Following the Buddha's sermon in Kelaniya, the king erected a shrine with the Buddha's hair, utensils and the seat buried inside. However, the foreign invasions have resulted in damaging the original shrine.
The Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara became more sacred following the arrival of Ven. Mahinda in Lanka to establish the Dhamma wheel officially. Mahavamsa - account of the great clan, if rendered into English - the official chronicle on Sri Lankan history written in the 5th Century CE, states King Devanampiyatissa's brother Uttiya renovated the Dagoba along with the first quarters of the monks. Mahavamsa interestingly relates how the Blessed One journeyed to Adams Peak or Sumanakuta from Kelani on the Vesak Poya day. The 7359-ft-tall conical mountain has a historic significance as Buddhists believe it has the Buddha's footprint on it.
The mount is normally known as Adam's Peak for Christians and Shivan Adipatham (Shiva's footprint) for Hindus. The mount has obviously become the meeting place for the people of diverse religions and ethnicities.
In Sinhala the mount is known as Sri Pada, the term derived from Sanskrit denoting the sacred foot. The Sinhala Samanala Kanda, or Butterfly Mountain in English, is named thus because of the annually migrating butterflies.
Footprints of the Buddha
Legend has it that the Buddha placed his left footprint on the hill summit and then strode across to Thailand, then Siam. In Siam the Buddha is said to have left the impression of the right foot; this is called Phra Sat, similar to Sri Pada. In his Bharhut Stupa General Sir A Cunningham rests details about footprints:
Footprints of the Buddha were most probably an object of reverence from a very early period - certainly before the building of the Bharut Stupa - as they are represented in two separate sculptures there. In the sculpture, the footprints are placed on a throne or altar, canopied by an umbrella hung with garlands.
A royal personage is kneeling before the altar, and reverently touching the footprints with his hands. The second example is in the bas-relief representing the visit of Ajata-satru to Buddha. Here, as in all other Bharut sculptures, the Buddha does not appear in person, his presence being marked by His two footprints. The wheel symbol is duly marked on both. (112pp).
A cave temple called Diva Guhava is recognised as the place the Buddha had a respite during his Sri Pada visit along with his retinue. The cave is said to have the capacity to provide shelter for over 500 people. Siripa samaya, the season of Sripada pilgrimage, starts in December through May.
When the Teacher, compassionate to the whole world, goes on Mahavamsa, had preached the doctrine there, he rose, the Master, and left the traces of his footsteps plain to sight on Sumanakuta.
And after he had spent the day as it pleased him at the foot of this mountain, with the brotherhood, be set forth for Dighavapi.
Some historians, however, see the Buddha's visit to Dighavapi far from being likely. As the chronicle states, the Buddha had visited the village and meditated consecrating the place. A shrine was later erected on the place the Blessed One meditated.
Many works including Samantha Pasadika and Dipavamsa contain allusions to Dighavapi.
The works mention the inhabitants of Dighavapi were Yakkas, with links to pre-Aryan Kirat people in Northern India. As a legend goes, while a novice monk was repairing a part of the shrine, he fell from the top. He heard the shouting of his colleagues to recall Dhajagga Paritta, a sutta reciting the great qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. And finally, it is said, the novice monk was saved miraculously. The area was later reconstructed by King Saddhatissa.
Some sources indicate that the Buddha set foot on Kataragama following the visit to Dighavapi. Legend lays down an account where the Buddha met King Mahasena (some sources identify the king as Mahaghosha) in Kataragama.
The king listened to the Buddha and erected a shrine - now known as Mangala Ceitya - on the place he preached. The place is now called Kiri Vehera, located close to the Hindu temple built by the same king.
According to a source discovered by Nishantha Gunawardena the Mangala Ceitya contains the sword that Prince Siddharth used to cut his hair in renouncing. However, as Nishantha warns, the source is yet to be verified.
Prince Vijaya's visit to Sri Lanka - then called Tambapanni, the gold-sand island - occurred on a Vesak Poya. As commonly known, Vijaya was exiled to Tambapanni because of the dreadful behaviour of him and his associates.
His father, Sinhabahu, had no option other than banishing him - his followers and their families numbering about 700 - to the island with their heads partly-shaved as a sign of disgrace. Vijaya's ancestors came down from the kingdom of Kalinga, known as Orissa to the ancient, and Vanga in Bangladesh and in the eastern part of India.
The king of Vanga was married to the daughter of the king of Kalinga, named Suppadevi. Mahavamsa then relates the episode of Suppadevi having intimacies with a lion ending up with two children: Sihabahu, lion-arms, and Sihasivali. The lion had a family life in a cave, covered by a large rock to block any attempt of escapade. But the turn of events took a different shape as the lion's family had escaped from the cave, and Sihabahu killing his father with an arrow. Following the patricide, Sihabahu married his sister and formed a kingdom in Sihapura city. The royal couple had a series of twins, of which Vijaya was the eldest.
Rajavaliya, the chronicle of Sri Lankan kings, mentions Vijaya's entourage spotted Adam's Peak and landed in Southern Sri Lanka - the area that later became the Kingdom of Ruhuna. H Parker, a British historian, however, mentions it is the mouth of Kirindi Oya. So started the Vijayan dynasty, a reign of a King with a positive attitude towards Buddhism, making the path clear for an official introduction during King Devanampiyatissa's reign.
King Devenampiyatissa - meaning beloved of the gods - had his second coronation on a Vesak Poya day. Mahavamsa goes on to describe the moment of glory: Grand miracles occurred during the consecration of King Devanampiya Tissa. Jewels buried in earth rose to the surface, pearls in deep oceans were washed ashore and piled up and bamboo trees started to look like they were made out of silver. King Devanampiyatissa thought that these pearls and gems should be sent to his great friend, King Dharmashoka of India. Kings Dharmashoka and Devanampiyatissa were great friends for many years but had never seen each other.
King Dharmashoka by this time was sending Buddhist missionaries to countries around the world. He selected his son arahant Mahinda to be sent to Lanka with the message of Buddhism.
Arahant Mahinda and four other monks left the Indian shores to visit Lanka; Missaka Pavva (Mihintale) was their destination. King Devanampiyatissa was conducting a deer hunt close to Mihintale at the time.
The god of the mountain, it is said, wanted to show Arahant Mahinda to the king and disguised himself as a deer. King Devanampiyatissa and his men chased the deer. When the deer came near the mountain where arahant Mahinda stood, the deer passed out of sight.
Eighty-year-old Gotama Buddha disclosed that his passing away, Parinibbana, would take place on the third watch of the night at Sal grove of Malla royal family. Maha Parinibbana Sutta gives an illustrious description of the Buddhas last moment.
Vesak brings in an engrossing historical tale mixed with spirit and elegance.
