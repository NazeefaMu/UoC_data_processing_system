Havies have the edge over Police today
The battle between two top rugby sides Havelocks SC and Police SC in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2016/17 season at Police Park should turn out to be a close game today.
The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
Havies who played really well in their seasons opener last week with an impressive (29-5) victory against Air Force at Ratmalana should have the edge over the somewhat depleted Police outfit which lost to the formidable Navy side 8-29 at Police Park.
Havelocks have been training hard under their new former Sri Lanka national coach Ronnie Ibrahim and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Police SC on the other hand trained really hard under the watchful eyes of their new head coach Sudath Sampath who is also the present Sri Lanka national under 20 head coach of the Sevens team.
The cops will have to be at their level best if they are to beat the high riding Havies outfit in their own den.
But going by the present form the two teams are in, Havelocks will definitely go out as the favourites to clinch this contest.
Teams:
Havelocks (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana Bodhi (captain), Prasath Madushanka, Ashan Darling, Jason Melder, Shehan Dias, Shenal Deelaka, Sharo Fernando, Lasindu Ishan, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Kevin Kutty Dixon, Dulaj Perera, Coach: Ronnie Ibrahim.
Police SC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Achala Perera, Randeera de Silva, Romesh Archirige, Udara Sooriyapperuma (captain), Radeesha Seneviratne, Ranjan Harischandra, Diren Warnakulasuriya, Mohamad Abzal and Sandesh Jayawickrama, Harsha Iroshan, Musheen Falleel, Chula Susantha, Reeza Rafaideen, Rajitha Sanzoni, Head Coach: Sudath Sampath

Pujara and Vijay lead Indias strong reply
RAJKOT FRIDAY : Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay hit centuries as India mounted a steady counter-attack on the third day of a high-scoring first Test against England on Friday.
Top-ranked India finished the day on a strong 319-4 at the Saurashtra Cricket Association ground in Rajkot, supported by the duos performance.
Pujara made 124 off 206 balls before being dismissed by first-innings centurion Ben Stokes, but owes his ninth Test century and third against England to the Decision Review System.
The right-handed batsman was ruled lbw on 86 but the TV umpire -- which long-time sceptics India are using for the first time in a home series -- overturned the decision after the ball-tracker showed Zafar Ansaris delivery going over the top of the stumps.
Vijay hit 126 during a marathon eight-hour innings and shared 209 runs for the second wicket with Pujara.
Indian skipper Virat Kohli was batting on 26 at stumps while nightwatchman Amit Mishra was dismissed for a duck off the last ball of the day. The hosts trailed by 218 runs with six wickets in hand in reply to Englands 537, their third biggest total on Indian soil thanks to centuries from Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Stokes.
After being stuck on 99 for 10 balls, Pujara reached the three-figure mark with a nervous single as his father and wife applauded from the stands. AFP

Rain may thwart Aussie fight-back
Hobart, Australia Friday: Skipper Steve Smith said Friday he may play with just four bowlers as rain threatens Australia's chances of rebounding from their mauling against South Africa in the second Test from Saturday.
Heavy downpours are forecast through to Monday's third day in Hobart, which doesn't bode well for Australia as they bid to recover from their 177-run thrashing in Perth -- their fourth straight Test defeat
.Smith's underfire side are anxious not to make selection mistakes ahead of the pivotal Hobart game, the second of three Tests, and the 27-year-old captain has several options in mind.He confirmed that number five batsman Adam Voges was fit to play after hamstring trouble and indicated Australia may line up with six recognised batsmen, throwing into doubt the places of all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and spinner Nathan Lyon.
No decision yet (on the team), waiting until the morning, having a look at the wicket again and the forecast as well, Smith told reporters at Bellerive.The forecast isn't great for the next couple of days so we'll wait until the toss.Asked about going in with just four bowlers, as rain delays should mean they will get plenty of rest, Smith said: We'll wait and see. Anything's possible, it'll wait till the morning..While that might not bode well for the chances of Marsh keeping his number six spot, after just one half-century in his last 28 Test innings, Smith remained coy.

BRC has invited the 14 Premier tournament teams and the two top teams of the Emerging Trophy of Sri Lanka Crickets 2015/16 season to participate in this years contest.

Thisara Perera shines in BPL
Barisal Bulls opened their account in this seasons BPL with a six-wicket win over Comilla Victorians, whose fight fizzled out during a fourth-wicket stand of 49 between Mushfiqur Rahim (33) and Thisara Perera (34 n.o.), which sealed the contest.
Comilla, the defending champions, remain winless and would be worried by a brittle batting line-up, though bowling seems to be their strength.
Set 130 to win, Barisal opener Dilshan Munaweera struck two pleasing fours before getting caught at mid-off in the fifth over but Dawid Malan quickly restored the pressure with two boundaries in the same over.
