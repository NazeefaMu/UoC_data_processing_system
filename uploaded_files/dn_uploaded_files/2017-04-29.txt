Isipathana demolish Zahira 48-10
Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby :
Isipathana College ran circles around hapless Zahira College Maradana where they eventually demolished them by 48 points (8 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (2 tries) in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby second round opening match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The winners led 26-5 at half time.
The Pathana team dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to the hapless Zahira outfit who were completely lost in a nutshell throughout the entire game.
Isipathana scored four tries through full back cum vice captain Chamod Fernando (two) and one each by scrum half Harith Bandara and winger Nadeesha Chaminda with Chamod converting three tries.
Zahira closed down the gap with a solitary try scored by Thuan Amath just before half time.
After the break Isipathana scored two more quick tries through Bandara and centre Manilka Ruberu as they went through the Zahira defence to score. Chamod missed both conversions but increased their score to 36-5 in favour of the Havelock Park school.
Zahira cut down the lead to 36-10 when prop forward Amjad crashed through for an unconverted try.
Pathana scored again this time through their second row forward Ravindu Anjula with Chamod making no mistake with the conversion to increase the tally to 43-10. Isipathana virtually sealed the match when centre Ruberu scored his second try of the match off a superb three quarter move. Fly half Kulasekara missed the difficult touchline conversion to take the final score to 48-10.

Joshua at his heaviest for Klitschko clash
LONDON April28: Anthony Joshua weighed in at a career-heaviest for his eagerly anticipated showdown against Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday.
The Briton tipped the scales at 17 stones 12lbs 2oz (113.4 kg) ahead of facing Klitschko for two versions of the world heavyweight title in front of 90,000 spectators at London's Wembley Stadium.
Joshua, 27, was ten pounds heavier than Klitschko, who tipped the scales at 17 stones 2lb 6oz at Friday's weigh-in at nearby Wembley Arena, with a crowd of 2,000 watching proceedings.Klitschko (64-4 53 KOs), 41, was five pounds lighter than he was for his previous fight 17 months ago when he lost a surprise points decision to Joshua's fellow Briton Tyson Fury. The Ukrainian, who was his lightest since 2009, can win back two of the three titles he lost to Fury by beating Joshua, who has stopped all 18 professional opponents since turning professional after his 2012 Olympic gold medal triumph.
Thursday saw Klitschko try to unsettle his opponent by suggesting Joshua's physique was like that of an over-muscled and immobile body-builder.
I've never seen AJ (Joshua) as big as he is right now. He is as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best, said Klitschko. He's a puncher. I'm a boxer that can punch. - 'Beat Klitschko, don't hate him'
But Joshua refused to rise to the bait and on Friday he would not be drawn when asked about how he would win.
It depends if I see an opportunity, the 27-year-old Joshua said about the possibility of a knockout.
My main focus is to focus round by round, for 12 rounds. I don't hate Klitschko, I just want to beat Klitschko.
I've been switched on since December 10, my last fight. All I have to do is focus on this fight and making it as easy as possible. When you are competing it's tunnel vision. Even though there are beautiful people, I have to keep tunnel vision. Klitschko, who has had 50 more professional fights than Joshua, hopes his superior experience will see him become world heavyweight champion for the third time. AFP

He is now trying to hold the May Day rally for the working class shedding crocodile tears.
Therefore, the former President has no rights whatsoever to represent the working class and speak on behalf of them.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha, Hettiarachchi said what the previous government had did was to allegedly shoot fisherman Anthony during a protest in Chilaw in 2012, demanding for fuel concession. But, t was our government which granted the biggest reduction in the fuel prices.
Private sector worker Roshan Chanaka was allegedly killed during the protest at Free Trade Zone in Katunayake for demanding higher wages and pension scheme. But, when we came to power, we increased the salaries of public servants by Ra.10,000 and private sector workers salary by Rs.2,500.
Today, they are trying to coerce innocent working people to come to Galle Face Green, he said.

Two garbage collecting companies to be dismissed: Faiszer Musthapha
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said in Parliament, that he would take steps to send away the two private companies involved in garbage collection in Colombo or amend the agreement in that regard.
Speaking at the Adjournment Debate, the minister was up in arms against Care Cleaner and Abans, the two companies to which the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had outsourced the collection of garbage.
Since November 1, 2016, I gave directive that all local government bodies should collect segregated waste. The two companies involved in collecting garbage in Colombo, paid additional bonus to their employees for going house to house saying not to segregate waste and instead pay some money to them. There is corruption at all quarters with regard to the collection of garbage. I asked the CMC why garbage collection was outsourced to these two companies for a period of four years. The Commissioner had no answer. Care Cleaner and Abans recruite employees over 75 years and even disabled persons for garbage collection just to show off they have the required numbers of workers, he added.
The minister was of the view that the CMC and the Western Provincial Council have to bear the responsibility of the Meethotamulla tragedy to a great extent. I summoned the CMC thrice. I knew that there was a dangerous situation. I requested the CMC to carry out a proper administration with regard to the manner in which the Meethotamulla dump yard was run. I requested for the use of drones to ascertain whether there was danger, he noted.
LG bodies are corrupt with or without politicians running them, he remarked.
The minister stressed that whoever was responsible for the Meethotamulla incident and all those who fraudulently earn money from garbage, must be brought before the law. That was one of the reasons why the President appointed a Commission in this regard. A lot of dirty linen would come out from the findings of this Commission, he said.
Commenting on future measures, the minister said, I am starting a landfill within 40 days in Muthurajawela. I will take all precautions to see that it would be environmental friendly. Compost plants would be set up in all nine provinces. We are working to solve the garbage issue with commitment. I urge all to take this as a national issue and support our endeavour, he commented.
Replying to MP Dinesh Gunawardenas complaints of not holding LG elections, the minister said he had now placed all necessary Amendments to the Act before the Cabinet and now it was up to the Cabinet to proceed.
Public officials should take responsibility for Meethotamulla carnage: Eran
Public officials should take responsibility over the deaths and the tragic incident at the Meethotamulla, said Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne.
He also said the highest officials in the relevant areas should resign from their positions due to their failure to solve this issue.
"The Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Environment Minister and Local Government Minister should find out as to who of the public officials were responsible to this incident," Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said. "If they are unable to find the officials, they themselves should take the responsibility," he said.
The Deputy Minister said Public officials have to take responsibilities. Most of the people come to us ask for government jobs so that they should be able to take responsibility.
He made these observations yesterday, while joining the Adjournment Debate on the Meethotamulla garbage collapse, moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan.
However, opposition member Jayantha Samaraweera questioned as to why public officials should take the responsibility where as there are politicians there to take decisions. He said that when the people in Meethotamulla engaged in protests, there were brutally attacked and their protests suppressed.
Gazette Notification on garbage disposal presented in House
The Gazette Notification to declare garbage disposal and collection as an essential service was presented to the Parliament yesterday as per the Constitution.
All services, work of labour or any description whatsoever necessary or required to be done in connection with any undertaking performed or maintained by any local authority or for and on behalf of any such local authority for the clearance,collection, transportation, temporary storage, processing, separation, treatment, disposal and sale of street refuse, house refuse or other similar matter are declared as essential services, according to the Gazette Notification.
'Meethotamulla garbage collapse, tantamount to mass murder'
A Deputy Minister and an Opposition member stated in Parliament yesterday, that the deaths at Meethotamulla garbage collapse was tantamount to mass murder.
During their speeches, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Opposition member Jayantha Samaraweera said that the deaths were nothing but murder. Deputy Minister Ramanayake said the deaths at the Meethotamulla incident should be identified as a massacre. "Members of the opposition say that they have plans to solve this issue," the Deputy Minister said. They said while they were about to solve the issue the government changed. "Had not the government changed, we would have solved the issue." But the Deputy Minister said that they aggravated the issue while they were in power."
Opposition MP Samaraweera said the government has been failed to solve the issue of garbage disposal. "The Municipal Commissioner and several others have said that they knew that there was a threat of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsing before hand," Opposition MP Samaraweera said. He said the government has been failed to solve the issue of garbage disposal.
PFCB against granting of tax exemptions to 26 selected persons under ESPA
The Public Finance Committee Bill (PFCB) has recommended that the proposed regulations under the Excise Special Provisions Act(ESPA) to grant tax exemptions to 26 selected individuals, while there were hundreds of persons in the category who have opened letters of Credit (LC) on or before May 26, 2016 to import vehicles not be approved.
Committee Chairman Parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran while presenting the committee's report in Parliament, highlighted that the Finance Minister should make a note in Parliament as to how these individuals were selected and on what basis it was done. He also said that each individual had earned a profit of Rs 4 million due to this special exemption of tax, adding that among those 26 were fathers and sons and several medical professionals as well. He added that they should not be permitted as it was a bad precedence.
Special Force under Field Marshal:
Suppressing of people's rights:Vijitha Herath
The proposal to set up a special force under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka was an attempt to quell public protests and promote military rule, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was speaking at the Adjournment Debate in Parliament yesterday. He questioned as to how President Maithripala Sirisena who came to power with the pledge of abolishing the Executive Presidency and reviving democracy, could come up with such an idea.
The Government is going to set up a special force to suppress public protests and thereby to subvert the true issues of the people. When people are lining up against the move to sell the countrys assets, the Government is trying to control public protests. The Government is trying to cover up its inability by suppression. This is a dangerous situation. The President and the Cabinet should take the responsibility of such a move. People are not ready to go back to a military rule. They do not want another Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he noted.
The fall of this Government would not be far, if the it continues to suppress the peoples democratic rights, he added.
Stringent laws needed against dumping garbage at environmentally unstable locations: Ranawaka
The government should impose stern laws against dumping garbage at environmentally unstable locations in the country, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He made this observation yesterday in the Parliament, while joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan on the issue of garbage disposal and the Meethotamulla incident.
He also said that the government had declared garbage disposal an essential service as it had become a serious issue in the country. He also said that the collapse at Meethotamulla was a deep seated collapse. Around 3 million tons of garbage had been dumped at this marshy land called Pothuvil Kumbura now known as Meethotamulla garbage dump, since 1989.
"The responsibility of garbage disposal comes under the Colombo Municipal Council(CMC). There are around 70 engineers to manage that task," Minister Ranawaka said. "But when Meethotamulla is considered, not a single measure had been taken to rehabilitate the dump."
He also said the CMC did not heed to the warnings made in 2015 and 2016 by the Urban Development Authority(UDA).
"Not only the garbage of Colombo is dumped at Meethotamulla, but garbage of Kaduwela, Wattala, Biyagama, Kotte, etc," Minister Ranawaka said. "It became clear only when Kaduwela, Wattala, Biyagama and Kotte faced severe problems of dumping their garbage following the collapse at Meethotamulla."
He also said the garbage had become an issue not only in Colombo, but also in many other parts of the country. "The dump of garbage in Guhagoda in Kandy had a threat of collapse. It would pollute the waters of the Polgolla Reservoir and the Mahaveli River and Gampola, which has an imminent threat of causing water pollution," Minister Ranawaka said. "Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Gampaha, Peliyagoda and Kelaniya too have the same issue."
The Minister said the Meethotamulla garbage dump would be rehabilitated within the next six months. It would be brought to a level that would not collapse. "The garbage from hotels, hospitals and all the other institutions are dumped at Meethotamulla," Minister Ranawaka said. "So this is not only the garbage of the 650,000 people of Colombo, but of the entire country. So garbage management should be brought under a Central Garbage Management Authority, bringing the garbage management across the country."
The Minister said that although power could be generated with garbage, the level of moisture in garbage is to high to do so. He added that Rs 7 to Rs 10 is needed to dry a kilo of garbage.
"Garbage management should commence at the houses and other institutions themselves," Minister Ranawaka said. "Japan has reduced garbage dumping to one sixth by commencing garbage management at house level."
"We should have a different mechanism to dispose electronic wastes and clinical waste," the Minister said. "We should not add them to Meethotamulla or any other dumps of garbage as it could cause serious health hazards."
He added that the government's attempt to dump garbage in Puttalam in 2014 in a lime stone quarry, was stopped based on a report of the Wild Life Department. However, we trying another quarry to continue with the same project. "Nearly 1.3 million tons of lime stone are excavated every year, but only 0.4 million tons of garbage is a accumulated every year," the Minister said. "So we have to take bold steps to address this issue."
Meethotamulla Garbage collapse:
Past and present governments should take responsibility: Opp. Leader Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, urging the Government to do all in its capacity to alleviate the pains and sufferings of victims of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, observed that all past and present governments should take responsibility for it.
Moving an Adjournment Motion in Parliament yesterday, Sampanthan also called for a radical change in the countrys political culture. Meethotamulla was just the tip of an ice berg. Our country could face even many more greater disasters in several spheres, unless there is a radical change in this political culture, he noted.
The culture of politics in this country has become such that no issue however important to the country and its people, could be addressed free of political influence and political meddling. Our political culture is such that anything, irrespective of whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, legal or illegal, shall be done to promote their political careers to acquire and retain political power for their own convenience, he remarked.
He pointed out that contemporary politicians are increasingly becoming unwilling or unable to accept and truly respect the democratic verdict of the people.
This political culture must change for the better. Those elected by the people are elected to serve the best interests of the country and its people and not to device ways and means or tactics to subvert that trust placed on them by the people for their own political gains and benefits. Claims of alleged patriotism could never be a substitute for action that demonstrates a genuine commitment to honestly serve the country, he said.
While partaking in the despair and sorrow of the affected families in Meethotamulla, I urge the Government to take immediate steps to adequately compensate the victims and relocate the affected people and also as a matter of utmost urgency, to come up with solutions to the growing garbage crisis in the country, he added.

Premier League basement battle hots up
LONDON: While the race for the Premier League title has become a contest solely between leaders Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, the battle to beat the drop is a more complicated affair.
With a maximum of five rounds left, the identities of the bottom three who will be relegated into the second-tier Championship come the end of the season have still to be confirmed.
Sunderland have excelled at staying up in recent seasons, but even their reputation as the Harry Houdini of the Premier League may not be enough to save them this time. Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by northeast rivals and fellow strugglers Middlesbrough left bottom of the table Sunderland 12 points adrift of safety with a maximum of 15 still available to them this season.Defeat completed a wretched day for Sunderland manager David Moyes, who has been charged by England's Football Association for telling a female reporter she might get a slap.
But the defiant Scot, whose side are at home to Bournemouth on Saturday, insisted he had no intention of walking out on the Black Cats.
No, I'm here, I'm the manager, you take it on the chin. I am used to winning, I'm not used to losing and I don't want to get used to it either. Marten de Roon's ninth-minute strike gave Steve Agnew his first win since replacing Aitor Karanka as Middlesbrough boss and the club's first in the league since December 17, although they remain six points shy of safety.
We hadn't won a game since December, so we needed to win the game, said Agnew, whose side now face a daunting trip to Manchester City on Sunday.
Clement confidence
Swansea too had the morale boost of a win, a 2-0 victory over Stoke, last time out but they remain in the bottom three, two points from safety, ahead of their Sunday match at Manchester United.
I am very confident that we will stay up, said bullish Swansea coach Paul Clement.
Maybe I would not have been if we had not got that good result and good performance against Stoke. Hull, just above the relegation zone, have earned 19 points out of 21 at home since manager Marco Silva was hired but they now face a potentially awkward trip to Southampton. -AFP

Proposals to strengthen workers rights to be introduced at SLFP May Day rally
A set of new proposals strengthening workers rights will be introduced to the country at the SLFPs May Day rally in Kandy, SLFP National Youth Front (NYF) Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
The NYF has included a bundle of proposals which would strengthen workers rights, he said.
Bandara was addressing a NYF media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
He added that the NYF will present the set of proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena during the SLFPs May Day rally at Getambe, Kandy for his consideration.
Asked what the contents of those proposals are, Bandara said that it would guarantee equal opportunities for every mother at child birth. All mothers should be given equal amount of maternity leave without considering whether they are in the state sector, private sector or in the estate or plantation sector. He added that a mother in the private sector or in the plantation sector doesnt receive the equal maternity benefits enjoyed by a government servant.
Besides, the NYF has included a proposal to increase employees insurance compensation to Rs.10 million from Rs.5 million, he said.
Bandara said that the countrys image has improved under this good-governance government. Accordingly, the world is accepting Sri Lanka in a positive manner,unlike during the days of the last regime.
The image of a country defends on its leader.The balanced and friendly policies of the President has helped the country improve its image, Bandara said.
When asked about the appointment of new SLFP electoral organisers, he answered that new electorate organisers were appointed to work for the betterment of the party and country.
He said all SLFP organisers who do not attend the May Day rally in Kandy and those who are not assist in their preparations should be removed.
If one does not assist the party organise its May Day rally or does not attend the rally, it indicates that he or she is not a real SLFP organiser. The May Day rally in Kandy is organised by the SLFP under the chairmanship of the President but May Day rally of the Joint Opposition is organised by a party chaired by G.L Peiris, he said.
Inactive and inefficient electoral organisers should be removed from their positions and people who are dedicated to working for the upliftof the party appointed. The party cannot progress unless with people who are creating obstacles to its well-being. The SLFP will never hesitate to appoint new organisers in place of those inactive oganisers and those who violate the partys constitution,Bandara added.

Reforms, resolutions and democracy
Tamil radicals say Sri Lanka has always rejected the advice council monitoring and adjudication by foreigners and promised to do it on their own. But they never did anything, except lied, cheated and continued to commit even more bloody crimes against the minorities. The present government appears to be heavily influenced or threatened or bribed by the Rajapaksas and their goons.
Putting on a facade of less public violence does not change their attitude against the minorities as crimes continue behind the scenes. Nothing has in fact changed or improved for the poor people of the north where land grabs, displacement and rape continue. There appears to be an underworld force coupled with the troops who are controlling various aspects of the country.
The country has lost its way and the climate of hatred and racial discrimination prevails. The few exceptions quoted by some do not make the rule. Buddhists destroyed Hindu temples and built far too many Dagabas in the north, outnumbering the Buddhist citizens living there! Obviously this cannot be the whole truth as there is a committed movement in the south fighting for equality, autonomy and the right of self determination of Tamil people. However it is serious and should get proper attention.
Future generation
The capitalist world is in turmoil and all countries are themselves facing calamities of their own and they are far too preoccupied with their own issues to spent time on Lanka, if the government is wasting time and solutions are delayed. Tamils therefore should work closely with the anti fascist southern forces rejecting the view utterly helpless and out on their own to either save themselves or self destruct. Tamils are virtually doomed within Lanka. Nobody understands this.
It is true that the fascistic Mahinda Chinthanaya is spreading a toxic culture in Colombo and other areas. Those who are affected are immune to scandal and ignore everything around them even if it affects and influences their children negatively. They are breeding a horrible future generation. For them the good guys finish last so they all have become bad. The time that criminals, embezzlers, crooks, rapists murderers who should be in jail are freely roaming the streets and travelling overseas are over. Under the present government struggle is continuing to end corrupt lawless state.
Less violent, less corrupt
It is very depressing to see very corrupt people still free. However we have no choice as this Yahapalanaya is less violent, less corrupt than the previous lot. We have a space to fight. The pressure of fascist makes the government slow in redressing the problems of the Tamils. However we have no choice as this capitalist government is less racist and more accommodating than the previous fascistic lot. It is wrong to assume that west will come to help Tamil liberation.
Hence pathetic dependence on them is of no use. It is true that the west has made some interventions such as removing DSP+. EU, Regulations lays down the modalities of the Unions Generalized System of Preferences, which is meant to improve developing countries access to the EU market by means of granting them preferential treatment for their export products.
In February 2010 GSP+ preferences to Lanka were suspended due to serious breaches in the application of UN human rights instruments, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Covenant on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention against Torture and the ILO Core Labour Conventions.
After the democratic mass uprising the Yahapalana government of Lanka took some strong steps towards improving human rights. This includes the governments decision to co-sponsor Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 30/1 in October 2015. However the governments reform efforts, including those that directly relate to the GSP+ criteria, have not yet delivered substantially to comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
On the other hand ILO delegation of Experts has identified a number of shortcomings with ILO Conventions 87 and 98, including the insufficiencies of the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act 56 of 1999, which is the only existing legislation that relates to ILO Convention 87.
Human rights activists have indicated that the process of repealing and replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has not yet been accomplished. If a new Act replaces the PTA it must not include a broad definition of terrorism related offences, and limit the risk of forced confessions through torture. They argue that the existing rise of breaches of Human Rights in Lanka concerns about the appropriateness of granting GSP+ status while there is inadequate real progress according to international bodies. Clearly the Lankan government is suspected of not adequately tackling the culture of impunity by rewarding military officials accused of human rights violations with government positions.
Peace, reconciliationand stability
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka on February 10, 2017 concluded that the measures taken by Lanka since October 2015 have been inadequate to ensure real progress, and the fulfillment of commitments has been worryingly slow by two months on January 23, 2017. Considering all this they propose to instruct its President to forward this resolution to the Council and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
The slow pace of transitional justice in Lanka and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address accountability for past crimes, risk derailing the momentum towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability.
Everybody acknowledges that there have been positive advances on human rights and constitutional reform. The Government has advanced on constitutional reforms and showcased some positive developments on the broader human rights agenda. The fulfillment of transitional justice commitments has, however, been worryingly slow, and the structures set up and measures taken during the period under review were inadequate to ensure real progress.
Office of Missing Persons
Of course they also recognize some advances on constitutional reforms, on crucial issues like land restitution and symbolic gestures towards reconciliation, as well as legal reforms and the design of an Office of Missing Persons.
The laudable, inclusive work of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism, appointed by the Government, has also resulted in an incisive report, which was issued in January this year. But it is very necessary to do what was promised and cleverly indicate to the democratic masses all over the world that Lanka is beyond fascism and racism.
It is necessary to counter the often directed criticism: Party politics, including the balancing of power between the different constituencies of the coalition in the run-up to constitutional reforms, have contributed to a reluctance to address difficult issues regarding accountability or to clearly articulate a unified position by all parts of Government.
Unclear and often contradictory messages have been delivered on transitional justice mechanisms. Public messaging around transitional justice and reconciliation has been generally confusing and at times contradictory.

Royal out to regain Michael Gunaratne Trophy today
Royal College will be looking to regain the Michael Gunaratne Trophy after a lapse of one year when they take on arch rivals S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia in their annual inter- school rugby encounter of the Singer A Division league tournament second round at Mount Lavinia commencing 4.30pm today.
This traditional encounter was inaugurated in 1962 and the first match ended in a draw. Present tally stands 28 wins to Royal and 19 to S.Thomas with 5 draws. In 1979 the match was not played due to a dispute regarding the date for the encounter.
The Royalist lost last years encounter 15-21 at Royal Sports Complex under the leadership of number eight Nikhila Gunadeera where the winning Thomian captain was hooker Pandula de Silva.
This time they seem to have a great chance of regaining the trophy after having won all their previous games against St. Joseph College (28-22), St.Peters College (17-10), Dharmaraja College Kandy (18-15), D.S. Senanayake College (47-7) and St. Anthonys College Kandy (48-35) while losing only one match to Isipathana College (17-22).
Royal will be captained this year by their experienced fly half Ovin Askey while the most experienced and one of the best school coaches if not the very best Sanath Martis, the Sri Lanka under 19 national 15 a side head coach will once again be the head coach of Royal and ex-Royal College rugby player and former Sri Lanka national rugby captain Dushanth Lewke will be his assistant. T.A. Silva, former Army and Sri Lanka national full back is the kicking coach.
The 2015 Royal side under the leadership of Bhanuka Gamage and head coach Sanath Martis, re wrote the Royal-Thomian rugby history where they demolished the Thomians 52-0 at Havelock Park, which to-date is the highest score by a team in this traditional encounter. The Thomians highest score is 22-0 under the captaincy of Charya de Saram in 1991.
Incidentally in 2015 Royals unsung hero and the highest try scorer in the league tournament, number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya emerged the first and only rugby player from both the schools to score a hat trick of tries when he touched down four times to enable Royal to achieve this remarkable 52-0 victory.
The Thomians will be hoping to produce an improved performance after their match against Science College where they scored a narrow (20-12) win in their last first round game. They also won against Prince of Wales (57-0), Zahira College (29-24) but lost to Wesley College (19-23) and unbeaten Trinity College (14-29). The Thomian outfit will be captained this year by experienced speedy Sri Lanka national under 18 Asian Sevens champion skipper and winger Naveen Heenakankanamge while Samoan Tevita Tulagaese Laga will be their head coach and former Sri Lanka captain Viraj Prasantha the forwards coach.

Sharapovas successful return continues
Maria Sharapova made it two wins out of two following her return from a 15-month doping ban by defeating fellow Russian Makarova 7-5 6-1.
The five-time Grand Slam winner dominated Makarova, ranked 43 in the world, wrapping up the victory in just one hour, 20 minutes.
Sharapova was powerful on serve, as she had been in Wednesdays win over Italys Roberta Vinci, but struggled at times with her return.
Once she had claimed the first set with a late break of serve, she powered through the second, breaking twice before wrapping up the match with an ace.
Practice and playing are so different and you can only prepare the best you can, Sharapova said.
The reaction and anticipation you need are so hard to replicate in training and these are the things I need.
SHARAPOVA MAINTAINS MENTAL HOLD - ANALYSIS
She may not have figured in any draw for 15 months, but it appears Sharapova still has a strong mental hold on so many of her opponents.
Makarova had a glorious chance to hit a backhand winner into open court to break for a 6-5 lead, but missed. She then dropped her serve to concede the set, and only won one more game after that.
It was another strong performance by Sharapova, and she then moved to the media centre to make it clear she no longer wishes to discuss the details of her positive test for meldonium.
She says she has done numerous interviews in the past few months - which overlooks the fact that journalists and publications, like the fashion magazine Vogue, have been very carefully selected. - BBC

Sharapova into Stuttgart semis on doping return
STUTTGART April 28: Maria Sharapova eased into the semi-finals of Stuttgart's WTA tournament after seeing off qualifier Anett Kontaveit on Friday for her third-straight win on her comeback after a 15-month doping ban.
The 30-year-old five-time Grand Slam winner has yet to drop a set in Stuttgart and powered past Estonia's Kontaveit, ranked 73rd, for a 6-3, 6-4 quarter-final win in one hour, 23 minutes.
This was another impressive display from the Russian, who hit four aces, 28 winners and just two double faults, while she converted five of her six break points.
I served quite well and held my serve which gave me confidence, so I'm happy, said Sharapova.
We haven't played each other before, so the first six games were just about working each other out.
I kept myself in good shape, because once you lose it, it's hard to get it back, she added when asked about her fitness on court after 15 months out.
The former world number one will now play either France's Kristina Mladenovic or Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro in Saturday's semi-final.
Sharapova only made the main draw for Stuttgart after being given a wild card as her ranking was wiped out after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
Her rivals have heavily criticised the decision to give her wild cards in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome with Canada's Eugenie Bouchard branding her a cheater on Thursday.
There has been nothing but support for the Russian from the Stuttgart crowd with a few positive banners around the indoor arena.
She has been in commanding form on clay here as Sharapova waits to learn on May 16 whether she will be granted a wild card to play next month's French Open.
The 21-year-old Kontaveit had already knocked out last year's French Open champion and fifth seed Garbine Muguruza in the second-round.
The Estonian put up a fight, breaking Sharapova's serve in the second set and matched the Russian's tally of four aces.
But Sharapova made light work of her early on, breaking Kontaveit's serve on the way to winning all of the last four games to take the first set in just 36 minutes.
The Estonian dug deep at 3-1 down in the second and had the audacity to break Sharapova in the fifth game.
But with her superb array of baseline shots, Sharapova broke her opponent straight away, then held her serve to go 5-2 up.
The plucky Kontaveit held her serve, then broke the Russian for the second time, but Sharapova also dug deep and broke the qualifier again to take the second set.
Sharapova has won three Stuttgart finals, suffering just one defeat, in her four previous appearances.
Her bid to reach a fourth final on Sunday has been made easier as top names, such as Angelique Kerber, Muguruza, Britain's Johanna Konta and Agnieszka Radwanska, have all crashed out.
Only two of the seven top-ten players who started here -- second-seed Czech Karolina Pliskova and fourth-seeded Romanian Simona Halep -- have survived to the quarter-finals.

Stronger ties with India as EU gives OK to Sri Lanka
This week began with that massive strike by employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation with signs of a dangerous extension that would threaten the entire country. It was against what was believed was a sell out of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to India. The strike was settled the same day with the assurance given by the Prime Minister that there was no plan to sell the Trinco Tank Farm to India, as stated by the trade unions, and the assurance that negotiations would be held with India in a cooperative effort to develop this British-built tank farm, that is a valuable asset of the country.
The strike took place the same day as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to go on a State visit to India, where discussions with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other Indian leaders, would involve this tank farm, along with other matters of interest to both India and Sri Lanka. In the event, Sri Lanka and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding on economic co-operation in the presence of Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday. As reported this MoU makes important proposals for Indian investment in the development of the port and oil tank farm in Trincomalee, the setting up a 500 MW LNG power plant and terminal also in Trincomalee, and Indian participation in highway and railway development projects in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
Currently, 14 of the oil tanks in Trincomalee are leased out to the Indian Oil Company (IOC) a Government of India enterprise. The new proposal is to develop 75 of the balance tanks as a Joint Venture between India and Sri Lanka, and the balance 10 tanks to be developed by the Sri Lankas CPC.
There is no doubt that India is very much interested in this Trincomalee Oil Tank Project as well as the LNG Power Plant with the impact these will have on important aspects of the Sri Lankan economy and development, especially in view of the close economic relations that Sri Lanka is developing with China, mainly in the South of the country with the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport, two hugely costly projects as well as the Port City project in Colombo. Interestingly, the Joint Opposition has tried to make political capital of this aspect of Sino-Indian relations by Sri Lanka, as an aspect of selling national assets to foreign powers. At a recent meeting with the media the JO even urged the government to re-examine the India  US partnership to challenge the growing influence of China. These JO alarmists seem to be unaware of the new policies vis--vis India that are emerging from the Trump Presidency in the USA, that is raising questions about the India-US partnership built during the Obama administration.
The Government was successful in overcoming the danger of the strike in the petroleum sector being extended and moved ahead to the MoU with India, which covers the areas that were concerns for trade unions in the petroleum sector. It must now take more interest in keeping the trade unions and the public better informed of its policies in key sectors of the economy, and take timely measures to prevent breakdown due to wrongly informed trade unions.
Brussels success
Picture by Chenaka Wickramarachchi
Sri Lanka had a major success at Brussels this week when the European Parliament defeated a motion that sought deny the GSP plus facility to the country, in a special motion placed before the parliament citing the slow pace of reforms regarding human rights, labour relations, and other issues that are important for the European Unions economic support and related concessions.
The vote on the resolution that was placed by a group of EU parliamentarians, supported by some Human Rights organisations and sections of the Tamil Diaspora, saw it being defeated with 436 against it, 119 in favour, and 22 abstentions. The resolution took up the position that Sri Lanka was too slow in carrying out the reforms necessary for reconciliation and better human rights in the country.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was active in lobbying EU parliamentarians and explaining the actual situation in Sri Lanka on the disputed issues, and urging that the resolution be defeated, thereby bringing Sri Lanka closer to restoration of the GSP Plus facilities, which were lost during the Rajapaksa Regime.
It was in 2010, that Sri Lanka lost the GP Plus trade scheme giving preferential access to the 27 nation European nation bloc. This followed an EU probe, after the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, finding Sri Lanka in breach of human rights laws, largely to do with the war with the Tamil Tigers. The then Sri Lankan government saw the EU review as politically motivated, and backed by Tamil Diaspora elements resident and active in Europe. It refused to give as written pledge to carry out certain reforms, which the EU demanded in exchange for GSP Plus.
Sri Lanka was then one of 16 countries with GSP Plus status and the EU its single largest trading partner. It is reported that garment exports, the countrys second largest foreign exchange earner at the time, had benefitted with 6  7 percent concessions. The value of benefits was then estimated at 100 million Euros (US $ 125.4 million). Losing GSP Plus made Sri Lankan exports more expensive and less competitive. The business sector believed the loss to the country could have been as much as 500 million Euros.
Had the motion against Sri Lanka been carried, it would have taken at least another ten months for the GSP Plus concession for Sri Lanka to be reconsidered. The success in the EU Parliament this Thursday has been a major achievement for Sri Lanka and an eagerly awaited support, after the actions taken to restore democracy, support and strengthen human rights, act on issues of missing persons and other aspects of reconciliation and peace building that have been initiated in the past two years.
May Day politics
The May Day events next Monday are the substance of local politics, with the coalition national unity government seeking to show its strength, especially to the opposition led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The May Day activities take place with Mahinda Rajapaksa repeating that the unity government will not last two months after May Day. The crowds at the rival May Day rallies at Getambe  Kandy (SLFP), Campbell Park - Colombo (UNP) and Galle Face Green (JO and SLPP), will be the show pieces of the competition, with all sides making loud boasts of the certainty to have the largest crowd.
Midst this three-sided rivalry is the division within the SLFP, with the official party being under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and its rival section led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The real competition for people will be between the SLFP rally at Getambe and the JO rally at Galle Face.
The big issue in this crowd competition is the removal of key SLFP Central Province organisers who are clearly on the MR side of the party. Those removed were UPFA MPs Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Lohan Ratwatte and PC member Anura Widanagamage. Two of these have old family connections to the SLFP, with Janaka Bandara Tennakoon being the son of the late T.B. Tennakoon, one of the strongest rural leaders of the party for many years. The other, Lohan Ratwatte, is the son of the late Gen Anuruddha Ratwatte, a Cabinet Minister and strong leader of the partys Central Province section, who also gave the lead to the military in the battle against the LTTE in Jaffna, during the leadership of Chandrika Kumaratunga. The Joint Opposition states the removal of Janaka Bandara Tennakoon is a sign of the SLFPs breakup in the present political situation, and sees these moves by the party leader President Sirisena as paving the way for the inevitable breakup of the SLFP. They are silent on Janaka Bandaras dual role, amidst plenty of tears, on the about to cross over situation in December 2014.
As the SLFP moves to a crucial stage on the question of party unity, there is also the strong disciplinary action that has been proposed for those who do not accept the partys invitation to come to the May Day Rally at Getambe. One will recall that similar threats of disciplinary action did not materialize at previous events such as the May Day last year. But, the signs are that disciplinary action is most likely to follow after this May Day events, paving the way for the full emergence of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as the new political party of the Rajapaksas. Yet, many uncertainties remain. We will be watching another May Day of major political importance in the country.

Surrey on track to win County Championship
Five years on from the death of Tom Maynard:
The road to recovery has been long and painful for Englands biggest county but Surrey are finally poised to honour the memory of Tom Maynard by regaining their place at the very top of domestic cricket.
The tragic death five years ago of a young cricketer seemingly destined for a highly successful career will never be forgotten by all at a county embedded in the twin traditions of winning trophies and producing England players.
But now, after five years of mainly hurt, Surrey finally appear ready to fulfil the rich potential provided by the combination of top home grown products and the ability to recruit well and expensively because of their financial muscle.
Surrey are top of the formative championship table after two matches and begin their Royal London one-day Cup campaign against Somerset on Friday with captain Gareth Batty confident that they are back on the right path.
It took more time than expected and that is a reflection of the pivotal role Tom was playing in the way we were developing as a team and his position within it, said Batty.
So in some ways it s nice that it has taken us so long to challenge again because it reflects so well on Toms role within the group.
Its taken this long for us to get to a pretty good place where the core of the club is Surrey and want the best for Surrey. And because of our financial strength we do have the ability to recruit people like Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick from Durham who would be wonderful signings for any team in the country.
Im not going to sit here and deny its great we can sign fine, ready-made players but the point is theyre coming into what is a Surrey environment where things have been done in a certain way and hopefully will continue to be done that way for generations.
I see that as my greatest responsibility. Even though we have the financial power to bring people in they have to have that value of the brown cap and everything that goes with it. The people who come in understand this isnt any old club, this is Surrey and this is how we want to do things.
At the centre of that is Surreys impressive 39-year-old captain who had to rally Surrey when Maynards close friend Rory Hamilton-Brown gave up the leadership in the terrible aftermath of the accident that killed him.
Batty was briefly captain when Hamilton-Brown resigned and then took over when the short-lived reign of Graeme Smith was ended by serious injury. Now a man who considers himself a Surrey product despite starting out with his native Yorkshire epitomises the values he wants to see in his younger charges.
Sometimes we will upset people with how we want to do things and other times we wont get the credit we deserve which is absolutely fine because we understand it comes with the territory of being a Surrey player, Batty told Sportsmail. Its a wonderful club and there will always be people who want to give it a nudge. Its our job to make sure we do things properly.
We wont walk around with a swagger for the sake of it. Its about being confident, yes, but holding yourself in the right way and I certainly feel over the last 18 months or so the perception about us has changed around the traps.
People know now that we want to do things properly and were trying to be good human beings as well as win games of cricket.
Surrey certainly seem well equipped to do that with a squad as strong as any county with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Batty purrs at the quality of the players, both young and experienced, at his disposal.
He waxes lyrical about the start Mark Footitt, one of those recruits from elsewhere, has made to the season and the huge influence of Kumar Sangakkara but it is potential of two of those Surrey products that particularly excites him.
The Curran brothers are fantastic talents but different, said Batty. Tom is a more workmanlike player whereas Sam is more free-flowing, a bit more natural. They are reminiscent of the Hollioake brothers and how they went about things. They complement each other and are great lads. Its our job to make sure we dont put too much on them too early and allow them to flourish into the cricketers they want to be. They have huge careers ahead.
While Tom and Sam Curran are undoubtedly part of Englands future, Batty is now, almost certainly, part of Englands past after his fairytale return to Test cricket after an 11-year absence for the winter tours of Bangladesh and India. Sadly, that fairytale did not have the happiest of endings as the off-spinner played just two Tests with modest results but his call-up was a triumph for Battys enduring skills, determination and sheer passion for the game.
The first game back in Bangladesh was the most nervous Ive ever been on a cricket field, said Batty. I was petrified and I cant explain why other than when youre a bit older you understand the repercussions more when it goes wrong. You dont want to let anybody down.
But I felt I got into more of a groove in the second innings and if I hadnt been taken off when I was there could have been a quicker finish to the game.
Yes we lost in India and that was a bitter pill to swallow but I was engrossed in that tour. The people around the group were fantastic, particularly Alastair Cook, who I think gets some unjust stick. For a guy to leave his new-born baby 24 hours after she was born and get on a plane to do what he did should have been put up in lights. I dont think many people would do that.
I took some really positive things out of watching the way Cooky went about things with Trevor Bayliss and I hope I can help make Surrey better for the experience. Im a cricket badger and to sit in that dressing room with the likes of Jimmy Anderson was something else. Yes hes a friend but he s our best ever bowler and I was sat there in the same team. It wasnt like youre going out for dinner as mates. It s an amazing thing and I wouldnt change it for anything.
And Batty has no doubts England have a bright future. The last time I was involved I felt that team was getting to its peak but this one now has so much ahead of them. In two or three years time I want to be sat in the stands watching them because as a group its frightening what they could achieve.
Batty s future approaching his 40th birthday, surely, is solely with Surrey now where he retains the competitive edge that has sometimes got him into trouble but which will always define his approach to the game.
I had about four or five years when I said to myself if you get a wicket dont do anything but I couldnt. It just comes out. I was embarrassed about it for a while but Ive realised now that I cant stop so I just get on with it. Im a bad loser but I like to think as time has gone on I now lose in the correct manner.
The day the competitive edge goes it wont need Alec Stewart to say theres your P45 because I will know its time to go. Its what its all about. The more you win the more youre doing your job and that passion is part of me. The older Ive got the less I try to fight it. I dont want it to boil over but if people dont like it then Im sorry I cant change, its me. Its just the way I am.
Surrey looked poised for great things before the Tom Maynard tragedy changed everything but now, after being beaten finalists in the last two Royal London finals, the time has come for them to start winning again. Their adopted Yorkshireman wants nothing more.
The accent and birthplace doesnt suggest Im a product of Surrey but from the day I walked into the gates at the Oval Ive felt like one. I guess its a love affair. I fell in love with the club and thats still the case.
I will stop at some point and I will be very grateful for the career Ive had but I wont stop loving the club, thats for sure.  Daily Mail

There are aliens out there, says Ridley Scott
FRANCE: Alien creator Ridley Scott says he'sconvinced that there are aliens out there -- and one day they could come for us.
The veteran director said on Thursday he believed in higher beings as he prepared to release the sixth episode of the sci-fi horror series, Alien: Covenant, next month.
I believe in superior beings. I think it is certainly likely. An expert I was talking to at NASA said to me, 'Have you ever looked in the sky at night You mean to tell me we are it' That's ridiculous.
The experts have now put a number on it having assessed what is out there. They say that there are between 100 and 200 entities that could be having a similar evolution to us right now.
So when you see a big thing in the sky, run for it, he joked.
Because they are a lot smarter than we are, and if you are stupid enough to challenge them you will be taken out in three seconds. Alien: Covenant, the second of the prequel films, is set in 2104 on board a spaceship carrying 2,000 cryogenically frozen colonists to a distant planet when they chance upon an uncharted paradise.
But their voyage soon turns into a gory nightmare that makes Alien's original chestbuster scene seem tame in comparison.
The neomorph aliens in the new film are based on the goblin shark which has a jaw which hinges in two ways. It's scary, hideous beyond belief actually, Scott said.
The 79-year-old British-born director -- who was also the brains behind Blade Runner -- said he never tired of scaring people out of their skins.
When I did the first 'Alien' I had to get a sense of responsibility because the reaction to the kitchen ( chestbuster ) scene with John Hurt was beyond anything I expected -- and it was not good, he told AFP.
But the film was very successful because people are perverse. He said he could not believe the terror he had created when he went to see people watching the film.
Everybody was half underneath the seat watching by the time you get to the kitchen scene. There was a woman underneath the seat with her husband holding her. I said this is not healthy. Scott, however, claimed that he was unshockable.
Nothing scares me. I have a 9mm (pistol), he said.
If there is a problem I tend to close down into calm. When you walk in in the morning on a film and 600 people turn and all look at you, that is scary, he said.
Alien: Covenant has a religious subtext, the director insisted.
He said he was agnostic, but this did not stop him making a film about Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings, in 2014.
Either religion is the greatest trick played on mankind. Or it is not, and that poses some great questions, and this film is a great context for those, he said.
The film sees Irish actor Michael Fassbender return to his role as the cerebral android David which he played in the last prequel Prometheus in 2012.
But this time with a twist. Scott uses him to pose questions about the nature of humans.
There is an artist in there somewhere, Fassbender said in an earlier interview. There's definitely an ego in there... So again these are very human things.
We all want to leave something behind after we go. There's a legacy of some sort that we've left behind, he added.
Scott, who was knighted in 2003, is about to make a film about the Battle of Britain during World War II, when the Royal Air Force fought off the German Luftwaffe.
Alien: Covenant opens across the world from May 10.- AFP

Tobacco industry resorts to nasty gimmicks
Govt asked to protect public health policies:
The tobacco industry is influencing leaders, politicians and university lecturers to achieve their target. The industry promotes myths and lies, a Senior Lecturer attached to the Colombo University Medical Faculty Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
Colombo University Medical Faculty Dean Prof. Jennifer Perera said Sri Lanka was the first Asian country and the fourth country in the world to ratify WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
She said 180 countries had signed the FCTC. The government should protect the public health policies from the tobacco industry under this convention, she said.
Alcohol and Drug Information Centre Executive Director Pubudu Sumanasekara said over 250 news items and articles were published on behalf of the tobacco company and smoking after the government increased the tax on tobacco. Articles had no bylines. Even the editors did not know how those news and features landed in the newspapers, he said.
Verite Research Executive Director Dr. Nishan de Mel said a formula is required to decide tax on tobacco. The profit of the tobacco company has increased. Tax income of the government from tobacco has also increased. But smoking has not been reduced, he said.

## Title: Trumps Asia team is missing in action

Trumps Asia team is missing in action
Nearly 100 days into his administration and amid a growing crisis with North Korea, President Trump has so far failed to install Asia policy officials in several key posts across the government, a situation experts say is hampering strategy development, slowing relationship-building with key allies and potentially dangerous if a conflict erupts.
Trump himself seems active on Asia issues, meeting with leaders including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in his first few months in office. On Wednesday, the White House will host U.S. Senators for a briefing on the North Korean nuclear issue. Senior officials have toured Asia, including Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and most recently Vice President Pence.
But none of Trumps top officials had deep Asia experience before joining the administration, and inside their departments nearly all of the Asia-related political-appointee positions remain unfilled or staffed by temporary civil servants. There is no appointed assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, no assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs and zero Trump ambassadors to Asia are in place. Only one, nominee for Beijing Terry Branstad, has even been submitted for consideration to the Senate.
Asia policy work
These are not folks who really know a lot about Asia, so they really need help from some serious people, said one GOP Asia hand who asked for anonymity for fear of retribution.
The one bright spot in the administrations Asia team has been Matt Pottinger, the National Security Council senior director for Asia, who was originally brought in by former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal reporter in Beijing, has been handling the bulk of the Asia policy work along with his small team of civil servants inside the White House.
He travelled to Asia with Tillerson and Mattis, separately. He led a North Korea policy review that produced a policy entitled maximum pressure and engagement. He participated in preparing for the Trump-Xi summit, although Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner played the major role in organising those meetings. But several Republican Asia experts told me that Pottinger doesnt have the bandwidth or the mandate to run Asia policy all on his own.
Several GOP Asia experts have been interacting with the Trump administration in one form or another, but very few have actually joined up. There are various reasons for the growing disconnect between the administration and the Asia expert community.
Anti-Trump statements
Some top Asia experts have been deemed persona non grata in Trump world because of their opposition to the president during the campaign. Other top former officials were more careful talking about Trump but are nevertheless in limbo. Former NSC senior director Victor Cha has been discussed internally for a top position but was never offered a job or explicitly told he was not wanted. Ashley Tellis, a top Indian expert, was initially considered strongly for ambassador to India, but was later taken out of consideration for allegedly not disclosing some of his anti-Trump statements.
Former Pentagon official Michael Pillsbury has been informally helping the Trump team since before the election and was on the list for consideration as ambassador to Singapore. But now that job may go to K.T. McFarland, who is being ushered out of her role as deputy national security adviser.
Some Asia experts remain in consideration despite having anti-Trump statements on their records. Former State Department official Christian Whiton is currently posted inside the East Asian and Pacific affairs bureau at the State Department as part of the temporary beachhead team. He is considered a leading contender to be assistant secretary there.
During the presidential primaries, Whiton wrote for the Fox News website that Trumps foreign policy comments made him sound like a teenager who has failed every quiz during the semester but implausibly promises to save the day by acing the final. Days after the election, he wrote that Trump ought to receive the Nobel Prize.
Korean Peninsula
There are some indications that help may be on the way.
At the Pentagon, Mattis has reportedly chosen retired Army Col. Joseph Felter to be deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia. Administration sources said that the assistant secretary of defence for Asia job could soon go to Bert Mizusawa, a Major General in the U.S. Army Reserve who was part of the Trump campaign.
But theres still no undersecretary of defense for policy, following Mattiss failed attempt to gain White House agreement to give that post to veteran ambassador Anne Patterson. One top contender for the job is Randy Schriver, an Asia expert who served in the State Department under Colin Powell.
On my recent trip to South Korea and Japan, several officials told me they simply dont have interlocutors on the U.S. side and therefore cant begin to make real progress on policy or strategy. More pressingly, they dont know who to call if there were a real emergency.
If the Trump team really wants to complete President Barack Obamas unfulfilled pivot to Asia, or to prepare for the worst-case scenario on the Korean Peninsula, they will need real experts to do it, the sooner the better.

World Masters Games: Man Kaur wins 100m gold - aged 101
Man Kaur is living proof that age is just a number.
The 101-year-old from Chandigarh, India, has made history at this year's World Masters Games in Auckland, New Zealand, as the oldest female athlete to win a gold medal in the 100-meter race.
She's the oldest athlete at the multi-sport event, which has been labeled by many as the Olympics for veterans. Held every four years, the World Masters Games is for people of varying abilities who are, generally, age 35 or over.
Kaur competed in multiple events at the games, winning the 100-meter dash in 74 seconds on Monday, and seizing gold in the 200-meter dash and shot-put events on Wednesday. On Thursday she'll compete in the javelin throw. The sprightly great-grandmother has quickly become a sensation at the games, posing with peace signs for fans post-race and showing off her own victory dance to the crowd, while proudly sporting the number 10001 on her jersey.
She was the only competitor in her age category for all of her medals, but her effort and determination have won her much admiration from spectators and other athletes alike.
NEVER TOO LATE
Born in Patiala in the north Indian state of Punjab, Kaur didn't become involved in athletics until she was 93, when her son began taking her to the Punjab University grounds and noticed she could run well.
He'd taken part in the games and encouraged his mother to get involved when he saw other women from around the world competing. "She trains daily," Kaur's 79-year-old son and coach, Gurdev Singh, told CNN. "We eat good homemade food -- no fried food. No restaurant eating, every day wheat grass, nuts and seeds."
Aside from a healthy diet, Kaur's grandson Nirmal Singh said she also stays positive and keeps busy. Kaur doesn't receive any professional training, but despite severe osteoporosis and a curved spine, the centenarian's health is good and she remains hopeful she'll continue to enjoy athletics in the future and even improve. "I will run as long as Guru's (God's) grace is with me. Although I am in such a state of health and I have improved my performance in these games, I will definitely perform better if there is some medical help," Kaur told CNN.Her accomplishments in New Zealand are being noticed back home. Indian Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu called her inspirational in a tweet Tuesday.
Last summer, Kaur competed in the American Masters Games in Canada in running, shot-put and javelin events. Her son said she's won more than 20 medals since she started competing in athletics. Perhaps most proud of Kaur is her large family. She has three children, 10 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. "I feel very good that she won," said Nirmal Singh. "Whenever she participates, she wins gold."

Students must be given opportunities to develop in diverse fields
Quality of education has to be improved while providing opportunities for the students to develop interests in diverse fields, Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chang Won-Sam said.
He was addressing the opening ceremony of Happy Childrens Centre in Dematagoda yesterday.
The centre was established with the financial assistance from the Hyundai Engineering and Constructions jointly with the Korea Food for the Hungry International (KFHI).

Water supply charges should be revised: Hakeem
The water supply charges should be revised soon for the economic stability of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Rauff Hakeem said.
He said that while a liter of bottled drinking water is sold at Rs. 60, the NWSDB provides 1,000 liters to the people at a price of Rs.12.
The NWSDB bears a huge cost for purification and distribution of water, so it is impossible to provide water at such a low price, he said.
Minister Hakeem made these remarks yesterday at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the Polgahawela, Pothuhera and Alawwa Integrated Water Supply Project, in Pothuhera, Kurunegala.
The Polgahawela, Pothuhera and Alawwa Integrated Water Supply Project will provide drinking water to over 167,700 beneficiaries in 167 Grama Seva divisions in Polgahawela, Kurunegala, Weerambugedara, Alawwa, and Mallawapitiya Divisional Secretariat divisions in Kurunegala District.
The estimated cost of the project is USD 108 million, of which USD 91.8 million is funded by the EXIM Bank of India. The Bank of Ceylon will provide USD 16.2 million and Government of Sri Lanka will provide Rs. 4,547.8 million. The total expected cost of the project is Rs 20, 207 million.

Another victory for Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka secured a major victory in the international arena on Thursday as a motion to deny the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) to Sri Lanka was defeated at the European Parliament. The motion to deny the trade concession put forward by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, was voted down, as 436 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted against it. There were 119 votes for the resolution, while 22 abstained.
The proposal to deny Sri Lanka the GSP Plus status was tabled by 52 MEPs from the European United Left/Nordic Green Left group, who argued that the countrys labour laws are insufficient to protect workers, while there had not been enough progress in the field of human rights. This initiative was led by MEPs Anne-Marie Mineur and Lola Sanchez Caldentey, who visited Sri Lanka from April 10 to 12 and sent a letter to European Commissioner on Trade Cecilia Malmstrm arguing that the trade concession should not be restored unless Sri Lanka kept its promise to improve labour rights.
However, the majority of MEPs clearly had not agreed with this view, acknowledging the vast progress made in the fields of labour rights and human rights since January 2015. There is a general consensus in the European Union (EU) that even though improvements could be made in the above sectors, the present achievements can justify Sri Lankas efforts to regain GSP Plus.
This is yet another major victory for Sri Lanka at the EU, following the restoration of fish exports to the bloc a few months back. The final decision with regard to granting GSP Plus to Sri Lanka will be taken as soon as next month by the EU, but judging by this vote Sri Lanka will not experience any problems.
The granting of GSP Plus will make Sri Lankan exports to the European Union market cheaper and lead to export growth. GSP allows developing countries to pay fewer duties on their exports to the EU. This gives them vital access to EU markets. The GSP+ enhanced preferences mean full removal of tariffs on essentially the same product categories as those covered by the general arrangement. Sri Lanka still does enjoy the normal GSP, but Plus status gives additional advantages.
The main beneficiary will be the apparel and textiles sector, which accounts for nearly 62 percent of all experts to the EU (2016 figures of European Commission). The EU is also the countrys second biggest trading partner after India, absorbing 32 percent of all exports, which amounts to around Euro 2,225 million (2016). Garments are one of the countrys top export items and any losses on that front affect the economy adversely.
Sri Lanka lost the Plus facility in 2010, after an HR investigation by the European Commission. The investigation relied on reports by UN Special Rapporteurs and Representatives, other UN bodies and by human rights NGOs that identified significant shortcomings in Sri Lanka's implementation of three UN human rights conventions: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This was partly due to the belligerent attitude by the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration towards human rights in general. They argued that conforming to these conventions would amount betraying the countrys sovereignty, whereas they would actually have strengthened sovereignty.
The loss of GSP Plus was a massive blow to the economy, as we could not compete with the other countries in the region including Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal and Laos which were enjoying the additional zero duty benefits of Plus. Thousands lost their jobs as many garment factories closed around Sri Lanka. The garment industry did find some new markets, but that could not offset the losses incurred from the loss of GSP Plus.
This Government promised to get the ban reversed. Now Sri Lanka is on the cusp of receiving GSP Plus again. The new Governments pragmatic foreign policy has won over the International Community, especially the West, that was once very hostile towards Sri Lanka as a result of human rights concerns. If the Rajapaksa administration continued, many countries would have blacklisted Sri Lanka and imposed economic sanctions. Fortunately, the January 8 transformation saw an end to such designs. In fact, the Government was able to secure a two-year extension for its accountability and truth-seeking endeavours at the UN Human Rights Council recently.
As Sri Lanka moves higher up the development ladder, it will lose most aid packages granted by Western countries. It will have to rely mostly on external trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Hence it is vital to rely more on trade, according to the mantra trade not aid. Efforts should thus be made to increase exports other than garments to the EU and other countries. This is why the Government is keen to have more FTAs with leading economies in our region, which will give duty-free access for our goods. Trade and investment are the keys to a prosperous future and the GSP Plus will be an immense boon to our economy.

Anura Rohana wins Pune Open Golf Cship
Ranasinghe Aarachchilage Anura Rohana, silver medalist in Seoul Asian Games 2002, continues to fly the Sri Lankan flag high on the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI).
Anura Rohana won the Pune Open Golf Championship 2017, at the Poona Club Golf Course, a significant event in the PGTI annual calendar. Anura Rohana lying in joint 6th place after 3 Rounds at 4 under par, fired a brilliant last round of 65 (6 under par) to come from behind and Win by a clear 2 strokes from Khalin Joshi. The overnight leader and multiple winner on the PGTI, Mukesh Kumar, the leader after Round 3 was over hauled by Anura Rohana to clinch his second PGTI Win since winning the BLIT Open at Delhi Golf Club in 2015.
Anura Rohana, climbed the ROLEX PGTI Rankings too with the win, to be ranked number 4, at present. The consistency of Anura Rohana on the PGTI, has largely gone unnoticed as Indian media did not give him due pulicity. But the recent signing up of Anura Rohana by Soft Logic LIFE as the Travel & Tour Sponsor in early 2017 has apparently motivated Anura Rohana to clinch victory in a very competitive Professional Golf Tour of India. The magnificence of Anura Rohanas win can not be over emphasized, since the standard of Indian Pro Golf ranks among the best in the South Asian Region and for a foreigner to win on Indian soil is anyway a challenge with the home advantage stacked in favour of the local golfers.

Can Serena Williams return to the top of tennis after giving birth
It is July 2008. Five months have passed since Kim Clijsters gave birth to her first child, and the Belgian is back on the tennis court for the first time.
Movements which were once as natural as flying is to a bird are now off limits. There will be no lunging towards tramlines, or stretching every sinew to serve at speed. The grand slam champion has to begin from the very beginning. She is starting from zero.
She attempts to hit the ball in quick succession, but her heart rate bursts to 180 beats per minute. A no-go zone for the new mum. A gentle two-shot rally with her coach is her maximum.
Clijsters' return to professional tennis will be measured, calculated. Progress will be made at a crawl.
For a 27-year-old woman who has already been world No.1, life will, sometimes, be frustrating, but there is no fast-track to sporting success, even for a talent such as Clijsters.
It will be another seven months before she is ready to play competitively, to challenge herself against her peers.
Serena Williams has all of this to come
One of the greatest athletes of her generation is expecting her first child and fresh challenges, a new perspective, are before her. Williams has said she will make her tennis comeback next year, but will a 35-year-old who has won it all really return to the sport in which she made her name
Wim Fissette, Clijsters' former coach, believes we have seen the last of Williams at grand slams, dazzling with her flawless serve, overpowering opponents with her destructive groundstrokes.
WHAT IS LEFT TO MOTIVATE THE WOMAN WHO HAS WON IT ALL
The American will not be too old, or too weak to put her body through punishing training regimes. She won't lose her ability to serve with venom. Her once-in-a-generation talent will remain, but her iron will may not.
What, asks Fissette, will motivate her to be the best in her field again when, for the last 20 years, she has already proven to be one of history's finest champions, winning 23 grand slams.
Having won one major title and been retired for two years, Clijsters felt she still had something to prove, as does two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka, another of Fissette's former charges who, aged 27, will make her comeback in July, having given birth to a baby boy in December.
"What I found the most important with both players was that they still had a lot they wanted to, and believe they could, achieve," Fissette -- Clijsters' coach when the Belgian won three grand slams during her comeback from pregnancy -- told CNN Sport.
"They had big dreams and big goals and they used that motivation from the moment they were pregnant, to stay fit and start training quite shortly after giving birth.
"With the right motivation, anything is possible.
"Science is at a point where you can be very fit at 37 or 38. If she has that goal to come back next year she will be fine but, personally, I don't see her coming back.
"She's achieved everything. She's the best tennis player of all time, who will be 36 in September and is about to have a baby.
"She will realize, when she gives birth, that being a mum will be a better feeling than all her grand slam wins put together and she will enjoy the family life."
Fissette points to Williams' past struggles with motivation to support his argument. Until Williams partnered with the tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou nearly five years ago, the now 23-time grand slam champion seemed, for a period, to lack hunger. She had been competing less and less, grand slam success was no longer a given.
The Frenchman shifted her focus onto records, onto building a legacy, and Williams began collecting majors again with renewed vigor.
PREDICTABLY UNPREDICTABLE
It is difficult to imagine what it is like being Williams, the oldest player to ever be world No.1, a black woman in a predominantly white sport, the most relentless accumulator of grand slam titles in nearly 50 years.
The girl from Compton who first started playing aged three has kept going, and done so while almost always being at the very top.
She has come through depression, come back from the pulmonary embolism which could have ended her career. She is a player who won three of her grand slam single titles after being match point down.
Who is to say an athlete of such mental fortitude will not combine motherhood and continued on-court success, setting new records in the process
Williams is, after all, predictably unpredictable. She announced her unexpected engagement to Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of internet site Reddit, in December, by posting on Reddit.
On Wednesday, she sent the internet into wild frenzy with the Snapchat picture which told the world of the change that is to come.
The picture also informed us all that this was a woman who won January's Australian Open while pregnant.
"You never know with Serena," says Fissette. "She's an unbelievable champion and with those champions they have a different mindset, though I don't see it happening.
"If she wants to become again the No.1 player in the world, yes, it will cost a lot of effort, but if you have that goal it should be quite easy in her position because she has the talent, she has the body, she can do that."
ADAPTING, COMMUNICATING, ORGANIZING
Williams may need no greater motivation than winning in front of her child, traveling the world as a family and overtaking Margaret Court's all-time singles record of 24 grand slams.
Court, incidentally, was the first mother to win as a professional tennis player, securing the last three of her titles as a mom. In the past, father-of-four Roger Federer, the 18-time grand slam champion, has said that fatherhood has had a "very positive change" on his life.
Admittedly, not every father has earned over $100 million in prize money and can travel on private planes, with nannies, coaches and physiotherapists easing the burden.
But Williams, with a fortune of around $149m, has the wealth to support whatever lifestyle she chooses, as did Clijsters.
Her team will expand, and player and coach will have to adapt. Fissette talks of initial team bonding exercises for the new Team Clijsters.
"We had to get to know each other, to know everybody's role in the team. That was important," he says.
Tennis tournaments are not hostile environments for families. Many, especially in America, provide play areas and organized day trips to the zoo for players' children.
Williams will be in a position to pick and choose her tournaments, though a successful return will depend on exquisite organization. Hotel rooms will need to be booked close to each other so mum can sleep separately but visit her child during tournaments without feeling cut off.
Clijsters, says Fissette, received "a lot of help" from her husband and nanny during big events, allowing her to focus fully on her tennis.
"Before, everything was about tennis and performing and winning, winning titles," says Fissette, now coach of Johanna Konta, the world No.7.
"Coming back, the first priority was family and a healthy, happy baby. I felt that took a lot of pressure away from Kim, even after a loss she realized there were more important things in the world and I think that helped her a lot."
BECOMING A MOM, BECOMING A BETTER ATHLETE
Traveling should be problem free for Williams, but there is still the prospect of sleepless nights; tweaking long-established training regimes to suit an athlete who could be sleep-deprived as she adjusts to motherhood.
Toni Minichiello, coach of former Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, warns of the dangers of sleep deprivation, making an athlete susceptible to illness.
He also says Williams will have to change her diet -- and increase her vitamin C and iron intake.
"You're no longer only considering sponsor time but also baby time. Who is getting up for the feed Will there be a nanny Jess did all of that herself so don't discount sleep deprivation because it is damaging," Minichiello tells CNN Sport.
Despite these hurdles, Williams could return a better, more focused player. There is evidence to suggest there are numerous physiological benefits to pregnancy.
"I felt everything was better," says Fissette, describing his three years with Clijsters from 2009 to 2011 as one of the most enjoyable periods of his career.
"Scientists have proven that a woman who has given birth can be a stronger athlete than she was before and I felt that with Kim.
"She was a better athlete, but she knew her body well and she knew she had to take her time.
"My experience of working with a woman who has given birth is only positive."
Recovering from the trauma of childbirth
Fissette suggests Williams should not contemplate returning to training until five months after giving birth -- playing too much too soon may lead to complications and potential back trouble.
Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe was back running 12 days after giving birth to her daughter, Isla, and she has since conceded that that was too soon.
She ended up with a stress fracture in the bone at the base of the spine, though she did win the New York Marathon 10 months after Isla's birth.
Minichiello remembers the returning Ennis-Hill as a new mum eager to succeed for her son, Reggie, but she was also a different athlete to the one which won gold at her home Olympics in 2012.
To lessen expectation, Minichiello created a new barometer by which success should be judged -- PPPBs (post-pregnancy personal bests).
Ennis-Hill would no longer focus on the times she used to run, or the height she used to jump.
"It's a different body, you don't respond in the same way," Minichiello says.
"I read a lot of papers on the psychology of coming back from injury, not that pregnancy is an injury, and it's not that she's less skillful -- it's that her body is still recovering from giving birth, the hormones are still there."
Minichiello found that Ennis-Hill's powers of endurance, necessary for the lung-busting 800 meters -- the final event of the grueling seven-event heptathlon -- had been boosted as a result of increased blood volume.
During pregnancy, a woman's heart is remodeled with the chamber capacity increases, meaning blood is pumped at a far greater rate around the body.
Her feet and hips were more mobile, too -- a consequence of a hormone called relaxin which loosens ligaments and tendons in preparedness for giving birth.
The postpartum period -- the time after pregnancy -- can potentially last up to a year and Minichiello admits that Ennis-Hill did not perform to the best of her ability until 12 months after giving birth, in time to win heptathlon gold at the World Championships in Beijing in 2015
The continued presence of relaxin, he said, affected her speed and power.
"Will Serena have the speed and power to serve in the same way I'm not so sure. Will she have the speed to get to the balls I'm not sure. But that will come back, probably after nine months," says Minichiello.
"She's a superbly fit athlete. She's head and shoulders above other female tennis players, she is a different class. If Jess can come back and medal in a Olympic Games, in a very physical sport, then I can't see why Serena can't.
"But regardless of what she may have planned, it's very different when the little one arrives." - CNN

Colombo and Galle the final showdown
SLC Super Provincial tournament:
Almost a fortnight of one-day cricket that included the cream of 60 top cricketers in the country reaches its climax when Colombo take on Galle in the final of the SLC Super Provincial tournament at the R Premadasa Stadium under lights today.
With the pressure to play for places in the national team now a distant dream after the final 15 for the ICC Champions Trophy was announced on Monday the players can rest assured play their natural game without any anxiety.
The tournament which replaced the scheduled 4-day first-class Provincial competition was played to give the players maximum opportunities to perform and clinch a place in the national side.
The player who made full use of it and managed to find a place in the Sri Lankan 15 for England was Kandy captain Chamara Kapugedera whose team unfortunately are not in the final.
Nevertheless the tournament gave Kapugedera the chance to regain his place in the national ODI team after 15 months scoring 287 runs inclusive of two centuries.
That apart Colombo one of the finalists got off to a rather inauspicious beginning being held to a tie by Dambulla and losing to Galle by 188 runs before picking themselves up by defeating Kandy and then Galle in the return match played at R Premadasa Stadium by three wickets successfully chasing down 300 to win by three wickets with an over to spare. They suffered a mild hiccup losing to Dambulla before securing their place in the final with a win over Kandy in the return match.
The first three matches Galle played saw them win and lose two matches by one wicket margins and secure a 188-run win over Colombo only to lose the return match by three wickets. But back to back wins in their final two round robin matches against Kandy and Dambulla where they topped 300 plus on each occasion stamped their class and made certain their place in the final.
Galle has been consistent in running up totals in excess of 300 in four of their six round robin matches. Even on the two occasions they failed to reach 300 they totaled 299-9 and 250-8 which tells you of the batting power they possess in their ranks.
On top of the pile is that promising young opener Sadeera Samarawickrama who has been making waves in the tournament notching up two centuries and being the leading run-getter with 314 runs. Samarawickrama is closely followed by Sri Lanka Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne who has also been in rock solid form contributing 310 runs inclusive of three half-centuries that includes a top score of 89.
While Samarawickrama and Karunaratne contribute at the top of the batting the fact that Galle have been able to go past 300 consistently is largely due to powerhouse Dasun Shanaka down the order. He is the teams third highest runs scorer with 285 runs and a strike rate of 141.79 and that includes an innings of 121 not out off 95 balls.
With a batting line up comprising Samarawickrama, skipper Upul Tharanga, Minod Banuka, Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva, Sammu Ashan, Dasun Shanaka and Chathuranga de Silva no wonder Galle have displayed the likeness for big scores.
Even in the bowling Galle again has the leading wicket-taker in the tournament  left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara with 12 wickets. He has the support of Suranga Lakmal, Seekkuge Prasanna, Akila Dhananjaya and Chaturanga de Silva.Captain Dinesh Chandimal is Colombos leading run scorer (285 runs) and a lot will depend on him if his team are to give Galle a challenging target to chase. Dilshan Munaweera is the only other batsman who has topped 200 (232) in an otherwise Colombo side that has managed to win matches largely not on their batting but with their bowling where there is variety in the likes of Thisara Perera, Lahiru Madushanka and Vishwa Fernando to the spin of Shehan Jayasuriya (12 wickets), Ashan Priyanjan and Sachitra Senanayake.
On paper Galle look the stronger side as many of the Colombo players have not fired in the tournament although the big names like Kithuruwan Vithanage, Dilshan Munaweera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Angelo Perera and Lahiru Thirimanne are in their line-up.
It is the two best teams in the competition that has reached the final and one hopes that they can live upto it and make it a memorable contest.
An SLC media release states that entrance to the final is free and that the game will be telecast live from 2.00 pm on Dialog TV, Sri Lanka Cricket Web, The Papare and Dialog mobile.

Dinesh accuses Colombo Municipal Commissioner of fraud
The Colombo Municipal Commissioner has allegedly been involved in a fraud running into millions of rupees involving garbage, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena charged in Parliament yesterday.
The MP, joining in the adjournment debate on the Meethotamulla disaster, levelled corruption allegations against the Colombo Municipal Commissioner.
MP Gunawardena thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a special commission to investigate the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. Thirty two people had died and more are still unaccounted for.
The Colombo Municipal Commissioner should take responsibility for this tragedy.
Warning after warning had been given to stop dumping garbage at Meethotamulla, but garbage dumping had continued ignoring the warnings, he stated.
The MP also criticised the Government for not holding the Local Government Elections, pointing out that the situation could have been managed better had the CMC and other Local Government bodies functioned properly.
He pointed out the Commissioner alone could not handle the situation without the support of Council members.
MP Gunawardena also questioned the role played by the disaster management authorities during the Meethotamulla tragedy. Our disaster management arm is very slow to react. We need a disaster management flying squad that is alert round the clock and can be immediately deployed to any part of the country, he proposed.
The Colombo Municipal Commissioner said fears of a collapse had been there for over a week. Were the disaster management authorities sleeping he questioned.
The MP also said the housing projects from which the victims in Meethotamulla were given houses were started during the previous Governments time. Had those not initiated the Government would have been utterly helpless he added.

Effort to settle environmental issues of Norochcholai residents
Public Utilities Commission initiative:
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) started discussions with the communities that raise concerns on the environment impact of the Norochcholai coal power plant in the North Western Province, a release issued by the PUUSL said.
An expert committee appointed by the Commission has started discussions with the communities, the release said.
The release adds: A committee of experts appointed by the PUCSL in March 2016 to study the environmental impact that caused by the thermal power plants in Sri Lanka, the fisheries and farmer community, the representatives of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Central Environmental Authority, North Western Provincial Environmental Authority, Department of Coast Conservation and Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited discussed on the issue that the communities raised.
The discussions came into light as the Supreme Court directed the PUCSL to take steps to regularise the environmental damage caused by the Norochcholei coal power plant. The direction was given with regard to the Fundamental Rights Application pending at the Supreme Court on the environmental impact of the power plant, which the PUCSL informed that it has commenced the process to reduce the damage caused by the fly ash as well as the remaining coal in that area.
The Supreme Court said matters concerning the environmental damage caused, will be looked into by the PUCSL, which is the authority in law entitled to do so.
The first meeting was held on April 5, 2017 and the representatives of various communities and institutions discussed the issues that the villagers voiced.
In the second meeting held on April 24, 2017, the villagers submitted their issues and concerns in writing to the Committee.
The Lakvijaya Power Station, also known as the Norochcholai Power Station is the largest coal power station in Sri Lanka. The plant which has the capacity of 900 MW generates about 39 percent of Sri Lankas energy requirement.
The need of establishing community based committees to work hand in hand with the Ceylon Electricity Board to resolve these types of issues that arise from time to time was also discussed parallel to the development of a regulatory mechanism to address issues in the short, medium and longer term basis.
The next meeting of the committee will be held on May 22, 2017.

Export-Import Bank of Korea signs aid memoire with ADB and GoSL
The Export-Import Bank of Korea has signed an aide memoire with Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) on 26th April, marking the launch of ADB-KSP Joint Consulting to support the GoSL in drawing a blueprint for the Colombo-Trincomalee Economic Corridor (CTEC). The signing ceremony was preceded by a high-level meeting (consultation workshop) where the interim report prepared by the ADB study team was presented to the government officials. KSP team also took the opportunity to unveil its study plan at the workshop. Another workshop was held subsequently on 27th April with private sector stakeholders in an effort to create awareness about the CTEC development plan and also to initiate close cooperation and engagement with private sector.
CTEC development plan is a long-term and holistic policy instrument that provides opportunity for inclusive and sustainable development of Sri Lanka. As Sri Lanka is on the threshold of upper-middle income status, it becomes increasingly important to synergize industry, infrastructure, logistics, and urbanization to create more jobs and income. In this context, GoSL has requested the ADB to lay out a comprehensive multisectoral integrated development plan to support the CTEC initiative.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with around 100 other trade unions and organisations will launch a countrywide strike against SAITM between May 3 and 5, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Zoysa said the Government should present an acceptable, practical and realistic solution to the SAITM issue by May 9. If the Government fails to do so, a date will be fixed on May 9 for continuing the countrywide strike.
The Government should take over SAITM and declare it as a public property on behalf of the safety of the patients lives.
The people have started to dislike the way judiciary functions in the country and they are losing confidence on it. Political pressures are being exerted on independent supreme bodies such as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The University Act and the Medical Ordinance are being openly violated. The people do not approve the unethical and inappropriate conduct of the Higher Education Minister and the Health Minister, Dr.De Zoysa added.

Government expects GSP+ by May 15
Motion needs to be signed off by European Council of Ministers:
Concession withdrawn from Sri Lanka in 2010 due to countrys poor human rights record:
The government expects to be officially granted the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Plus from the European Union by May 15, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha de Silva said.
The motion to deny Sri Lanka of the GSP Plus concession was defeated at the European Parliament on Thursday but it still needs to be signed off by the European Council of the Ministers to become official.
We have passed the biggest hurdle, the next steps are procedural,Deputy Minister de Silva said addressing a media briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The GSP plus concession which was withdrawn from Sri Lanka in 2010 due to the countrys poor human rights record, had according to the Deputy Minister resulted in a loss of 150-200 million Euros in the countrys exports,
It was not until 2015, when we took over power that we re-started negotiations with the EU to regain GSP Plus, said de Silva and stressed that the European market was an extremely important one for Sri Lanka.
He said with the GSP Plus concession, there was a complete removal of 9-10 percent in duty for exports to the EU.
The concessions however are open to around 6,600 products but Sri Lanka exported only a few of them,
Our exports for many years have not diversified. We need to diversify in order to achieve the economic growth we need. The main objective of building airports, ports and trade agreements are to increase exports. An economy cannot grow with increasing exports, he said.
In 2000, exports made up 34 percent of the countrys GDP but by 2015, it was stood at 13 percent of GDP. There has been no marked improvement in the number in the last two years either.
This is a great turnaround for our exports. One of the main reasons our diversification into other areas has not improved is because we have not been able to compete with other countries which have had a better relationship with the EU,the Deputy Minister said.
The markedly improved relationship between the current government and the EU however is based on the premise that the government was working on improving its commitments to the 27 International Human Rights conventions the country is party to. Given that there is still more work to do in that field, De Silva said that the governments commitment to rule of law, good governance and human rights had nothing to do with Geneva or GSP Plus and that they would fulfil their obligations made to the people.
As the countrys per capita income increases, Deputy Minister De Silva pointed out that the benefits of the GSP Plus would be short lived.
Countries which have achieved an upper-middle income ($4,036) per capita during three consecutive years, according to the World Bank classification will not be applicable for GSP Plus, he added.
We hope to reach the upper middle income status by the end of the year. So we have three more years to enjoy the concession. In such a scenario, we would have to look to starting negotiations with the EU on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA),Deputy Minister de Silva said.
In addition, with the likelihood of Brexit being completed in the next two years, Sri Lanka would also lose duty free access to the British market. To combat these issues, the Deputy Foreign Minister said Sri Lanka would work out a new agreement with Britain and explore FTAs between Commonwealth countries, We have started negotiating FTAs with New Zealand and Singapore already,he added.

## Title: How Difficult is Cliff Diving
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Saturday, April 29, 2017 - 01:00
How Difficult is Cliff Diving
Prelude to Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series :
The Degree of Difficulty varies between 3.6 for a required dive and 6.3 for the most difficult dives in the sport currently. The degree of difficulty (DD) is the rating for each dive performed in a competition and is multiplied by the sum of the judges scores to give the total number of points per dive.
Each trick in a high dive adds to the degree of difficulty and the athletes of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series keep pushing the limits of their sport by creating and realising new dives which werent even considered possible a few years ago.
I came to my dives just by a natural progression. I started off doing a back triple with two twists and eventually added two more twists to get to the back triple quad. My other dive at the start was a front triple with 1 1/2 twists and I started adding a twist and then decided to take away a twist but add a somersault, says the man who introduced the first dive conceived exclusively for cliff diving, Gary Hunt.
The reigning champion of the World Series premiered his triple quad  three somersaults with four twists  with an unbelievable DD of 6.3 in 2009 and has perfected this striking weapon over the past seasons.
Only since the start of this season have two more athletes added dives with a DD of more than 6.0 to their portfolio: Russias Artem Silchenko  back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 2 1/2 twists has a DD of 6.1  and Blake Aldridge from England who learned his back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 4 twists at the US leg in Boston a few weeks ago is now the second athlete performing a dive with a DD of 6.3.
The DD value depends on the kind of manoeuvres, somersaults and twists a diver shows in one dive. The number of somersaults and twists as well as the position in which you leave the platform and enter the water add to the degree of difficulty. You have the tuck position which is like a ball shape and that puts you into a really small position and allows you to spin really fast and that gives you a lower degree of difficulty. But, for example, when you have the pike position, which is more like an L-shape that means you are bigger and longer and its harder to spin as fast and that increases the degree of difficulty. And if you start with a handstand, instantly you have a higher degree of difficulty, explains former cliff diving world champion Joey Zuber.
Improvement and evolution are crucial aspects of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series and in the past four years the athletes have been pushing for more difficult and complex dives. In the 2012 season, the average DD for the optional dives performed in a competition is 5.4. However, not everything in cliff diving centres on the degree of difficulty as the quality of the dives plays a major part, and this is where the judges come in. The five international jurors dont judge based upon how difficult a dive is. They judge it by how well the athletes execute the dive and they have to look at the overall aesthetics of the dive: is it a strong take-off Is the flight in the air good Are their legs straight, are the toes pointed Is the entry nice and vertical It doesnt matter whether the dive is easy or hard, they still have to score it based upon how good it looks. The judges have to look at the dive as a performance piece, not just as a technical piece.
Still new to the sport is David Colturi. The 23-year-old American won the 2012 qualification competition and finished his home stop in third place. His diving list contains dives with a DD of 5.4 and 5.6, which is already a lot higher DD than some of the more established divers have in their programmes. The youngest athlete on tour knows that picking the dive is something that depends on ones personal diving style and what types of manoeuvres one likes to do: I am a fan of the twist. My favourite dive is a reverse twister and my handstand also has a lot of twists in it. I think with a sport that is extreme and dangerous like cliff diving you kind of pick the ones that youre comfortable with and the ones you can feel confident going into.
The recent competitions have proven that the worlds high diving elite feels more and more comfortable with doing big dives from almost three times the Olympic height. Having followed its past development, one next comes to the inevitable question: How difficult can the dives get I think the platform is the limit. Not too long ago, we shifted it up to 27.5m from like 24 or 25m, which was the traditional cliff diving limit and soon enough we are going to be using that full 27, 28m to do all the dives you can. I dont know if there really is a limit. As the sport progresses and the years go on and it gets bigger and more popular, every year I think there going to be bigger and harder dives that come out.
Its awesome to be a part of it and to push the envelope myself is just an extraordinary feeling, says David Colturi whose innovative energy everybody may soon have to try and keep up with.
Just like nine-time world champion Orlando Duque, who leads the overall standings going into the final competition and who has influenced this sport so much in the past 20 years. I dont think we have reached the limit yet.

Hur grabs early lead at Texas Shootout
DALLAS: Hur Mi-Jung fired a 65 Thursday to take the early lead at the Texas Shootout, where Lexi Thompson opened with a solid 69 as she tries to put her ANA Inspiration fiasco behind her.
South Korea's Hur leads a pack of seven golfers who shot four-under 67 at the annual LPGA Tour event at the Las Colinas Country Club.
Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn, Australian Katherine Kirk and South Korea's Park Sung-Hyun join Americans Michelle Wie, Sandra Changkija, Marina Alex and Jennifer Song at two strokes back.
Ariya, of Bangkok, had four birdies in her bogey-free first round.
I hit the ball pretty good today, she said. I just didn't make a putt on the front nine, but I started making putts on the back nine.
Wie overcame an early bogey to make four birdies on the back nine.
I was happy with where I positioned myself today, and hopefully I can go out there tomorrow morning and make some more birdies, said Wie, who has won just four tournaments on the tour since being named newcomer of the year more than a dozen years ago.
Thompson is trying to forget about a controversial ruling in her most recent tournament, the ANA Inspiration on April 2.
She was leading the tournament on the 12th hole of the final round when she was notified that she was being docked two strokes for a violation for improperly marking her ball on 17th green during the third round, plus two more stokes for signing an incorrect scorecard after that round.
LPGA officials based their probe on an email sent to them from a television viewer.
Kirk nailed a hole-in-one on the par-three fourth.
I hit it so well, so I bent down to pick up the tee, then someone said, 'Get in the hole,' and I'm like, 'What' and it went in. I didn't even see it, to be honest, she said.
Nine players are tied for ninth at 68, including Japan's Haru Nomura and Australia's Lee Min-Jee.

The number of cigarettes smoked in Sri Lanka annually was higher in 2016 and 2015 than 2014. Cigarette sales in 2014 were much lesser than in 2015 and 2016, Executive Director of Verite Research Dr. Nishan De Mel said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that in 2014, 3,560 million cigarettes were smoked in Sri Lanka, but, in 2015 the number had increased to 3,960 million. In 2016, the figure stood at 3,790 million.
Smoking should be reduced by at least 25 percent. The profit of the cigarette company has been increasing faster than the tobacco tax income increase of the Government. A formula should be introduced as soon as possible to decide the tax on tobacco,De Mel said.
ADIC Executive Director Pubudu Sumanasekara said that people have not resorted to smoking beedi after the increasing in cigarette spices as stated in certaon media reports. There are cheep cigarettes in the market. It is a daunting task to make the Finance Ministry and certain media institutions realise the truth about the tobacco industry, he added.

Ireland confident of Test status after ICC changes criteria
Ireland say they are cautiously optimistic of achieving Test status in June after the International Cricket Council announced a new process for associate nations wishing to become full members.
Wednesdays ICC meeting means Irelands application must go before a newly-created membership committee which will decide if the various criteria have been met.
Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom said they were optimistic about getting approval from the ICC members.
The new criteria involves areas like governance, finance, the performance of national team and development programmes.
There are some details around financial criteria which I would like to be more certain of, but it looks like we will be in a relatively good position, said Deutrom.
I am cautiously optimistic. I do not want to give the impression it is a penalty kick as we cannot take the process for granted and must respect the opinions of the ICC members whose ultimate decision this is.
The ICCs board agreed on the new membership process at a meeting in Dubai. The current 10 full member nations are Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe.
As well as Ireland, Afghanistan are attempting to move up from associate member level.
In the past, teams wishing to obtain Test status had to be proposed and seconded by full members.
