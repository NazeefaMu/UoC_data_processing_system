Gunasekera said Solta was arrested with the 9 mm pistol which he allegedly used in the above two murders. The suspect also had in his possession a magazine for the firearm, live bullets and close to 7 grams of heroin which has a street value of over Rs.500,000.

Government to provide 2,000 buses to SLTB
Kurunegala District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian and Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said that the government had decided to import about 2,000 buses to be used in urban areas countrywide, adding that the said buses would be provided to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB).
The buses would be imported under the patronage of foreign investors, the minister said while addressing a media conference held in Kurunegala, last Saturday (16). The buses would be operated and handled by SLTB employees, while another 500 buses too, would be imported from India soon.
The said additional buses would also arrive in Sri Lanka during the next eight months and a sum of USD 20 million would be spent for the purpose, he added. In addition, Cabinet approval had been granted to import 12 locomotives at a cost of USD 48 million.
Every year, about 500 buses are removed from the transport service by the SLTB as they become unserviceable, the deputy minister further said.

Human-Elephant conflict could be overcome within one year
The prevailing Human-Elephant (HE) Conflict in the country that had caused numerous difficulties to the public, could be overcome within a year if the recently proposed plans could be continued directly sans any obstacles, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said.
Addressing a gathering at Kekirawa, recently, he added that non-governmental organisations that depend on foreign currency were levelling baseless allegations regarding the environment and wild animals. They had seen animals only at the zoo, not in the jungle. Therefore, intelligentsia do not heed such claims.
The minister said, After assuming my duties, I decided to launch a plan to end the existing human-elephant conflict within one year.
Accordingly, necessary physical resources would be provided for that purpose. At present, the electrified fences spanning a distance of 4,000 kilometres would be further expanded to an additional 2,500 kilometres.
Minister Fonseka said lands for two enclosures would be allocated in the Horowpathana and Lunugamvehera areas as well.
Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma also participated.

I doubted Id ever sing again
After postponing her El Dorado tour for seven months due to vocal problems, Shakira finally hit the road last week with an athletic, hip-shaking show that encompassed more than 20 years of hits.
It's the star's first tour in seven years, after taking time out to start a family with her partner, Spanish footballer Gerard Pique.
Footage from the opening night in Hamburg showed the 41-year-old looking overwhelmed, clasping her hands to her chest as she acknowledged her long journey back to health.
"Last year was one of the most difficult times of my entire life," she tells the BBC from Amsterdam. "Being back on stage has been so emotional."
With the tour hitting London next week, the Colombian star took time out from her schedule to chat about how she's stopped being narcissistic - and whether she understands the offside rule.
Q: Hi Shakira, how are you
I just woke up, can you believe it! My kids are not with me so I'm allowed to sleep. I think the last time I slept this much was six years ago, before I had my first child.
Q: How's the tour going so far
It feels like the first time. In the past, my experience on stage was a little different. A little more narcissistic. I was like, "Oh wow, they're here for me - I'd better look good and sound good."
But now it's more like, "Man, I have this amazing opportunity to make the crowd smile. To make all those people, who've also had hardship in their own lives, happy."
Q: You had to postpone the tour because of a vocal haemorrhage. How bad was it
It was actually more than a haemorrhage. It was like a vascular lesion. So you can imagine, there were times when I doubted I would ever be in front of a crowd again singing my songs.
Q: Did you need surgery
Miraculously, and contrary to everything the doctors predicted, I recovered naturally. They all foresaw surgery, but the lesion disappeared completely from my vocal cords.
I remember praying. I had forgotten to pray for a while, but when you go through hardship you suddenly recover your faith! I was promising God if I could ever use my voice again, I would celebrate every night - and that's what I'm doing.
Q: You've just released a single, Clandestino, which is your third duet with fellow Colombian star Maluma. What keeps you coming back for more
I promise you, we try not to make new music, but it happens! We just can't help it.
He came to Barcelona for a photo session so I said to him, "Listen, why don't we get together in the studio and see what happens" And in less than two hours we had two new songs.
But this one was the one. I was like, "Oh my God, this is it! This is as good as [2016 song] Chantaje!" And those are major words.
Q: Because Chantaje spent 18 weeks at number one in Colombia, right
Exactly. And it did like two billion views on YouTube. Crazy, crazy, unexpected numbers.
Q: Latin music is having a resurgence. Do you think it's here to stay, or could it fade like the Latin explosion of the 1990s
It depends on the artist. I think some artists are meant to stay and some will disappear. It always happens. It's natural selection of the species.
But I don't think of it as a boom in Latin music. I think the world is in a different place. Social media means it's not only the radio that decides what'll be a hit. It's the people.
Q: You once sang "I don't understand football" [on 1998's Inevitable]. Presumably that changed when you met your husband
A little! I still get confused with offsides, though. Can you believe Almost eight years with Gerard and I still don't see the offsides quite well.
But everything else I understand. And I sometimes dare to give my opinion! Gerard thinks it's very cute.
Q: Last year, Fortune Magazine named you one of the world's Top 50 leaders for your charity work. How important is that to you
I have a huge commitment with education. It's a commitment that started [when] I was 18 and I decided to create my own foundation to build schools in remote places in Colombia. That commitment obviously goes beyond anything that appears in a magazine. It's something that lives and breathes in my heart.
Q: Why education in particular
I come from the developing world and that has marked me in so many ways. I was born and raised in a country where there's huge social injustice and poverty and a lack of opportunities. So I feel education is the great transformational agent - the one thing that can change the fate of so many kids who are born poor and who, without the opportunity of an education, would probably die poor.
The one thing that can really break that cycle of poverty and bring new opportunities is education. I've seen it with my own eyes. I've seen the transformation in families and entire communities when you bring a school to an area where there was nothing before.
Q: You've sat down with people like President Obama and President Santos of Colombia. Do they ever underestimate how informed you are about these issues
I think they're used to me by now! Bono once called me and said I'm the most vehement woman he'd ever met.
I'm quite stubborn and every time I get the chance, I'm giving those [world leaders] a call and asking them to participate in projects.

I should have freedom to take decisions within Wildlife Act
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Provincial Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday stressed the importance of finding a permanent solution to the human-elephant conflict in order to save the lives of both parties.
As the Minister, I have the responsibility to protect wildlife. But when it comes to the human-elephant conflict, I have to think beyond the limitations and protect the lives of people, he said.
Speaking to the media after the launching of book Hasthiraja Wanshaya by Tharaka Umayanga Dilshan at the Mahaweli Centre, Minister Fonseka said that the support of the government, general public and environmentalists is essential to put an end to the human-elephant conflict.
Speaking about his decision to remove two elephants temporarily from the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Minister Fonseka said that it was a decision taken by him for the betterment of these two elephants and the residents of the area that the elephants frequented.
He further said that not only the lives of the villagers, but also the lives of those invading elephants are at risk. If these villagers cannot bear the behaviour of these two elephants anymore, they will definitely try to kill them by using a trap gun or something else.
Around nine deaths of elephants have been reported since I was appointed as the Wildlife Minister. Around 50 percent of those deaths were due to gunshot wounds, he said.
People who live in Colombo cannot empathise with those who live in areas where the human-elephant conflicts prevail. They do not feel the suffering of poor farmers due to invading elephants. The elephants destroy farmers crops and damage their homes.
As the Minister of Wildlife, I should have freedom to take decisions that I can take within the limitations of the Wildlife Act, said the Minister. He further charged that electric fences are not the best way to safeguard people from invading elephants. If those elephants cannot find food and feel hungry, they will try to find food even by destroying these fences.
Using elephants for cultural events cannot be stopped. But we cannot accept the inhuman way of treating some of these elephants. Nobody should harm these elephants or limit their freedom, he added.

Trade war would hurt a lot of American brands
A lengthy trade war between China and the United States would be horrible and it would end up hurting a lot of American brands, according to the founder of Chinas second-largest e-commerce company.
Thats because more Chinese consumers now have a preference for buying imported goods, Richard Liu, founder and CEO of JD.com, told CNBCs Eunice Yoon.
For the next five years, or 10 years, Im sure in the larger cities, almost half the shopping will come from imported goods, Liu said.
That means American companies would have an opportunity to sell to a large Chinese consumer base that is eager to buy foreign products.
But if its a long-term (trade) war, it will be horrible, Liu said, telling CNBC it would hurt a lot of American brands.
Planning for the future
JD.com competes with Jack Mas Alibaba in Chinas massive e-commerce market. Both companies have invested significantly in technology, retail and logistics to win over consumers. Those include opening high-tech supermarkets and testing drone delivery to reach Chinas rural consumers.
Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson & Co told CNBCs The Rundown on Monday that both companies are important to watch. While Alibaba added a media business and a successful cloud business to augment its growth, Luria said JD.com was more of a pure retailer.
Theyre singularly focused on being a fantastic retailer, he said. They have the advantage on logistics, they have the advantage on quality and they have the alignment with Tencent, which is incredibly important because of the relationship with WeChat.
Tencent is one of Chinas major technology giants and its businesses include messaging platform WeChat, which is used extensively internationally and in China, where it is known as Weixin. In March, the company revealed that WeChat hit one billion monthly users for the first time.
As a result of the partnership, JD.com is able to sell directly to consumers through Tencents WeChat app.
Moreover, Tencent and JD.com have also teamed up to challenge Alibabas stronghold in the e-commerce space. Last year, the two firms reportedly said they would pay $863 million for a 12.5 percent stake in Vipshop Holdings, which sells discounted fashion and accessories from global brands.
Luria explained that it made sense for JD.com to invest in its business since theres still a very large opportunity in China. In fact, he added, if JD.com did not invest in new technologies and important tools, they would not be able to catch up or compete with Alibaba.
You have to prepare for your future growth at least three, or even five, years earlier, Liu told CNBC. For JD, most important to us is, you know, our supply chain service based on our logistics system. And second is technology.
He added that JD.com planned to reduce the comparatively high logistics costs in China. But across the Pacific, both Alibaba and JD.coms attempts to make in-roads into the U.S. have been slow.
Trade tensions
The tense climate between Washington and Beijing will affect JD.coms confidence and expansion plans into the U.S., Liu said. He explained that his company previously wanted to invest in a lot of projects and firms stateside. The current situation, however, gave the e-commerce giant pause, according to the founder.
Last year we planned to go to the U.S. market from this year, but now we have to wait, Liu said.
Trade tensions between the two countries escalated on Friday, after the United States Trade Representative announced that the U.S. would initially impose an additional 25 percent tariff on 818 Chinese imports worth about $34 billion on July 6.
Duties on an additional $16 billion worth of goods from China would need to undergo public review. If approved, that would bring the total to $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.
For its part, Beijing swiftly retaliated and said it would levy a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion of U.S. goods, taking effect on July 6. The list of goods included soybeans, electric vehicles and a variety of seafood and pork, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
Still, many analysts said Beijing and Washington were likely to come to an agreement that could avoid the levying of tariffs on imported goods.
The hope is that this is just brinkmanship and an arrangement will be arrived at by the governments to avoid such tariffs, Luria said.
He added that many companies and consumers would suffer a negative impact if both governments followed through on their recent announcements.

Aguilera included  daughters  voice  on new album
Christina Aguilera has included her daughter's voice on her latest album.
The superstar released her eighth studio album Liberation on Friday (15Jun18), with the record featuring collaborations with artists such as Demi Lovato, Ty Dolla $ign and 2 Chainz.
But during an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, Christina shared that her three-year-old daughter Summer Rain, who she shares with fiance Matthew Rutler, can be heard on the album too.
"Her voice is on the album," she said, without divulging which track Summer's voice can be heard on.
However, Christina admitted that Summer wasn't too bothered about being on the record, and in fact, gets annoyed by her mother's singing.
"When I'm doing my vocal warm-ups, she slams the door and is like, 'You are interrupting (children's cartoon) Peppa Pig.' It's hilarious," the 37-year-old laughed, adding that her little girl is also obsessed with the music in kids' TV shows like Paw Patrol and PJ Masks. "She wants a PJ Masks birthday party. She makes me sing it to her every night, so I do a lullaby version for her. But it's a hard song to slow down and she won't let me skip a lyric either!"
Prior to Christina's interview, host Jimmy aired a clip showing how he and the blonde star went incognito and surprised an unsuspecting crowd at a New York subway station with a performance.
Disguised in costumes and wigs, Christina and Jimmy belted out Aretha Franklin's Think, drawing in a huge crowd of commuters who all began filming the show on their phones.

To be the  best they can
25 years of success! The beginning of it all was the dream of a single individual Mohan Lal Grero. His dream of a Sri Lankan student population proficient in the English Language became a reality with the establishment of the Lyceum International School on June 14, 1993. The dream developed into his Vision and then into his Mission, and the Mission of the school is To enhance the potential of every young soul that passes through our halls, empowering them to be the best they can do.
It seemed then a mission impossible. In reality, however, in proved to be quite possible. As a teacher who joined the school on September 6, 1993 with the opening of the Primary School and yet works as an AL teacher for the Upper School of Lyceum, I have observed the transition over the years and can now very sincerely state that this mission has been, in every sense of the word, fulfilled.
I have witnessed the growth of Lyceum from infancy to adulthood. I have observed the advancements, the successes, the great heights reached and the national and international recognition earned by Lyceum; and, I have marveled at the sheer skill with which all this has been made possible in such a short span of time as a mere 25 years. In fact today we boast of 8 branch schools established in diverse parts of the country, namely Kandana, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Nuwara-Eliya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. The significant fact about it all is that equal attention and supervision is maintained with respect to all these branch schools to keep up the standards of each and every one of them.
One naturally wonders, perhaps, as to how all this could have been possible in such a short time. However, having come to understand, over the years, the methodical nature and the meticulous attention given to detail, from Day One to date in any and every venture undertaken by the Founder of our school Mr. Mohan Lal Grero and his wife the Principal of the school Kumari Grero (a very diplomatic lady indeed), I am by no means surprised; only, more and more impressed.
One cannot but be impressed beyond measure when one sees the advancement of the facilities afforded by the school. Lyceum International School which began with the Nursery and Pre Grade on June 14, 1993 rose up to the AL Commerce and Science streams in its very first two years. From the start, all religions were given time for study and prayer. Discipline was maintained to the maximum. And the little known Lyceum gradually grew into a more and more sought after International School of no mean repute. Currently, Lyceum has both National and Cambridge AL and OL streams. In addition to the academic curriculum, extra curricular activities were added on. For our Founders undoubtedly believed in the old adage, All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy! Sports as Cricket, Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Swimming, Badminton etc. (You name it, you get it!) received a very special place. Cultural Kandyan Dancing flowered out. Scouts, Girl Guides and even Little Friends increased in numbers. Public Speaking was given a very special place and made part of the school curriculum from Grade 1 itself.
We now have our own Broadcasting and Media Clubs as well and our very special Channel 100.8 Lyceum FM was launched to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Lyceum Nugegoda.

Brazil suffer first night nerves in Swiss stalemate
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Sunday - Coach Tite blamed first night nerves after Brazil's bid for a sixth World Cup got off to a rocky start as Switzerland withstood an early onslaught to snatch a 1-1 draw in Rostov-on-Don on Sunday.
On the day when holders Germany were shocked 1-0 by Mexico, Brazil's tag as pre-tournament favourites looked justified in a dominant first-half capped by Philippe Coutinho's wonder strike to open the scoring.
However, Brazil paid for their failure to kill the game off when Steven Zuber powered home an equaliser from Xherdan Shaqiri's corner five minutes after the break.
The pressure will now be on Brazil to kickstart their campaign when they face Costa Rica on Friday.
The stalemate left Tite unimpressed.
"I'm not happy with this result. Our finishing wasn't good. We had 20 chances, but too many shots were off target. We should have made their keeper work harder than that.
"I put it down to stress, first match nerves, that's true for me too," the Brazil boss said.
He added: "Up to their goal, I was satisfied. We were moving well. Then they raised their game, and it took us 10 minutes to regain our rhythm. But once again, our finishing wasn't good."
His Swiss counterpart Vladimir Petkovic had an understandably more upbeat assessment of the game.
"I'm proud of my lads. I hope this will mean we are taken seriously," he said.
Earlier, Serbia beat Los Ticos 1-0 to move to the top of Group F.
Coutinho had been handed a central role behind Neymar, on his first competitive game for four months, Gabriel Jesus and Willian in a line-up filled with attacking intent.
The five-time world champions went about their task of erasing the memories of a 7-1 thrashing by Germany on home soil four years ago purposefully early on.
Paulinho passed up a glorious chance when his scuffed effort from close range was turned behind by Yann Sommer.
It seemed a matter of time before Brazil's pressure paid dividends and the opener arrived in stunning style on 20 minutes.
Barcelona's record signing picked up a loose ball on the edge of the area and in trademark fashion bent the ball crashing in off Sommer's far post.
Neymar looked bright despite his lack of match practice as he teased the Swiss defence provoking yellow cards for Stephan Lichtsteiner, Fabian Schar and Valon Behrami.
However, Brazil failed to build on their lead as Thiago Silva and Jesus headed off target from dangerous corners and were made to pay early in the second-half.
Switzerland had offered barely any attacking threat before levelling when Zuber took advantage of a gaping hole in the heart of the Brazilian defence to head home Shaqiri's corner.
Forced back onto the front foot, Brazil turned to Neymar for a moment of inspiration but he could only blast into the side-netting before Coutinho sliced wide with a much simpler opportunity than the one from which he opened the scoring. Brazil were unhappy that Zuber wasn't penalised for a slight push on Miranda for the equaliser and felt hard done by again when Jesus tumbled under a challenge from Manuel Akanji inside the area with Mexican referee Cesar Ramos unmoved.
Tite's men ended as they had begun with a series of chances for a late winner as Neymar and Roberto Firmino headed straight at Sommer before Miranda dragged a shot inches wide.
And deep into stoppage time Schar's outstretched leg turned a goalbound effort from Silva wide as Switzerland held out for a vital point.  AFP

[CITIZENS' Mail - (19-06-2018)]
Withholding Tax on Treasury Bills and Repos
This is with reference to a letter from H. B. Ranasinghe which appeared on Daily News of June 6. The correct position for the benefit of the readers is furnished below.
a) Balance Interest Income on Deposits of Senior Citizens (above the exemption limit of Rs. 1.5 million) is taxable at 5% once and for all, at source. It is not added to other Income. In the case of non Senior Citizens, entire interest is taxable at 5% once and for all, at source.
b) With effect from 01.04.2018 Treasury Bills and Repos are not subject to notional tax credit and the entire interest is taxable in the hands of recipients.
National Savings Bank offers the following rates of interest.
Senior Citizens up to the Deposit of 1,500,000 15%, Senior Citizens up to the Deposit of 20,000,000 11.25%, Senior Citizens after the Deposit of 20,000,000 10.50%, Non Senior Citizens on the Deposit of any amount 10.50%
Therefore unless Treasury Bill and Repos interest is above 9-975 (10.50% less 5% tax), no individual will patronize Treasury Bills and Repos in future. At present Treasury Bills and Repos play a major role in Government borrowings. This market will be affected shortly. Hope the Central bank will rectify this situation early.
c) Personal Income tax for 2018/2019 is payable on quarterly basis within 45 days after end of every quarter I.e. 15.08.2018, 15.11.2018, 15.02.2019 and 15.05.2019.
Treasury Bills and Repos are offered for 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Further Treasury Bill Income is taxable on cash basis. Therefore, the balance outstanding of treasury Bills at the commencement of a quarter could help to compute the interest receivable for the next 3 months. This information could be checked with actual cash received. Double checking is possible.
Any change in Treasury Bill operation (buy or sell) will affect the balance as at quarter end and the Income for next quarter could be computed accurately.
It is true that new tax law is a little complicated, but could be understood. It is suggested that adequate seminars be organised by Chambers and Department of Inland Revenue to educate the public.

Coffee helps people work better as a team
For many of us, the promise of coffee is the only thing that gets us out of bed.
A second cafetiere is needed before we talk to anyone in the office and a third cup just about keeps us civil towards our colleagues until lunchtime.
So its no surprise that coffee makes us work better in a team.
Researchers from Ohio State University conducted two experiments with groups of undergraduates and found that those who drank caffeinated coffee were able to stay more on task.
The first study looked at 72 coffee drinkers, half of whom were told to drink a cup of coffee and rate its flavour at the very beginning of the experiment and half who drank one at the end.
They were then split into smaller groups and were asked to discuss various controversial topics like social inequality for 15 minutes  after which they were asked to evaluate their performance in the conversation and that of their fellow students.
And researchers found that those who drank coffee beforehand rated themselves and their teammates more highly than those who didnt.
The second study involved 61 students, all of whom drank a cup of coffee at the start but with half having decaf.
This time, those who drank the caffeinated drink rated their performance more positivity than those who drank decaf.
And thats led the studys authors to conclude that caffeinated coffee can boost participants alertness.
Those who drank caffeine also tended to stay more on topic than those who had decaf or no coffee at all.
Co-author Amit Singh says, We suspect that when people are more alert they see themselves and the other group members contributing more, and that gives them a more positive attitude.

Colombia fret over James as embattled Japan loom at World Cup
SARANSK, Sunday - Despite sacking their coach just 71 days before the World Cup, Japan will attempt to prove their doubters wrong on Tuesday against a Colombia side sweating on the fitness of star midfielder James Rodriguez.
The top scorer at Brazil 2014 is a doubt for the Group H opener at the Mordovia Arena in Saransk after struggling with a strain in his left calf, which also flared up last February.
The Bayern Munich attacking midfielder is key to Colombia's chances of repeating their run to the quarter-finals four years ago in Brazil.
James, 26, netted six goals and created four assists to help Colombia qualify for Russia, while midfielder Wilmar Barrios is also battling to be fit.
However, the South Americans face a Japan side who would struggle to avoid an early World Cup exit even if they were under Jose Mourinho, according to former coach Philippe Troussier.
In a recent AFP interview, Troussier suggested Japan have "no chance" of reaching the knockout stage after sacking Vahid Halilhodzic in April.
"Even if they play with Mourinho or Arsene Wenger, it would be so difficult for Japan to get to the last 16," said the Frenchman, who steered Japan to the second round of the 2002 World Cup.
Troussier's bleak prediction follows unsettling events in the national team.
HIGH-RISK MOVE
After Halilhodzic was sacked, the Japanese FA replaced him with former technical director Akira Nishino.
The 63-year-old has plenty of experience in the J-League, but at national level has only ever worked with Japan's Under-20 and Under-23 teams before.
With Robert Lewandowski-led Poland and Senegal also to come in the group, Japan need a good start.
"If Poland was the first match it would be different. But the fact that Colombia is the first match and Senegal the second  for me, on paper at least they have no chance," said Troussier.
The high-risk move to install Nishino will be tested in Saransk as the Japanese try to improve on the 4-1 drubbing handed to them by Colombia at the 2014 World Cup when Jackson Martinez scored twice.
Colombia marched into the last 16 and the result sent the winless Japan home after finishing bottom of their group, a record they are desperate to improve on despite the last-minute change of head coach.
"Despite that, I think we will cope," said Japan captain Makoto Hasebe.
"We have three tough opponents. But they are not (defending champions) Germany, so we have a chance and we hope we can go further."
Their form in the pre-World Cup friendlies gives Japanese fans hope. They romped to an impressive 4-2 win last week over Paraguay when midfielder Takashi Inui scored twice, after defeats to Switzerland, Ghana and Ukraine.
Colombia are unbeaten this year after seeing off France 3-2 in March before goalless draws against fellow World Cup contenders Egypt and Australia.  AFP

Even though the Colombo Port had operated as a high-security zone during the 30-year war period, in the near future, it would be opened for the public having considered the prevailing peaceful conditions in the country, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said, while addressing a passing-out ceremony of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) security personnel held yesterday.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority had posted a profit of Rs. 13.2 billion in 2017, which in turn, had created a positive impact on the countrys economy.
Hence, the Colombo Port would be opened for public considering it as public property, Minister Samarasinghe added.
One hundred and fifty security officers were passed out during the ceremony, which was held at the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy. Deputy Ports and Shipping Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigama, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Security Director Major Genaral Gamini Hettiarachchi and several other officials took part in the event.

COPA to present report on all bodies under its probe to House today
The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) will present a report on 837 institutions coming under its probe in Parliament today, COPA Chairman and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.
The report is based on the Auditor Generals observations on annual accounts of public institutions for 2016. The evaluation has been done using five questionnaires prepared by the Committee.
The Chairman said a performance evaluation ceremony based on this report will be held in another two months with the participation of the President, Prime Minister and the Speaker.
He was addressing an awareness programme for Parliamentary Journalists organised by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, at Waters Edge in Battaramulla yesterday morning.
A similar report of all public institutions coming under COPA based on annual reports of 2015 was presented to Parliament on November 13, 2017.
The Chairman said the evaluation of institutions for year 2017 has already begun.
Our aim is to probe and present the reports on the previous year before the end of next year, he said.
Speaking further, Alagiyawanna said that in future all institutions which are subjected to COPA investigation will have to present their cases with regards to any concerns raised within two months. In the COPA Chairmans speech it was revealed that only 160 public institutions have been summoned before COPA during 2010-2015.
Three reports have been submitted during the said period of time. In contrast, during the two years of 2016 to 2018, COPA has investigated into 125 institutes and records six reports. Alagiyawanna said that COPA will make its probes, supervision and follow up process stronger to minimize the mismanagement of public funds. Now there is an opinion built in our society that COPA and COPE exist to fight corruption, catch thieves and apply the law against them.
I am not disassociating the fact that we are responsible to reveal such corruption and bring forth recommendations to put a stop to such acts.
Strict supervision and follow up are important, but we know that we cannot recover the losses we have incurred due to these corruption.
So, what is most important is to make sure that these institutes follow proper finance management. All MPs have an immense responsibility thrust upon them to make sure proper management of public funds is done.
This is one of the main reasons why the general public sent us to Parliament, Alagiyawanna said. Alagyawanna also said that the present COPA has understood that establishing continuous direct connections with the 837 institutions have decreased poor public finance management in them. Summoning the institutions before COPA itself has been a very promising act.

Deep South Tourism yet to pick up - Moshi Perera
Deep South Tourism is yet to take off and its a sleeping giant in the Sri Lankan tourism sector, said General Manager of Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa, Moshi Perera.
He said that with the rapid development in the Hambantota Port and the surrounding area along with proposed extension of the highway from Matara would add more value to Deep South Tourism.
The leasing of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company is opening up new corporate business to the region. The cruise Tourism sector too is picking up and several cruise liners have included the Hambantota Port to its Itinerary.
He however said that there was a new line of business that was picking from the UAE expat market but this has dipped due to Fly Dubai pulling out of the Mattala Airport. There are several star class hotels and they should now try to get-together and promote Charter flights. He said that Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa is now witnessing increase occupancy year on year. We see an increase of occupancy from both local and foreign clientele and the appetite for their Golf Course too is increasing.
The hotel is also offering special bank card promotions to Sri Lankans and this too has a very good response. He said the hotels average occupancy was around 55% last year and this year they expect to pass the 60% mark.
With the Chinese company taking over the management of Hambantota Port the hotel has also witness sharp increase in their conference market and this is expected to continue.
He said that many Sri Lankans are also enrolling for the Shangri-Las hotel loyalty program, Golden Circle where the guests could get additional points and benefits in their hotel in Colombo and all over the world and also have online checking using this PP
Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa, has one of the largest banquets and MICE facilities in the entire South which could accommodate over 1,000 guests. The hotel is also now very popular for Indian weddings.

Our main market is Chinese followed by European and Sri Lankans and guests visiting Colombo hotel also taking and extended holiday to our hotel.
The hotel is one of the first international chain hotels to be set up in Sri Lanka out of Colombo and has 300 rooms with 20 suites. It has three swimming pools with special emphasis for entertainment facilities for children that include water slides, indoor play area, water sports facilities, with Play Gym.
Commenting on their CSR activities he said that they invest on improving standards of several schools in the area and also one of their priorities are to offer employment to youth in the area. We already have 700 staff out of which 45% are from the area.

Dinuk Hettiarachchi
At 41 years of age and around 960 first class wickets under his belt he looked fit enough for many more. Dinuk was short, dark and muscular with energy to spare. He had to play under the shadow of another loyal servant to Sri Lanka Cricket the one and only Rangana Herath. Both were similar in build and bowled slow left arm. While Rangana stole the lime light when the great Muralitharan left, Dinuk had to wait in the wings. He was however never discouraged by being left out of the Test team. Dinuk diligently plied his trade playing for several clubs and now he is just 40 odd wickets away in reaching the milestone of 1000 wickets. Slow left armers for some strange reason seemed to last longer than the other types of spinners, Sir Wilfred Rhodes, Headly Verity, Colin Blyth, Charlie Parker, Johnny Wardle and several others, is it the rhythm of the action with a short run up I leave it to the experts.
Dinuk was born in and around Ananda College and attended Asoka Kanishta primary before entering Ananda College where he was coached by the late great P.W. Perera. Dinuk stated that it was none other than Minister Arjuna Rantunga who was a senior player in the team then, threw the new ball at him first up and asked him to bowl. This was a totally new experience to the young lad; Dinuk pondered whether it was due to his prominent side on action which induced inswing.
It is interesting to note that in Dinuks bag of tricks he had different types of deliveries which were bowled without changing his grip; this he said was by changing his wrist position. Another tool in his armory was the arm rotation speed and him being closer to earth at 5 feet 4 inches he could loop the ball above the eye level of the batsman and it would be awkward for the batsman to follow its path, (schoolboys who intend becoming slow left arm bowlers please note).
In his book, Glances at Perfection, Rajan Bala stated that he knew almost instinctively what Vinoo Mankad, a stocky and powerful man, was the sort who could keep at spin bowling day after day without tiring, would bowl. It is an interesting metaphor to note that Dinuk also looks stocky and dark and he has been wheeling away over after over in all the top class grounds in Sri Lanka and will wait for the day that he would bag his 1000th first class wicket. Already he is third in the list of highest wicket takers behind Muralitharan and Herath.
Dinuks cricket is not only confined to Sri Lanka, he travels to UK, Australia and even to U.S.A. playing in various leagues in those countries.
Dinuk is a prominent figure in the Northern Premier League in England where he is the senior pro at St Annes cricket club U.K. He has made headlines on several occasions on the local papers and here goes:
Hettiarachchi on a title mission by ANDY MOORE ON THE GUARDIAN FRIDAY JULY 16,2010
Dinuk Hettiarachchi believes St Annes can retain their Northern Premier League title- and that would be an even greater achievement than last year. There even greater pressure on the clubs professional to lead a less experienced bowling attack in his second season at Vernon Road and so far the Sri Lankan has risen to the challenge in supreme style. The left arm spinner is again the leagues top scorer, passing 50 with his 6-32 in the 10 wicket thrashing of Chorley last week end, and looks set to top last seasons bench mark of 87.
Dinuk keeps St Annes on top -The Guardian Monday may 30th, 2011.
St Annes restricted the visitors to 138-8 in 50 overs, pro Dinuk Hettiarachchi wheeling his way through 25 overs for 5-37.
(Due to space restrictions I can only do the headlines of these.)

Reason for Dinuks Sunny disposition
By ANDY MOORE THE GAZZETTE JULY 1,2011
Dinuk was termed as the high profile senior player at his club St Annes and I was given the opportunity to peep into the other side of the senior pros life, over the weekends. Dinuk had to represent his club and during the other days he was involved with coaching duties of several schools in and around Blackpool which is situated in the county Lancashire. Dinuk said the perks he had was as follows a 3 bedroomed fully furnished house with the best of food stuff at his disposal and a brand new Audi with only 50 km on the clock. Moneywise Dinuk said that during his latest stint with St Annes he was paid around Rs. 8 lakhs a month net for a six months stint. This was quite a lot of jam for a guy who persevered and Dinuk deserved every bit of it, apart from this he travels to other parts of the globe plying his trade.
Dinuk is of the view that there were a lot of guys who missed the bus and hence not given the opportunity unless you bum sucked the ones who mattered and he stressed quite emphatically that the cricket drain is due to that fact. Dinuk stated that players in the caliber of Malinga Bandara, Michael van Dort, Kaushal Weeraratne are residing in the district of Dandenong, a suburb in Melbourne and are PR holders involved in cricket in their adopted country and they are gone for good when there was a lot left in them, concluded Dinuk.

World Cup winning cricket captain and presently Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga expressed his gratitude to Roshan Mahanama, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Muthiah Muralitharan for taking a wise decision, not to walk into a trap and fall to gamblers.
The past legends declined the invitation extended by Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha to join SLC in the capacity as consultants to uplift Sri Lanka cricket.
Responding to queries posed by journalists Ranatuga stated that he condemned using senior cricketers to fulfill needs of the administration. He requested the Minister of Sports to establish a new procedure to save cricket.
The current cricket administration is trying to sell the names of senior cricketers for their sake. Even Ex- Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara appointed a committee, but nothing happened. Now, they are trying to put forward a few names of senior cricketers to use them. Im happy these former cricketers did not fall for the trap. All cricketers have to stand together against the cricket administration that has ruined our cricket, Ranatunga continued.
The womens cricket team was defeated by Thailand. Our cricket team had to face difficulties during the series with South Africa. If the government has not learnt a lesson by these defeats ours will be the only government which has ruined cricket in Sri Lanka. I regret to state that even I have fulfilled my responsibilities as a minister, but the President and the Prime Minister have failed to take proper action yet.
We barely upgraded cricket and another group has degraded cricket. I saw in the newspapers that 58 sports unions are urging the Sports Minister to hold the cricket elections. These are the people who have used money. We should investigate them. People should not criticize our cricketers, but at these people who have ruined our cricket, Minister Ranatunga further added.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
Evolve or go extinct
Steven Spielbergs Jurassic Park was a trendsetter. It spawned a large number of Hollywood films based on dinosaurs and creatures resembling enormous beasts like Godzilla and King Kong.
Colin Trevorrows science fiction adventure series Jurassic World too is a result of this trend. Jurassic World portrays how a few dinosaurs have managed to survive in a remote island and then co-exist with human beings in the present world.
Isla Nublar is abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. When the volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs. They find Blue, Owens lead raptor who was missing in the wild. However a group of men disguised as rescuers are on a money making mission to sell these beasts for combat purposes. They also design a new dinosaur species which becomes a threat to human existence.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a good example of how special effects have come a long way since Spielbergs time. A more realistic portrayal of the ever popular and terrifying T Rex is brought forth through J A Bayona work. New talent - Justice Smith as Franklin and Daniella Pineda as Zia - blended with the old - Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard reprising their roles as Owen and Claire, enthrall the viewers. The actors play their parts well and keep the audience at the edge of their seats in excitement. But the real let down is the originality of the tale. You get a lot of been there done that moments in the film.
Logic too lets the movie down. When Claire and Owen set off to save a few of these endangered species, one wonders if all the trouble is worth it. It is clear that to let dinosaurs roam freely amid man in the modern world will create chaos. Letting them fall into the wrong hands - Rafe Spalls in this case- is even more dangerous. When the last remaining dinosaurs are let loose into the world it is clear that the team intends it to lead to another movie. However one cannot help hoping that the next movie needs to possess some uniqueness rather than sell it out as old wine in new bottle.

Famous five
Indias Salman Rushdie made it twice. He was chosen the best Booker recipient at the 25th and the 40th anniversary of Englands Man Booker Prize. At the Man Booker Prize Golden Jubilee, however, Rushdie lost the competition. Instead, V S Naipaul stepped into the shortlist scaffold.
Englands Man Booker Prize committee has made it a custom to choose the best of its winners  perhaps lest they recede into a distant memory. The 25th, 40th and now the 50th anniversary is an offshoot of that custom.
Whats so special about Englands golden man booker prize shortlist Five decades have elapsed since the literary award, well regarded as the most sophisticated prize in the English-speaking world. Several plans of global scale are afoot to celebrate the anniversary. Many literary festivals will be there to look forward to.
Yet what matters above all is that the semi-centennial event has a Sri Lankan connection.
Michael Ondaatje, whose The English Patient won the Booker Prize in 1992, has been shortlisted for the Golden Booker Prize shortlist along with four more. Ondaatjes book has been chosen out of all the Booker prize winners of the 1990 decade. The Sri Lankan-born Canadian novelist founded the Gratiaen Prize with the money he received as the Booker Prize for The English Patient.
Adjudged Golden Five, the chosen books include In a Free State by V S Naipaul, Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively, The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje, Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel and Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders. Like the 25th and the 40th anniversary, this will be a fight in close range.
The winner will be announced at the Southbank Centre, London, on July 8. If Ondaatje chances upon the covetous prize, it will mark the end of Indian dominance in English literature. The chosen book can be deemed universal that withstands five decades. The single best work of fiction published since the awards inception in 1969  thats no simple deal.
The fifty-one winners from the half-century history of the prize will all now be in contention for the Golden Man Booker, whose authors include the likes of George Saunders, Michael Ondaatje, Ian McEwan and Margaret Atwood. These books will be judged by a panel of five judges who will each read selections from one decade. The judges include Hollie McNish (2010s), Simon Mayo (2000s), Kamila Shamsie (1990s), Lemn Sissay (1980s) and Robert McCrum (1970s).
The list is now open to the public on an online voting platform. The voting will be on till June 25. The overall winner will be crowned the recipient of the Golden Man Booker prize at the Man Booker Festival on July 8. The festival will run from July 6 to 8 and will take place in Londons Southbank Centre.
A list of the numerous literary festival partnerships and collaborations, as well as details on the full Man Booker Festival program, will be made available in the coming weeks.

The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje
Set in 1945, The English Patient explores the lives of four very disparate war torn people, a young woman and three men, who take refuge in a damaged villa north of Florence as the war retreats around them. In an upstairs room lies the badly burned English patient, alive but unable to move. His extraordinary adventures and turbulent love affair in the North African desert before the war provide the focus around which the vivid tales of his companions revolve. His very presence will forever change the destiny of those around him.
Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders
On 22 February 1862, two days after his death, Willie Lincoln is laid to rest in a marble crypt in a Georgetown cemetery. That very night, shattered by grief, his father Abraham arrives at the cemetery, alone, under cover of darkness.
Over the course of that evening, Abraham Lincoln paces the graveyard unsettled by the death of his beloved boy, and by the grim shadow of a war that feels as though it is without end. Meanwhile Willie is trapped in a state of limbo between the dead and the living  drawn to his father with whom he can no longer communicate, existing in a ghostly world populated by the recently passed and the long dead.
Unfolding in the graveyard over a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a thrilling exploration of death, grief and the deeper meaning and possibilities of life.
Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel
England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe oppose him. The quest for the petulant kings freedom destroys his advisor, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum and a deadlock. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a bully and a charmer, Cromwell has broken all the rules of a rigid society in his rise to power, and is prepared to break some more. Rising from the ashes of personal disaster - the loss of his young family and of Wolsley, his beloved patron - he picks his way deftly through a court where man is wolf to man. Pitting himself against parliament, the political establishment and the papacy, he is prepared to reshape England to his own and Henrys desires.
From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.
Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively
Claudia Hampton, a beautiful, famous writer, lies dying in hospital. But, as the nurses tend to her with quiet condescension, she is plotting her greatest work: a history of the world ... and in the process, my own. Gradually she re-creates the rich mosaic of her life and times, conjuring up those she has known. There is Gordon, her adored brother; Jasper, the charming, untrustworthy lover and father of Lisa, her cool, conventional daughter; and Tom, her one great love, both found and lost in wartime Egypt.
In a Free State by V.S. Naipaul
In the beginning it is just a car trip through Africa. Two English people  Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious compound wife  are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital.
But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amins Uganda. And the farther Naipauls protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims.
Judges of five decades: Robert McCrum (1970s), Lemn Sissay (1980s), Kamila Shamsie (1990s),Simon Mayo (2000s) and Hollie McNish (2010s).

First Ladies concerned over Trump separation policy
US: Former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country.
Writing in the Washington Post, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking.
Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trumps zero-tolerance immigration policy.
Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern.
Mrs Trump hates to see children separated from their families, her spokeswoman said.
She repeated her husbands call for both sides to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trumps attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped.
In a recent six-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings.
Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry.
As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents. Critics have condemned the action as unprecedented.
Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush, launched an outspoken attack on the policy.
This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart, she wrote in the Washington Post.
Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.
These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history, she added.
Earlier, Mrs Trump said she hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.
We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart, her statement added.
However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents was a policy announced by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month.
The significant change, analysts say, is the justice departments decision to criminally prosecute parents for a first-time border crossing offence. The children, however, are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together.

FR petition filed by Gnanasara Thera fixed for support
The Supreme Court yesterday fixed for support, a Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera who sought a declaration that the order given by the Homagama Magistrate to keep him in remand custody in 2016 is unlawful and is a violation of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the constitution. Accordingly, the petition will be taken up for support on July 2.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasad Dep and Justice Murdu Fernando.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing on behalf of Ven.Gnanasara Thera informed court that his client had been sentenced over this incident and already filed an appeal against the conversation. Mr.Silva further informed he has not received instructions from Gnanasara Thera regarding future action over the petition.
In his petition, Gnanasara Thera maintained that the statement made by him when getting ready to leave Court on January 25, 2016 addressing complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda can in no way amount to be a threat made to injure a person or her reputation, nor can it be said that the statement so made would cause alarm to a person.
The petitioner stated that on a complaint by Sandhya Ekneligoda on January 25, 2016 to Homagama police, the first respondent, OIC Miscellaneous Complaints had arrested him and produced him before the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 26.
Ven.Gnanasara Thera stated that complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda after attending the Magistrates Court was getting ready to leave Court when he told her Thoge miniha LTTE karayek uu malane, tho hingakapiya.
The petitioner stated that Police alleged that he had committed an offence under Section 486 of the Penal Code.
He said upon being produced, the petitioner was remanded by the Magistrate until February 9 and then he was remanded till February 10, 2016.
He stated that Police further alleged that he had committed offences under section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act of No.4 of 20.
He said he was ordered to be further remanded till February 23. The petitioner maintained that there was no justifiable reason for the Magistrate to make an order of remand with the statement so made in as much as such statement does not constitute an offence under section 483 of the Penal Code and Section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera.

Heino a hundred hero again as Kent reach Lords final
LONDON, Sunday: South Africa batsman Heino Kuhns superb run in limited-overs cricket continued as his fourth century in five One-Day Cup innings helped guide Kent into their first Lords final for a decade as they just did enough to beat Worcestershire by two wickets on Sunday.
Kuhn, all of whose four Test appearances for the Proteas came during last years tour of England, followed on from where he left off with hundreds against Surrey, Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire by making 127 in Sundays semi-final as Kent closed in on a victory target of 307.
The 34-year-old Kuhn was dismissed with visitors Kent still requiring four from three balls but the very next delivery saw Harry Podmore hit teenage seamer Pat Brown for a boundary to seal a hard-fought win.
It had seemed highly unlikely there would be any last-over drama at all in Worcester when the hosts collapsed to 48 for four.
But wicketkeeper Ben Cox, widely regarded as one of the best glovemen in county cricket, gave the New Road faithful plenty to cheer with the bat in an impressive innings of 122 not out.
He received good support from Brett DOliveira -- whose South Africa-born grandfather Basil, an England batsman, and father Damian, both played for Worcestershire -- who made 78 during a stand worth 140 runs.
Kent too suffered a top-order collapse, slumping to 31 for three.
But Kuhn, playing for Kent under the Kolpak ruling in a move which effectively saw him call time on his South Africa career, reached his latest hundred off 99 balls, including seven fours and a six.
Kent needed 11 off the last over and Kuhns straight six off Brown took them to the brink of victory before, deceived by a slower delivery, he was caught at midwicket off the very next ball.
Kuhn feared the game was lost, but Podmore made sure he ended up on the winning side.
To get a century in a semi-final makes it one of the better ones, Kuhn said afterwards.
I was heartbroken when I got out. Its just my job to take us through and I was in tears, but luckily the boys pulled it through, he added.
Kent will play the winners of Mondays second semi-final between Hampshire and Yorkshire in the June 30 final at Lords.

Home should be secure place for child - President
The home should be transformed into the safest and most secure place for the child generation which formed the life blood of the nation, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation delivering the inaugural address at a district conference under the Child Protection National Programme at the Killinochchi Madya Maha Vidyalaya grounds as the Chief Guest yesterday.
The President who said that children should be safeguarded at all costs added that ensuring a safe and secure life for children was the responsibility of everyone.
He said children in Sri Lanka too faced various problems like their counterparts in other countries and it was to pay special attention to childrens problems and bring urgent solutions to them that he launched the Child Protection National Programme.
The President said children more often encountered problems at the home front due to economic difficulties, liquor and drug addiction of parents and parents lack of proper understanding about their offspring and other reasons.
There were rare occasions of children being abused by parents. This was a practice unacceptable in a disciplined society, the President said.
The Child Protection National Programme is implemented countrywide in five sectors of preventing child abuse, ensuring their security, health nutrition and welfare, personality development and uplifting education and life skills.
The inaugural ceremony of this programme was held in September 2017 at the Digana Provincial Sports Complex in Kandy, at which the 2017-2019 National Plan was unveiled.
During the Killinochchi District Conference yesterday, several joint programmes were implemented by the Presidential Secretariat, Women and Childrens Affairs Ministry and several other ministries and institutions.
The President also participated in several other connected programmes on this day including the opening of a new playground at the Kanagapuram Vidyalaya, distribution of funds towards modernisation of childrens homes and detention homes, handing over of funds for the development of access roads and other facilities at selected childrens homes and detention homes.
The President also distributed domestic water filters among 1,000 families facing acute shortage of pure drinking water, books, furniture and sports goods among selected pre-schools and cash benefits among families with children leading unprotected lives. Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, Womens and Childrens Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara, Deputy Ministers Cader Masthan and Angajan Ramanathan, Northern Province Governor C. V. Vigneswaran, Killinochchi Government Agent Sunderam Arumainadan and Additional Secretary to the President Rohana Dissanayake were also present on the occasion.

India moves ahead with tariffs on US goods
India is moving forward with plans to hit back at the United States over trade.
The country has proposed hiking tariffs on 30 US products in order to recoup trade penalties worth $241 million, according to a revised World Trade Organization filing.
India said the retaliatory barriers are equal in value to US tariffs on steel and aluminum from India that were imposed by the Trump administration in March.
The new tariffs target products including American almonds, walnuts and apples, as well as some chemical and metal products.
India said its tariff on large American motorcycles, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly spoken out against, will also be hiked.
The latest filing with the World Trade Organization submitted by New Delhi is dated June 14. It updates an initial complaint about US metals tariffs made on May 18.
India said last month that its proposed tariffs on US goods would take effect by June 21.
The Indian government is also leaving the door open for further tariff hikes, it said in its latest notification.
India reserves the right to adjust the specific products for which [tariffs would apply], and its right to adjust the additional rate of duty imposed on such products, it said.
Exports of steel and aluminum from India to the United States are worth around $1.2 billion, according to the World Trade Organization filing.
The United States sold goods and services worth $42 billion to India in 2016, according to the US Trade Representative. That translated into a US trade deficit with India of $30.8 billion.
Tensions between the United States and many of its biggest trading partners have spiked dramatically in recent weeks. Three of Americas biggest trade partners -- the European Union, Mexico and Canada -- are retaliating after the Trump administration allowed exemptions that had spared them from tariffs on steel and aluminum to expire.
And on Friday, China accused the United States of firing the first shot in a trade war when the White House said that it would impose tariffs of 25% on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Beijing said it would respond in kind to the US tariffs. The moves raise the specter of an intensifying trade war, which would hurt consumers, companies and the global economy.
Trade war
President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on imports including steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels. Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union are retaliating.
Experts say the economic impact from the new tariffs has so far been limited, but the pain could increase dramatically if a cycle of retaliation takes hold.
A worldwide escalation of tariffs ... could lead to cumulative trade losses equivalent to those experienced during the global financial crisis, the World Bank warned this week in a report.
If political leaders follow through on their most dramatic trade threats, including US tariffs of 25% on $100 billion in Chinese goods, Barclays estimates that a full percentage point could be knocked off global economic growth next year. The World Bank is currently forecasting 3% expansion for 2019.
Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg bank, said that geopolitical risk is now at its highest level since the early 2000s.
The current global upswing depends on continued global trade growth  the two are closely linked, he said in a research note. A threat to trade, and hence economic growth, is a threat to markets.
Senior policymakers are calling on political leaders to reduce tensions, and quickly.
Protectionism is rising everywhere ... and its important at the international level that this is addressed, Swiss National Bank Governor Thomas Jordan told CNNMoney Switzerland on Thursday. NMoney \

ITAK stronger than before: Senathiraja
The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) had been re-organised under nine major lines as a strong political party which could face any future election in a successful manner, ITAK Party Leader Mavai Senathiraja said.
He said the re-organisation was effected at a conference held at Mullaitivu on June 16, which was attended by all members of the partys central committee, including Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader Parliamentarian R. Sampanthan.
He said the great political setback suffered by the TNA at the recent local government election was discussed at length and it was decided that the setback was not due to any fault on the part of the party, but due to the nature of the electoral system itself.
He said that during the discussions, an effective plan for development work to be undertaken with decentralised budget funds of parliamentarians, was also finalised laying employers on funds received by members elected to local government institutions as well.
ITAK, as the main component of the TNA, appealed to all Tamil parties which left the TNA to regroup under the TNA banner once again for the welfare of the Tamil community.
Asked whether a decision was taken to field C. V. Vigneswaran as the chief ministerial candidate once again at the future Provincial Council Elections, Senathiraja said it was not so. The decision not to field Vigneswaran as the TNA candidate for the chief minister post once again, was taken three months ago at the central committee meeting of the party. He said no decision was taken to field either himself or M. A. Sumanthiran as a candidate.
Senathiraja further said there were many suitable candidates in the party, adding that to select a person prematurely, was politically inexpedient.

In the candid memoir, 64 year-old Chan, one of the most recognisable Asian faces in Hollywood, will reflects on his early life including his childhood and years at the China Drama Academy, his big breaks (and setbacks) in Hong Kong and in the West, his numerous brushes with death both on-and-off film sets, and his life as a husband and father.
"I hope those who read my stories can come to learn that Jackie Chan is, after all, an ordinary man who had the courage and determination to do extraordinary things," Chan said in a press release from the publishing house. Chan, whose filmography ranges from two series, films 'Shanghai Noon' and the 'Karate Kid', also discusses about his youth that he spent accumulating possessions and how he has turned his attention toward charity in more recent years, becoming a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. The memoir is scheduled for publication in November this year. PTI

Keys to reshape music  industry  with new initiative
Alicia Keys has announced her involvement in music industry initiative She Is The Music, which is designed to empower female talent.
The No One singer shared the news on June 13 evening during her acceptance speech for the Icon Songwriter award at the National Music Publishers Associations annual meeting in New York.
As well as thanking family members, collaborators and executives closest to her, the 37-year-old confirmed she is teaming up with a host of powerful females to champion musical talent and confront the inequalities currently plaguing the industry. Ive joined forces with a group of really powerful female executives, songwriters, artists, engineers, producers and publishers to help reshape the industry that we all love by creating real opportunities and a pipeline of talent for other women, she told the audience at The Edison Ballroom in Times Square.
We want to create a model for change that affects women across all industries. We deserve the utmost respect, and so many of these women across industries are telling our culture that time is up on double standards, and its over for pay inequity and colleagues who are, at best, disrespectful and at the worst, unsafe.
The singer-songwriter remained vague over specifics of the movement, telling Variety: Youll be hearing about it and We just want it to permeate right now when asked what it might entail.
But the Girl on Fire hitmaker spoke at length during her speech on its creation, labelling 2018 as the beginning of so many things.
She cited statistics from a study of Grammy Award nominees conducted by the University of Southern California, which found that of almost 3,000 pop songwriters credited last year, only 12 per cent were female.
We have to do something because the statistics are brutal, she urged, adding: Our world is 50-50, and its time for our industry to reflect that. Music News

KPMG workshop on Challenges from SLFRS on new Inland Revenue Act on June 21
KPMG will conduct a workshop enlightening the challenges emerging from SLFRS on the new Inland Revenue Act on June 21 at the Movenpick Hotel Colombo from 9 am to 12.15 pm.
The tax law is intertwined with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to such a degree under the new Inland Revenue Act (IRA), in order to grasp concepts of taxation, its influence stemming from GAAP must be comprehended.
Its a fair statement to make that the tax implications stemming from the new Inland Revenue Act are much more closely interwoven with Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) compared to the previous income tax regime.
One may observe concepts and definitions in the new IRA influenced by IMF Model Act are based on international practices, hence much aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Simple example would be the definition of Finance Lease contained in the new IRA. The phrase bears a strong resemblance to the definition in the SLFRS 16. On the other hand there are instances where the concepts / definitions in the new IRA which deviate from that of the Accounting Standards too which gives rise to complications in computing the income tax liability.
A topic that attracted much debate in the current context is the classification of assets for the purpose of new IRA.
The Act restricts the definition of Capital Assets used in business & Investment Assets to specific categories identified in the Act whilst defining Depreciable Assets and Trading Stock too whilst defining Assets in an inclusive manner very widely. On the other hand Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 refers to Property, Plant, Equipment and Investment Properties dealt in LKAS 40. Deferred Tax addressed in LKAS 12 derive impact from classification of assets.
The presentations will be conducted by Suresh R.I. Perera and Shameel Nayeem.
In this very current and pertinent subject matter the speakers will educate the audience on Capital Assets, Investment Assets and Deferred Tax thereon, besides the Tax treatment on gains or losses recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income Statement (OCI). Moreover, they will be explaining the intricacies in Leases, Foreign Currency Transactions and Financial Instruments.
The tax complexities embedded in the new Inland Revenue Act has been enhanced due to the impact from the SLFRS, and there is a great nexus between calculation of income tax liability and the Accounting Standards compared to previous income tax regimes. Shameel Nayeem, Partner, KPMG is an Associate Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, an Associate Member of the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants and an Associate Member of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka. He had served as a Partner of KPMG in the Maldives.
Suresh Perera is a multidisciplinary professional qualified in law & accountancy. He is a member of the CIMA Middle East, South Asia & North Africa Regional Board, Deputy Treasurer of Organization of Professional Associations, Chairman of the Tax Committee of the Bar Association.
This interactive and educative workshop will shed light on the finer points and enlighten the nexus between the New Inland Revenue Act and the SLFRS.

Lewandowski v Sane as Poland brace for Senegal test
MOSCOW, Sunday - Robert Lewandowski and Sadio Mane face off in a mouthwatering World Cup shootout between two of European football's most lethal forwards on Tuesday as Poland take on Senegal.
Bayern Munich's Lewandowski finished the season as the Bundesliga's top scorer for the third time with 29 goals, netting 41 times in all competitions.
Mane scored 10 Champions League goals -- including one in the final in Kiev -- forming a devastating strike force at Liverpool alongside Egypt's Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino of Brazil.
"I believe Sadio can be one of the stars of the tournament," said former Senegal player El Hadji Diouf, who played in Japan and South Korea in 2002, the only previous time the country has reached the World Cup.
Poland go into the Group H match at Moscow's Spartak Stadium as favourites and are expected to emerge from a section also featuring Colombia and Japan.
Ranked eighth in the world, it is Poland's eighth appearance at the World Cup, with coach Adam Nawalka's side desperate to improve on the third-place finishes in 1974 and 1982.
Lewandowski admits he has a point to prove after a disappointing Euro 2016, when he scored only once as Poland exited at the quarter-finals stage.
The 29-year-old is finally reproducing his prolific club form at international level, setting a European qualification record with 16 goals in 10 matches to secure Poland's place in Russia.
Lewandowski said he was entering the tournament in a different frame of mind from 2016.
"I'm sure that training will be better now and that I'll be fresh and dynamic at the right time," he said. "I started preparing for the World Cup much earlier." AFP

Loan scheme for homestay operators to upgrade facilities
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) announced the launch of a loan scheme for home stay operators across the country, in line with the Budget proposals for this year.
All categories in the homestay sector namely homestays, homestay bungalows and rented apartments will be eligible for the loan scheme launched under the guidance of the Treasury and the SLTDA.
The loans schemes, the SLTDA said, will help homestay operators upgrade their properties to attract more tourists. Developing the homestay sector is a key priority identified in the three-year Tourism Strategic Plan (TSP) adopted by the Sri Lankan government.
Applicants can obtain their forms from any branch of Peoples Bank or Bank of Ceylon and the banks will send the applications to the SLTDA which will work with the Treasury to facilitate the loans . The applicant can receive money from the nearest State bank, SLTDA Director General Upali Ratnayake said.
He said the homestay operators receiving the loans are required to register themselves with the SLTDA before commencing commercial operations after upgrading.
Prior registration is not required to apply for these loans. Operators can register their properties before commencing commercial operations after renovation and we have also introduced concessionary registration fees to facilitate this process, Ratnayake said.
He also added that the interest of the loans will be subsidized by the government.
They will be issued at 14% interest. But, 6% of the interest will be paid by the Treasury, the Director General said.
Any homestay operator can obtain more information on the loan scheme from our hotline 2426800 ex.250. We believe the homestay sector will play a key role in taking the tourism sector to its strategic goals by 2020. Therefore, we encourage all homestay operators in Sri Lanka to make use of the loan scheme and upgrade their standards, Ratnayake added.

Speaker reveals to journalists
Losses at Govt. bodies sore to Rs. 50 bn
The losses incurred by government institutions last year is over Rs. 50 billion, Speaker of the House Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
He pointed out that these funds could have been used for the welfare of the public or economic development, if proper public finance management was carried out by these institutes.
Speaker Jayasuriya said these losses should draw more public attention. Instead we see reports of 118 MPs who are alleged to have been involved in the Treasury Bond issue, of which neither me nor the Presidential Secretary is aware of, he said.
The Speaker was addressing an awareness programme for Parliamentary Journalists organised by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, at Waters Edge in Battharamulla yesterday morning.
He also observed that a survey in 2014 revealed that 40% of all government department expenses is wasted.
He also pointed out that the Committee on Public Accounts and Committee of Public Enterprises are now able to summon the media at any time to update the public on investigations that they are conducting. Speaking on the strict supervision maintained by the present government over public fund management, Speaker Jayasuriya said that public funds cannot be used according to others whims and fancies like in the previous times.
Now nobody can spend public money as they wish for whatever they want. We are striving hard for transparency in utilising public funds. The government institutions have to undergo an internal audit every three months now, unlike in the previous times. The government departments must submit information required by COPA on time, otherwise the responsible authorities will be regarded as not qualified to handle these subjects.
It has been revealed that continuous COPA probes have increased responses from the public institutes by 80%, the Speaker also said.
Speaking on the COPA reports that will be taken up for debate in Parliament today, Speaker Jayasuriya said that extremely important information on public fund mismanagement and persons involved will be revealed. Speaking of the COPA procedure, the Speaker said previously there was a process where the Committee chases the thieves whereas now, it does not have to do so.
From the new system adopted by the COPA, the shortcomings, mismanagements and wrongdoings will come in real time, he pointed out.

Lukaku scores twice as Belgium prove too strong for Panama
Sochi, Monday: Romelu Lukaku netted a brace as a much-improved second-half performance gave Belgium an ultimately comfortable 3-0 victory over tournament debutants Panama in their World Cup opener in Sochi on Monday.
A moment of inspiration from Dries Mertens set the Belgians on their way two minutes after the break, his volley breaking the deadlock after a rather flat first period.
Lukaku then converted assists from Kevin De Bruyne and captain Eden Hazard to secure victory in this Group G clash, with the Central Americans succumbing to a defeat in their first-ever match at the finals.
Group rivals England will look to respond to Belgiums win when they kick off their campaign against Tunisia but this was not entirely the statement of intent that Roberto Martinezs side would have been hoping to make.
A victory will do for a team who are, on paper at least, good enough to go far in Russia, especially after heavyweights Germany, Brazil and Argentina all slipped up over the weekend.
Belgium are now unbeaten in 20 matches, although the nature of the first-half performance against weak opposition showed that Martinezs men still have significant progress to make if they are to improve on quarter-final appearances at the last two major tournaments.
To be fair to Martinez, the Spaniard had warned on the eve of this game that his side would not have it easy. The Central Americans lined up with a team of journeymen featuring five thirty-somethings. Jaime Penedo in goal is 36, while Blas Perez up front is 37. But while the Belgians had the younger, talented players, other factors played in Panamas favour.
The heat and humidity on Russias Black Sea coast was one, as was the fact their supporters greatly outnumbered those following the Belgians.
The locals at the Fisht Stadium got behind the outsiders too, and they were given encouragement as Hernan Dario Gomezs side competed well in the first period. Hazard pulled the strings when he could, although the Chelsea star was denied by Penedo in the 38th minute, having earlier found the side-netting when a slack back-pass from opposing captain Roman Torres gifted him the chance.
At the other end, Panama tried to expose Belgiums potential weaknesses at full-back. However, they struggled to score goals in qualifying and rarely looked capable of beating Thibaut Courtois.
Belgium just needed a spark from somewhere, and they got it from Mertens in the 47th minute.
The Napoli mans cross looking for Lukaku was headed out by Torres and on by Fidel Escobar. But the ball dropped perfectly back to Mertens, whose volley from the right side of the box arced into the far corner. AFP

Mercantile Investments posts Rs 514 mn PAT
Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC displayed a strong financial performance posting impressive profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2018.
Based on the recently published annual report of the Company, pre-tax profits and post-tax profits stood note-worthily up at Rs. 879 million and Rs. 514 million respectively, reflecting 180.2% and 154.4% astounding growth rates compared to the last years moderate performance. Amid the industry slowdown, MI sustained steady core business revenue growth of 24%, enjoying improved core margins on the diverse lending product mix offered whilst efficiently managing the funding cost.
In keeping to the corporate sustainable growth strategy, total assets advanced to the Rs 40 billion mark, up by 7.6%. The vibrant credit products offered to the market enabled the Company to grow the loan book by 11.5% and to supersede the challenging business conditions and the constraints witnessed in the vehicle sales industry. The growth was driven by both the term based lending and the traditional lease financing which recorded 28% and 8% growths respectively for the financial year. With a 51% portfolio increase, micro finance lending played a key role in boosting yields and was a catalyst in self-empowering women to play a wider role in the economy.
Stemming from the previous year, few large accounts though adequately collateral backed continued to impact the asset quality, with the Non-Performing Lending Ratio (NPL) moving up to 7.58%. However, through close recovery monitoring, debt restructuring and recovery actions, impairment charges was curtailed and brought down by 32% compared to previous period.

Mexico quakes with joy over World Cup upset win
MEXICO CITY, Sunday - Thousands of jubilant Mexico supporters partied in the streets of the capital Sunday after their team's shock 1-0 victory over World Cup holders Germany -- singing, dancing, blaring car horns and cheering El Tri.
The earth literally moved in quake-prone Mexico City when Hirving "Chucky" Lozano smashed home the game-winning goal in the 35th minute at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium -- a football "earthquake of joy."
Seismologists said that they had detected an "artificial" rumbling, possibly caused by "widespread jumping" when the goal was scored.
Fans crammed into the Zocalo, the city's main square, to celebrate.
"What happened today was an earthquake of joy for us -- just imagine, we beat the world champions!" said Laura Villegas, a 45-year-old merchant who downed her beer with tequila in one gulp.
"What happened hey, what happened hey, to the Germany that was going to beat us today" the crowd chanted.
President Enrique Pena Nieto joined the party, saying on Twitter: "Confirmed: Mexico competes and wins against the best in the world, Congratulations to @miseleccionmx! Great match!"
Victory rallies erupted in other major cities such as Guadalajara, Toluca, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez.
'LOZANO FOR PRESIDENT'
Throughout the capital, the streets filled with exhilarated fans, on foot, bicycles, motorbikes or in cars. Some blasted their car stereos, while others shrieked in glee.
Amid the cacophonous bustle, a veteran violinist played the traditional tune "Cielito Lindo" -- roughly translated as "Lovely Sweet One."
The victory was a heart-stopping one, but "a small goal is still a goal," said the musician, while fans left coins in his instrument case. One female fan, a flag in her hand and the national colors painted on her cheeks, screamed: "We are an Aztec warrior force!"
"Lozano for president, Lozano for president!" fans cheered -- not forgetting that the country will hold elections to choose a new leader on July 1. Ana Maria Contreras, a primary school teacher, came with her children and even dogs decked out in El Tri's signature green jerseys to join the festivities.
"We have shown that we can compete with any power. And I hope that whoever wins as president also knows how to lead us to victory," she said.  AFP

Ministry to investigate moon-sighting quandary
Muslim Religious Affairs and Postal Services Minister M. H. A. Haleem yesterday said the ministry would conduct an investigation into the confusion over the moon-sighting for the Ramazan festival this year.
The Moon-Sighting Committee, which consists of representatives from the All-Ceylon Jamaithul Ulemma and the Colombo Grand Mosque, are entrusted with the duty to declare the start and end of the Ramazan period every year. Ramazan is the ninth month of the lunar (Islamic) calendar and begins when the new moon is sighted. It ends after 29 to 30 days, with the sighting once again of the new moon.
This year, while Muslims around the world began their fast on May 17, the Moon-Sighting Committee in Sri Lanka declared that the moon had not been sighted locally and that the Muslims in the island would start their fast on May 18.
On June 14, a day before the calendar date for the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr, however, confusion reigned as many had reported to have seen the crescent moon, but the Moon-Sighting Committee had refused to declare the next day to be the festival. This confusion meant that certain devotees would have celebrated on Friday (15), while others celebrated on Saturday (16).
I will be summoning the current Moon-Sighting Committee to investigate what had happened and thereafter, we will look into whether we need a new committee,  the minister said.
He added that they would look into the possibility of adding other members, including scientists and professionals into the committee, to make it more representative of the community. In the meantime, petitions had been submitted to the minister requesting that he resolve the issue by forming a better-informed committee to sight the moon every year, in order to clear up any future confusions.

Money laundering case against Namal, five others fixed for July 10
The case filed against Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others under the Money Laundering Act was yesterday postponed for July 10 by Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon.
The case was postponed since Sujani Bogollagama, one of accused in the case, was not present in court.
The court was informed through the defence counsel that Bogollagama was not present in court since her child is being treated at a hospital for dengue fever.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the six accused for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited.
Four of the accused, Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd, were present in court when the case was taken up before the Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused, Indika Karunajeewa, was not present in Court, but represented by attorneys.
On a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed with the trial in absentia of the second and sixth accused in the case in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case. The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe, who alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited, while being an MP, from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.

Must-have lip shades
With a plethora of lip shades available in the market, there are a few hues like coral, red and purple that should definitely find a place in your beauty bag.
Reena Chhabra, CEO at Nykaa Beauty, and Bhavya Chawla, chief stylist at Voonik, have listed a few shades that you must have:
Nude: With a range of nude shades available in the market, choose the right shade for your skin tone, otherwise it can make you look pale. It can be combined with red, pink, orange to give you the right shade of that colour, which is most suitable for your skin tone, making you look stunning.
Pink: The colour doesnt only amplify the beauty of lips, but it also goes well with almost any kind of eye make-up. Decide on a lighter shade of pink for an understated look or go for a bright pink shade to flaunt your vibrant self.
Corals: Use the shade to complement any eye look, or pair it with matching blush and shadow for a monochromatic effect. Coral lips go well with a little darker or tanned skin. Too dark a shade could be a bit intimidating, but a burnt shade works well for the Indian skin tone.
Red: If you have a bold personality, then red is an important shade in your make-up kit. It looks good on all skin tones, depending upon the hue.

National Export Strategy for Cabinet endorsement
The National Export Strategy (NES) is ready for Cabinet endorsement, the Export Development Board in a communiqu said.
The timeframe for implementation of the NES is from 2018-2022 and it aims at increasing Sri Lankas export revenue to USD $28 billion by 2022.
As part of efforts to ensure a smooth transition from design of NES to its implementation, lead implementers have been closely consulted concerning implementation modalities of the NES. More than 700 public and private sector stakeholders participated in designing and formulating the NES and now it is ready for Cabinet endorsement. 70 public and private institutions identified to carry out NES implementation have reviewed its operational plans &activities and confirmed their commitment to integrate these interventions in their respective work plans. The approval of NES priorities by national implementing agencies pave the way for the NES to be submitted to cabinet for endorsement. The NES provides a coherent roadmap to coordinate actions between multiple institutions and agencies across Sri Lanka.
The NES consultative process builds widespread national consensus for moving towards successful implementation. Efficient coordination between the public and private sectors has built strong momentum for the progress of the NES. The strength of this collaboration ensures commitment to roll out implementation immediately after cabinet approval.
In order to fast track the implementation, many national institutions have already planned to implement NES priorities rapidly. As such, budgetary allocations for many NES priorities were included in the 2018 national budget. Major reforms of export administrative processes, setting up of new tools and systems to ease trade, as well as stimulating export innovation and promotion are now ready to commence.
The NES)is a timely catalyst through which the export sector will be expanded. It supports the National Economic Councils objective of increasing export incomes and developing local industries.
The current wave of economic reforms combined with increasing regional trade opportunities, provide a unique window for Sri Lanka to modernize and start a new cycle of export growth.
To seize this opportunity, Sri Lankas NES proposes a clear-cut vision to drive the reforms needed for Sri Lanka to reach its true export potential: Sri Lanka  An Export Hub driven by Innovation and Investment.
While providing the conditions necessary to strengthen emerging sectors, all export industries of Sri Lanka will benefit from the implementation of the NES. NES implementation will create a favourable business environment for all Sri Lankan enterprises by strengthening key trade functions such as Logistics, National Quality Infrastructure, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and Trade Information & Promotion.

Bawas work reveals him discovering the traditions of Sri Lankas architecture while reshaping and learning in an effort to engage with European and Asian design cultures from a decolonial perspective.
Some of the exceptional architectural work of Bawa have been captured at the Aitken Spence Hotels such as Heritance Kandalama, Heritance Ahungalla and Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara.

No plan to close down SriLankan Airlines - Kiriella
The government has no plans to close down SriLankan Airlines, asserted Public Entreprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
He also said that however the airlines income and expenditure should be bridged.
The Minister said he had instructed the SriLankan Airlines Chairman to limit losses to a minimum during the last three years.
Minister Kiriella was speaking following a visit to the SriLankan Airlines office yesterday.
The Minister also visited the SriLankan Aviation College and SriLankan Catering.
Minister Kiriella further said that although the government needs to continue with SriLankan Airlines, the government has had to spend Rs.465 billion to maintain several government institutions, including SriLankan Airlines.
He added that is all the tax payers and the government cant continue to pay that much money.
Minister Kiriella also said the downturn of SriLankan Airlines was due to the short term policies and decisions of the previous government. During the previous regime, 15 airbuses had been leased at higher than at the market rates, Minister Kiriella said. These purchases had been made even without Cabinet approval. Had the trade unions at least expressed their objections, some kind of influence could have been made to change that decision.
Minister Kiriella further said that the new Director Board has been allowed to work independently without political influence.
SriLankan Airlines Trade Unions have pledged their fullest support to the Minister towards the development of SriLankan Airlines.
They also said that the previous government did not consider the views of the trade unions when it made decisions.

Panel discussion  on Nationalism
Elizabeth Moir School recently hosted a panel discussion on Nationalism. The members of the panel were Dr. Harsha De Silva MP, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs; Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, Executive Director of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute; and Priyanga Hettiarachchi, Sri Lanka Representative of the Westminster Foundation. The discussion was moderated by two students, Shakuntala Fernandopulle and Felix Deemer.
The panelists were asked questions on a wide range of issues linked to Nationalism. This included the merits of free trade and rise of protectionism, the danger of a new era of national rivalries causing conflict between great powers, the implications of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative for Sri Lanka, and the continuing prevalence of ethnic nationalism, both around the world and in relation to the recent communal violence in Kandy.
Dr. Harsha De Silva argued that the Belt and Road Initiative was a strategic opportunity for Sri Lanka, given the potential economic benefits, but also discussed President Xi Jinpings recent abolition of term limits for the Chinese presidency.
Dr. Panditaratne questioned the view that Sri Lanka is in a debt trap to China, saying that only 6 percent of Sri Lankas total debt is owed to China, about the same as what is owed to Japan. On free trade, she argued that Sri Lanka should follow the example of countries like New Zealand, which are reaching out to educate their citizens about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so people see how they benefit from free trade agreements.
Hettiarachchi discussed how Nationalism appeals to everyones desire for a sense of belonging and community but distinguished positive or harmless manifestations of this, such as supporting ones country in the Olympics or World Cup, from exploitation of these feelings to create divisions.
All the speakers emphasised the dangers of politicians drumming up nationalist sentiment for political ends and turning their back on the co-operation that has brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the world since 1945. They called on leaders to develop a civic nationalism by emphasising what unites countries and different communities rather than sowing discord.
The schools students were enlightened about many important contemporary issues and inspired to fight for a more open world by building bridges between different peoples and not building walls.

The strike launched by postal employees since June 11 has caused inconvenience to parents hoping to admit their children to Grade One classes next year (2019).
Parents complained that since the closing date for next year's admissions is July 1, they are uncertain whether they could keep to the deadline due to postal and other delays caused by the strike.
Parents said they request education authorities to consider their plight and postpone the closing date for applications beyond July 1, to enable them to submit applications on time.

Postal unions protest disrupts Colombo Fort traffic
Heavy traffic prevailed along D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha and in Colombo Fort area due to a protest march organised by a group of postal workers, which started outside the Central Mail Exchange (CME), yesterday.
Postal Union workers launched the protest march demanding that the government resolve issues with regard to the recruitment procedure in the Postal Services.
The public were inconvenienced as protesters blocked roads in the Fort area and vehicular traffic was severely affected.
Meanwhile, the Postmaster General on Sunday urged the trade unions to end their strike and enter into discussions with the Department.
Issuing a statement, the Postmaster General said the issues will be resolved within a month, after having discussions with the trade unions.
The Postmaster General stated that the department had been conducting the service for over 200 years, and will be responsible for the problems faced by the public. The Postal Department workers would undergo difficulties if the strike continued and the 200-year-old service would be disrupted.
Postal Trade Unions Convenor Chinthaka Bandara meanwhile stated that the trade unions are ready to hold talks with the authorities, but the strike would not be called off until the demands are met.
Postal Services came to a halt on June 11 with the joint trade union strike launched by 23,000 employees of 24 Postal Services unions. Services at 653 post offices, 3,410 sub-post offices and 100 control officers were also disrupted. Over 1,500 airmail sacks were piled up at the BIA Airport and at the Central Mail Exchange (CME) as island-wide mail collection and distribution came to a standstill.
Bandara said the strike was carried out on two demands - to amend the recruitment process and to make sub-post masters permanent.

The strike launched by the Postal and Telecommunication Officers Association will continue in-spite of warnings issued by the government to cancel leave and terminate the employment of postal workers who fail to report to work.
The decision was made by the trade union citing that authorities failed to provide adequate solutions to their demands at the meeting held yesterday, Postal and Telecommunication Officers Association President Chinthaka Bandara said.
Furthermore, Chinthaka Bandara said that the postal workers are determined to face any challenge until their demands are met by the authorities.
The strike is carried out by the Postal workers based on two demands, which are to amend the recruitment process of the department and make the profession of the Acting Sub Post Masters permanent.

Presidential question
It was President J R Jayewardene, who having introduced the neo-liberal economy and changed the Constitution used to take pride in saying that during his tenure there was five star democracy in Sri Lanka.
Though the economy picked up momentum and increased the GDP, as far as the masses were concerned what they experienced was far from five star democracy. Actually they began to see stars (daval tharu) in broad daylight with the abolition of subsidies on essential goods and services, devaluation of the Rupee and across the board increase of prices as well as the dismissal of thousands of workers who struck work demanding a paltry Rs. 10 per day. Even World Bank researchers later said that the reforms were implemented with extraordinary haste that it shocked the poor.
Though the masses were not capable of fully realizing that their economic woes stemmed from the neo-liberal economic reforms they understood the adverse effects of political reform better. Hence, the new Constitution was opposed by a large section of the public.
Almost all Opposition political parties except those representing non-Sinhala national communities opposed it. The latter supported it under a delusion that it is favourable to them in seeking a solution to the National Question. Three executive presidents, including the present incumbent came to power promising its abolition but reneged on the promise or were prevented from honouring it.
Presidential election 2020
Now three years after coming into office of the Yahapalana government the tables have been turned. The UNP which introduced the executive presidency opposes it. Non-Sinhala national communities that supported it want it abolished now. The SLFP and its allies support it, taking 180 degree turn on the ground that it favours the minorities in seeking a solution to the National Question.
All political parties are gearing themselves for the Presidential election 2020. There is hardly any effort by the Government to proceed with the drafting of a new Constitution. The matter was laid to rest the moment the two ruling parties decided to try their luck at the local government elections with acrimonious politics as rivals. It opened old wounds, formed alliances detrimental to government unity and favoured the former regime whose slogans were picked up by the official SLFP too.
Now we are in this quicksand immersed and sinking. The attention of the leaders of the Government as well as the Opposition is focused on 2020 that there is hardly any governance. Peoples problems get over-looked and neglected.
Though official campaigning has not started the presidential commodities are in the market, at least in the gossip market till they eventually enter the real one. Names are traded, waters are being tested and media are being used or made use of to promote various candidates albeit unofficially.
As during the 2015 elections, the Mahinda Rajapaksa supporters are already predicting victory, even though they shy away from naming the candidate. Three commodities in the persons of Gotabhaya, Basil and Chamal are mentioned in the gossip market. Ironically all three are from the Rajapaksa family alluding to a continuation of dynastic rule. In the disillusion of the present moment battle lines are re-drawn with some favouring a strong man and others not. Charlatans are on the scene under various incarnations as erudite scholars or all-knowing pundits in local verbiage, as astute statesmen with doctoral assistance in quoting the Devils scriptures or moneybags hiring academic sycophants in service.
There are still others whose names are to be found by innuendo at after dinner speeches or press conferences. Some affable Ministers have also bragged about their eligibility.
National Question
The incumbent President, who on assuming office pledged to go home after his maiden term, seems to have changed his mind, openly declaring that he has no intention of retiring from politics at the end of his term. Whether that means he will contest again or do a Mahinda Rajapaksa by getting elected as an ordinary MP is yet to be ascertained.
Given his animosity to the UNP, his vacillation in seeking a solution to the National Question, the lack of resoluteness in dealing with racist anti-Muslim assaults that occurred recently and the growing disillusion of the masses his prospects at a future presidential election do not look rosy at the present moment.
Former President is legally barred from contesting and he could regain power constitutionally only through a Constitutional amendment with the help of a friendly Parliament or becoming the Premier after a general election. Anyway he has not expressed any personal interest so far. Perhaps he may be relying on one of his siblings.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already announced his candidature though dissenting voices are also heard from certain UNP quarters. However, he seems to be the most suitable candidate for the UNP.
While there may be other candidates and proxies contesting the presidential election the choice is between three personalities - the incumbent President, Prime Minister and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. All three have unofficially started their campaigns. Of them the novice Gotabhaya seems to have a better and dedicated organisation while the other two are plagued by internal dissention among their followers.
One could discount the dissention between a section of the JO and the Gammanpila  Weerawansa clique for the JO is a foreign entity with respect to Gotabhayas presidential bid followers. Gotabhayas past conduct could be his Achilles heel or his forte. What it will depend on can be decided not in advance but in the context of the elections when final battle lines are drawn.
Politics, however, is full of surprises. For example, nobody was aware of the surprise candidate Maithripala Sirisena until the eve of nominations in 2015. Who could predict that history may not repeat in 2020
There are few more factors to be considered. What would be the effect of multiple candidates Will a third force emerge prior to the elections What external influence could and would affect the election And lastly the ubiquitous question: Will the elections be held

Public may have access to Parliamentary Committees during PP Act amendments
The amendments to the Parliament Privileges Act will allow the public to access all Parliamentary Committees, Parliament Assistant General Secretary Tikiri Jayatilake yesterday said.
The public and media personals will have access to the Parliamentary Committees if the Committee Chairman gives consent, Jayatilake explained.
This is a revolutionary step taken, he said.
Meanwhile, Director (Legislative Services) on Standing Orders of Parliament Jagath Gajaweera Arachchige said the new standing orders have made two parties responsible on behalf of the Executive to respond to the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Committees.
Accordingly, the Finance Minister and the subject Minister of the probed State institute will have to produce their observations, conclusions, remedies on the reports submitted by the Parliamentary Committees.
Previously, there was no provision in law to make it compulsory for the Executive to respond to the recommendations of the committees, Gajaweera said.
Jayatilake and Gajaweera were speaking at an awareness programme for Parliamentary journalists organized by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy at Waters Edge, Battharamulla yesterday morning. Speaker Karu Jayasooriya, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe and COPA Chairman Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna addressed the gathering.

Scary comb nails are  the latest fashion fad
We all live increasingly hectic lives, juggling heavy workloads and a lack of sleep. However, even the busiest of us might balk at the idea of a manicure that also doubles up as ten teeny-tiny combs.
Sounds bonkers, yet this vision has become a reality - thanks to some very creative nail art. The brains behind the latest striking trend is Nail Sunny , who, back in February brought us the evocative Kylie Jenner baby fingers manicure .
This time, the Russian beauty salon have designed a manicure where tiny combs are attached to each nail - perfect if youre always on the go...
The eye-catching nails were revealed in a tutorial posted by the salon, which showed how they can be used to brush through your hair.
In the video, we also see how this look is achieved by brightly-coloured extensions being added to each nail, before the teeth of the comb are drilled out.
Once this is done, each nail gets painted a different, cheery colour, for extra impact.
Nail Sunny accompanied their bizarre creation with the caption: Brush nails - YAY OR NAY.
Mostly, it was a nay.
If they get caught on something your entire nail will rip off omg, wrote one person, which is a good point, and one which has our eyes watering.
Nay those are the ugliest thing ever, another, more candid person added.
This is frightening! read another comment.
But there were people who pointed out that this design requires a lot of creativity and strong craftsmanship. Which is fair.

The sling, the zing and the sting!
If you really want to grab the attention of your classmates or co-workers, shoot them in the neck with a rubber band. Thats right, I said a rubber band. You graduated from middle school and found your way to a desk job, but that doesn't mean you have to leave rubber-band-powered projectile launchers behind.
But have you ever wondered what the relationship is between a stretched rubber band at rest and the energy it holds The energy the rubber band has stored is related to the distance the rubber band will fly after being released.
Every child who has been in a rubber band battle instinctively knows the longer you stretch a rubber band, the farther it will go. This is true unless the rubber band is pulled too far and begins to break. So you see, the case does involve some very fundamental idea of physics.
Growing up, a rubber band war was something my friends and I engaged in for fun. In fact, we would collect discarded rubber bands and use them as ammunition to launch at our friends when the teachers had their backs turned. They would be completely scattered throughout our classrooms. Yes, rubber band wars were darned exciting and every one had a sore finger by the end.
Yes, I know what you are thinking  very immature. However, if my personal experience is any indication, your ability to master this skill will mean the difference between being bored and being joyfully occupied even in the most jaded times. This classic game is fun to play and will improve your hand-eye coordination skills and ability to aim correctly while judging the level of force required to hit target.
Since they were patented in 1845, rubber bands have been put to a staggering variety of uses. The humble rubber band, I learned, has a very curious history and if one rubber band manufacturer is to be believed, theres about to be a lot more, as science is set to create a major upgrade to the old office standby. And that is not stretching things too far.
There are many uses for rubber bands, inside and outside the classroom and workplace. They are used to wrap around flowers for a special occasion, bind wads of money at the bank, hold vegetables together in the supermarket and in foreign climes to secure the newspapers when landing on your front lawn.
Bands are used at the hairdressers for ponytails, horses tails at show jumping events, holding dental braces at the orthodontist, packaging in the warehouse, specialist industrial and engineering applications, art and craft lessons at school and of course slingshots anywhere.
You actually dont need to buy or turn out a shooter to make a rubber band fly across a room. You can ingeniously make a cheap and safe version of a rubber band gun using only your hand! The most-complicated, but also most-classic way of firing a rubber band is by shaping your hand into a gun and wrapping the band around to really let it fly. To fire a rubber band this way: Make your hand into a gun shape, with your thumb as the hammer and your index finger as the barrel.
Point your index finger in the direction you want the rubber band to go. Hook the band around your pinkie, (little finger) pulling it back toward the inside of your wrist. Hook the band all the way around your thumb. Secure it on the very tip of your pointer finger. To release the rubber band, let go with your pinkie.
I learned these methods some four decades ago from a translator on the very newspaper this column is published in. We called him Jules, which of course was close to his unlikely real name. He was the supreme office sniper and expert at shooting rubber bands with his hand. Jules claimed that work never got boring when there were elastic bands lying around the office. Being a great aerodynamicist he claimed that shooting bands at his colleagues with unerring accuracy was simply a snap.
Besides his incurable obsession to spring elastic bands at people there were other reasons why you would have wanted to slug him. The guy wore his hair long, sported a Zapata moustache and walked with his arms flailing like a tight-rope walker frantically trying to balance himself.
He found the itch to sling rubber bands into co-workers backsides irresistible. He was no spring chicken but never thought himself too old for that type of horseplay. In similarity to James Bond he imagined he had the license to sting whenever a tempting rump was within his sights. There were times when he sparked a contretemps in the editorial for this particular transgression, such as when he seared the bottoms of a brace of hot-tempered sub-editors.
It cant be all work and no play in the office. There were few things more satisfying to your childhood self than hearing that sharp thwack as a flung rubber band hit its target. Some people may think they are too old for that type of tomfoolery now. But who can resist shooting an adversary and hear him yelp when you hit target.
Rubber bands were made to be fired. Well, okay, maybe they were made to hold stuff in place, but come on, chappies. It's just too tempting to give the back of someones ear or their rump a bit of a sting from the back of the classroom when the teacher is not looking. If you've ever been shot with a rubber band from behind then you know it has energy in it  enough energy to smack you in the ear or neck and cause a sting!
This is what happened in the newspaper editorial offices of old: Someone shot a rubber band at someone else. They returned fire. Soon, things escalated into a full-scale battle in the editorial. Staff were ducking behind their desks and firing off paper clips at coworkers, rubber bands were flying through the air and no actual work was getting done.
Editorials are places with stressful deadlines. No editorial would be complete without rubber bands to fiddle with or ping. Whether you're tormenting your enemies or enforcing elastic justice, you won't find a better tool for the job.
Here is my advice for livening up any editorial. The rubber band is capable of inflicting first and second degree welts, contusions, and bruises, on the supple flesh of its targets. For safety's sake, it should only be wielded by a trustworthy and licensed adult. For fun's sake, place it in the hands of your craziest, most demented, deranged, unbalanced, loose-cannon of a friend and watch the rubber fly!

South Africas top-ranked ODI bowler at No.6 in the world Imran Tahir has been rested from the ODI squad to play Sri Lanka in July-August as the country gears up for Vision 2019.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who has played two ODIs, and left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi have been included in the 15-man squad in Tahirs place.
The series, which will consist of five ODIs and a one-off T20I, is the first of five in South Africas build-up to the 2019 World Cup, and the first since AB de Villiers announced his international retirement. The uncapped Reeza Hendricks, wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram are the three players in contention for de Villiers middle-order spot.
Faf du Plessis returns as captain, after missing five of the six ODIs against India earlier in the year with a broken finger, and Junior Dala, who has played three T20s, comes in as an option in place of the retired Morne Morkel. Wiaan Mulder is the only other addition from the group that played against India, and replaces Chris Morris, who is injured.

Special audit report on Diplomatic service performance soon
A special audit report on the performance of Sri Lankas diplomatic service will be released shortly, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
He said his Department is currently working on the document and the Department officials would be sent to diplomatic missions of Sri Lanka overseas to collect the necessary information. He was addressing an awareness programme for Parliamentary Journalists conducted by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) together with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy at Waters Edge in Battaramulla yesterday.
There is a general opinion in the country that our diplomatic service is highly inefficient.
In 2017 alone, the country has spent Rs.8.3 billion to maintain the offices of our diplomatic missions. The inefficiency in them is a problem of the performance of individuals appointed to those missions. What have they done to promote the image of the country or to promote trade or tourism What have they given to the country in return There has been no such assessment up to now.
No statistics are available, the Auditor General said.
He said his Department has paid attention to produce sector-wise audit reports and the report on diplomatic service would be the first among them. Similarly, he said a report on Agrarian Services would also be produced in the time to come.
The Agrarian Services Department has 300 odd branches country wide. However, most of them are inactive.
These are the closest units to the farmers. When asked as to what programme they have to revive this network, the relevant authorities went blank, he added.
The Auditor General also lamented the inordinate delay in passing the National Audit Bill in Parliament, adding that the Audit Commission is idling for almost three years due to the absence of legal provisions.
He added that the Auditor General was not given the powers to audit the companies coming under the Corporations from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, and therefore a lot of subsidiary companies of the CEB and may other companies such as Sri Lanka Telecom evade Government audit.
However, he pointed out provisions to audit such companies have been made in the Audit Bill, thus rectifying the loopholes of the 19th Amendment.
The Auditor General was also of the opinion that financial discipline of public institutions sharply deteriorated during the past administration due to arbitrary actions and decisions of a few individuals.
The entire institutional structure collapsed as certain individuals had full control of them.
They changed the system per their whims and fancies. Offenders did not get any punishment for their wrong doings and instead got promotions setting bad a precedent. At the end, financial discipline was completely ruined, he noted.
Observing that currently there is no procedure to impose punishment on public officials who breach the disciplinary code, he highlighted the need for a stronger mechanism to deal with offenses similar to that of former President Secretary Lalith Weeratungas Sil Redi case.
He pointed out if the law on breaking financial regulations was implemented tightly, half of the public officials would have to be in jail today.
He pointed out over spending as well as under spending of an allocation is against the law.

The Technology behind VAR
Football fans still remember the 1986 World Cup quarter-final match between England and Argentina for one of the most controversial goals in soccer history, the Hand of God goal by Diego Maradona. The goal changed the result of the tournament. But had VAR (Video Assistant Referee) been there at that time, it might have altered the entire course of the game.
VAR has become one of the most widely discussed subjects in the sports world ever since the news of its use in the World Cup 2018 has released. But what exactly is VAR Lets find out more about VAR, the technology behind it, and how it is going to transform the face of the game.
WHAT IS VAR
VAR stands for Video Assistant Referee. As the name suggests, video replays are used to review certain decisions made by the main referee to eliminate serious human errors and make the game as fair as possible.
The Video Assistant referee is a team of 3 people  video assistant referee, his assistant, and a replay operator. The three team members work in unison to review the relevant incidents in a video operating room.
The VAR technology in its present form was first used in a competitive match between Brighton vs Crystal Palace in the FA Cup in January 2018. But video technology was used for the first time in World Cup in 2014.
It is called the goal-line technology, and it has revolutionized the way decisions about goals are made.
TECHNOLOGY BEHIND VAR
As mentioned already, VAR is a team comprising 3 people, who sit in the video operating room, where they can watch the events on the ground on a number of monitors. They can view a particular incident from different angles on the monitors to come to an error-free judgement.
The entire process involves 3 steps  incident, review/advice, and decision. In the first step, when the incident occurs, the referee informs the VAR or the VAR suggests the referee that the incident or the decision needs to be reviewed.
In the second step, the actual review of the incident takes place. The VAR reviews the event and advises the referee through the headset. Finally, the referee either decides to review the video footage of the incident himself on a pitch-side monitor or accepts the advice given by VAR and takes a decision accordingly.
The process of reviewing a decision can be initiated by the referee. The VAR team also has the authority to suggest a review. But referees will have the final authority to decide whether to change their original decision.
The original decision will be overturned only in the event of a clear and obvious error of judgement in one of four game-changing scenarios:
(i) GOALS (VAR will help the referee decide whether a goal should or should not be awarded)
(ii) PENALTIES (VAR will help do away with wrong decisions made regarding the award of a penalty)
(iii) STRAIGHT RED CARDS (VARs role is to ensure that no wrong decisions are taken in this regard)
(iv) MISTAKEN IDENTITY (VAR will correct the referee if he sends off the wrong player due to mistaken identity)
PROS OF VAR
Although the VAR system is not free from flaws, it can have a huge impact on enhancing the credibility of the game by reducing the instances of grave mistakes made by referees, which can have serious consequences for teams and also for the game.
Many times, errors in judgement can be attributed to the inability of the referee to view the entire incident from the correct angle. Video can be of immense help in this regard.
Finally, football players will think twice before trying to deceive the referee by pretending an injury or falling on the ground intentionally to get penalties or dismissals, by giving the impression that a foul has been committed.
CONS OF VAR
Despite its many advantages, concerns have been expressed by many, especially by football fans that the application of VAR system will slow down the game, affect its fluidity and the thrill and the excitement that come with it.
Many experts also feel that VAR may eventually undermine the role of the referee. The entire process can take up a lot of time, which may frustrate the audience.
Moreover, every contentious issue cannot be sent for a review, as this will take up a lot of time.
Therefore, the referee has to make a decision regarding which incident should or should not be sent for a review, which too can become controversial at times.
There is yet another school of thought which feels that VAR may diminish the beauty of the game. The flaws and human errors are a part of the game and add to its beauty. They make the game more thrilling and exciting.
CONCLUSION
Only time will tell what and how much impact the VAR technology will be having on the game. Some teething problems will be there for a while, but eventually, the system will evolve and help make football as error-free as possible.
When all other sports are adopting technology to ensure fairness in the game, football cannot afford to lag behind.
It too has to evolve and apply technology to its advantage without reducing the thrill and glamour associated with the game.

THASL hosts Hospitality Conclave
The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Shangri-La Hotel held the Hospitality Conclave a discussion forum for school principals at Shangri-La Ballroom, Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
Over 200 principals from schools across the island, including schools offering the technological stream in their curriculum, participated in the program. The forum comprised of two sessions with resourceful panel discussions drawing attention on the importance of nurturing skilled employment in Sri Lanka and the seamless opportunities in the Hospitality sector for youth.
With its well defining competitive attributes, it is regrettable that contemporary youth are unaware of the true potential and seamless opportunities offend by the Hotel sector, leading to a formidable challenge in attracting the local youth to enter the industry and reap myriads of benefits, an official from THASL said.
In a bid to address this matter, the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) the apex body of the entire hotel industry in the country, devised a concerted strategy to both recognize the youth in the sector and spread awareness among the masses on The Hospitality sector and its seamless possibilities.
As the first step, THASL organized Rising Stars of Hospitality 2017, an island-wide competitive context evaluating candidates under nine key categories, Thousands of young and talented individuals representing over 200 member hotels vied for the honours and the winners were felicitated at a Grand Award ceremony in October last year. Driven by its strong passion to spread awareness on hospitality sector by means of inclusion into school curriculum, THASL has kick-started the second phase with Hospitality conclave  a resourceful discussion forum.
In its endeavour to elevate Sri Lanka as the ideal travel destination in the world and Tourism as the No. 1 net foreign exchange earner in the country by 2020, THASL aims to spearhead a number of such impactful and interactive forums in the near future, across the nation.

Towards a more transparent government
When the news came out earlier this month that the last international operator at the Mattala International airport had stopped all of its services there, not many were surprised.
In the five years since it was built, Mattala has earned an infamous reputation as the worlds emptiest airport.
Minister Kabir Hashim.
At its peak, five airlines operated out of Mattala, and dropped out one by one due to high costs and frequent bird strikes.
When the final operator, Dubai-based Fly Dubai, pulled out on June 8, the news read more like a foregone conclusion.
One of the people who had long expected this outcome was Mylvaganam Thilakarajah, a Member of Parliament from the Nuwara Eliya District.
In fact, Thilakarajah saw the whole debacle as a case in point for a new system he and other MPs have been pushing in Parliament for the last few years: independent evaluations for public projects.
If (the airport) had been evaluated before, the environmental people would have commented on this, he said. We would have learned about the threat of peacocks coming and hitting the wings.
Thilakarajah and the other members of a group called the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation have been lobbying for a national policy on evaluation.
They want an independent body, staffed by people with financial, technical, environmental, and cultural expertise, to evaluate all proposed projects before they commence, in order to give MPs a full picture of the risks and rewards associated with any given development.
MP Mylvaganam Thilakarajah, memberof Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation.
Every Parliament the world over should have an evaluation unit within it, said Kabir Hashim, the Minister of Highways and Road Development, in a recent interview.
Hashim is the chair of the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation, as well as being a member of the Sri Lankan counterpart.
We as a group have been putting pressure on the Speaker, on the Prime Minister, Hashim said.
He said the future for evaluation looks brighter now. Sri Lanka will host an international evaluation conference in September, bringing specialists and Parliamentarians from about 100 other countries to discuss Parliamentary evaluation mechanisms.
Members of the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation like Minister Hashim and MP Thilakarajah say that that international spotlight has applied much-needed pressure at home.
And with some key victories in recent months, they believe that Sri Lanka could finally be close to establishing an evaluation mechanism of its own.
The case for evaluation
If the Mattala Airport is a case in point for the need of evaluation, it is not alone.
Thilakarajah lists a variety of projects that he said he believes couldve gone differently with a proper evaluation.
For example, theres the cricket stadium in Dambulla.
The cricket board built the stadium there for the benefits of the dry-zone climate, Thilakarajah said.
But after starting these cricket grounds, only now they are talking about the culture, he said. That is a Buddhist-based area. Now they are thinking about having alcohol there, dancing, cheer girls, now theyre thinking about that and avoiding having matches there.
So it doesnt work properly, but they spent a lot to build it, he added.
Or take the case of the disastrous Uma Oya project.
They wanted to get the water to down south, that is Hambantota, Thilakarajah said. So now the Hambantota people get water, but theres no water for Bandarawela.
All the houses in Bandarawela city, they all have cracks, he added. Once this channel was created, they dont get water in their wells. Because of us.
(Its) a completely man-made disaster, he said.
Thilakarajah said that the Mattala, Dambulla, and Uma Oya projects all displayed the same problem.
This is the issue that we have now: all the development proposals are political proposals, he said.
The governments needs become the states needs, which means the partys needs, which means political needs, he said.Thats how it gets deviated from the state to the party. So all the peoples money goes to political purposes.
Thilakarajah and the members of the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation think that if it were made mandatory to evaluate projects by a diverse and independent group of experts before they were finally approved, some of these ill-conceived developments could be stopped.
If it is to come into practice, I think Sri Lankas development will be really changed, he said.Not at once, but in another 20-25 years, you can have the right path. Evaluation will give the right path in the development projects of our country.
Forming a national policy
According to Minister Kabir Hashim, the political winds have shifted in favour of evaluation.
In 2013, as an Opposition MP, he proposed an evaluation mechanism for all government projects. It didnt go anywhere.
But he said the fact that Sri Lanka is hosting the international evaluation conference in September brought attention to the issue at home.
Earlier this month, Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would bring forward a National Evaluation Policy in July.
He told media that the policy would provide accountability in the efficiency, effectiveness, value, and sustainability of public projects, and emphasize evaluation as a requirement of development planning.
This is a great achievement, Minister Hashim said in an interview.
The evaluation body should be independent, he said, like an audit group, but analyze projects from a variety of angles. That way, consequences like potential environmental damage or social impacts could be discovered and discussed beforehand.
Hashim said that USAID has agreed to contribute significant funding to the creation of an independent evaluation office within Parliament, as well as technical staff expertise.
The Parliamentarians Forum hopes to have the new policy in place before the conference in September.
But Hashim said even then there will be an opportunity for Sri Lanka to shape its evaluation culture, because representatives of countries that have utilized evaluation as a tool will be there.
South Africa (has) used evaluation as one of their key tools, he said. Weve also found that Malaysia has a very sophisticated monitoring and evaluation and performance-budgeting system and that has helped (it) to utilize funds to the maximum and have most of their projects implemented successfully.
Nepal, which was also a founding country of the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation, adopted an evaluation policy of its own last year, Hashim said.
So already in South Asia, because of the Global Parliamentarians Forum, weve been able to influence two Parliaments, he said.
Hashim said he doesnt expect opposition to the bills passage in Sri Lanka.
At the moment we have the support from a cross-section of political parties, which includes the opposition as well, and we are happy that the stakeholders are varied across and we have everyone on board, he said.
Nobody in their right minds could be against something like this, he added.
Mattala International Airport, an example of a development project gone wrong.

## Title: Trimming the fat

Trimming the fat
The Yahapalanaya government, it appears, has taken a meaningful step to confront head on the perennial issue of over-staffing in the state sector. The failure and/or the reluctance of successive governments to trim the fat has prevented most of our state institutions from functioning as financially viable entities. Needless to say, the surplus is chiefly due to political patronage in the recruitment process. For obvious reasons, this has led to indiscipline and insubordination in our government departments and corporations, over the years, that has not only affected productivity but made these institutions dens of corruption.
According to our main story yesterday, the government, henceforth, will make state sector heads foot the salary bill of the excess staff under them. According to Director Information Ministry of Finance and Mass Media M. Ali Hassen, Secretaries to Ministries, Heads of Departments, Chairpersons, executive officers and Accountants of Government Institutions will be made liable to pay the salaries of redundant workers they have employed in excess of the approved cadre. The Cabinet has taken this decision after the Report of the Final Quarter of the State Sector Employees - 2017 was submitted by Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera recently. According to this report there are over 7,500 persons employed in various government institutions above the cadre positions approved by the Management Service Department of the Treasury. It states that during 2017, alone, 23,224 persons were recruited to the state service while at the same time 5,000 public servants had retired from service.
Hopefully, the government will have the will to go ahead with what is admittedly an unpopular measure. But it has to begin somewhere if the government departments and corporation are made to run as viable entities. Today, government institutions such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the CEB have been virtually run to the ground, financially, mainly due to the bloated staff on their payrolls.
But the problem should be addressed at the source. It is common knowledge that it is the politicians who are the chief culprits where the excess staff in government departments is concerned. The problem has exacerbated after January 8. We say this because, while in the past, only the victorious party at the elections packed the state sector with its supporters, the present dispensation, being a unity government of the two major parties, supporters of both parties have been recruited to government departments and corporations without let or hindrance, inflating their salary bills out of proportion.
Hence, as already mentioned, trimming the fat is going to be a herculean task, what with the Chairmen and Directors of these Corporations who are now called upon to foot the salary bill of the excess staff, themselves responsible for recruiting their own friends and relatives for nonexistent posts at these institutions. In any event, these individuals themselves are placed in a dilemma. They cannot dismiss the excess employees recruited by their predecessors or those recommended to them by ministers of an earlier government. To do so would be quoting litigation, if these employees are below the retirement age. The only option, therefore, appears to be to force the politicians concerned to foot the salary bill of those whom they recommended.
This may be justified, given that Chairmen, or, Directors of the government institutions concerned would be powerless to ignore the orders of a powerful minister to recruit his/her supporters.
Come election time, politicians of all hues offer jobs to their supporters and once ensconced in power they are bound to oblige. Political patronage in granting jobs prevailed under all governments since independence. However, things got out of hand in 1970, when, after the victory of the United Front, supporters, in their droves, were given government jobs. Not to be outdone, the UNP even recruited baila singers to the CTB, after the 1977 victory, and, similarly placed square pegs in round holes in other government departments as well.
The outcome is that today the government is saddled with a huge pension bill to maintain the excess staff that was recruited to the state sector over the years by successive governments. Not only were they contributing to the financial ruination of the public institutions but also acted immune to regulations and disciplinary codes due to their close connections with the ministers responsible for their recruitment.
Hence, rather than penalizing the hierarchy of the government departments by way of forcing them to foot the wage bills of the excess staff, legislation should be introduced to ban politicians from packing state institutions with their supporters. Laws should also be brought to make merit the sole criterion for jobs in the state sector. This is the reason why the private sector is way ahead in efficiency and financial viability, adhering to this norm.
State sector employees should also be made to follow a proper work ethic. The legendary indifference and lethargy attributed to the government servant should be transformed if efficiency is to be promoted in the government departments and corporations. Steps should also be taken to eliminate waste and corruption in the state institutions which is costing the government much more than the salaries squandered on excess staff.

Trump tariffs: US escalates trade threats to China

US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200bn (151bn) of Chinese goods in a growing trade row.
Trump said the 10% tariffs would come into effect if China "refuses to change its practices".
The move would be a major escalation of the dispute.World stock markets have suffered sharp falls as a result.
China responded by accusing the US of "blackmail", raising fears of a full-blown trade war.
Trump insists that China has been unfairly benefiting from a trade imbalance with the US for years.
During the 2016 election campaign, he promised to use tariffs to cut the US trade deficits.
But many economists have warned that tariffs are likely to make products more expensive for US consumers and hurt some of the businesses the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly.
Asian markets sank on Tuesday in response to the latest news, and European markets also opened lower.Global shares had already fallen on Monday.
How did the latest spat unfold
Last week, Trump confirmed that the US would impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods.
Beijing responded by saying it would hit 659 US products worth $50bn - including agricultural products, cars and marine products - with a similar tax.
Late on Monday, the US president condemned China's "unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology".
He added: "Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong."
Trump added that new tariffs would "go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced".
"If China increases its tariffs yet again, we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200bn of goods."
China's commerce ministry reacted swiftly, saying: "If the US acts irrationally and issues a list, China will have no choice but to take comprehensive measures of a corresponding number and quality and take strong, powerful countermeasures."
One analyst wondered if performance at the polls may be behind Trump's latest move.
Ritu Vohora, an investment director at M&G Investments, told theBBC's Today programme:"There is a lot more at stake here for Trump with the mid-term elections in November.
"China clearly is very much wanting to be this global tech leader so neither side really wants to back down and the real risk here is if Trump continues to push China on systematic changes to its economic model, then that's quite a significant protracted tension we could see in the markets.
"It seems to be a war of attrition at the moment where neither side is willing to bow down to the pressure."
What products are affected
The US tariffs previously announced affect more than 800 Chinese products worth $34bn in annual trade. They are due to come into effect on 6 July.
The product lines range from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers.
In his latest statement, Trump said that he had asked his advisers to identify additional Chinese products on which to impose new tariffs.
The Trump administration says China encourages transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, through measures such as requiring that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market.

An unlikely yet  beautiful friendship
A baby swan has become best friends with a builder after he was rescued from a river bank.
Rob Adamson, 39, rescued the abandoned cygnet, who hes named Sidney, after he found it had been attacked over night at a boatyard by another animal.
The attack only happened last week, but ever since, Rob and Sidney have become the best of friends and now do everything together  including shopping trips and kayaking.
Rob said, To get the opportunity to look after a cygnet, youre not going to get that again. I am a wildlife lover so this is a dream come true for me to look after him like this. This was a story meant to be. I would not give up my boat for 10 million and if I didnt live here then I would never have the opportunity to look after him.
Since taking him in, Sidney has trailed Rob like he is his mother, and hes also made friends with a chihuahua puppy who works on site.
Rob added, I take him to work with me in the boatyard and he has met Sophie a little chihuahua who comes into the office. They are quite happy with each other and run about together playing about. Sophie is so curious about him but Sidney definitely thinks that she could be his sister. I love watching them storm around the office having the times of their lives.
Rob has a little box next to his bed that Sidney is meant to sleep in, but he refuses to.
Hes not happy unless he is cuddling up to his owner  and when hes doing that, he falls asleep straight away.
Rob continued, I pick him up and he falls asleep. If its a bit chilly then he will curl up in the corner of my jacket quite happily. I cant leave him on his own on the back of the boat because the heron will take him. One thing I am struggling to get used to is the early mornings. He some how knows that the sun is coming up and by 4 am he is ready to go. I cannot say the same for myself.
Sidney was found by another marina worker at the boatyard in St Ives, Cambs, who spotted the injured cygnet while mowing the grass.
Rob said, An elderly chap Geoff Ingle came across poor little Sidney bobbing his head out of the grass, sitting there cold and hurt. The mother had abandoned him, his brother had died alongside him and he had badly hurt his little neck. If he had not have spotted him and picked him up then the poor little guy would have died. They must have been attacked overnight and he was just left for dead. We hoped the mother would come back and look after him but she never did. We spoke to the RSPCA and the RSPB and none of them could really do anything about it. I was worried that if we left him there they might have put him down and I just could not let that happen to him.
Rob feeds Sidney all the required nutrients a little swan could ever need, including special swan food and green peas  his favourite snack. Sidney is also happy to munch on grass while out of the boat.
But Rob knows that the fairytale cant be forever and that Sidney will eventually have to venture out on his own.
He said that he knows that the time will come, but that he just wants to live in the moment.

VAR penalty gives Sweden a narrow win over S. Korea
Nizhniy Novgorod, Monday: A VAR-awarded penalty gave Sweden a narrow but deserved victory in their opening Group F match against a poor South Korea side in Nizhny Novgorod on Monday.
Veteran Swedish skipper Andreas Granqvist scored the only goal of the game from the spot after Viktor Claesson was upended by South Korean substitute Kim Min-woo Kim in the 62nd minute.
Despite furious appeals, El Salvadorean referee Joel Aguilar, who had ironically been whistle-happy up until that point, intially waved away Swedish penalty claims.
But after consulting the video, he pointed to the spot.
It was the third VAR penalty awarded at these championships after France and Peru also benefitted from video referrals.
The win was reward for Swedens more attacking approach, but it was unsurprising the winner came from the penalty spot in a game between two sides who had only managed two goals between them in seven games heading into Russia.
Sweden never really convinced that they would score prior to the penalty despite their domination and a toothless South Korea did not manage one shot on target.
However they should have equalised in the 90th minute but Hwang Hee-chan put a free header wide, spurning the Koreans best chance of the game by far.
The victory leaves Sweden joint top of the group after Mexicos surprise victory against world champions Germany on Sunday.
Next up for the Swedes is an intriguing encounter against Germany in Sochi on June 23.
South Korea started the game brightly, forcing the first corner in the fourth minute, but were gradually forced back by Swedish side.
It was the Europeans who came closest to breaking the deadlock when forward Marcus Berg was denied by a fine point-blank save Jo Hyeon-woo in the 20th minute.
Berg was denied again nine minutes later by a desperate last-ditch block from Kim Young-gwon.
Despite their increasing dominance, Sweden also demonstrated why they have struggled to score goals.
Berg, again, and Claesson went close before the end of the half, but it was clear for everyone to see why they had only scored once in their four matches prior to Russia.
Korea threatened only on the break where Son Heung-mins pace troubled 33-year-old Granqvist, who was without defending partner Victor Lindelof, who was ill.
The somewhat rancorous build-up to the game where Sweden were accused of spying on their opponents was increasingly reflected in the niggly nature of the match.
Resilient Sweden held firm after the goal and the Hwang late scare aside, and a half-hearted South Korea appeal for a penalty, their defence rarely looked troubled.
The huge celebrations, the first match played in the $290 million stadium, at the end showed the importance the Swedes attached to this match. AFP

WADA calls for intelligent, targetted dope testing
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) called for more intelligent and targetted testing for doping in sport, as the 15th Asia/Oceania Region Intergovernmental Ministerial Meeting on Anti-Doping in Sport opened yesterday.
WADA President Sir Craig Reedie, addressing a media briefing at the Kingsbury Hotel during the conference, explained that the rule of thumb was when in doubt to test the athlete, but one could not practically test them all. Thus intelligent and targetted testing, he said, was the most effective and cost-efficient method to use.
WADAs technical documents on sport now tells you who they should test, at what event, and at what time. Target-test people who we feel are most likely to cheat, said Sir Craig.
This is a 50-50 responsibility between government and sport. Our job is to ensure that everybody has the rules and now starts implementing them, he added.
As Sri Lanka hosts its first Ministerial Meeting this year, Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) Director General Dr. Seevali Jayawickreme signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency (ASADA) CEO David Sharpe to collaborate and share knowledge in the fields of testing, education, information technology, legal mechanisms and research.
Dr Jayawickreme, speaking on the occasion, said that SLADA, started five years ago, needed to work together with more established Anti-Doping Agencies like ASADA to develop their skills further. One area in particular they hope to stress on is in that of investigations. They currently have a staff of 27 with one Director for Investigations and Enforcement, but the post remains vacant.
Dr Jayawickreme said they expected to fill the vacancy soon. Given the cost of testing (approximately Rs. 35,000 per test), targetted and intelligent testing is something that Sri Lanka too is pushing for.
One of the biggest problems we have among local athletes is a lack of knowledge on doping. They may not know that they are taking a banned substance. At times, we have gym instructors directing athletes to use various substances or getting them to import certain banned substances. It is hard to arrest them as many of these substances are not registered under the Food and Drug Authority, he said.
SLADA President Prof. Arjuna de Silva, in the meantime, said that many athletes who used ayurvedic arishta (herbal drink) were found to have around 10 percent alcohol content and whilst this was not a banned substance, it was not recommended either.
In Sri Lanka, body building, rugby, power lifting and athletics were the high-risk sports, explained Prof. de Silva. Cricketers who are not registered with the ICC also are tested by SLADA.
Although cricket is not a high risk sport, it is a high-profile sport, so we test them, he said.

Welikada prison riots: IP Rangajeewa, Lamahewa further remanded till July 3

Police Narcotic Bureau Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa and former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who were arrested in connection to the Welikada Prison riots in 2012, were today ordered to be further remanded till July 3.
Neomal Rangajeewa and Emil Ranjan Lamahewa were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on March 28.
Twenty-seven inmates were killed and more than 20 other injured in a deadly shooting during the Welikada Prison riot on November 9, 2012 when prisoners took control of the populated prison objecting to an unannounced search by the Special Task Force to nab hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones at the prison.

When teams protested against umpiring decisions
Sri Lanka players refused to take the field on time on Day 3 of the second Test against West Indies in St. Lucia owing to a disagreement over change of ball, which the on-field umpires called for before the start of play. They play eventually began nearly two hours after the scheduled start but not before five penalty runs were added to West Windiestotal off 118/2.
Heres a look at five previous such instances when a team responded to dubious umpiring decisions with a form of protest.
THE OVAL FORFEITURE
Pakistan vs England, Oval, 2006 (Test)
Inzamam-ul-Haq takes the Pakistan team off the field against England at the Oval 2006
On the fourth afternoon of the final Test between England and Pakistan at the Oval, the visitors were docked five penalty runs by umpire Darrell Hair for altering condition of the ball by methods not permissible. Post the tea break, unhappy Pakistan players refused to take the field. Around 20 minutes later, umpires Hair and Billy Doctrove walked back to the field along with the England batsmen and removed the bails, thereby signalling the end of the Test match, and awarding it to England - the first and only instance of a team forfeiting a Test.
Pakistan emerged on the field later in the evening, but the umpires insisted the result must stand, which was confirmed by both the boards later that day. The result was amended to an abandonment by ICC in July 2008 which was reversed to the original verdict six months later.
THE RANATUNGA - MURALITHARAN - EMERSON SAGA
Sri Lanka vs England, Adelaide, 1999 (ODI)
Arjuna Ranatunga had a long altercation with umpire Ross Emerson before gesturing his players to walk off the field againstEngland at Adelaide 1999
Arjuna Ranatunga was never a popular man in Australias cricket circles, and the incidents in the Adelaide ODI against England in January 1999 did nothing to improve it either. After umpire Ross Emerson kept no-balling Muthiah Muralitharan from square leg for chucking (Emerson was one of the three umpires who called Muralitharan for throwing four years ago), Ranatunga had a long altercation with the umpire before gesturing his players to walk off the field.
The players stopped near the boundary line which was followed by a heated discussions between the match officials, Sri Lankan team manager Ranjit Fernando and Ranatunga.
Play eventually resumed 12 minutes later as Muralitharan completed the over without any further stoppages. Ranatunga then brought him on from the end where Emerson was officiating and asked the umpire to stand closer to the wickets so that it would make it difficult for him to call. Sri Lanka went on to win the humdinger, chasing 303 with two balls and a wicket to spare.
GOTHSOKARS ULTIMATUM TO ZAHEER ABBAS
Pakistan vs India, Bangalore, 1983 (Test)
Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas issued final ultimatum by Indian umpire at Bangalore 1983
The Test match started off on a sour note as Pakistan skipper Zaheer Abbas was reluctant to play on an outfield that he considered too slippery because of overnight rains. The match meandered to the final day bedeviled by persistent showers and bad light with the respective first innings getting completed only on the last day. Under the playing conditions, a minimum of 77 overs had to be bowled, including 20 mandatory overs in the last hour of the final day. There was no real possibility of a result and the match was only of academic interest from thereon.
Sunil Gavaskar was nearing his 28th Test ton but at the end of the 14th over in the last hour, Zaheer led his players off the field without consulting the on-field officials as they thought 77 overs for the day had already been bowled. However, the umpires stressed that unless both teams mutually agreed to end the game early, all 20 overs were needed to be bowled. An ultimatum was issued to Zaheer by umpires Swaroop Kishen and Madhav Gothsokar that unless they return to the middle the Test would be awarded to India. Pakistan returned reluctantly and Gavaskar completed his century, as the Test ended in a tame draw.
COLIN CROFT MAKES HIS DISPLEASURE KNOWN TO FRED GOODALL
West Indies vs New Zealand, Christchurch, 1980 (Test)
Colin Croft barges into umpire Fred Goodall at Christchurch, 1980
The Test series started off on a shaky note in Dunedin, thanks to some dubious umpiring by John Hastie. The image of Michael Holding kicking the stumps at strikers end summed up the first Test. The second Test began in Christchurch nine days later and the ghosts of Dunedin resurfaced on the third day. This time the protagonists were West Indies Colin Croft and umpire Fred Goodall as the latter refused to give a caught behind of New Zealand skipper Geoff Howarth on 68 (he went on to make 147) off Joel Garner.
The West Indies team was raging during the tea break and they unanimously decided not to resume the Test, and even thought about leaving the country midway through the series. After Howarths assurance to Clive Lloyd that his batsmen would walk off if they knew they hit the ball, the visitors took the field 12 minutes after the scheduled time.
The Test witnessed the worst the next day as Colin Croft barged into Goodall and even had a verbal altercation with him. Skipper Lloyd did little to diffuse the situation as he refused to budge from where he stood in slips as umpires tried to talk to him to restore sanity. It remained the only series between 1979 and 1994 where West Indies ended on the losing side.
INDIAS INFAMOUS WALK-OUT
India vs Pakistan, Sahiwal, 1978 (ODI)
Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz bowled bouncers at random forcing Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi to takebatsmen team off the field
India took on hosts Pakistan in the third ODI in the Zafar Ali Stadium in Sahiwal, with the series locked 1-1 after the first two matches. After restricting the hosts to 205 in a 40-overs-a-side contest, India were 183 for two, needing 23 runs off the last three overs with Anshuman Gaekwad batting on 78 and Gundappa Vishwanath on eight.
Sarfraz Nawaz began the 38th over with a bouncer that flew way over the six-footed Gaekwads head, and to wicketkeeper Wasim Bari. But umpires Khizer Hayat and Javed Akhtar stood unmoved.
The next three balls were action replays of the first delivery. Befuddled Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi called his batsman back in protest of the shenanigans. India thereby became the first team to concede a match to the opposition due to a walk-out. The decision created a lot of furore in Pakistan as well as India. The concept of neutral umpires was still years away from becoming a reality but the incident was one of the catalysts for that decision.  cb

## Title: WHITHER SRI LANKA ECONOMY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

WHITHER SRI LANKA ECONOMY
Part I
The GDP growth recorded by the Central Bank in 1917 shows that there is a deceleration further to 3.1% from the growth of 4.5% (corrected from previous figures) recorded in 2016. Given below is the per capita GDP at net market prices in US$ as follows:
See Table I
It can be seen that the GDP growth has decelerated to 3.1% and the annual average value for the US$ has increased from Rs. 145.60 to Rs. 152.46. It has since depreciated to around Rs 160.00. The declining GDP growth rate over last three years has continued.
Agriculture was adversely affected and contracted by 0.8% against the backdrop of adverse weather conditions that continued from 2016, while a slowdown in economic activity in both services and industrial sectors were observed.
Foreign Direct Investment
Quoting from the Central Bank Annual Report 2017 Foreign Direct Investment which includes foreign borrowings of Board of Investment (BOI Companies), recorded the highest inflows in history in 2017. Accordingly total FDI inflows, including foreign loans received by companies registered with the BOI, amounted to US$.1,913 Mn in 2017 in comparison to US$.1,078 Mn in 2016. Major inflows of FDI included receipts to Hambantota Port project and the Colombo Port City project. Both projects are expected to attract a significant amount of FDI in 2018 and beyond. Based on the origin of the immediate investor, China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore was the top 5 sourced countries of FDI in 2017.
See Table II
Portfolio Investment in equity, through non FDI Investment in the CSE recorded a notable increase in 2017. On this basis FDI shows an increasing trend but far below the levels of countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and even Burma.
Balance of payments
Primary income
Quoting from the Central Bank Annual Report 2017, In line with the trend observed in recent years the deficit in the primary income account widened, with increased reinvested earnings by direct investment enterprises (DIES) and increased interest payments on ISBS and project loans of the Government. Accordingly the deficit in the primary income widened to US$.2355 Mn in 2017 from US$ 2202 Mn in 2016.
Secondary income
The secondary income account with consists of private and government transfers remained subdued during 2017 with modest performance in workers remittances. Workers remittances which account for the majority of inflows to the secondary income account declined by 1.1% to US$.7164 Mn in 2017 as opposed to the growth of 3.7% in 2016.
However a positive trend is noted in the first quarter 2018 with workers remittances of US$.678 Mn when compared with US$.643 Mn an increase of 5.4% over 2017. It was reported that workers remittances continued to increase in April with US$.541 being 11% over the April 2017 figure. Furthermore, S P Liyanage the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Qatar has stated that the employment opportunities in Qatar will double and it will be a substantial source of workers remittances.
Current Account balance
Despite the gradual pick up in export earnings since March 2017 the trade balance deteriorated substantially as increased export earnings were insufficient to offset the notable increase in import expenditure mainly driven by weather related imports such as rice and also fuel.
Capital Account balance
Capital transfers to both the Government and the Private sector recorded a marginal decline during 2017. Accordingly the surplus in the capital account amounted to US$ 11 Mn in 2017 compared with US$ 25 Mn in 2016.
Financial Account
Higher inflows to the financial account as against outflows witnessed during 2017 resulted in a significant increase in net incurrence of liabilities in 2017. Further a significant accumulation of gross official reserves resulted in a notable increase in the net acquisition of assets during the year.
Reserve Assets position
Quoting from the Central Bank Accounts Report 2017 In line with the increase in reserve assets position, transactions related to reserve assets recorded a significant increase during 2017. The net increase in reserve asset transactions of US$.2,771 Mn was a significant contrast to the net decline in reserve assets transactions of US$. 472 Mn in 2016.
Overall balance
Reflecting improvements in the financial account the overall balance recorded a surplus in 2017, after recording deficits for two consecutive years. The net International Reserves thereby increased to US$.6,597 Mn by end 2017 increasing from US$.4,529 Mn at end 2016.
International Investment position
In terms of the International terms of position (IIP) which shows the value and composition of the countrys position in external assets and liabilities with the rest of the world, Sri Lankas external liability position as well as the asset position increased as at end 2017 compared to that of 2016. The total foreign assets increased to US$.12,366 Mn primarily due to the increase in the reserve asset position, while the asset position of direct investment, trade credits and advances and currency and deposits also contributed to this increase. Meanwhile the total foreign liability position increased from US$.54,857 Mn at end 2016 to US$.60,721 Mn at end 2017 primarily due to the increase in direct investment, port folio investment, outstanding loan liabilities and trade credit positions. The net liability position of the IIP increased to US$.48,355 Mn at end 2017 from US$.44,591 Mn at end 2016 with the increase of foreign liability position out weighing the increase of the foreign asset position. Despite Sri Lankas net IIP continuing to be negative inflows in the form of direct investment and other non debt creating inflows to the financial account has shown an improvement during the year.
The depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against several major currencies increased the total debt stock in rupee terms by Rs.225.2 Bn at end 2017. The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 2.0%, 5.1%, 7.5%, 10.5% and 13.5% respectively against the US$, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee, Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the Pound Sterling and the Euro during the year. The debt stock in rupee terms has increased further with the continuing devaluation of the currency.
General economic performance
Although the Government has initiated steps in an attempt to restructure the economy, political constraints have stifled the process. The SOEs continue to be a huge burden on the economy with some 230 billion total losses incurred in 2017. SriLankan Airline is one of the biggest problems with a continuing debt burden and no partner being identified despite various attempts. CEB and CPC continue to run at a loss and very little appears to be done other than the introduction of the price based formula for fuel. Hereto the Government has delayed the introduction of this formula which should have been introduced much earlier so that the impact would have been gradual with the gradual increase in OECD fuel prices. The percentage increases are very high specially in kerosene the fuel most used by poor people for cooking purposes, on the excuse that kerosene is being used to dilute diesel for use in diesel vehicles. There have been numerous protests specially by the fisher folk and once again the Government has backed tracked and it is stated that the kerosene price will come down to Rs.70 a litre. If such a price was possible I wonder why the price was fixed at a much higher level.
The overall economy performance in 2017 has been far from satisfactory although the first quarter of 2018 has recorded an increase in export income though but accompanied by a similar increase in import expenditure.
When considering the overall picture the general economic performance could perhaps be assessed to have improved although GDP per capita growth has gone up by only 3.1% the lowest in the period under consideration.
Exports
Quoting from the report, Export performance which was affected adversely during the past 2 years rebounded strongly in 2017, recording the historically highest the value for earnings. The strong growth in export earnings was underpinned by the restoration of the EU-GSP+ facility, recovering external demand, expansion in investment in export related industries, increased commodity prices in the International market, conducive external trade policies, together with strong institutional support and the flexible rate policy maintained by the Central Bank. Export earnings increased by 10.2% to US$.11,360 Mn in 2017 from US$.10,310 Mn in 2016.
It is noteworthy to mention that the total exports in the first quarter 2018 reached US$.1,107 Mn. a 6.3% increase in March and for the 1st quarter increase to US$.2988 Mn or 7.7% growth.
The EDB has projected exports to increase to around US$.18 Bn in 2018 which will be the highest on record. However import values could also increase thereby negating to an extent the growth in exports.
Import performance
Expenditure on imports rose considerably by 9.4% to US$.20,980 Mn in 2017 recording the historically highest value for imports, mainly due to higher fuel imports. Meanwhile expenditure on non fuel imports increased by 5.1% to US$.17,552 Mn.
Inflation
The CCPI moved up from 116.1 in January 2017 to 122.9 in December 2017. Headline inflation as measured by year on year change in the NCPI exhibited an increasing trend. The annual average NCPI inflation gradually increased from 4.6% in January 2017 to 7.7% in December 2017. The CCPI inflation which was 5.5% in January 2017 peaked at 7.8% in October 2017. The annual average CCPI inflation increased from 4.3% in January in 2017 to 6.6% in December 2017. So it is apparent that inflationary trends were on the up.
Employment
The number employed increased by 3.3% to 8208 Mn in 2017 compared to 7948 Mn in 2016. The services continued to be the foremost employment generating sector contributing a share of 45.5% of the total employment in 2017.
The overall unemployment declined to 4.2% from 4.5% in 2016 with a notable decline in the female unemployment rate. The unemployment among the youth, educationally qualified and females continued to remain high despite the low overall unemployment rate.
A large gap has been created between the requirements of job creators and the expectations of job seekers leading to labour shortages in the domestic market. The total number of departures for foreign employment in 2017 declined by 12.6% compared to 2016. In terms of skill levels departures for foreign employment have declined across all categories. It should be noted that the dependence of the Sri Lanka economy on worker remittances needs to be reduced. Socio economic developments such as high youth unemployment have led several Middle Eastern countries to implement national policies to create jobs for the locals and restrict migrant labor. Such scenarios raise significant threats to the ability of the Sri Lankan migrant workers in securing jobs in these markets.
Tourism
The tourism industry remained the 3rd largest foreign exchange earner to the country despite recording a moderate growth of tourist arrivals in 2017. Although it recorded the highest annual arrivals of 2,116,407 in 2017 the year on year growth moderated to 3.2%. Flight cancellations and delays at BIA till April 2017 due to the upgrading of the runway, as well as break out of the dengue in mid 2017 partly contributed to the sluggish performance.
Despite a lower than expected in growth in tourist arrivals earnings from tourism remained healthy with increase average spending and duration of stay by tourists during 2017. Earnings from tourism increased by 11.6% to US$.3,925 Mn from 3518 Mn in 2016. The salutary feature was that the average spending per tourist rose to US$.171 per day from US$.168.2 per day in 2016. Further the average duration was estimated to be 10.9 days in comparison in 10.2 days in 2017.
I am glad to note that one of the recommendations made by me in the earlier report that is to implement the tourist master plan without further delay appears to have been achieved with Sri Lanka being featured on CNN although fleetingly for a few seconds only. Unfortunately the other recommendations made have not been considered. Quoting from the Central Bank report although the tourism sector remains a promising foreign exchange earner, Sri Lanka has not yet tapped its full potential in the global market. Sri Lanka attracted over 2 Mn tourist in 2016 and 2017 but countries smaller than Sri Lanka in the South East Asian regions such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong attract over 10 Mn tourists a year. Therefore to reap the benefit of the untapped potential of the Sri Lanka Tourism industry, it is vital to expedite the implementation of a strategic approach addressed through the TSP 2017  2020. A coordinated effort is needed between the Government and tourism industry stakeholders, through PPP ventures to achieve sustainable tourism targets of the TSP by 2020. In addition Sri Lanka needs to explore potential areas of water related tourism activities such as cruise tourism, whale and dolphin watching, diving and snorkeling, kite surfing as well as pilgrimage tourism, culinary tourism, bird watching, wedding tourism, film tourism and MICE (Meeting, Incentives, Conferences and events) tourism in order to thrive as the countrys key foreign exchange earner.
Most of the strategies mentioned in the Central Bank report were included in my article. In addition I mentioned my concerns about the total number of tourists our tourist infrastructure can absorb without considerable strengthening of the facilities. As it stands there has been an adverse impact under Flora and Fauna of the Wildlife Sanctuaries and the wear and tear on other environmental factors. I commented on the Prime Minister targeting 5 Mn visitors in 2025 and wondered on what basis this target had been fixed because I had concerns as to whether Sri Lanka can sustain such a high level of tourists.
I also highlighted the time taken for tourists to travel from the airport to the popular destinations mainly because, despite the improved road infrastructure as a result of constructing the Airport Expressway and the Southern Expressway, the time taken to go to and from the entrance to the express ways is far too long. The other day leaving Fife Road Colombo at 5 pm on Friday, I entered the Airport Expressway only at 7 pm. I had a similar experience on a previous flight. So it looks as if we have to leave more than 2 hours before departure in order to enter the expressway. Add to this another 2 hours required by the airline to be at the gates could result in 4 hours to be set aside for a flight from Colombo. This is simply unacceptable.
I expressed the view that without spending enormous sums of money and getting further into debt by building express ways we should develop the domestic air routes by developing domestic airports at Katukurunda for Bentota tourist complex, Koggala for Galle, Weeraketiya for the deep South and airport at the Cultural Triangle and an airport for the Passekuda Kalkuda complex. These could be easily developed on a PPP basis with the local private sector involvement or on a BOT basis with foreign investment. I also suggested building golf courses to attract the Golf tourists and building Marinas for the Yachting enthusiasts. No progress appears to be made in this context.
There is tremendous potential for development in tourism in our beautiful island which is situated very strategically in the Indian Ocean which in the future will be the centre of development activities. As such it could be an ideal place for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing and Exhibitions) tourism. As mentioned before, this requires large conferencing facilities which can accommodate around 10,000 people with additional break up facilities and for smaller conferences. A location in the coconut triangle accessible from the Airport Expressway would be ideal as it would be between the Airport and Colombo.
The tourist industry needs a far more dynamic approach than at present. There can be a serious problem in the future with a surplus of rooms when the new hotels such as Hyatt (which appears to be delayed due to disputes with a contractor). ITC which is fast coming up being available for occupancy. In addition John Keells is involved in a massive water front development which will include a 5 star hotel plus conferencing facilities. For some time we had only the Hilton which has now been partly refurbished, the Cinnamon Grand which in my opinion is totally out of date requires a fundamental refurbishment, Galadari which is somewhat neglected, Taj which has been refurbished but not up to 5 Star standard and the Kingsbury, the former Intercontinental refurbished after Dhammika Perera took over but with limitations as the small room size can hardly be changed.
The Shangri-la is in operation but does not appear to be bringing in his own clientele and is competing with the other 5 star hotels, the Movenpick and Cinnamon Red which are budget hotels. The Galle Face has also being refurbished. As a result a large number of new rooms have being created in Colombo. Unless the tourist arrivals increase dramatically it will be difficult to find clientele even for the Colombo hotels.
I am told that in the Galle City and adjoining areas 800 new rooms have been added increasing the competition which has become very fierce. Trincomalee and Nilaweli also appears to have many new rooms. In the Eastern province Passikudah has added a large number of rooms which are occupied only on a seasonal basis.
A large number of new boutique hotels have commenced operations and also estate bungalows converted to tourist hotels providing excellent accommodation at reasonable prices.
In this scenario unless arrivals increased both in quantity and quality we will soon have a situation of surplus rooms.
