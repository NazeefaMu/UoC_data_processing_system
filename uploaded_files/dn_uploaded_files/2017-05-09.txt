100 years of Richmond-Mahinda cricket 1905-2005
The latest addition for cricket fans readership is a book authored by Tiddy Wijeratne, Percy Samarawickrema close friends of former Mahinda cricketer G.M. Sumanathilake de Silva who also contributed in no small measure.
The book consisting of 565 pages delves deep into the history of Richmond-Mahinda cricket and explores the healthy cricketing rivalry that exists between these two great schools in the South.
As the pioneer editor of the volume states, there were many who dreamt of publishing a history of Richmond-Mahinda cricket encounters. They had collected massive amounts of information.
The pioneer authors friend Percy Samarawickrema and Tiddy Wijeratne met and discussed this project. Then it was Percys discussion with G.M. Sumanathilake de Silva that made the project get off the ground with G.M.S de Silva supporting the project financially.
The book is well chronicled and each chapter is devoted decade wise. These encounters are also known as The Lovers Quarrel.
Chapter 1:
The period spanning the latter part of the 19th century when the Richmond-Mahinda series began in the late 1920 was covered by late E.M. Karunaratne, an eminent lawyer former Richmondite and a well-known cricketer of his time.
Chapter 2:
This chapter deals with the encounters in the twenties. Major Simon Wijeratna, a well-respected teacher of Mahinda looks back, during this era Mahinda won more encounters than Richmond.
In the 1929 encounter Mahinda had a strong side .They had wins over strong sides including Colombo schools by large margins and had five centurions. Richmond had only one win. Mahinda were dismissed for a paltry 74 runs. M.D. Jayasinghe contributing 31 runs, Richmond replied with 137 and their captain contributed 52 runs. In their second essay Mahinda fared better and scored 152. Again M.D. Jayasinghe top scored with 58 not out. Richmond had to get only 89 runs and they did it with ease losing only one wicket. This was described as the most glorious victory in the whole series.
Chapter 3:
Shelton Wirasinha, later Principal of Richmond College recalls the encounters in the thirties. It is worthwhile mentioning about Douglas Jayasinghe during this era and W.M.K.de Silva mentions about him as follows, just three months after leaving school he was selected to play for Ceylon, and he was born into a family of cricketers. His father, A.D. Jayasinghe, one time Head Master of Mahinda, opened the bowling for Richmond College. His eldest brother Felix captained Mahinda and Marcus was the famous Mahindian who captained Galle Cricket Club for many seasons.
Douglas joined Mahinda in 1920; he played from 1931 to 1936 captaining in his last 3 years. He represented Ceylon on three occasions. He was also a national selector for ten years and ended up as the Chairman of Selectors.
Chapter 4:
Tiddy Wijeratna (Mahinda 1940-44) recalls The War-Torn Forties
R D Abeygunawardena studied at Richmond from kindergarten to the matriculation class until he left school in March 1942. Soon after he joined government service and in 1967 passed the Sri Lanka Administrative Examination. He also spent eight years in the Foreign Service during which period he served in Singapore, China and Japan. He retired from Public Service as Deputy Food Commissioner in 1981.
R.D. loved his cricket very much. He also represented the college at football and athletics and captained the College cricket team in 1941-1942. At cricket he was exceptionally good as a leg spinner and an opening bat.
Chapter 5:
Lankans unknown World Record a report by A.B. Francis
W. Bennet of Mahinda College was the second Sri Lankan cricketer to have his name in theGuinness Book of World records after Clive Inman.
Bennet achieved his amazing feat way back in 1953 - a full eleven years before Inman performed his feat in 1964 by hammering the fastest fifty in just 8 minutes playing for Leicestershire in a county match. But the importance of Bennets achievement dawned on the record books only 27 years later in 1980. He claimed all ten wickets in an innings playing for his college Mahinda as a wicket keeper, against Galle CC in 1953 at the Galle Esplanade.
Chapter 6:
The big match played in 1964
The author wishes to inform the readers, that two Richmond College, players played with him in The Ceylon Schools Team of 1964, they were L. Kaggodachchi and R B Jayasuriya, the former kept wickets and the latter opened bowling for Ceylon schools, we played against All India schools at St Peters grounds and their team included Eknath Solkar who later played for India with distinction.
Chapter 7
In the opinion of many Upul Sumathipala was the best Mahinda has produced during the seventies although D L S de Silva the pace bowler who played for Sri Lanka also played in this era. Upul had the distinction of captaining the under 25 Tamil Union team in the Sara trophy.
Chapter 8
Athula Samarasekera and Gajaba Pitigala were outstanding Mahinda cricketers in the eighties. Athula played 4 Tests and 39 ODIS for Sri Lanka. Pitigala was a canny left arm spinner, who was chosen as the Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer in the eighties.
Chapter 9
Upul Chandana was outstanding for Mahinda in this era. He was a brilliant fielder for Sri Lanka and played 16 Tests and 147 ODIs. In 2011 Dhananjaya de Silva captained Richmond and he is a real talent for Sri Lanka and will be an asset in the future.
Editable gaps are there in the book and it is left to the future chroniclers to fill them if they intend. The publishers going for a second edition it will be opportune to have a contents page which will be useful for the readers. The stats records are commendable.
In this seminal work the authors have produced a well-researched book which posterity will find invaluable as both a book of reference, for its historical nature, as well as an inspiring read about Richmond-Mahinda cricket. The book deserves to be on the bookshelves of all Mahindians and Richmondites.

Are doctors strikes ethically justifiable
Medical doctors strikes have now become a common Sri Lankan phenomenon. These strikes carry the potential to negatively impact on the quality of healthcare services and, particularly, the deterioration of physician-patient relationship and publics respect for the medical profession.
There was a time, not so long ago, when people looked upon doctors as one of the most ethical and respected professionals as they were regarded as educated and responsible section of the society. People considered them doing a noble job in the country. Whether that image still persists or slowly deteriorating is something debatable today. To be fair, however, the majority of the doctors are doing the same noble work, but the high-pitched voice they collectively emit through their trade union doesnt project the professionalism expected by the common citizen.
Strikes, in general, are a legitimate form of collective protest in a democratic country and as such they are an important weapon that workers possess and use to increase their bargaining power. As an accepted general principle, it is used when negotiations have reached an impasse.
However, health is an exceptionally important human value and hence health care is a paramount social good. In such situation, when a strike is launched by the doctors, the ethical principles of respect for autonomy, justice and fair play all come into conflict. The doctors themselves will have to decide their role  whether to be ordinary employees who are legally entitled to strike work to win their demands or to bow down to their moral obligations to patients and society.
Strikes
GMOA has consistently maintained that they are compelled to action to make their demands met, and that strikes may be chosen as an ultimate choice of action. We should appreciate their line of thinking. However, this argument just does not hold water when one looks back to some of the strike actions initiated by GMOA during the past few months.
Doctors struck work mainly for two major issues. One was Indo-Lanka Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the other was SAITM. These two are national policy issues not directly related to monetary or non-monetary demands of the doctors. Nevertheless, as a registered trade union, GMOA has a legal right to move beyond its workplaces and campaign against national policies and even lobby to help change laws in the whole country and gain new rights for workers. There is no problem in it. They are quite welcome.
But the issue is  should patients suffer due to this struggle Should they
As GMOA quite rightly agreed, strike should be the last resort, if and when, all other avenues of negotiations are exhausted. And, all other forums are fully utilised. The average citizen believes that requirement was not met. And, fair number of citizens and media believe there is a political agenda behind this action.
Ethical justification
Unfortunately, for GMOA, compromise is a distasteful word. Websters New World dictionary defines compromise as primarily a settlement in which each side gives up some demands or makes concessions. Unfortunately, the word compromise has become an ugly term, meaning to selling out. In reality, compromise means working things out, or as Websters says in a secondary meaning, an adjustment of opposing principles. As such compromise is essential to getting things done. It can mean the difference between failure and success. Any seasoned trade unionist will tell us that compromise is essential to the negotiation process.
At the same time, doctors strikes, regardless of the reason for them, had received a lot of media attention and met a great deal of criticism and resistance from the general public as well. In fact, it has aroused intense debate on the ethical justification of medical professionals failing to prioritise human life and their needs, and to find less harmful ways of negotiating their own needs without harming patients.
* In September last year, Chief Executive and Registrar, has set out the latest General Medical Council (UK) advice for doctors. It covers those contemplating industrial actions.
The duties of a doctor are set out in Good medical practice, which says that doctors must make the care of their patient their first concern. Parliament has not fettered the right of doctors to take industrial action, unlike some other professions and occupations. Doctors therefore have a right to strike and take industrial action. The question each doctor must ask, however, before taking action is whether what they are proposing to do is likely to cause significant harm to patients under his or her care or who otherwise would have come under his or her care. This is a matter of professional duty and we expect each doctor to comply with it.
The 1983 Medical Act and the accompanying guidance require doctors to exercise their professional responsibilities in the interests of their patients, to put their patients first and protect them from harm. The GMC has powers under the Act to investigate and apply sanctions to any doctor whose behaviour has fallen consistently or seriously below the standards required. Where we are presented with evidence that a doctors actions may have directly led to a patient or patients coming to significant harm, we would be obliged to investigate and if necessary take appropriate action.
* Editor of the New Zealand Medical Journal, said that the short-term inconvenience of a strike must be balanced against an improvement in care. If doctors (and others) truly believe it is important for patient care, then they must sometimes have the courage to do things that are unpopular and difficult, he wrote. If the conditions that doctors work under put patients at risk, then (on balance) they are morally obliged to strike.
* Editor of Nigeria Africa Health, said that a strike by health workers was the worst option in the business of negotiating for higher wages. The pawn is the public, with human lives and limbs as the bargaining chips, he wrote. He warned that doctors who abandoned their patients were likely to be found guilty of misconduct if tried by the Medical and Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal.
* Doctors strikes are rare in the United States. David Kemp, a lawyer and columnist, said that healthcare providers might ethically leave their patients bedsides to go on strike only when the benefit of the patient was the ultimate goal and only after all other avenues of negotiation had been exhausted.
* In a judgement in 2003 involving the striking government doctors in Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court ruled that Government employees cannot take society at ransom by going on strike. This ruling refers to the moral duties of public employees, such as doctors, concerning the fact that they have no legitimate claim to go on a strike and take the helpless patients at ransom to meet their demands with the government.
In the Code of Ethics and Regulations framed under the Medical Council of India (MCI) Act, it is unconditionally stated that medical doctors cannot refuse treatment to any patient who is in need of emergency medical care and once a physician has undertaken a case, he or she should not neglect the patient, nor he / she should withdraw from the case without giving adequate notice to the patient and the family.
* In December 2010, the Delhi Medical Council issued a statement in response to doctors strike at the Safdarjung Hospital mentioned that it violates the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations and so under no circumstances doctors should resort to strike. Further, in India, the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), 1981 enables the government to ban strikes and demand conciliation or arbitration in certain essential services to maintain proper functioning of the community. In this Act, essential services incorporates any service connected with the maintenance of public health and sanitation including hospitals and dispensaries. Laws like ESMA are not implemented effectively to minimize the negative impact to the public and/or end the strikes.
Oath
Finally, in the context of doctors strike, the significance and meaning of the Hippocratic Oath deserves to be mentioned. The Hippocratic Oath, the first reflective code of professional ethics, is historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically. It enables doctors to adopt a more humane and professional approach to the service.
If the Oath is taken seriously as a binding commitment to place ones special knowledge and skill at the service of the sick, the graduate has then made his profession. He or she enters the company of others with similar commitments. At this moment, one enters a moral community whose defining purpose is to respond to and to advance the welfare of patients  those who are ill, who are in need of help, healing, or relief of suffering, pain or disability.
In essence, all doctors strikes are against someone and causing harm to somebody directly or indirectly. The first moral reason constituting the deliberative presumption (the principles that govern our moral life) against physicians strike is that physicians cause harm to patients through their strikes and harm to patients ranges from physical injury to psychological stress or anxiety to prolonged pain and suffering to added expense in accessing care.
Afterthought
By strike action, doctors and the GMOA are crossing the line, both professionally and morally. As a reasonable common citizen, I strongly support the right of our doctors to vigorously campaign for their inadequate current income, and non-monetary aspects such as better working conditions, adverse administration policy issues and hospitals physical and administrative infrastructure etc.
Yet, to threaten to deliberately affect patient care by forcibly imposing GMOAs own amendments to two National policies, in my opinion, is wrong. Eventually, it could well give an advantage to those who seek to erode the doctors power base, which is built on the respect the patients and prospective patients have for doctors in Sri Lanka.

Army supports UN Vesak Day splendour and national Vesak festival
Sri Lanka Army is throwing their full weight behind the successful conduct of the forthcoming UN recognized island-wide Vesak commemoration, themed Buddhas Teachings for Sustainable Global Peace and the National Vesak festival at State and Army levels.
Security Force Headquarters-West (SFHQ-West), Adjutant General Branch, Army Headquarters and the Army Buddhist Association under the close supervision of the Army Commander Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva, have undertaken to commemorate the phenomenal Thrice-Blessed Day by staging elaborate arrangements across the country with special focus on full-day sil programmes, Vesak decoration zones, concerts of devotional songs (Bakthi Gee), free eateries (Dansal), special religious programmes, etc, Sri Lanka Army said in a release.
The 14th United Nations Vesak Day, as well as Sri Lankas National Vesak festival, take place in Sri Lanka this year on a grand scale under the guidance of the President, Prime Minister and the Ministry of Buddhist Affairs, mustering the support from all state and private sector agencies.
State-sponsored main ceremonies and international conferences have also been scheduled to coincide with this commemorative event at Kegalle, Wattarama Raja Maha Vihara premises and the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) with the participation of a record number of foreign delegates and government leaders. Of 85 countries, representatives of 73 countries have already confirmed their participation in the 14th UN Vesak Day celebration in Sri Lanka. It had been held 11 times in Thailand and twice in Vietnam before the UN offered the opportunity to Sri Lanka.
Symbolising the initial commencement of this years national Vesak celebrations (May 7 - 14) in the country, Minister of Buddha Sasana, on Friday, ceremonially opened the Army-built new preaching hall (Dharmashalawa) at Wattarama Raja Maha Viharaya along Kegalle-Polgahawela road. SFHQ-West troops, under the directions of SF-West Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, brought the construction project to a successful completion with the blessings of the Commander of the Army, the release added.
The Army-built Rs. 50 m worth new Wattarama preaching hall that could accommodate 2,000 devotees, sponsored by the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, is 7,000 sq. ft. in extent and will be a monumental gesture to mark the phenomenon. Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops, together with the support of 8 Gemunu Watch and 8 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment troops, were behind the erection of the much-needed new preaching hall and the renovation of the ancestral Pothgul octagon at Wattarama sacred premises on the advice of the Department of Archaeology. Troops continue to complete other preparations at this sacred temple, in which the last Arahant (perfected person) of Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka resided centuries ago.
The state ceremony at Wattarama Raja Maha Viharaya, headed by Mahanayakes (prelates) of all three Nikayas (sectors), religious dignitaries, the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, Service Chiefs, foreign delegates and a large gathering of devotees, takes place today on a grand scale.
On Vesak Full Moon Day, Army troops of the SFHQ-West at Panagoda Army Cantonment, together with the members of the Army Buddhist Association, will hold a full-day 'sil' observance programme at Panagoda Sri Maha Bodhirajarama temple before the Vesak zone inside the Panagoda Army Cantonment is inaugurated at dusk, in which hundreds of Vesak lanterns and other decorations will remain on display to the public until Saturday.
The special Buddha Rashmi Vesak zone, surrounding the Gangarama temple in the heart of Colombo, will also be adorned by Army-crafted Vesak lanterns and decorations between May 11 - 14. Army troops and members of the cultural troupe would also co-operate with the conduct of the 'mal perahera' (flower procession) at Gangaramaya on Sunday.
Staging of the devotional song (Bethi Gee) concert by way of ballet performances, Inginalu Samagin Vesak Bethi Gee at Nelum Pokuna theatre on May 16 will be a major spectacle organized by the Army on account of the Vesak festival.
Choreographed by professional artistes of the Directorate of Army Band and Performing Arts on the directions of the Army Adjutant Generals office, a team of 150 performing dancers, 40 vocalists to the tune of a 40-member orchestra are expected to stage their spectacular talents during the Inginalu Samagin Vesak Bethi Gee at Nelum Pokuna theatre in the presence of a distinguished gathering. The entire ballet-type show of the Army troops has been lined up, depicting different life stages of the Buddha.
SFHQ-West troops contributing to the Bauddaloka Mawatha Vesak arrangements during May 10 - 13 at Colombo 7 will showcase their artistic talents during a separate devotional song recital and accompanying dancing features that remind Buddhists of old life stories of the Enlightened One.
Near the Vesak zone at Diyawannawa, Parliament grounds stands a huge decorative pandal, put up by the Army, in addition to the number of other Vesak lanterns on display.
A private sponsor has supported the Engineer troops of the Army to erect this pandal. So are the decorative arrangements, being organized by the Army for Vesak zones near the Presidential Secretariat and at Valukaramaya, Kollupitiya, Lake House, Army Headquarters and Kelaniya, Bollegala International Buddhist University premises.
Army troops will meanwhile, coordinate the supply of electricity to more than 300 Vesak lanterns that would be placed along the Galle Face-Fort main road during the Vesak season. Decorations that adorn the Army Headquarters would also cover the Galle Face roundabout and Slave Island.
Meanwhile, island-wide other Security Force Headquarters, including those in the North and the East, have organised their own arrangements in connection with the forthcoming event.
Security Force Headquarters-Jaffna (SFHQ-J), with the support of troops serving all divisions, brigades and units in the peninsula, will decorate the entire Jaffna Nagavihara premises with lanterns and bulbs, erect a special pandal and set up a special Vesak zone near the Jaffna Weerasingham hall during May 10 - 14.
A combined team of Army singers and 20 students from Navatkuli School during two days will conduct Bethi Gee concert, showcasing the spirits of reconciliation, harmony and co-existence.
All those Vesak arrangements are streamlined under the close supervision of Jaffna Security Forces Commander Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi.
Vesak zones, display of Vesak lanterns and decorations, staging of Buddhist dramas, devotional song concerts and conduct of dansal (free eateries) will meanwhile, feature among Vesak arrangements, being organised by the Security Force Headquarters-East (SFHQ-E) covering Polonnaruwa town, Welikanda, Trincomalee and Batticaloa areas on the directions of Security ForcesEast Commander Major General Nandana Senadeera.
At Diyatalawa, Security Force Headquarters-Central (SFHQ-C) has organised a series of arrangements to mark the event. In addition to Vesak lanterns that would be displayed at Muttukumaru ground, SFHQ-C troops on the directions of Security Forces-Central Commander Major General Upul Vithanage, will conduct dansal during May 10 - 12 in the heart of Diyatalawa town.
Similarly, Security Force Headquarters-Kilinochchi (SFHQ-KLN) will also hold a devotional song concert inside a Vesak zone, expected to be held at Lumbini Viharaya. The area is also to be illuminated and the Governor for Northern Province attends the inauguration of the Vesak commemoration in Kilinochchi as the Chief Guest at the invitation of Security Forces- Kilinochchi Commander Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana.
Donation of first-aid boxes to pre-schools, Bodhi pujas/sath Budu Vandana, release of 20 cows meant for butcher, devotional songs, pandals, screening of Buddhist films, blood donation campaigns, display of Vesak lanterns and exposition of sacred relics, are among the host of meritorious activities scheduled during the period.
Meanwhile, Security Force Headquarters-Wanni (SFHQ-W) contributing their share to the commemoration, has organised a series of features in line with the programme, launched by the District Secretariat for Vavuniya.
Conduct of devotional song concerts, dansal and display of more than 400 Vesak lanterns in and around the SFHQ-W premises and display of Buddhist flags take the centre stage in the arrangements, launched on the instructions of Security Forces-Wanni Commander Major General Ruwan Kulathunga.
In the meantime, Security Force Headquarters-Mullaittivu (SFHQ-MLT) joins to mark the event by producing Vesak lanterns and holding dansal around Mullaittivu town area. A special 'sil' campaign will take place tomorrow, inside the SFHQ-MLT premises throughout the day, following instructions given by Security Forces-Mullaittivu Commander Major General Dampath Fernando, Sri Lanka Army stated in the release.

Wenger had failed to win any of his previous 14 competitive clashes against Mourinho dating back to 2004, with his only victory over his old rival coming in the 2015 Community Shield when the Portuguese coach was in charge of Chelsea.
The Gunners boss brought an end to that frustrating streak at just the right time as goals from Granit Xhaka and Danny Welbeck improved Arsenals chances of salvaging a troubled season by finishing in the top four.
Sixth-placed Arsenal are now six points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with four games to play, while Pep Guardiolas side have only three matches remaining.
Downplaying his rivalry with Mourinho, Wenger said: It is not manager against manager.
It was a patiently built win where in the first half you could see we were a bit nervous, but in the second half we took the edge off and scored the goals. Fifth-placed United remain four points behind City with three games left.
Of course, we knew we were not coming in our maximum power. Thats a decision, Mourinho said.
We want to try to win the Europa League. Its more important than finishing fourth. With Mourinho prioritising the Europa League semi-final second leg against Celta Vigo in midweek, United, who hold a 1-0 first-leg lead, fielded a much-changed side in north London.
United can qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League and they may well need to do exactly that after surrendering their 25-match unbeaten run in the Premier League. The Gunners only route back into Europes elite club competition is via a top-four finish, so it wasnt surprising that they played with more hunger than United.
Even so, they still needed a stroke of luck to open the scoring in the 54th minute.
Xhaka blasted a long-range strike that slammed into the back of United midfielder Ander Herrera, looping high in the air before dropping into the net just out of the reach of goalkeeper David de Gea.
If that was a fortuitous way to take the lead, Arsenal had no need to apologise for their superb second goal three minutes later.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain whipped over a teasing cross and when United defender Chris Smalling misjudged the flight of the ball, former United forward Welbeck was perfectly placed to bury his header past De Gea for just his second league goal this season. AFP

Bahubali 2 Indias answer to Game of Thrones
The much awaited Indian film Bahubali 2: The conclusion hit the screens last Friday and has bagged a mammoth opening at the box office. The first part of film was released two years ago and created much hype amidst the Indian movie enthusiast.
The world of Bahubali was conceptualized and executed by the renowned Indian film director SS Rajamouli. The historical fantasy film revolves around the fictitious land Magilmadhi and battle for the kingdom. Since its a period film it comprises a large ensemble and a star studded cast and crew .The popular south Indian actor Prabhas plays both son and the father version of Bahubali , Anuskha plays the portray princess Devasena , Rana Daggubati plays Balladevan and the well experienced actress Ramya Krishnan and Sathyaraj play Sivagami and Kattappa. Even though it serves as a sequel the continuity of the movie is undisrupted it flows like a waterfall sharp and crystal clear. The movie is loosely inspired by the great Indian epic Mahabharata and Ramayana.
Bahubali 2 begins at the point very it ended in the first part. Kattappa narrates on how Bahubali was worshipped by the locals and is s declared as the king after smartly defeating the kalakeya tribe. He is asked to tour the kingdom before coronation, while touring he stumbles upon a warrior princess called Devasena, Bahubali decides to stay back and woo her. Balladeva is furious after hearing this as Bahubali won everything including his mothers heart kingdom and now the beauty, so he plots multiple plans against Bahubali, the rest of the story revolves on how Bahubali conquers the obstacles and how he forgoes the kingdom and his life while doing so. The world famous question why Kattappa killed Bahubali is finally answered after listening to all this Bahubalis son is fueled up and sets on a spree to conquer the kingdom back, and wins back the kingdom.
The award winning art director Sabu Cyril has done impeccable job by given life to the fictitious land , the sets are surreal the swan boat in particular is stunning .
The dialogues were penned by the famous lyrist Madan karky , the characters speak ancient poetic Tamil but it is understandable to great extend the dialogues are powerful and alarming , you end with goosebumps whenever Bahubali utters a lengthy dialogue .
The background score and music uplifts the movie to another next level, the music director has played his cards right by infusing authentic and contemporary music together, the music is so catchy that you will find yourself tapping your feet to the rhythm . Costumes redefine royalty so vivid and detailed, princess Devasena wears drool worthy clothes.
The action sequence are well choreographed , Bahubali and Devasena move like dream when they fight as a team to vanquish the intruders . So graceful!
The plot is nothing new, its the same old battle between good and evil however the vision is new , The visualization of the vision will amaze you , you shall watch the screen with a wonder . Since the story line is intense there is very little room for romance but you are left with a mushy heart whenever Devasena and Bahubali exhibit their love.
The movie is quite lengthy, it finished three hours later and it get a bit drag towards the end so you might lose patience and start to scroll your phone.This movie may be something very simple compared to the things done in Hollywood but considering the fact that Indian cinema makes more of realistic cinema this is something out of the box and anew for the Indian audience .Its not every day that an Indian movie with such extravagance is released hence it deserves all the hype it had .For those of us who were thoroughly bored of Mass hero entry, Madras slang and Mani Ratnam type romances , Bahubali is a must watch as it will break the monotony and be something refreshing .
The movie will be a visual treat, no doubt in that so if youre planning to watch hit go theaters as you get to witness some beautiful landscapes ,pretty ladies and their saris but make sure youve done your homework in others watch part one before jumping into conclusion .

Bairstow stars as England win Ireland series
London: Jonny Bairstow's quickfire 72 not out set up England's 85-run win over Ireland in the second one-day international at Lord's on Sunday.
Victory saw England take the two-match series 2-0 after they had launched their build-up to next month's Champions Trophy tournament on home soil with a comfortable seven-wicket win at Bristol on Friday.
Ireland, in their first ODI at 'the Home of Cricket', fought hard with the ball in front of a 22,000-strong crowd.
But, as was the case Friday, they suffered a batting collapse after a promising start and were dismissed for 243 chasing 329 to win.
Ireland captain William Porterfield did, however, make 82, the top score of the match, as his side, who could be granted Test status next month, restored some pride after being bowled out for just 126 in 33 overs at Bristol.
England risked squandering a strong position when their Dublin-born captain Eoin Morgan (76) and Joe Root (73) fell in quick succession following a third-wicket stand of 140 to leave the hosts 213 for four.
But Bairstow and fellow Yorkshireman Adil Rashid shared a sixth-wicket stand of 88 in just 46 balls that helped take England to 328 for six.
Their county colleague Root was named man-of-the-match after also taking ODI-best figures of three for 52 with his occasional off-spin.
"If we've got guys who can bowl a few overs then it's great," said Root at the presentation ceremony.
"It's been nice to get a few runs, a good stepping stone towards the Champions Trophy."
Morgan added: "We should have been more clinical, one of us should have got a big score, but Jonny and Adil led us home really well."
Meanwhile Porterfield was proud of how Ireland bounced back from their Bristol battering.
"I thought we were much improved today," he said. "After Friday it would have been easy to hide away, but we took a step forward."
Porterfield opted to bowl first after winning the toss in overcast conditions that promised to assist his seamers.
His decision was all the more understandable given Ireland's embarrassing batting at Bristol.
Tim Murtagh, one of several Middlesex players on show, took Ireland's first wicket Sunday when he bowled Alex Hales (32) with a delivery that nipped back up the Lord's slope.
Left-hander Morgan slashed Kevin O'Brien over long-off for six and also deftly late cut the medium-pacer for four.
However, on 39, he nearly played to off-spinner Stirling only for the ball to touch the stumps without dislodging a bail. Root scored his runs in typically calm but brisk fashion on his way to a 57-ball fifty including five fours.
Morgan followed him to the landmark, off 49 balls with two fours and two sixes.
Both batsmen chipped to extra-cover off pacemen Peter Chase and Barry McCarthy respectively. Test wicket-keeper Bairstow, playing as a specialist batsman, led a counter-attack, belting McCarthy high over long-on for one of three sixes in a 44-ball innings also featuring seven fours. Bairstow's charge helped England pile on 61 runs in their last four overs.
Paul Stirling, like Morgan playing on his Middlesex home ground, launched Ireland's reply with 48 at better than a run-a-ball. - AFP

Call to hoist black flags on Vesak Day condemned
Members of the Joint Opposition who are trying to grab votes by spreading false rumours about the proposed new Constitution alleging that it would deny Buddhism its prominent place have displayed their own anti-Buddhist stance by trying to instigate people to hoist black flags instead of Buddhist flags on Vesak Poya day, said Ven. Bendiwewa Diyasena Thera, the General Secretary of Aryange Ekamuthuwa organisation. Ven. Diyasena Thera said he was anxious to know the opinion of Mahinda Rajapaksa about this movement to hoist black flags as Rajapaksa gave unofficial leadership to the Joint Opposition while standing for the Sinhala nation and Buddhism. Ven. Diyasena said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Sri Lanka to grace the UN Vesak Day celebrations was a victory we have achieved as a nation. This showed that political Lilliputians were trying to challenge the Gulliver s in today's politics in order to increase their vote bank by deceiving the people.
Holding of UN Vesak Day celebrations in Sri Lanka was itself a victory achieved by Sri Lanka internationally.
Attempts made to utilise the thrice blessed day for for Buddhists for political gain, displayed the bankruptcy of defeated politicians.

UNCALLED FOR WASTE OF NATURE'S RESOURCES
Recently I got a gift of a slab of chocolate from Greece, which had travelled through the Mideast and yet had not melted one bit when opened here, though it was wrapped ONLY in the well sealed outer covering, bearing the name, logo and other details of the chocolate, in multi colour. There was no inner wrap of gold or silver paper. How sensible!
We too could follow this in all our locally manufactured chocolates, thus eliminating unnecessary waste of forex, saving trees and also reducing our garbage disposal woes. Actually the government should make it mandatory, that there be no useless extra coverings for products. All culprits should be severely punished.
There are some powdered milk packets and biscuit packets which have no cardboard (paper) boxes as outer coverings. These packets are nitrogen - flushed and very well sealed to ensure quality, and safety from contamination from insects and other vermin. The cardboard box and also the outer wrap of chocolates are promptly thrown away as they are opened! Paper is made from trees. Therefore hundreds of trees can be saved if the government makes it mandatory that such unconscionable waste of precious resources of Nature, are stopped immediately by business institutions. Even the dyes etc which are used to print the blurbs on the outer coverings are imported, and therefore a total waste of foreign exchange. The Meethotamulla disaster should make the government think laterally also, so that unnecessary waste of Mother Nature's resources are eliminated by puny, and stupid, and greedy mankind, before she wakes up and very rightly punishes us without mercy.

Dengue vaccine to be introduced soon

A vaccine for dengue will be introduced in Sri Lanka within the course of this year or next, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today he said a scholarly panel is looking at the possibility of registering the French Dengue vaccine in Sri Lanka.
It should be thoroughly checked before registering because the vaccine can make some persons' condition worse. It has previously occurred in some foreign countries where the vaccine was introduced without checking,  the Acting Director General of Health Services said.
Another dengue vaccine is now in the stage of clinical trials, he added.
Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said Dengue has not reached to the epidemic level in Sri Lanka.
On May 16 the Presidential Task Force was called in order to launch a National Dengue Control programme with the participation of all state stakeholders.
Only if a national effort is implemented, dengue will be controlled in Sri Lanka. There is no use of one party or few trying their best or doing their duty to control dengue. Records of Dengue patients this year has increased when comparing with the previous years. There is a possibility of Dengue Type 2 reaching to the epidemic level in Sri Lanka. Therefore all should keep their premises clean especially all dansal organizers should clean the places after holding dansal following the example set by President Sirisena on May Day at Getambe, he added.

Developing countries must share wealth with needy countries - Ravi
Developing countries should share their wealth with needy countries like Sri Lanka and offer credit at lower interest rates, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Addressing the Business Session of the Asian Development Banks 50th annual meeting here, he said that that he was making this appeal on behalf of all developing member countries of the ADB.
Commenting on Sri Lankas economy, he said that in 2016, the countrys economic growth was below expectations mainly due to bad weather conditions.However with focus on key areas, the country will be able to achieve its budgetary proposals, he said.
Sri Lankas economy has shown tremendous resilience in the past countering many adverse situations and the governments strategies to improve growth and dilute the debt servicing could ensure a noteworthy contribution towards the expected evolution of the Asian and Pacific region.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will establish a trust fund to promote the integration of high-level technology (HLT) and innovative solutions in the design and implementation of its projects in Asia and the Pacific.
The Japanese Government will be the first donor to the fund. The High-Level Technology Fund will provide grants for technical assistance projects, investment projects, and recruitment of technology experts to promote the integration of HLT and innovative solutions throughout the project cycle from identification to implementation of ADB financed and administered sovereign and no sovereign projects.
It will encourage more widespread adoption of HLT to address development challenges in ADBs developing member countries.
Enhancing the quality of infrastructure is important in realising sustainable economic growth. Japan welcomes and supports ADBs initiative to incorporate advanced technologies into projects, Japans Deputy Prime Minister and ADB Governor Taro Aso said in his speech during the opening session of the 50th Annual Meeting of ADBs Board of Governors in Yokohama. Japan has been promoting quality infrastructure in Asia, collaborating closely with ADB. To further strengthen the partnership, Japan will provide $40 million over two years to the new trust fund for HLT.
The HLT Fund will be operational by July. It will support a broad range of technologies and innovative solutions that are either new or need scaling-up, not only to improve project impact but also to develop the countries technological capability. The fund may be used for feasibility studies, detailed designs, knowledge transfer, policy advice, pilot and demonstration activities, among others.

Emmanuel Macron is Frances youngest President
FRANCE: Emmanuel Macron has won a resounding victory in the French Presidential election but the focus will shift immediately Monday to whether he can govern the country without the support of a traditional party.
At 39, the pro-EU former investment banker will become Frances youngest-ever President after crushing far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the run-off on Sunday, but he faces a formidable challenge to enact his policy programme while trying to unite a fractured and demoralised country.
He has proposed an ambitious domestic reform agenda including cutting state spending, easing labour laws, boosting education in deprived areas and extending new protections to the self-employed.
But he is inexperienced, has no political party and must fashion a working parliamentary majority after legislative elections next month.
There is scepticism about Macrons ability to win a majority with candidates from his En Marche movement -- neither of the left, nor right -- alone, meaning he might have to form a coalition.
In order for us to act, we will need a majority in the National Assembly, En Marche secretary general Richard Ferrand told TF1 television, adding that only half of the journey had been completed. And his economic agenda, particularly plans to relax labour regulations to fight stubbornly high unemployment, is likely to face fierce resistance from leftist opponents.
He also inherits a country still in a state of emergency following a string of Islamist-inspired attacks since 2015 that have killed more than 230 people.
I will fight with all my strength against the divisions that are undermining us, Macron said in a solemn speech at his campaign headquarters Sunday.
A sea of jubilant supporters waving French flags celebrated outside the Louvre Museum in Paris as the extent of Macrons victory sank in.
With 99.99 percent of ballots counted early Monday, Macron had 66.06 percent of the vote in the first ever election he has contested, far ahead of the nationalist Le Pen at 33.94 percent. Turnout was 74.62 percent.
But in a sign of widespread disillusionment, one in three voters abstained or cast a blank ballot.
Western leaders largely hailed the result after the shock of Britains vote to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump in the United States.
Macron reached out to Le Pens supporters in a plea for unity after a vicious election campaign that exposed deep economic and social divisions, as well as tensions provoked by identity and immigration. They voted out of anger, distress and sometimes conviction. I respect them, he said. I will do everything I can over the next five years to ensure that people no longer have any reason to vote for extremes, he said.
According to a poll Monday, En Marche will receive between 24 and 26 percent of votes in legislative elections, with the Republicans party on 22 percent, the National Front 21-22 percent, the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) 13 -15 percent and the Socialist Party 8-9 percent.
Macron walked on to the stage to the strains of Ode to Joy, the anthem of the beleaguered European Union that he has promised to strengthen after Britains impending exit.
His 64-year-old wife Brigitte joined him on stage with her children and grandchildren.
Hes a symbol of hope, said Jean-Luc Songtia, a 36-year-old driver. Its like Obama eight years ago. Its youth, its hope. His first ceremonial duty comes on Monday when he appears alongside outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande in Paris to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945.
Unknown three years ago, Macron is poised to become one of Europes most powerful leaders and the result will resonate worldwide, particularly in Brussels and Berlin where leaders will breathe a sigh of relief at the defeat of Le Pens anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme.
The euro briefly rallied to a six-month high against the dollar in Asian trade and other financial markets are expected to react positively.
It is a big victory for a part of the population -- and there are many of them -- who identify closely with Europe and a certain vision of globalisation, political analyst Philippe Braud told AFP.
The French election had been widely watched as a test of how high a tide of right-wing nationalism would rise after Brexit and Trump.
Le Pen, 48, had portrayed the election as a contest between Macron and globalists -- those in favour of open trade, immigration and shared sovereignty -- and her patriotic vision of strong borders and national identities.
In a short speech to supporters, Le Pen claimed a historic, massive result and said she had called Macron to wish him success in tackling the countrys challenges.
She said her party needed to undergo a profound transformation ahead of parliamentary elections in June. One of her aides said the party will change its name.- AFP

EU praises Lankas commitment to intl obligations
Sri Lankas renewed commitment to respecting international rule of law and upholding its human, labour rights and environmental obligations has resulted in the European Commission recommending the reinstatement of GSP Plus,European Union ambassador in Sri Lanka Tung Lai Margue said.
In a message to mark Europe Day 2017,the Ambassador said Sri Lanka and European Union reset relationship after the election of a government with a commitment and vision to make fundamental reforms.
We renewed our cooperation, broadening our political dialogue to cover a wide rang of topics from fisheries, exports to trade from agriculture to climate change as well as often difficult and sensitive topics such as national reconciliation,he said.
Excerpts of the message:
The formation and development of the European Union offers important lessons in pursuing goals of peace, stability, and prosperity. South Asia remains the least integrated region in the world despite Sri Lankas tireless championing of the cause, which gives an indication of the potential that could be harnessed by better and increased cooperation.
But within the country, the Sri Lankan Government is in the enviable position of being mandated to chart a definitive course for national reconciliation that recognises an inclusive and collective Sri Lankan identity.
Two years ago, after the election of a government with a commitment and vision to make fundamental reforms, Sri Lanka and the European Union reset our relationship: we renewed our cooperation, broadening our political dialogue to cover a wide range of topics, from fisheries exports to trade, from agriculture to climate change, as well as often difficult and sensitive topics such as national reconciliation, good governance, human rights and the rule of law. Sri Lankas renewed commitment to respecting international rule of law and upholding its international human rights, labour rights and environmental obligations has resulted in the European Commission recommending the reinstatement of GSP Plus. Getting there took many hours of intense collaboration between Sri Lanka and the EU, as together we examined Sri Lankas compliance with the 27 international conventions on which the GSP+ assessment is based.
I hope that our colleagues in the Member States and in the European Parliament will soon indicate that they are happy for readmission to take place.
Our wider cooperation is increasing. We are working with Government to build on our important cooperation in rural development across the country by contributing to work on national reconciliation, including providing funding to support the resettlement of people displaced by the war and supporting language training for public officials to help bring forward the day when all Sri Lankans are able to communicate with public officials in their own language.
Throughout the civil war and in its aftermath, we have worked with community leaders, civil society, and human rights activists to press for the protection of fundamental freedoms and values.
We continue to do so. These efforts are important and they will deepen. But they can only support reform and change in peoples lives where the political will to make those changes exists. Achieving real change requires vision, standing up to spoilers and vested interests, and clearly communicating to all people the importance and benefits of reform.
These are lessons that we have learnt from the development of the European Union. Sometimes they have been learnt
the hard way. But they offer important insights into how the Government can shape the SriLanka of tomorrow.

Farmers water woes
Beneficiary participation in the development projects has been seen as a vital component of the structural adjustment programme. It is an extension of worldwide enthusiasm for privatization of services and empowerment. Participation is an essential ingredient to implement market friendly policies, a supportive and flexible public sector and a discreet mix of de-bureaucratization, decentralization and de-regulation.
To create legitimate participation of intended beneficiaries in a project, firstly beneficiaries should get an opportunity to play a significant role in decision making which must go beyond mere consultation. Secondly, evolution of an appropriate form of local organisation is necessary to use as a vehicle participation. Thirdly, timing of beneficiary involvement must be right from the initial stage of the project to get most effective participation.
There is a growing uneasiness among irrigation researchers, policy planners, politicians and donors of the gap between potential and actual performance in the irrigation projects. Several reasons have been forwarded for the cause of problem.
The research findings show that the primary or fundamental problem of irrigation performance is not engineering, but the formation and functioning of effective user organisation. Beneficiary participation in irrigation system planning, designing, construction and management has cost and benefits for both the farmers and the government. It is said that active farmer involvement is cost effective in terms of mobilization of local resources, improvement and maintenance activities, reduction of irrigation staff time, provision of local wisdom for better design and planning of the systems, reduction in destruction of facilities, improved fee and fine collection, resolution of disputes and provision of an organised means for extension and farmer training. This will also contribute to greater community cohesion and empowerment which could be utilized effectively for other development as well.
There are several costs to be incurred by government agencies, when initiating the participatory development through the formation of Water Users Association (WUAs). Under this list of costs, there may be several activities including conduct of action research about a field situation for a socio-technical profile, mobilizing field staff and organisation and providing necessary training to the WUAs as well as to the officers. Costs are usually definite and certain, whereas the benefits from participation are ambiguous and uncertain, specially determining the amount of net benefit is extremely difficult.
There are obvious benefits for both the government and the beneficiary farmers from well organised and co-ordinated participatory development programmes. The success is dependent on the degree, time and ways of beneficiary participation. Therefore, the governments should use appropriate strategy and necessary intensives to get the participation before the WUAs are formed by direction or persuasion.
Participation of water users in decision making in connection with the irrigation reservoir from where they draw water, is one of the key concepts of sustainable development. According to the available literature on IMT experiences the world over, the sustainability of a participatory irrigation management (PIM) programme basically depends on the water users activities, control structure and of organisation activities. The performances of these activities are determined by the following factors.
(1). Sustainability of the Water Users Association (WUA)
(2). Bureaucratic re-orientation and political will for PIM
(3). Physical condition of the turnover irrigation infrastructure
(4). Economics of irrigated agriculture.
Water users associations
The basic intensive for farmers motivation to involve in sustainable action is based on the WUAs performance in water management, operation and maintenance (O&M) and organisational management activities. Water users in an irrigation system are inter dependent for water and its management process within a water course and between the water courses. Water wanted in one part of the system might deprive farmers in the other parts.
The WUA can involve in the provision of services to the farmers such as the provision of agro chemicals, fertilizer, seed materials and credit etc and undertake maintenance and rehabilitation contracts from the line agency, livestock enterprises and fisheries, marketing of agricultural products, operation of farm machinery and so on. The provision of multiple services would in theory strengthen the WUAs and assist in their sustainability through the necessary finance to manage the irrigation system as well as the organisation.
The government commitment, political will, formal supports towards organisation development and farmers self management and legal backing are necessary conditions for the sustainability of WUAs. Having a clear legal entity and effective sanctions against rule breakers can substantially reduce opportunistic behaviour. The government has to create necessary conditions and suitable legal reforms to enforce sanctions against opportunistic farmers. The legal framework should be strong and transparent which provides farmers rights and benefits as well as duties and responsibilities.
The water user participation in decision making and water allocation is not sufficient for effective irrigation system management. It requires a well disciplined organisation at the top level, which is responsible for executing, policing the system and prosecuting delinquencies. Therefore, for a successful participatory irrigation management, there must be a strong commitment from the agency and the need to share knowledge, information and authority with the farmers. Moreover, they must fulfil their role in the system management.
The weaknesses in the maintenance and water distribution at the main system level have a significant effect on farmers ability to manage water at the farm level. An irrigation system as a socio-technical profile requires more than just farmer involvement. The involvement of farmers in the system management will not be fruitful unless the main system management is effective and responsive to farmers needs.
Incentive to mobilizes cash and materials towards the WUAs is highly dependent on the economics of irrigated agriculture. Therefore irrigation management component should be adopted as an integrated package with other aspects of irrigated agriculture such as extension, input supply, credit and marketing which influence farm productivity and income level.
There must be parallel programmes to solve the farmers agricultural problems which bound the achievement of high productivity and increased income. Physical condition of the irrigation infrastructure has an effect on timeliness and reliable supply of water deliveries, which is the major tangible benefit of the farmers for their participation. Thus, functional irrigation facilities is one of the major factors determining the sustainability of participatory irrigation management.
Further, physical condition of infrastructure should be able to be operated and maintained by the user community within the limits of their resource capacity and technical knowhow.
PIM and Irrigation Management Turnover (IMT) are a worldwide trend in the irrigation sector development and management. The various governments have made considerable amount of investments for institutional development for mobilization of farmers and for legal and policy reforms. Therefore sustainability of the PIM is a crucial aspect in the irrigation and water management sector.
PIM Policy in Sri Lanka
The PIM policy is not solely a cost recovery policy: rather it was seen as a strategy of cost reduction and transferring power and authority to beneficiary groups. The main goals of the PIM policy of the government of Sri Lanka have been twofold. Firstly improving the irrigation performance and secondly reducing the government expenditure on O&M by transferring the part of the O&M responsibility to user groups. Therefore the policy emphasizes the change in the traditional role of farmers from passive recipients of irrigation benefits to active partners in the management process sharing responsibilities with irrigation agency staff. Under the PIM policy, the government has to continue the financial allocations to the irrigation agency for O&M of the head works and main cannels (MCs). The O&M task of distributory cannels (DCs) and field cannels (FCs) are responsibility of FOs.
PIM programme implemented in Sri Lanka towards IMT since 1992, has been studied by many researchers in specific projects and locations. Past study findings show mixed results on the performance of PIM in irrigation system management, water use efficiency, agricultural production and the government cost reduction. Amidst these mixed results and pros and cons, PIM has continued to be the major irrigation management policy in Sri Lanka to date.

FIFA finances extremely solid - Infantino
Manama: FIFA president Gianni Infantino claimed on Monday that the finances of footballs governing body were extremely solid, despite it posting a $369 million loss earlier this year.
Speaking at the Asian Football Confederations congress in Bahrain, Infantino said the losses were in line with FIFAs business model and there was no need for it to give artificial figures.
In spite of what some have been trying to write or to say, FIFAs finances are extremely solid, Infantino told delegates in a short address.
He added that it was normal for FIFA to make losses for three years and then make revenue during the fourth financial year, when a World Cup takes place.
Thats how the business model is conducted, he continued.
We dont need to tell you other stories, we dont need to make our figures artificial (or) look better by some accounting measures.
The situation is that the finances of FIFA are extremely solid.
FIFA has said previously that its losses could increase throughout this year, but rebound in 2018 to a profit of $1 billion, largely due to TV deals from the Russian World Cup.

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by the Colombo Fort Magistrate was yesterday re-fixed for support on August 28 by Supreme Court.
Three-judge-bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Upali Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General was given further time to seek possibility of releasing funds from several frozen bank accounts belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga following his request to do so.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of UdayangaWeeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner. In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv,Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner.
The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the Constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006. In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircrafts at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983.
He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine. President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Gearing up for Guinness
Hailing from a family of musicians, Chennais Isaimamani M.S. Martin grew up on musical notes and has been naturally drawn towards practicing Carnatic music right from the age of five. After years of learning and later teaching Carnatic melodies on the keyboard to hundreds of students, Martin has been using music as a way to create awareness on a number of societal issues. Alongside this, he has been setting world records for his mega keyboard concerts, with many students playing the instrument along with him in unison.
After his Guinness World Record in 2011 for a keyboard concert with 109 participants, Martin is all set now to break it with a whopping 550 students this time, on May Day, at the St. Bedes Centenary Auditorium. The idea is to create awareness to stop child labour. Children, between 7 to 17 years, who are young keyboard musicians from the state, will all be coming together to raise their voices against the issue. Visually and economically challenged children from aided schools will also be part of the group. They will be playing songs like Acham Acham Illai from Indra, Mahatma Gandhis favourite Raghupati Raghava Rajaram, and others in unison, explains Martin, adding, The students little fingers will play melodious music in support of their fellow working hands and will call out attention for educating the underprivileged children.
Martin, who has spent around three decades teaching Carnatic music on the keyboard, has risen to become one of the most-sought after tutors in the field. Keyboard is mostly considered an instrument that can play only western music, but there are many classical Indian tunes that it can produce. I have also been working with keyboard companies on making necessary additions to the instrument so as to allow playing Carnatic renditions on it better, Martin adds. The musician hopes to continue making music that aids in facilitating a larger good. Deccan Chronicle

Although the state media is biased, unethical and cunning, the current Cabinet Media Minister is good, but he has to control his deputy, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said. Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the worst Media Minister was Mangala Samaraweera and the media was worst at that time. But now media, especially state media has fallen to a lower level than during his time.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the GMOA is able to launch a tough strike but then a large number of patients will die. On the other hand, the main objective of the GMOA is protecting patient's lives and not letting them be destroyed by unqualified and sub standard doctors.
Changing Governments will not solve the SAITM issue. Only changing policies will solve it. GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya is a law-abiding person. The previous Government filed court cases against him. The GMOA does not make or break Governments. If anyone thinks so, something is wrong with his thinking, he said.
The GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the conduct of the present Government is not practising good governance. Suppressing trade unions is not good governance. It is a violation of human rights.

Gota visited Chandrika and discussed her security during previous regime: MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had visited former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and discussed her security requirements under his directive.
Rajapaksa in a statement said that former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa, after a discussion with her chief security officer provided her with personnel and facilities.
The Former President rejected the statements by some politicians that he filed a motion before Supreme Court to obtain an order to reduce the security of former President Kumaratunga.
The statement: A statement by certain government politicians to the effect that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had filed a motion in the Supreme Court to obtain an order reducing the security of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga has been given much publicity. We unreservedly reject that statement.
Neither President Mahinda Rajapaksa nor the Presidential Secretariat nor the Defence Ministry filed any such motion. The case that is being referred to was filed by an NGO.
At a request by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had gone to see her at her residence and after a discussion with her chief security officer, provided her with the personnel and facilities. Despite the court ruling, no change was made in her security arrangements.
The requests by her chief security officer at various times, were always met.
Certain bankrupt politicians are making statements aimed at justifying their own vengeful action in the eyes of the public. Under this government, there have been attempts to revive the LTTE. Earlier, this year, a plan by the LTTE diaspora overseas to use former LTTE operatives to assassinate a TNA Parliamentarian was uncovered with several arrests being made. Two claymore mines which were to be used in the attack were also recovered. Dangerous LTTE operatives held in detention are being released by this government. My government rehabilitated over 11,000 LTTE terrorists, and kept only a couple of hundred hardcore terrorists deemed impossible to rehabilitate, in detention. These are the operatives who were released by the government. It is in such a backdrop that former President Mahinda Rajapaksas security contingent has been reduced in numbers.
I wish to emphasise that it is the bounden duty of the present President and Prime Minister to ensure the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who ended the three decade long war.

GSP+ through special gazette notification in Brussels on May 15: Mangala
The GSP plus tax concession lost by Sri Lanka during the Rajapaksa regime will be restored shortly through a special gazette notification issued in Brussels on May 15, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera at a meeting held in Matara on May 7. The meeting was held to thank UNP members and supporters who attended the partys May Day rally at Campbell Park.
Minister Samaraweera said the ban imposed on Sri Lankas fish exports to the European Union was also lifted sometime ago after the government assumed power. Now the export market had been opened for the fishing community.
Samaraweera said they were quite aware that party supporters were somewhat disgruntled over the governments failure to deliver during the past two years. The government was in the process of regaining the lost rights and benefits to the country from the outside world.
Party supporters encountered problems as regards employment and job transfers etc. The government hoped to look into them and grant relief soon.
The minister said a large number of party supporters attended the May Day rally held in Colombo. He was unable to attend the rally due to health reasons because he was after surgery.
He said the SLFP rally presided by President Maithripala Sirisena too attracted a massive crowd. If the two parties forming the National Government joined hands and held a single rally they could have mustered crowds almost five times bigger than the Galle Face crowd.
However, they did not have such a low mentality to display crowd attendance. What matters most was winning elections.
Minister Samaraweera said they were prepared to allow Mahinda Rajapaksa to fill Galle Face until 2025. However, they were not even allocated Hyde Park for a meeting during the Rajapaksa regime, Samaraweera said. The Foreign Affairs Ministry under his purview had provided all facilities to Mahinda Rajapaksa to travel abroad without restriction.
A group of conspirators were unnecessarily dragging the SAITM issue to spite the government. The doctors strikes would not succeed in toppling the government since no room would be given to such sinister attempts.
Samaraweera said that even though he did not wish to comment on SAITM he wished to categorically state that private universities were needed in the country as only about 25,000 students among those who qualified for university education managed to enter State universities while a vast majority was shut out.
Former Mayor of Matara Upul Nishantha, former MMCs Nalin Ranasinghe, Nalin Abeygunawardena, Nuski Iqbal and Nandasena Sellahewa were also present.

Invest SL Forums spark renewed interest among Australian investors
Foreign inflows originating from Australia have recorded a marked improvement in April, recording a surge since the recently conducted Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forums in Australia.
The daily average inflows originating from Australia since the forum has marked an improved to Rs. 23.22 million, rising from an average of Rs. 0.87 million recorded over the preceding 11 months.
In total, Australian inflows have contributed a total of Rs. 487.62 million since the events Down Under - a 94% portion of the total purchases originating from the country in 2017.
The post forum surge in investment from the country has also placed Australia as the seventh largest contributor to foreign purchases in the month of April, a marked improvement from its ranking of 14 prior to conducting the events in 2017 and 19 in 2016.
Commenting on the development, CSE Market Development Head Niroshan Wijesundere said they are pleased to see the events in Australia having a positive effect on the turnover flowing in from the county.
"This is consistent with a trend that we have experienced with Foreign Investor Forums conducted in the past, where these events almost immediately rejuvenate the interest in the Sri Lankan capital market. The presence of the stock brokers who traveled with the delegation to Australia also played a vital role in following up and securing such investments.
He also pointed out that partnering with event sponsors and the Sri Lankan High Commission in Australia, the Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka, bilateral associations and business councils was critical to hosting three successful Forums in both Sydney and Melbourne.
A strong community of individuals with a Sri Lankan origin eager to look at new Sri Lankan investment opportunities and the celebration of 70 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Australia presented the CSE with a unique opportunity to promote the capital market in Australia.
Growth in overall foreign investor contribution to turnover
Overall foreign investor activity has also recorded a rise in 2017, with a net foreign inflow of Rs.16.5 billion, a vast improvement compared to previous years, which recorded an inflow of Rs. 383.5 in 2016 and an outflow of Rs. 5.3 billion in 2015. Foreign investor contribution to total turnover in 2017 stands at 50.1%, another improvement in comparison with 42.0% in 2016 and 34.4% in 2015, which also points towards a growing interest among foreign investors in the Sri Lankan capital market. On another note, the share price indices at the CSE have also made consistent gains in the month of April, with The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI), crossing the 6,500 mark on Thursday the April 20. The index closed at 6,602.44 points by the end of trading for 4th May 2017, a 6.01% increase in the index in 2017 (year-to-date).
The S&P SL 20 index, which features the CSE's 20 largest and most liquid stocks has also improved consistently, making a 8.26% gain in 2017 (year-to-date) and closing at 3,785.15points by Thursday May 4, 2017. Overall trading activity has also improved in 2017, with the Daily Average Turnover recorded for trading in 2017 (year-to-date)marking an improvement to Rs. 901 million from Rs.737.2 in 2016.

Just Nail it!
One of the hottest accessories that a girl can possess is eye-catching nail art. Thats why the world is so full of them and a new trend emerges every day. Pauline Feinauers name is synonymous with nail art. The Polish lady who resides in Germany is the World Champion in Nail Master Class (Nail pro Championships Munich 2009) and has won over 30 international Prizes in Nail Art Technology.
She is the owner of the Pauline Feinauer Beauty Academy and is the CEO of the famous German Championship: Nail Master Competition. She is an author, cover -author, show master on international fair trades, world renowned judge and competitor. She has travelled across the globe sharing her experiences and nurturing budding nail artistes. She has done nail art for quite a number of celebrities including Rihanna. She even has her own German Reality Show Star on her own TV Series "Beauty Profi".
The renowned nail art expert was recently in Sri Lanka. The Daily News engaged in a tte--tte with her to find out what is the in thing in the industry.
I have been a nail tech artiste since 2005. I was a journalist before I took to nail art full time. Everything was not pre planned. I have always been concerned about having beautiful nails. Once we moved out of the city and I could not locate a nice nail salon. Then my husband suggested that I do things by myself. So it started off as a hobby at the beginning before I realized that I am a natural at it, Pauline said.
She took a two day class on nail art meant for housewives at the Golden Nails in Frankfurt. That was the beginning of a long journey which brought her to the top of the industry.
I always loved art. We studied history and art at college. Nail art is done according to the tastes of a person. One cannot say that a particular creation is beautiful for everybody. Art is like yoga for me. I ponder over it and many things including people inspire me in creating my designs, Pauline expressed.
She notes that whenever she comes across a design that captivates her, she tries to take a picture of it and tries to incorporate it into a nail design.
Here in Sri Lanka you have thousands of inspirations. There are many flowers of different colours which we do not have in Europe, she added.
She says that the most important chore for a nail artiste is to protect the natural nail. All the pigments used in nail art has a hazardous effect on the natural nails.
If you use nail polish it is ok to put the art on the nails but never do nail art on the natural nails without a base. A lot of people have issues with natural nails. They break or chip easily. They destroy the beauty of their natural nails due to their profession. People seek our help at the nail studios because having nice nails has become a vital factor in the 20th century, she said.
She says that there are no rigid rules in the profession of a nail artiste. A basic nail design lasts for about four to five weeks because nails tend to grow quickly.
It is really old fashioned to say that certain colours go only with certain skin tones. Everything is possible in 2017. The only thing to consider is that you need to feel good with those colours. I believe in karma so my mantra is open your mind. Do not believe it when people say you cannot do it. Practice and make it happen, she stressed.
Pauline says that square nails are totally out and oval shaped nails are in. Nude and natural colours or really crazy fantasy nail art are the trends of the season. All things in between are clich. Once can never have enough flower samples because those are things that the clients usually go for.
Speaking about nail prints she notes that it not her thing.
We work hard with our hands to create designs. I believe that it is a totally different sector. We are professionals. There are a lot of cheap places which put a few flowers on the nails and call it nail art. Beware of such places. You need knowledge to climb up the ladder in this profession. Take care of your nails because they will be with you till the end of your life, she advised.

Lancashire have signed experienced Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene for the upcoming T20 Blast campaign.
He played for Somerset last season and has since appeared for Karachi Kings and Central Stags in T20 competitions in Pakistan and New Zealand.
The 39-year-old helped Sri Lanka win the 2014 World T20 and has scored 5,455 runs in the games shortest format.
I cant wait to watch him bat, Lancashire head coach Glen Chapple told BBC Radio Lancashire.
He has a massive amount of experience in T20 cricket, in cricket all around the world and great captaincy experience. Hell add in all areas for us.
Lancashire won their first T20 Blast title in 2015, but failed to progress from the group stage last season.
Board member Paul Allott told BBC Radio Lancashire in January that the Red Rose county were looking to sign an iconic player or coach for T20 cricket.
Jayawardene is their second signing for the Blast, which runs from 7 July to 2 September, and will play alongside Pakistan fast bowler Junaid Khan.
He does not count as an overseas player as he has been granted a spousal visa because his wife is Danish.
Former Sri Lanka captain Jayawardene said: Lancashire is a huge county with a fine history in the game. There is a young group of players at the club and Im really looking forward to the opportunity to working with them and to be part of the T20 campaign this summer.
I havent won the NatWest T20 Blast in my career and its a trophy Id love to experience success in this summer with Lancashire Lightning. - BBC

M.A. Bakeer Markar, speaker of sri lanka (1978-1983) : Well deserved centenary birth anniversary celebration
The late Bakeer Markar was a politician and a gentleman par excellence, a man worthy of emulation. In 1978 when I served as OIC Crimes of the Mannar Police, Bakeer Markar as Speaker of Parliament visited the Mannar Peninsula and that was when I first set eyes on this distinguished gentleman.
My older brother Ibrahim Hamid, who later retired as a Senior Superintendent of of Police, was attached to the Presidential Security Division. He informed me that Markar wanted a bachelor and teetotaller for his Security Division. Since I had served in the North and East from 1973 to 1979, I felt it best to make a break and be close to my family in the process.
In 1979, I was transferred from Mannar to the Ministerial Security Division as Personal Security Officer to the Speaker. I reported for duty at Mumtaz Mahal - the official residence of the Speaker - and met his Private secretary, Azver, who introduced me to the Speaker in his office.
Having first surveyed the inner and outer perimeters of the residence, I became well acquainted with the place and able to carry out my duties. We had a team of five police officers, a backup security jeep and a motorcycle escort from the Traffic Police Headquarters. On our first visit to Parliament, as required, I did a thorough survey of the inner and outer perimeters of Parliament to gain first-hand knowledge for security coverage.
On the day after my arrival at the residence, I noticed a large crowd waiting to meet the Speaker, most of them from Beruwala. I briefed my men on their duties and proceeded to the office where the public were allowed to call on the Speaker. Some of those who were closely attached to the Speaker were unhappy about the security procedures adopted by me as they were used to coming and going as they pleased and being scattered all over the residence.
When we reached Parliament, I was summoned by the Speaker to his chambers. I was told that although he was satisfied with the security detail, it was necessary for me to ensure that the public were made comfortable when visiting, for without them he would not have come to that position. It took some time for me to adjust but in time, I was gradually able to gain the confidence of those who visited the residence.
In accordance with tradition, Speakers were required to visit Parliament only when Parliament was sitting; in the first and third week of every month. However, Bakeer Markar visited Parliament regularly except for week-ends and public holidays. Parliamentarians who were under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Parliament gradually began to adjust to seeing the new Speaker constantly in Parliament and he won the hearts of all except for a few.
The Speaker was quick to detect some discrepancies in Parliament and made a written request to the Auditor General to have Parliament audited. This was along overdue and to the surprise of the Parliament staff, all matters started functioning smoothly after the auditing.
All Members of Parliament delegated to go abroad on official visits came under the purview of the Secretary General of Parliament. However, since Mr. Markar took charge of this subject, a roster was drawn to ensure that equal opportunities were given to all Members of Parliament to go abroad on official duties. One day while in Parliament, the then MP for Galle, Albert Silva, requested to see the Speaker and I accompanied him to the Speakers Chamber.
Silva bowed at the Speakers feet and was promptly asked to sand up. He then thanked the Speaker profusely in Sinhalese for the opportunity given to him to go abroad, bowed again and left smiling broadly. One occasion, a senior Cabinet Minister requested permission from the Speaker to join a delegation proceeding to Geneva, so he could visit a close relative. However, he was informed that his request could not be complied with and he would have to await his turn on the roster. The Senior Minister then fell out with the Speaker and did not speak with him till his term was over.
The routine of the Speaker was to visit Parliament on week days and the Beruwala electorate on week-ends. Large gatherings from all walks of life were constantly seen at his Arab Road residence in Beruwala and each individual attended to, to their complete satisfaction. He was an extraordinary humanitarian, visited close friends and relations, attended weddings and funerals and went wherever and whenever he was needed AS President of the Muslim League Youth Front Youth at Heart, he travelled to the four corners of the country, continuously meeting people and giving redress to their needs. All petitions and requests were perused in his chambers and the relevant Ministers were summoned to deal with and give redress to the humanitarian problems of all concerned.
While the new Parliament was under construction at Kotte, the Speaker visited whenever time permitted to look into its progress. While it was half way through, it was observed that according to the construction plan, there was not floor for the Speaker of Parliament. This was brought to the notice of the President and the Prime Minister who obliged by allocating the first floor to the Office of the Speaker.
When the new Parliament was convened at Sri Jayawardenepura, Kotte in 1982, many meetings were held pertaining to his security matters, chaired by the Speaker. On matters of security, the then ASP Milroy Cruz informed that in the old Parliament, police personnel were able to obtain meals at their convenience but this was not possible in the new Parliament due to security reasons and suggested that meals be provided by Parliament.
The then Secretary General flatly refused to accede to this request, which made the Speaker question what duties were preformed by the Police, which the Secretary General had to concede was providing security to Parliament. The Speaker then questioned whether that did not include providing security to all of us. The Speaker then made a ruling that the Parliament Police Division were to be given meals by Parliament. The entire Police Department thanked the Speaker profusely for this magnanimous humanitarian gesture.
Markar was the Founder President of the Iraq-Sri Lanka Friendship Association and remained in this position until his demise. He was closely connected with President Saddam Hussein and through that connection convinced the Iraqi Government to build the Saddam Hussein Village in Eravur for the cyclone victims in the Eastern Province. Markar was personally invited by the Iraqi Ambassador in Sri Lanka to participate at the annual Bath Party Anniversaries on behalf of President Saddam Hussein.
One evening in Parliament, the Hon. Speaker informed me that the President had summoned him for an urgent discussion in an hour, and we had to proceed to Presidents House. Half an hour after our arrival, the Speaker came out with a big smile and when I asked him on the way back what had happened, he informed me that the President had requested him to submit his resignation as Speaker to accommodate a Senior Cabinet Minister and that he had done so.
I instantly replied that he should have contacted his supporters to get their views before making such a decision. He laughed at my naivete and said he strongly stood by Party decisions. After his resignation, he was sworn in as Minister without Portfolio and moved into one of the Stanmore Crescent residences. Though numerous calls and efforts were made to contact the Secretary to the President, we were eventually informed that he was not available. Finally Markar told me that enough was enough and he was quite content to serve as Minister without Portfolio and serve the community at large.
After Premadasa became President, Markar was appointed Governor of the Southern Province and his staff started to shift his residence to Beruwala which turned out to be the Governors Residence too.
When the UNP returned to power in 1989, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar was sworn in as State Minister for Housing and used to visit Beruwala on weekends to meet members of the public.
One morning, the Governor summoned me and in the presence of the State Minister requested me to take care of his security detail as I had done for him. I was aghast, my eyes filled with tears and I was speechless. I then said that when I get a capable officer to take charge of his security detail only, I would take the Security of the Minister.
That was when I realised that the reason the governor wanted me to do this was so I would be close to my family members in Colombo. This was yet another facet I discovered in you Sir, a man among men, a humanitarian act which I will never forget in my life, or the quintessence of the gentleman who performed it.
Sir, you epitomized a gentleman in every sense of the word, thank you for what we are today because of what we learned from you. You taught us not to limit our challenges, but to challenge our limits!

Macron vows to unite France in victory speech
The pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron has won the French presidency in a decisive victory over the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, and vowed to unite a divided and fractured France.
Macron, 39, a former economy minister who ran as a neither left nor right independent promising to shake up the French political system, took 66% to Le Pens 34%.
His victory was hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trumps victory in the US election.
Turnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.
Macron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is Frances youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war. Addressing thousands of supporters in the grand courtyard of the Louvre, the vast Paris palace-turned-museum, Macron said he would defend France and Europe. He said Europe and the world are watching us and waiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places.
He promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.
Speaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: Everyone said it was impossible. But they didnt know France! - THE GUARDIAN

Marked increase in residential, commercial land prices
Lamudi's annual real estate market report on Sri Lanka is released. Each year, Lamudi's researchers take an in depth look at the emerging markets where they operate. After consolidating the most important information about the economy and the local market, a whitepaper is created. This whitepaper aims to inform potential investors about the market, its potential, and its challenges.
Outside of the realm of investors, anyone interested in Sri Lanka's real estate industry can consult this useful report. Readers can gain all the information they need without needing to hunt through data hidden on sites across the web.
Taking a look back at 2016
As well as focusing on the real estate market specifically, this year's whitepaper reports economic trends which emerged within the country over the last year. Sri Lanka's economy is going from strength to strength with steady growth, increased urbanisation leading to greater wealth, and a rapidly expanding tourism industry.
It is clear that the country has experienced an impressive revival since the end of the war in 2009. Positive trends indicate that now is a great time to invest in a country which is encouraging increasing amounts of foreign investment.
Real estate market report
With state of the art modern high rise buildings adorning Colombo's skyline these days, it is fair to say that Sri Lanka's real estate landscape has changed dramatically since peace was declared. Infrastructural development on the island is underway and although the focus of large commercial developments is still on the capital, other cities, such as Kandy, are on the cusp of booming thanks to increased tourism numbers.
Since Colombo's growth is happening faster than elsewhere, both residential and commercial land and property command higher prices in the city. Property prices are increasing in both sectors. However, property across the island remains affordable with young professionals being the main purchasers of residential city property. Apartment living was not a concept that was familiar to most Sri Lankans until recently. It seems that living habits are changing with vertical living becoming the norm as the country becomes increasingly developed.
Changes that took place in 2016
Alongside price trends, this year's whitepaper outlines demographic trends and changes in laws which are encouraging new target markets, including overseas investors. The new visa options available for potential buyers are detailed in the whitepaper as well as plans to initiate real estate investment trusts.
Sri Lanka is emerging from being under global investors radar to being a destination for profitable business decisions. 2017 looks hopeful as many world class developments are underway. Next year's whitepaper promises to bring yet another balanced report on this flourishing haven for property seekers.(www.lamudi.com)

Masking a slip of the lip with wit while going hip
Some people are so sharp they can really think on their feet. I too usually think better on my feet. Besides, it makes it easier for spectacular theatrical exit lines. And never mind the slanderous minority who claim I favour the vertical position because I usually sit on my brains. My friend Sepala, a Sri Lankan jeweller is a master of the art. His family has been in the gee-gaw business for three generations. Their establishment in Hong Kong is one of the most trusted names in the region. As an experienced jeweller he never underestimates a potential client by the mode of his attire. From the 1960s and well into the mid 1970s the Hippies were a common sight in every Asian capital.
Fashions of the 1960s reflected youth. From the child-like short skirts of the mid 60's to the costume type outfits of the hippies, clothing took on new lines, colour, and a reflection of vibrant optimism mixed with an idealistic yearning for a new egalitarian society. The youthful population of the 1960s wore short skirts, geometric prints, and bright colors. From the casual sophistication of the early 60's, to the Pop Art and Op Art influences of the Mods, dress styles went through radical changes. Women had never shown so much skin. Men grew their hair long. Young people rejected traditional clothing until second half of the decade, a kind of style anarchy created a new Bohemian look introduced by the hippie movement.
It was a time when young men and women began to reject the dress codes of a conservative past when the elite establishment ruled fashion. People no longer dressed according to social position or time of day.
So Sepala greeted a bohemian who entered his showroom with all the due respect he would have displayed towards any potential customer. The beatnik sauntered in and said: Peace be with you, pardner. Im Mickey, a Hippy from Mississippi! Sepala knew the man was British because of his rather low-class English accent. Never at a loss for one-liners, he gestured an expansive welcome and quipped: Im Seppy from Olu Pippy. The Hippy shot back: Hi Seppy. But where in tarnation is Olu Pippy Sepala looked him in the eye and ad-libbed: Its a small village in our land of lotus eaters, in Sri Lanka.
The beatnik favoured the unconventional hippy attire. He wore an un-pressed old pair of Levi bell-bottoms, a psychedelic top and leather sandals. He wore his hair long, had an unkempt beard. His neck was festooned with strands of love beads. Sepala was in essence, a discriminating observer. His occupation had necessitated such sharp-eyed perception of his customers. He was seldom wrong. He had discerned that despite the nonconformist apparel the man was no ordinary peacenik, in the real sense. Seppys powers of discernment had been honed by years of experience as a self-educated student of human psychology. He observed that the mans outfit although bohemian was clean and his leather sandals were expensive. There was that aura of confidence and bearing about him that spelled big bucks.
So the bohemian gazing at the glittering showcases asked Sepala whether he could purchase a single diamond earring. Sorry sir, said Sepala, they come in pairs and we only sell them as sets. Anyway realizing that there just might be a misplaced single earring somewhere, he told the customer he would ask the boss. He walked into the office at the back of the shop and told his father: Some darn idiot wants to buy a single diamond earring. Just as he finished the sentence, he turned to find the customer standing right behind him.
Without batting an eyelash he continued: And this gentleman here has kindly offered to buy the other one. The hippies eyes twinkled as he moved back into the showroom. He eased himself comfortably into a chair and quipped: The idiot you spoke of will be back. Hes probably on his way now. Ill wait. He was spot on. A few minutes later his partner, another male Hippy walked into the shop. The idiot is here he said. This cats my partner. Hippy men were referred to as Hipcats and the women as Chicks.
The hippy customers it later turned out were celebrity rock stars. They were Brian Jones and Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones, the British musical group who epitomised the Swinging Sixties, along with the biggest and best ensembles of the time such as the Beatles and the Kinks. Seppy sold them two mixed pairs of expensive diamond earrings in four separate fancy boxes.
Then there was my old journalistic colleague Joshua who hailed from the salubrious climes of the village known as Little England in Nuwara Eliya. After all, the climate lent itself to becoming the prime sanctuary of the British civil servants and planters in old Ceylon. It was the hill country retreat where the British colonialists could immerse in their pastimes of deer hunting, rugby polo, golf and cricket. The complexions of many of the inhabitants of the village were a dead give-away as to their mixed pedigree. Indeed, their skin-textures and facial appearances were testimony to the fact that they were living monuments to the dalliances between local highland matriarchs and their British masters.
Joshua had been thrust with a local moniker but his pallid complexion was a tell-tale sign of his part-British ancestry. The legend goes that young Joshua was being interviewed for a job by a very crusty assistant newspaper editor who queried: Where are you from He answered without hesitation: Little England, Nuwara Eliya, sir
The interviewer an obvious anglophile stared at him: I know New Railiya. What made you leave the place Joshua replied: I got tired of the surroundings. There are only twilight women and rugby players over where I come from. The old journalist eyed him with suspicion: Oh, really. My wife is from New Railiya. Joshua was equally up to it. His answer was one of the most classic, inspired one-liners ever to have been uttered in that hallowed institution: What a small world, sir. Which rugby team did she play for

Meaningful Vesak celebration
The annual Vesak festival is tapping at our doorsteps. If one were to walk on the highways or on byroads right now, one would see the country getting ready to display the life events of the Buddha by erecting storytelling pandals and close to them dansel or almsgiving halls coming up or already set up. Also, there are special Vesak zones as well.
However, does it really display the true meaning of the great life events of Gauthama Buddha who showed the path to live in peace and harmony, with oneself and with others as a social animal; to live in unity with nature
At Colombo Narahenpita Temple premises recently (May 7), the public witnessed a truly novel way of celebrating Vesak. Narahenpita Eksath Velenda Sangamaya (United Merchants Society) had something different to offer.
The health camp
The chief organizer of the Society Nimal de Silva, on whose concept was born the novel idea to celebrate Vesak, said he was troubled by seeing the way some youths were throwing ice cream cones haphazardly inside his vehicle, being distributed freely at one of the Vesak dansal in the past.
He said, thinking of the incident, he realized that there are better ways to celebrate Vesak where the Buddhist world can recall with reverence the birth, enlightenment and passing away - the three cardinal events of the Buddhas life.
One day, it struck me that there are many elders thrown out of their homes by their own children and relatives and neglected by neighbours and society. For them, it is no easy task to bathe by themselves, owing to their old age and fragile bodies.
Why not we think of ways to help them, console them and come out with a viable project where they would enjoy a nice bath and at the same time impress on them that they are being looked after instead of being thrown to the streets. We need to give them consolation by taking care of them and assure them that they are precious and wanted, de Silva said.
With this thought in my mind, I canvassed United Merchants Society President Piyasena Hewawasam and forwarded him the idea of treating our neglected elders. The members were highly impressed and enthusiastic.
They wanted to implement this proposal and held discussions with the incumbent monk of Sri Maha Bodhi Temple Ven. Kahatagasdigiliye Dhammarathana Thera. The venerable thera encouraged us to pursue the idea and offered the temple premises to be used for the project.
De Silva said, for several years they had been conducting dansal during Vesak changing the food from time to time but found that this was monotonous.
This year we have changed this and instead of running dansal this Vesak, we decided to treat 100 neglected elders by giving them a bath and providing them medical attention.
We did not choose the beneficiaries on religious, ethnic or other criteria but took into account how deserving they are. This is our first experience and it is very satisfying. This is an act that draws great merit than only serving a plate of rice. Bathing the elders with our own hands, conducting a health camp to their benefit within the premises of the temple and feeding and clothing them, have brought us satisfaction, pushing us to do similar things. We hope to conduct such camps in the time to come with the assistance of the public, the generous contribution of the business community and our strength, de Silva said.
We are glad that we were able to get the temple premises for the project and provide all facilities to the elders. The presence of Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara was an honour.
We are grateful for the police force, the maintenance unit of Telecom and staff members of Asiri Hospital who supported us with the project. We are also thankful for all volunteers who bathed the elders and looked after them, de Silva added.
The project by the United Merchants Society was highly attractive and full of meaning.

Min. Gamage aims to double Lankas primary exports
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said yesterday at a workshop, Emerging Food Safety and Quality Risks in South Asia: Challenges and Opportunities for Sri Lanka that his ministrys goal is to double Sri Lankas primary exports and add value to them by introducing new technology and practices.
Speaking at Waters Edge, Gamage noted that the government hopes to improve Sri Lankas export standards so that there are fewer barriers for exports.
The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) is also in the process of formulating plans for ten export centres near farms that would directly link farmers with exporters.
These value-addition centres would also provide training on the best practices for using seeds and fertilizers and harvesting crops, Gamage said.
He added that his ministry is working on spreading the use of greenhouses in the country, and that it is in discussions to bring in the technology from China, Israel and Thailand, among others.
In order to increase investment in the agricultural sector, the MPI and Ministry of Agriculture are working with the World Bank.
If investors can front Rs. 10 million, they can go for a project of Rs. 100 million. They can receive a grant of Rs. 50 million and loans for Rs. 40 million, he said.
Gamage also argued that more efforts should be made to reduce food wastage in the country. We see wastage of 30 percent of agricultural products from the time they are harvested to the time they reach the consumer. By investing in improving harvesting, transport, storage, and packaging, we can reduce the amount of wastage by 90 percent. We have to increase our food yields, safety, hygiene, and production techniques. We also have to develop sustainable mechanisms like seed banks to ensure that these food sources are available for future generations, he said.

Mobitel envisions bringing Vesak to visually impaired
The National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel plans to bring the light of joy to the visually impaired in the country during the Vesak season with the introduction of the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform to enable users to listen to the stories on display on five prominent Vesak Pandals in Colombo this year.
Users can call the short code 565 from any Mobitel number to listen to the stories free of charge from May 10 to 20, 2017.
Traditionally, the Vesak season has always been a feast for the eyes and Mobitel strives to remain true to its slogan We Care, Always by sharing the joy of the celebrations with the visually challenged men, women and children of the nation. The Vesak season celebrates enlightenment and Mobitel has provided an innovative solution to share that spark of light with the visually impaired community in the country combining one of the oldest methods of communication in the form of storytelling with modern technology.
This IVR platform provides pre-recorded voice responses with keypad signal logic and access to relevant data to users.
Traditional Pandals depict legendary stories of the previous lives of the Gautama Buddha (Jathaka stories) on large vertical platforms with scenes of the story graphically displayed in an ascending or a descending order.
A multitude of lights illuminate the Pandals at night during the celebratory season.
Apart from giving access to visually challenged persons to enjoy narratives of Jathaka stories Mobitel aims to raise awareness about the challenges faced by the visually challenged population living in Sri Lanka.
The society is yet to reach the point where equal opportunities are provided to all sub segments and with this small gesture of goodwill, Mobitel uses its brand to communicate the message of equality for all human beings living in the country including the visually impaired.
The Vesak campaign is part of a series of initiatives to serve and uplift the Sri Lankan communities that require care.

Moodys assigns B1 rating to Sri Lankas global bond offering
Moodys has assigned a B1 rating to Sri Lankas US dollar bond offering maturing in 2027.
The outlook on the Government of Sri Lankas issuer rating is negative.
Sri Lankas B1 rating balances the economys robust growth potential and higher income levels than similarly rated sovereigns against a high government debt burden, low debt affordability, and reliance on external borrowing combined with relatively low foreign exchange reserves.
The negative outlook on the rating is underpinned by Sri Lankas persistently weak fiscal metrics, in an environment of subdued GDP growth, which could lead to renewed balance of payments pressure; and the possibility that the effectiveness of the fiscal reforms envisaged by the government may be lower than we currently expect, which could further weaken fiscal and economic performance.
Signs that the fiscal consolidation measures are ineffective or that the authorities commitment towards fiscal consolidation is wavering would point to a higher debt burden for longer and put negative pressure on the rating. In particular, if such developments were accompanied by a marked fall in foreign exchange reserves and lack of market access, a downgrade of the rating could be possible.
Conversely, evidence of effective reform implementation leading to significant and lasting improvements in tax collection would be positive. Such an improvement, coupled with reforms of macroeconomic policy that lead to more stable external financing conditions, would support a return of the rating outlook to stable.

She stood, a small figure in front of the school notice board. With anxious eyes she searched for her number.
It wasn't there.
The girls around her jostled and pushed. There were screams of delight and shrieks of ecstasy. She turned away from the sounds, tears streaming down her face. Far away she heard the same laughter turning to jeers. Suddenly she felt imaginary eyes on her back and voices saying.
"She's dumb you know, she failed."
"She was never any good."
"Remember in class, she sat with that stupid look."
She turned and walked the stairs to her now empty class. In silence, she heard her teacher's voice. "Why don't you do your homework like the others, you'll fail if you go on like this."
How was she to tell the teacher that she had not understood a thing the day before to have been able to do her work at home
"Stand outside the class will you, let the whole school know what an idiot you are!"
She had stood outside her class, and watched her juniors laughing as they walked past. The teacher had called her in after some time. There were sniggers from the other girls as she sat on her bench. "Dumb", they all seemed to say. "She 's just plain stupid"
There were no tears to wash away the heaviness in her heart.
She sat on her bench in the empty classroom and her thoughts went home. A shiver ran down her spine. She saw her father tall and menacing standing in front of her. "You better pass okay, we don't want the neighbors laughing at us, do we".
An uncle had sniggered. "She's got her brains from her mother's side".
"Oh no", shouted her mother, "it's her own dopey mind."
"I don't care where you've got your brains from", her father had shouted, "but if you fail, you've had it".
"At least pass your school, so we can marry you off," her mother had piped in.
Voices, laughter, shouting, sniggering in the empty, silent classroom. Voices chasing each other round and round her mind. Laughter, cruel and brutal, sniggers, sharp and merciless, echoed louder and louder in her head, till suddenly she felt herself shudder involuntarily:
"Stupid!" they shouted.
"Idiot!" they yelled.
"Failure!" they cried.
Like a zombie she climbed the steps one by one, the tears no more there. She walked as though pushed by some invisible force. She smiled as she heard the taunts and jeers grow less and less. She smiled as she calmly climbed up onto the parapet wall. She heard the screaming of her classmates below as she joyously threw herself down.
"Why did she do it" cried her classmates, her teachers, her father and her mother.
Suicide was what the police report said, but it was murder most foul..!

Musicians rich list
Adele is the richest musician under 30, according to the new edition of The Sunday Times Rich List, to be published this Sunday, May 7. The 160-page special edition of The Sunday Times Magazine reveals the wealth of the 1,000 richest people in the UK.
Adele, 29, who also appears in the main Rich List for the first time this year, having first appeared in The Sunday Times Young Rich List in 2011, is now worth a cool 125m. Having increased her fortune by almost 50%  40m  in the past year alone, she is the joint 19th richest musician in the Music Rich List.
Adele, 29, followed her phenomenally successful 2015 album 25 with an ongoing 122 date world tour, taking around 138m at the box office. Her main companys financial statements show profits of almost 20m in 2015 and hold assets of 13m. In February, Adele won five Grammy Awards, taking her to 15 in total. Brian May, the lead guitarist with Queen, shares 19th place on the Music Rich List with Adele, valued at 125m.
At 160 pages this years Sunday Times Rich List - the 29th annual edition to be produced - is the biggest ever. The definitive guide to wealth charts the fortunes of the 1,000 richest individuals and families in the British Isles.
Robert Watts, the Compiler of The Sunday Times Rich List 2017, said: What a year for Adele. Such strong record sales and a busy touring schedule propel her into our main list for the first time. Still in her 20s, if Adeles career lasts as long as many of the other entries in our list, she has the potential to be the highest-earning British musician of all time.
The rises we have seen from the Rolling Stones and other older bands are very striking. Many of these groups continue to play lucrative gigs well-into their 70s - with their wealthier fans prepared to stump up more for their tickets than younger fans of new acts.
It seems rock music - be it performing or watching - is no longer just for the young. Music News

Narines 15-ball half-ton matches IPL record
NEW DELHI:West Indies all-rounder Sunil Narine equalled an Indian Premier League record as he hit a whirlwind half-century off just 15 balls to lead Kolkata Knight Riders to a big win over struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Narine smashed a 17-ball 54 -- including six fours and four sixes -- as Kolkata reached the 159-run target in 15.1 overs to win by six wickets late on Sunday.
Narine and Australian Chris Lynn put together a 105-run opening partnership in the first six overs of Sunday's game. Lynn needed 22 balls to make his 50 at Bangalore's M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
He was outdone by Narine who, despite being better known for his off-spin bowling, matched Yusuf Pathan's 15-ball half-ton for Kolkata in 2014.
I'm surprised too. Lynn just said keep your eyes on the ball, keep focused and swing at it. I try to keep it simple, Narine said.
I'll hopefully get used to the expectations but it really was a team effort. Umesh's (Umesh Yadav) wickets early especially were key and I'm thankful for it, added Narine.
Bangalore's batting again faltered with big-hitter Chris Gayle, who fell for a golden duck in his 100th IPL game, skipper Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers managing just 15 runs between them.
Australia's Travis Head hit an unbeaten 47-ball 75 to take Bangalore to 158-6 in 20 overs. Kolkata pacemanYadav took three wickets while man-of-the-match Narine bagged two.
Gautam Gambhir-led Kolkata lie second in the eight-team table, with bottom-placed Bangalore already out of the play-off race in the cash-rich league.

National Action Plan for REDD+ in Sri Lanka
Climate change and loss of biodiversity are two of the main challenges facing global communities and ecosystems, today. Changes in land use resulting from deforestation and forest degradation is estimated to make a net contribution of about 12 percent to global emissions of greenhouse gases. It is a significant contributor to anthropogenic or human-induced climate change. On the other hand, land use changes through conversion of natural forests to agricultural land and built up areas also leads to loss or fragmentation of natural habitats and hence to a rapid decline in biodiversity on a global scale. .
Two global-level policy commitments have been designed in recent times to address these issues of loss of biodiversity and climate change. The first of these is the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity: it encompasses the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the period 2011-2020. The second, popularly known as UN-REDD+ programme, includes:
a) the emerging mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus (REDD), b) the conservation of forest carbon stocks,
c) sustainable management of forests, and
d) enhancement of forest carbon (REDD+).
These chart a new course in the global effort to combat climate change. The central aim of the UNFCCC Paris agreement of 2015 is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. It attempts to achieve this by keeping global temperature rise in this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels (1850-1900 base line) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.
Sri Lanka has already responded in 2016 to develop a national strategy for biodiversity conservation in the form of a National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) for the period 2016-2022. The corresponding National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) prepared with support from the Sri Lanka UN REDD programme for a period of five years (2018  2023) with wide stakeholder participation is to be submitted to the Government of Sri Lanka on the May 9, 2017 for acceptance.
What is REDD+ 
The mechanism to achieve REDD+ identifies five major activities to be carried out in developing countries. Remuneration for this is a results-based payment. These five activities are as follows:
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation
Reducing emissions from forest degradation, Conservation of forest carbon stocks, Sustainable management of forests and Enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
Over the years, REDD+ has evolved as a global climate change mitigation mechanism. Its main objective is to support policies and measures that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from forests, and increase carbon uptake by forests. The finances for this will be given as results-based payments to developing countries. REDD+ programme aims to shift particularly, the economic engines of growth in developing countries such as infrastructure development, unsustainable agriculture and natural resource exploitation towards more low-carbon and inclusive pathways. In 2013, REDD+ developed a comprehensive package of decisions (under the Warsaw Framework) to help countries implement REDD+. This package includes the following activities: development of national strategies or action plans; development of national forest monitoring systems; establishing forest reference emission levels; measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems; social and environmental safeguards; and finally, recognize the need to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in order to achieve emissions reduction. The National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) is the Sri Lankan response to this latest global effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon stocks.
Globally, REDD+ activities are to be carried out in the forestry sector, which includes natural forests, forest plantations, urban and peri-urban wooded areas, tree-lined avenues, parklands and agroforests, to arrest further degradation and deforestation and restore tree cover while safeguarding social and environmental (including biodiversity) values characteristic of these ecosystems.
Nexus between climate change and tropical forests:
Climate change scientists have shown that tropical forests maintain high rates of evapo-transpiration leading to decrease in surface air temperature and increase precipitation, compared with those of pasturelands. Therefore, large scale conversion of tropical forests could influence the global water cycle and carbon cycle through their impacts on temperature and rainfall.
Most recently these scientists report that the changes in the global water cycle due to warming over the 21st century will not be uniform throughout the planet. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.
In Sri Lanka too, this is emerging to be similar, in spite of the fact that it is a smaller continental island.
The future actions on tropical forests which may exacerbate global warming through decreases in evaporative cooling and releases in CO2 (changing from a net sink to source of CO2) leading to forest die-back.
The interrelatedness of climate change science, climate impacts on ecosystems, and climate change mitigation policy requires that these be studied together in an interdisciplinary framework to craft strong science in the service of humankind.
Link between REDD+ and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
The SDGs, also known as Global Goals, are part of the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development that aim to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
The SDGs are the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (2000  2015). There are 17 SDGs. They are intended to guide the pursuit of prosperity and human well-being, while protecting the environment, for the next 15 years.
Two of the SDGs are most compatible with REDD+ objectives of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. These include SDG 13 (related to climate change mitigation) and SDG 15 (forest conservation). Other SDGs deal with water, poverty and even responsible production and consumption, which can promote co-benefits in REDD+. In summary, REDD+ provides a viable, internationally accredited means of implementing certain SDG targets.
Forestry sector in Sri Lanka:
The current extent of natural forest cover in Sri Lanka is about 1.95 million hectares or 29.7 percent of the total land area of the island. However, the most bio diverse regions and the major watersheds of the island, viz., lowland rain forests, lower montane forests and montane forests collectively cover only 3 percent of the islands land area. Natural forests in the seasonally dry region of the country cover nearly 17 percent of the islands land area. In addition, there are 429,484 hectares of open and sparse forests which are mostly regenerating degraded forests covering 6.5 percent of the island distributed mostly in the dry and intermediate zones of the country.
The major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Sri Lanka were identified during the REDD+ programme, they are:
i) encroachments for agriculture, settlements, mining and shrimp farming,
ii) infrastructure development projects such as construction of highways, harbours, airports and development of tourism facilities,
iii) private commercial agricultural ventures and
iv) other unspecified localized small-scale activities. The forest cover change as a result of these drivers is estimated to be about 8,088 hectares per year during the period between 2000 and 2010.
The Forestry Sector Master Plan:
The last occasion a national level forestry sector management programme to address deforestation drivers prevalent at the time was during the preparation of Sri Lanka Forestry Sector Master Plan in 1995. It was meant to provide a comprehensive long-term (1995-2020) development framework for the forestry sector guided by the National Forestry Policy of 1995. Master planning, or any other sectoral planning, should be regarded as a dynamic, rolling, and sufficiently long-term process reacting to both actual and expected changes, whether socio-economic, environmental or political. Much water has flown under the bridge since this Forestry Master Plan was prepared and the time is more than ripe to assess the current situation in the forestry sector to set new targets in implementing the Nations Forestry Policy of 1995 in the face of emerging threats of climate change and loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the time is opportune to update the existing forestry sector plan through NRIFAP.
Vanaropa, Punarudaya, Haritha Lanka and A Blue-Green Era:
Sri Lanka has acknowledged the role of the forestry sector as a key climate change mitigation strategy. Several national level programmes such as Vana Ropa - to increase forest cover from the current 29.7 percent to 32 percent by planting about 150,000 hectares of new forests in three years, and programmes such as Punarudaya (Renaissance), Haritha (Green) Lanka and Sri Lanka Next  A Blue-Green Era to create a sustainable environment are among the main national level commitments towards REDD+ activities.
The Sri Lanka UN REDD programme is supporting the Government in developing a vision for REDD+ that forms a part of the national approach to improving the overall effectiveness of the countrys forest and land management regimes. This has been achieved through a thorough consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders.
National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) in Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankas national REDD+ strategy and action plan (NRIFAP) documents the actions condensed from a wide range of proposals made by a broad spectrum of stakeholders in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has identified 13 specific Policies and Measures (PAMs) to address the identified drivers of forest cover change that detailed out the mechanisms to co-ordinate their implementation.
These PAMs have been developed through a highly consultative process among academics, researchers, technical practitioners, business leaders, civil society interest groups and policy makers. The 13 PAMs and the specific actions proposed for implementation of each PAM are categorised under three priority policy areas,
Forest, wildlife and watershed.
These PAMs are particularly focused on strengthening law enforcement, forest boundary demarcation, restoration of degraded areas, sustainable management of natural forests and forest plantations to ensure overall effectiveness in forest management, taking also in to consideration the ecosystem services they render. This group of PAMs has the potential to contribute to the highest emission reduction and removal, as well as significant opportunities to deliver a wide range of non-carbon benefits which are especially relevant in the Sri Lankan context.
Land use planning
The PAMs in this group focus on the broader aspects of sustainable land management. They are expected to provide enabling actions for implementation of other PAMs which are more directly aimed at generating emission reductions and/or removals.
Other forest lands
This group of PAMs deal with forest lands outside the purview of the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. They focus on both reducing the risk of conversion of these other forests to alternative land uses and concurrently increasing the timber and fuel wood supply in them to reduce pressure on forests that are to be sustainably managed by the Forest Department.
Actions proposed under most PAMs require research inputs which open up a number of opportunities for the Academic and Research community to get involved in, preferably in a collaborative, inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional manner. For example, restoration of degraded forest areas in different climatic zones with suitable local species needs long-term engagement of the academic and research community, along with other stakeholders, in selecting a range of native species that would be suitable to match the sites available for planting. Similarly, there are many opportunities for the academic and research community with expertise and interest to be involved in sustainable forest and plantation management. The PAM on strengthening the protection of at least 4,000 ha of critical forested watersheds and riverine forests by restoring and improving their ecological service functions need involvement of scientists having different research backgrounds such as ecology, hydrology, soil science, sociology and also natural resource economics.
In Sri Lanka, the expertise of the scientific and research community need to be mobilised in addressing climate change, its negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as estimation of the economic loss due to these negative impacts. Thereby, policy makers can take decisions on verifiable scientific and economic research findings. At present, forests in general are considered as areas with no apparent economic value unless they are converted to agricultural lands, human settlements or other infrastructural developmental sites. Most of the services forests provide are not directly understood. Forests do provide a multitude of ecosystem services such as provisioning of fresh water, clean air, cultural and educational services; ameliorating the environment, regulating floods, controlling soil erosion and landslides, cycling of nutrients, providing habitats for pollinators and pest control organisms that increase agricultural yields, etc. So far these have been taken for granted or we have not been aware of them. The real monetary value of forests has been ignored in the economic decision making process. Losing these services will result in costly alternatives that can be economically valued.
Nations throughout the world are now increasingly recognizing the economic value of their natural capital and are developing methodologies to demonstrate the economic value of nature to make them more visible and appreciated, and thereby to capture their value in their national economy and policies.
Integrated Research on Ecosystem Valuation
Having realized the need for capacity building on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, the Academic and Research Forum of the Sri Lanka UN REDD programme organized an International Research Symposium titled Economic valuation of forest ecosystems and their services as a part of the International Conference on Climate Change organized by Sri Lanka Next in the Blue-Green Era on the 18th October 2016. The main objective of the symposium was to bring the latest developments in valuing ecosystems and their services to the forefront in Sri Lanka, using the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB, 2010) methodology. A set of recommendations, including a capacity development drive across all stakeholders on recognizing and appreciating the valuable services ecosystems provide and their economic valuation has been submitted to the relevant decision makers.
Follow-up training workshops for researchers were held to demonstrate the use of one of these more recently developed research tools, viz., InVEST software for estimating the economic values of selected ecosystem services. An inter-disciplinary research group that included natural resource scientists, social anthropologists and resource economists worked together to learn from each other and share their experiences in the different disciplines. This effort is still at its infancy, but a foundation has been laid to initiate the valuation of Sri Lankas natural ecosystems and landscapes.
We hope that the research opportunities offered by these nationally important environmental programmes will be taken up by a wider forum of academics and researchers to provide the scientific underpinning to facilitate a level playing field in decision making, in relation to exploitation of natural resources associated with the rapid development drive in the country.

No closure of Anti-Corruption Secretariat
A Committee consisting of officials from the Commission to Investigate Acts of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat, is looking at the future responsibilities and functions of the Secretariat.
A statement released by the Prime Ministers Office yesterday denied media reports that the Secretariat faced closure and stated the above mentioned Committee was in the process of working out a special report on whether the Secretariat should continue functioning as before, should its activities be amended or whether the Secretariat should be given responsibilities and functions similar to that of CIABOC and the FCID.
The Prime Ministers Office further stated that a final decision would be arrived at once the Committee finalizes its report.
A source within the Secretariat speaking to the Daily News, however, said they did not know much about the Committee but that there was a pending Cabinet paper forwarded by the Prime Minister to make it a statutory body.
We were aware of a move to make it a stronger anti-corruption body and if it was a statutory body it would be more independent, said the source within the Secretariat.
The Anti-Corruption Secretariat located next to Temple Trees was established in 2015 to investigate into public complaints of corruption and fraud and thereafter, direct genuine complaints to either the FCID or CIABOC.

One-shoulder smoulder
Off-the-shoulder tops and dresses are the rage right now with gorgeous ladies baring their shoulders in trendy off-the-shoulder pieces. But in case, youre experiencing a minor bout of fatigue with the entire OTS craze, we present you an extremely trending alternative: the one-shoulder look!
Designer Shruti Sancheti shares, The one-shoulder trend has been prevalent since time immemorial and was quite popular amongst the Greeks and Romans, especially in their toga and himation style outfits. It gained popularity in the 70s and since fashion is cyclical, it has come under the spotlight now with loads of variations and styles available.
Like its collarbone-baring counterpart, the one-shoulder dress allows you to wear some skin and show off all those arm exercises youve been doing in preparation for summer, but with an asymmetric twist. One-shoulder tops can work for a number of occasions, from covering up at the cabana poolside to an elegant wedding guest look. Shruti shares, The first basic prerequisite to sporting this trend is to have toned shoulders and arms. A broad-shouldered body type should avoid thin straps and wear broad straps instead, to conceal. And even if you are not very toned but want to wear this trend, a small part of the shoulder can be bared and the rest can have sleeves.
Suggesting different ways to test the water, designer Simran Arya shares, You can start by wearing a simple one sided off-the-shoulder top with ripped jeans or a high-waisted skirt. A little ruffled dress in soft pink and long sleeves on the other side makes for an elegant summer choice. You cant go wrong with a white dress either, so go for a dress in textured frayed fabric with a plain border.
About some of the coolest pieces to try out this season, she goes on, This trend can be carried off well in both Western and Indian attires. Digitally printed blouses in bold colours are chic and add an interesting element to your summer wardrobe. Pair it up with a bright digitally printed one-shoulder top and fitted jeans or white trousers and youre good to go. You can team up a one-shoulder blouse with a maxi skirt or palazzos as well. The trick to carrying off any outfit successfully is being comfortable and confident.
Designer Karn Malhotra adds, A pink mini-dress with elasticated neckline and long sleeves makes a pretty summer choice, or a little ruffled dress in soft pink or aqua also looks great. The lacy look is also a wonderful choice. You can opt for an oversized one-shoulder blouse and pair it with white denim shorts for a luncheon with girls. Designer Siddartha Tytler suggests, One can pair a one-shoulder top with a sari to give it a modern edge. Also its better to opt for pieces in darker colour tones to add a bit of oomph.
Talking about different body types, designer Aashima Behl explains, One-shoulder dresses are perfect for the Apple body type as they bring the attention to shoulders and draw away from the torso. For women with pear-shaped bodies, the one-shoulder look works well too as the neckline can bring attention upwards. But Id advise everyone to try it before you buy it, as the trend can get a little tricky if one has a big bust. Be careful with your under-garment. Otherwise, it will destroy the look.

Pilgrims path
Despite the doomsday-like heat, the sacred sites of Sri Lanka never run short of pilgrims. Come Vesak, the pilgrims carrying backpacks, rucksacks and bottles of water with sweat trickling down the white garbs are a common sight.
The journey, like any other spiritually-strengthened one, needs much preparation. You are supposed to shun the basic vices, smoking, consuming liquor and eating meat, at least for three days prior to setting off. The pilgrims have a reason to gather at this place, albeit the vicious heat.
They believe in miracles of the place.
The path to this most ancient monument was enshrouded by dense forestry. The monument was not in sight a century ago, until Venerable Sirimalwatte Piyaratna Thera discovered the area. The illumed skies showed them the path to the stupa which lay in ruins of centuries. The stupa is believed to have been constructed in the 2nd century BC when Arahant Aritta brought the sacred right tooth of the Buddha. Prince Giriabha was the chosen one to protect the relics. His queen consort, Somawathi, developed a passion for constructing a large stupa to deposit the sacred relics. The stupa was named after the queen.
Such is the genesis of Somawathiya, believed to be mysterious, for lights descending from the skies mostly during the nighttime. The stupa claims reverence from all quarters of Buddhists almost as equal as the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and Jayasri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura.
The area was infested by terrorists, and the attempts to demolish the place were aplenty. When the monks were compelled to abandon the site in fear of terrorists, the elephants came to its protection. Even today you will get to see an elephant or two within the stupa premises in the confines of the solar-powered electric fences.
One of the many legends linked to the stupa narrates about a monk who tipped the police off about excavating treasure at stupa. When police reached the spot, they found the stupa excavated albeit no monk in sight. In fact, no monk had been dwelling in the site at the time.
The appearance of lights is no strange phenomenon at the premises of the stupa. What your naked eye fails to see is captured rightly on your smart device or even better on a DSLR camera. The lights appear, disappear and reappear in strange ways. All you need to do is silently observe them. Because, as Ajahn Brahm said, you need to remember that silence is shy. The moment you begin to talk, silence will disappear. So do the lights.
Just observe them without making noise and any other attempt to interpret them. Whether you believe them to be celestial beings or simply digital tricks, the lights are also devotees who make regular visits to the stupa to worship the sacred relics.
Even if you do not manage to spot them, there are numerous photographs put on notice boards which indicate lights. During the daytime when the Buddha puja is offered, the devotees will get an opportunity to see a giant halo around the stupa pinnacle. The Buddhas halo, some believe it to be. In fact, it should probably be the halo of the celestial beings who participate in the meritorious act of Buddha Puja. And definitely not the photographing illusions, though some images can contain them.
You will meet devotees who have witnessed drums heard from within the hollow space. Even the most disbelieving among us might experience such strange things within the premises. At the Somawathi, the miracles and strange appearances are no longer a mystery. They are quite a normalcy, and you will naturally come to terms with it.
The rainy season is probably the worst period to visit the shrine. You may be prone to heavy floods. Pilgrims visiting the shrine during Vesak week are advised to keep water bottles ready. Be ready for the glaring sunshine too around and after noon. Probably it will be a test of endurance for your spiritual strength.

Pitt speaks out on his divorce
Brad Pitt graces the cover of GQ Style magazines latest issue. Talking to the magazine, Pitt compared his split from Angelina Jolie to a death, admitting that he is an emotional retard whose heavy drinking helped ruin his marriage. The actor said, I hit the lottery and I still would waste my time on those hollow pursuits, reports DailyMail.co.uk.
I worry about it more for my kids, who are being subjected to it. Its just very, very jarring for them to suddenly have their family ripped apart. Our focus is that everyone comes out stronger and better  there is no other outcome, he said.
On quitting drinking, the actor said, I was boozing too much. Its just become a problem. And Im really happy its been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but Ive got my feelings in my fingertips again. Truthfully, I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional.
I was good. I dont want to live that way anymore, it was reported on JustJared.com.
Talking about this phase hes in, Pitt added, For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street.

Presidential Commission questions Handunnetti on COPE report foot notes issue
The matter regarding the foot notes appended by certain COPE committee members when finalizing its report on the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue, resurfaced yesterday when JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti was testifying before the Presidential Commission.
MP Handunnetti, the Chairman of the second COPE sub-committee that looked into the Treasury Bond issue, was questioned by the Commission as to who included the foot notes to the said report and what caused those members to take such an action.
MP Handunnetti said there was a disagreement between the COPE members on a certain explanation included in the report. These members did not agree with the explanation that a loss is incurred when a Treasury Bond issuance is done with a discount. The disagreement was only based on this explanation. Other than this matter, all the COPE members agreed with all the conclusions and recommendations given in the report, he explained.
MP Handunnetti also said he considered the possibility of issuing a dissenting report due to this disagreement. A dissenting report could only be prepared only if there is a clear opposing group making objections to the findings and recommendations in a report. Since the members agreed with all of them and only had a minor disagreement with a technical explanation, we did not go for a dissenting report, he said.
Asked as to who he recommends to be summoned to the Commission to explain the rationale behind the foot notes, MP Handunnetti said he cannot pinpoint a single person out of the nine members who agreed with them. However, Handunnetti said Dr. Harsha de Silva, who was appointed to document the foot notes in the report, will be able to give an explanation as his educational qualifications also complements to the understanding of the matter.
An objection was made by legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva when Handunnetti was referring to a letter sent by the Central Bank regarding the foot notes while answering a question posed by Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando.
De Silva said, the Central Banks clarification letter on the foot notes was at a later stage was withdrawn by its sender.
Fernando PC asked if the COPE committee report is solely based on the Auditor Generals report on the same matter, and Handunnetti said it was one main document on which the COPE relied on.
Fernando PC asked, whether the COPE committee considered the loss calculation done by the Auditor General when forming the COPE report, and Handunnetti said of several calculation results provided in the report, they accepted the one that calculates an immediate loss of Rs. 688.536 million.
Handunnetti requested the Presidential Commission inquiring into the treasury bond issue to take COPE reports recommendations into consideration when preparing its report.
Meanwhile, speaking to media after testifying before the Commission, MP Handunnetti said he hopes the Commission would give the necessary legal empowerment to the recommendations mentioned in the COPE report via its report.

South Korea election: Polls open to choose new president

South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.
Left-leaning Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger.
The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea.
Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties.
Observers are expecting a high turnout at the ballot boxes, with numbers boosted by younger voters, as South Koreans choose from 13 candidates.
Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after.
Money and jobs
All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high.
There are also promises to rein in perceptions of elitism in South Korean political society and reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy.
Keeping an eye on the North
But heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula in recent weeks has also made the perennial concern of domestic security a key election concern.
Moon, of the Democratic Party of Korea, has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions.
He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.
Conservative candidate Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party however has attacked Moon's approach, saying on Thursday morning that the election was a "war of regime choices".
North Korea has dropped a pretty clear hint about who it wants to win the election.
A state media editorial says the current North and South relationship has been "been wrought by the conservative groups which, having been in power for the past 10 years, revived the foregone period of confrontation and maximized the political and military rivalry between the same race".
This indicates it favours a candidate associated with what's known as the Sunshine Policy when Pyongyang and Seoul communicated and co-operated.
The policy finally collapsed in 2008 after North Korea's started testing nuclear devices, though it had faltered earlier when South Korea stopped sending aid to the north in 2006.
Moon Jae-in was part of the government which promoted the Sunshine Policy. He has indicated he wants closer ties with the North in this campaign. An endorsement by Pyongyang won't help him win - but it probably won't harm his chances very much either.
New blood at the top
Candidates are also promising a break from the past as symbolised by the deeply unpopular Park.
Moon, has called for an "overwhelming victory" as it would help to heal a national divide caused by her impeachment.
"I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government," he told reporters on Tuesday morning after he cast his vote.
In March, Park Geun-hye became the first South Korean president to beremoved from power by impeachment.
She denies wrongdoing - although she has repeatedly apologised - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power.
Moon narrowly lost to Park in the last presidential election in 2012.
Ahn had also run for the job but dropped out to endorse Moon in an attempt to consolidate votes against Park. He has now positioned himself as an alternative to Moon, promising to be tougher on national security.
"The time for Ahn Cheol-soo is here and the time for Moon Jae-in is slipping away," he declared in his campaign.

SriLankan Aviation College, SriLankan Airlines training arm, is looking at a major expansion drive and is also looking at setting up an Aviation College in Mattala Airport.
SriLankan Aviation College General Manager Primal De Silva said that they will set up this college from revenue within the company and also through bank loans. We are ready to invest but need more aircraft movements at Mattala to fully engage in the project.
He said they have also acquired a 737 200 cargo aircraft for training and now are on the look out for a six seater Cessna aircraft.
Elaborating on their other plans he said that they will also tie up with three universities in England and Australia to offer more engineering courses. We will also open two regional Aviation Colleges in Jaffna and the Eastern province next year. The students will come to Colombo in their final part of the exam to Colombo for practicals.
De Silva said SriLankan Aviation College is a self funding institution and today has around 20% of foreign students who help to generate additional forex to the country and the airline.
He said that they are one of the worlds 25th IATA accredited Regional Training Partners and only such centre in the region.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the largest aviation training body in the world, has selected Sri Lanka as the venue for its flagship annual event, the IATA Global Training Partner Conference 2017, on May 15 and 16 at Cinnamon Grand. We will provide around Rs. 1.5 million to be the main sponsor for the event allowing us to get regional mileage from the event.
The conference is the largest aviation training conference in the world and is the most dynamic event for networking in aviation training partners worldwide.
IATA selected Sri Lanka from among many other nominees for its Global Training Conference based on the above criteria and by recognizing the efforts of SriLankan Aviation College and SriLankan Airlines in developing a regional platform for aviation training.

Three star hotel facility, a must at Sooriyawewa - SLC president
A three star hotel facility at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Sooriyawewa is a must to make best use of the
facility was the opinion of Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala when he addressed members of the Matara District Cricket Association last Sunday.
The MRICS was built in Meegahajandura eight kilometers from the Sooriyawewa town and is an elephant infested territory. Elephants have been breaking down the protective fence regularly and causing damage. We cant blame the pachyderms as it was originally their grazing ground, said Sumathipala.
The MRICS is not a popular venue as there is no suitable accommodation for the teams close by and obtaining quality meals is a problem. Hence, Sri Lanka Cricket hopes to invest in at least a three star hotel facility at Meegahajandura to popularize the venue. Until such time SLC hopes to rent out a suitable premise in Hambantota which can accommodate both teams and also provide a bus to transport the teams to and fro, he said.
It is likely that MRICS may be a venue for the forthcoming Zimbabwe tour to Sri Lanka.
Speaking further Sumathipala said, SLC has to incur a cost of Rs 600,000 to Rs 700,000 each month to merely maintain the cricket ground. At present the MRICS is understaffed after the Sri Lanka Army contingent that was detailed to maintain the facility was reduced. The air conditioning system needs alteration as the whole complex is centrally air conditioned. If all goes well the MRICS will not be a burden on the coffers of Sri Lanka Cricket in three or four years time, he said.

Tokyo Cement commissions Rs 2.5 bn second biomass power plant
President Maithripala Sirisena inaugurated Tokyo Cements second Biomass Power Plant in Trincomalee yesterday.
This is part of a series of events held in commemoration of late A. Y. S. Gnanam, the founder Chairman of the company.
The Tokyo Eastern Biomass Plant began construction in 2015 with an investment of over Rs 2.5 billion. The plant will contribute 70 Gwh per year to the national grid generated using industrial and agricultural waste sourced through community trade.
In total, the plant will produce 160 Thousand MW Hours of clean renewable energy per year, which equals to the annual electricity consumption of 100,000 Sri Lankan rural households.
Tokyo Cement Managing Director S. R. Gnanam said this contributes towards achieving the National Renewable Energy Target to generate 10% of the countrys energy requirement through all forms of non-conventional renewable energy resources by 2017. With this opening, the company becomes the single largest contributor of renewable energy in the nation, generating 23 megawatts with the ability to supply 2.5 megawatts surplus capacities to the national grid, thus making a significant impact in the countrys energy footprint as a single player.
The plant opening was among a series of events held in commemoration of the birth anniversary of Deshamanya A.Y.S. Gnanam, which included the foundation laying ceremony for a housing project for 25 families displaced during the war, distribution of deeds to residents of the Tokyo Cement Tsunami Housing Scheme in Nilaveli, foundation laying for a Technical Building and the commissioning of the Biomass Power Plant inside the Tokyo Cement factory premises at Cod Bay, China Bay.
Late A.Y.S. Gnanam was a pioneering entrepreneur who ventured into many of Sri Lankas firsts, which included the generation of Renewable Biomass Energy.
The company established Sri Lankas first successful large scale Dendro power plant in 2014 in Mahiyangana.

The UNP today stated that it is against removing Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha UNP headquarters, UNP backbencher Hector Appuhami said Minister John Senaratne has no moral right to make such a request.
"Minister Senaratne was in the vanguard of making the 'yahapalana' government and he was with us right from the beginning.
He speaks straight. He has undertaken a huge task on behalf of the people.
We, in the UNP, do not agree to his removal from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Minister John Seneviratne who joined the Cabinet later has no right to make such a demand.
We don't think that Dr. Senaratne made any wrong statement or anything against the country" he said.

## Title: A victory for France

A victory for France
The people of France have spoken decisively for inclusion, multiculturalism and European unity by electing Emmanuel Macron as their next President. Centrist Macron, just 39, becomes the youngest leader of France since Napoleon, having won nearly 67 percent of the votes cast.
His term begins on Sunday May 14, just two months shy of the 228th anniversary of Bastille Day and on the cusp of the 60th anniversary of the French Fifth Republic. His victory marks the third time that extremists have been defeated in Europe, starting from Austria and the Netherlands. It is a victory not just for France but also for globalism and democracy.
In the second round of voting held on Sunday, French voters faced a stark choice between two candidates who held vastly different views on the future of France. Macron, a former civil servant, investment banker and Economy Minister, is pro-European Union, pro-immigration and pro-multiculturism. In fact, when his victory was announced Macron strode to the podium to the strains of Beethovens Ode to Joy, the anthem of the European Union.
His main rival Marine Le Pen (48), daughter of Jean Marie Le Pen, represented the far-right National Front that stood for "Frexit" (taking France out of the European Union and euro Single currency) and drastic cuts in immigration. Her xenophobic France First campaign, that uncannily followed US President Donald Trumps successful America First election campaign and the success of the Brexit campaign in the UK, however failed to resonate with French voters, of whom only around 33 percent voted for her. She did manage to get almost double the votes her father received in 2002 at the Presidential polls. Frexit would have been a disaster for France, which is at the heart of Europe and French voters have resoundingly rejected that proposal in a blow to all nationalist parties in Europe.
In Macron, French voters have opted for a political neophyte shorn of any scandals, which is rather unusual in French politics. He did receive a little bit of help in this regard from former Prime Minister Franois Fillon whose campaign was marred by a series of corruption allegations involving his wife that led to his first round exit. Macron started his campaign virtually from scratch, under the theme En Marche (Onward/On the Move) without the backing of any of the traditional political parties. Macron has the added bonus of being very young and good looking  only the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can perhaps beat him in that department. And the French also warmed up to his fairy-tale romance  Macron is married to his former drama teacher Brigitte Trogneux who is 24-years-older.
Macron inherits a France beset with a variety of problems. His predecessor Francois Hollandes re-election campaign fell by the wayside due to his inability to solve Frances chronic unemployment problem and contain a string of ISIS terror attacks in key French cities. The same problems will no doubt haunt Macron during the next five years at the Elysee. Macron will have to play a key role in the fight against extremism and terrorism and allay the fears over immigration. He has also pledged to cut government spending, reform the tax code, generate employment and loosen up Frances rigid labour markets.
Macrons first task will be to appoint a Prime Minister and a strong Cabinet, which is likely to include many outsiders just like him. But gaining a Parliamentary majority will be a bigger challenge, because En Marche has never ever contested a Parliamentary election (one is due next month).
In January, Macron announced En Marche! would field candidates in all 577 parliamentary constituencies. He wants half to come from civil society or elected local authorities. All must have a clean criminal record, renounce current political affiliations and campaign as an En Marche! candidate. At least half must be women. This is going to be a very challenging task, because voter apathy was a major factor in the Presidential polls, with millions of voters choosing to stay at home. If he cannot muster enough votes for a Parliamentary majority, Macron may have to strike a deal with some of the bigger traditional parties.
Leaders around the world breathed a sigh of relief as the elections results were announced, because a Le Pen victory would have caused chaos in Europe. They were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory which could dampen the spirits of nationalist and extremist parties everywhere. Stock markets around the world too reacted positively to the news, since France is a leading financial centre.
Relations between Sri Lanka and France have generally been excellent, except for a brief period during and after 2009 when the French Government expressed serious concern over the Human Rights situation in Sri Lanka. Fences have been mended after this Government came to power and France has been very supportive of Sri Lankas endeavours for achieving lasting peace and reconciliation. There is no doubt that Sri Lanka-France diplomatic, cultural and social ties will become stronger under Macron with his more enlightened global outlook. Vive La France!

You name it, we play it
The Marians were formed through the sacrifice and courage of one man. This man is Nalin Perera. Over the years it has become one of the most versatile and dynamic bands in the Sri Lankan music industry.
Daily News features the Marians comprising of Prasanna Rosa (Lead Guitar), Ruwan Fernando (Rhythm Guitar), Chaminda Silva (Bass Guitar), Dileepa Mangala (Key Boardist), Subash Punyasoma (Drums), Jayantha Kandabadage (Percussionist), Shivantha Fernando (Vocalist) and Shehan Jayasuriya (Saxophonist) and led by the inspiring Nalin Perera (band leader).
As a band Nalin tries to inculcate in his band members, an acceptance of different music styles. Nalin points out that in Sri Lanka lots listen to Sinhala, English, Hindi and Tamil.
As a band we try to cater to a diverse audience. We really like to play some retro type music. In the international music industry you have rock, classical and jazz. So you cant take one side in Sri Lanka because people like to listen to different types of music. So we do every kind of music style. That is the talent we have today. You name it we can play it. Music is a Universal language. It does not matter if you cannot understand that language  Hindi, Sinhala or Tamil. So why should we limit ourselves to one language/ one music style to produce our music said Nalin putting things in perspective.
The Marians perform in a lot of weddings. So they have to cater to the diversity out there. There are Tamil weddings, Sinhala weddings and Muslim weddings.
We perform so many styles of English songs. We perform the hits, all the styles, even hip hop. As a musician you need that power to entertain. That is why we have so many fans all over Sri Lanka! We never forget any community in Sri Lanka. Music is the bridge to communication between different communities. It is really great! In India we try to do some Hindi Songs. They were highly impressed with our Hindi songs. In USA and Australia, same story, the crowd loved it!, pointed out Nalin.
The Marians have put out seven albums, all originals. They have also have done some video productions. We have done some 60  70 original songs. In addition to all of this Nalin has done his solo performances.
Our band can understand the audience very easily, through our experience. We see the audience and we can judge within a second what to do. That is because of our experience. We have been doing it for almost 30 years in front of different types of people. My band line up is highly professional. They know what I am thinking and the goals I have and my vision. That is essential for a leader, stated Nalin.
When I was doing my A/Ls I organized a singing competition which marked the beginning of the Marians. At that time I was the head prefect of the school. At that time I did not have a name. So I happened to talk to the principal and revealed to him my intentions of starting a band. So we both brainstormed and came up with the name Marians, since my school is Chilaw St. Marys college. So those were the early beginnings of the band, said Nalin Perera.
At the very early stages of his youth Nalins intention was to become a musician. He spent a lot of time familiarizing himself with music neglecting his studies. In the years to come he would devote his life entirely to music. I got 4 Fs. But I had a great ambition to become a musician in this country. I have been influenced by so many people. One is Sunil Perera of Gypsies. We formed a friendship that has benefited my music. He helped me a lot. I met musicians who were around that time and we properly formed a band releasing our first Album in 1989 and subsequently did some shows, stated Perera. The band Marians has been in action for 29 years, dominating the music scene in Sri Lanka. To me discipline is very important. That is something I am very keen on. If you have no discipline you cannot go forward and progress. We are very qualified in our fields. The band members have experience in different kinds of bands but finally they joined with me to do a different kind of music, to do something new. That is something I always think of. Something new, pointed out Nalin.
Nalin feels that dreams can be realized. In this country parents want children to be doctors or engineers or a lawyers. But my intention was to become an artist. That is what I focused my mind on. I told me self you do whatever you like. You have to find out who you are. Luckily I got that chance. When I was doing my A/Ls I did Bio Science. Somewhere down the line I felt that this was not going to work. Then I changed my class to Math because my good friends were there. During that time I did not study anything, I allocated all my time to music  band rehearsals. My parents were a little unhappy because they expected me to become a doctor one day, explained Nalin.
Seeing tear drops from his fathers eyes broke his heart, but Nalin was set on his path.
That was like a fire burning in me. I had never seen tears in his eyes. But those tears gave me the incentive. We were not a very wealthy family, but my father provided for us. I felt that what I do, I must do it properly being the eldest in the family. With my determination, hard work and sacrifice I awaited my time. Then I met my wife at that time. Her parents helped me a lot to develop my band. The challenges I faced in my life helped me to take Marians up to a high standard. I wanted to become a musician because I had a passion for it. So today I have achieved that dream. It does not matter who you are. Or where you came from. Only thing that matters are your thoughts. Your mind is the most powerful weapon that you will possess in your life. So my advice to anyone is to work on your dreams. Work hard and you can make it a reality, elucidated Nalin.
Nalins son is studying for his O/Ls this time. But I can see that he is not studying. He wants to become a film maker! So this is just like flashback to me. My wife is so worried about him. But I know one day he will succeed. You have to believe in yourself. You have to give your children a chance to aim at their goals. If you impose barricades life goes down. You see every person has a different kind of talent. In my life I want to give my fullest support to the newcomers. These talents create a different world in this country. I can see that today so many people are enjoying my singing, added Nalin.Nalin feels his duty is to provide entertainment. With a fine band behind his back the sky is the limit for Nalin. Today he is thinking of new innovative things to do with his band in this country.
As a band leader, singer and TV Presenter I have lots of good ideas for my future and for my field. I have also acted in a film in 2003. I feel that one is free to do anything. One day we will close our eyes for the final time in this world. And you cant take anything with you. So do the right thing. As a musician I have done a lot for this country. As a human being I have done so much for charity. And I am still doing. God has given me the chance to become an artist in this world. Under the sun and moon we are all the same, revealed Nalin.

Yunnan holds seminar for ASEAN tourism professionals
China's Commerce Ministry with the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's office of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka conducted a seminar on Tourism Administration for ASEAN Countries at the Yunnan International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges in Yunnan, China from April 7 to 20.
Senior government officials from ASEAN countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Samoa, Bangladesh, China and Sri Lanka participated
Nineteen senior officials from the Presidential Secretariat, Tourism Ministry, Skills Development Ministry, Health Ministry, Labour Ministry, Media Ministry, Vocational Training Ministry, Foreign Employment Ministry,Colombo University, Land Reclamation Corporation, Ports Authority, Registration of Persons Department, Sri Lankan Airlines and representatives from China Eastern Airlines and the President of the Chamber of Tourism and Industry attended the seminar.
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranawithana made a speech on Sri Lanka's potential in agriculture and tourism and highlighted the investment opportunities available in Sri Lanka.
Chamber of Tourism and Industry President A.M. Jaufer said the Chinese authorities have developed their natural tourist attractions such as mountains, parks, lakes and lagoons to such high standards and is very commendable. It generates a lot of income to the local community.
During the meeting with Yunnan tourism commission official, he appealed to the Chinese Authorities for technical assistance and financial support in order to facilitate rural development in tourism industry. He mentioned that there is a vast potential of untapped resources in these provinces and by supporting them to develop, it will lead to a social growth in the country.
It was noted that there are 158.6 million inbound tourist arriving annually in Yunnan. He also identified the need to establish a Tourism Research Center to facilitate research work on tourism development and other related activities in Sri Lanka.
Another special area, where he thought that we can pay some special attention was the 'Travel Police' operation that he noticed in China.
He even suggested to Chinese authorities whether they can have some cross exposure arrangement for the local 'Tourist Police', where officers will be trained on how to handle situations in a professional manner and also how to deal with foreign guests, when they are faced with difficulties.
