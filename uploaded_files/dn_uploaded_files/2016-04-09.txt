What's Wrong with Sri Lanka Cricket
Many Sri Lanka cricket fans are not happy with Sri Lanka cricket. Our mediocre performance in New Zealand, in the Asian Cup T-20 Tournament and in the T-20 World Cup made our cricket crazy people unhappy and disgusted. Fortunately, our cricket lovers do not descend to the level of damaging the houses of our cricketers when they do not deliver the goods. This shows that Sri Lankans are a great people and know how to face victory and defeat in good spirits. Hats off to our cricket fans!
To me there is nothing wrong with Sri Lankan cricketers. They are a very talented lot. They should be given opportunities to play together for quite some time. Changing players every now and then will not do any good for Sri Lanka cricket. My concern is about two veterans on our side, namely, Rangana Herath and T. M. Dilshan. I believe that they have to hang up their boots now. In another few years they will be too old to make a substantial contribution to the team
Therefore, it is better for them to retire gracefully and made way for another two up-and-coming youngsters. Then a young side can play for some time and eventually become an experienced team. There is a fear among the selectors to introduce young blood to the team. They think that youngsters may not perform well and become discouraged. If a young player is allowed to play in the national team, then he should be given a free hand to play his natural game. As well as this, assurance should be given to him that he will not be dropped from the team if he fails to deliver goods from the very first match. To gain experience and become a matured player, any cricketer needs time. Let the players play their natural game without any fear. If the selectors and coaches do not interfere with the players then they will show their real class and perform well.
Someone may question what is lacking in our national cricketers. The answer is very simple. Our players are not mentally fit. There are times when you have to handle pressure. But our cricketers are not able to do so when the occasion arises. Except for our skipper Angelo Matthews, the others do not have the ability to adjust to the situation. Cricket is not only a game of skill. It is also a mental game. Our players are not prepared mentally to handle pressure situations. If our cricketers are not psychologically in the proper frame of mind to show their natural talents, then Sri Lanka cricket will not go very far.
For example: Virat Koli of India and Dinesh Chandimal of Sri Lanka of Sri Lanka are both equally talented. Virat Koli knows how to handle pressure and play the game without panicking. When the situation is tough Chandimal becomes upset and plays a silly shot and sacrifices his wicket. He is totally unfit to handle pressure situations. It is the prime duty of the Cricket Board to see that our players are mentally fit to play this great game.
If men in authority do not see to this important aspect, then our standard of cricket will go from bad to worse. In Sri Lanka we have enough talent and a lot of players. But they are not in the frame of mind to handle difficult situations. This is something that must be remedied immediately. If not, then we cannot become a great cricket nation.

Over 500 paddlers for WP TT C'Ships
Over 500 paddlers will vie for honours at the annual Western Province Chief Minister Trophy open ranking table tennis championship organised by the Western Province Table Tennis Association which will be worked off at the Indoor Stadium of St. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia today and tomorrow (April 9th and 10th).
All top ranked players are expected to participate mens Junior and Senior National champion Udaya Ranasinghe and women's Junior National Champion 14 year old Samadhi Hettiarachchi and Senior Champion Nuwani Navodya.
The other top paddlers who will be in the fray are Sri Lanka's ladies captain Ishara Madurangi, former champion Erandi Warusawitharna, Hansani Piumila, Chamathsara Fernando, Ruvini Kannangara, Thanushi Rodrigo and Bhagya Tennakoon. Twenty year old Nuwani Navoddya created a major sensation the Table Tennis Nationals last year by winning it and it will be left to be seen whether she could repeat her success but she will receive tough opposition from Ishara Madurangi, Erandi Warusawitharna, Hansani Piumila and Ruvini Kannangara in the open event.
Udaya Ranasinghe of Vidyartha College is a gifted paddler who is just 16 years of age and he has won most of the major championships during the last few years and often making it one way traffic. But he will have to overcome the likes of former national champions Rohan Sirisena and Nirmala Jayasinghe and Chameera Ginige and to some extent from his own school from paddlers like Krishan Wickremaratne and Prasad de Silva.

Over 120 competitors for Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb
The hills of Nanu Oya will roar with the revving of the engines and the screeching of the brakes when over 120 motorcycles and motorcars including Formula cars burn the tracks when the 83rd Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb organised by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club gets underway at the Mahagastota Division of Pedro Group, Blackpool, Nanu Oya on Saturday, April 10. The first set of motorcycles is expected to be flagged off at 8 am.
This speed hill climb will herald the motor racing season during the Nuwara Eliya Festivities season is also the oldest organised motor racing event in the country dating back to 1934. This event has been held annually except in 1934 when the scene was shifted to St. James Group, Hali Ela as the then Vicar of Nuwara Eliya was opposed to having this motor racing event on a Easter Sunday. In some years this event had been conducted twice the same year. Every tenth year it is being conducted in August during the mini season.
Those were the days when it was a two day meet when on the first day the official practices were conducted. A few years back this was done away with and the competitors go into the event straight away. Official practices helps the competitors to get themselves familiar with the track and where they have to be careful and where they could step on the gas.
The present overall course record holder is Nishan Weerasooriya who drove his Mitsubishi Evolution in a dare devil style to clock 34.17 seconds which broke the existing record of 34.348 held by Darin Weerasinghe. Nishan Weerasooriya's timing is the fastest ever in the 83 year old history of Mahagastota and is the fastest for stock cars and the Overall course record. Nishan Weerasooriya's timing is great following his earlier idea of retiring from the motor racing scene and in fact kept away from it for a few years and was also not heard of.
But last year like the mythical phoenix rose from the ashes to be in the limelight again. But this year he will not be there to improve his own record.
In Nishan Weerasooriya's absence it will be in the hands of Darin Weerasinghe to set up a new mark. Daring Weerasinghe has earlier held the course record in his Subaru, Impressa, which 34.348 seconds established in 2014.

A shot in the arm for flagging West Indies cricket
Cricket in the Caribbean has been flagging and there was no better solution to solving it than the West Indies men's and women's teams winning their respective World T20 competitions. It is the first time it has happened in the short history of the tournament which began in 2007 and has completed six editions of it. The Women's tournament began in 2009 and there have been five completed editions.
Joe Root
What everyone would like to see is this enthusiasm which West Indies has got into their system for T20 cricket born again in their Test cricket as well.
Not many of these players play Test cricket which is a crying shame. West Indies enjoy their cricket very much and it is generated on the field whenever they win. It is now upto the West Indies Cricket Board to ensure the success in T20 cricket is now transferred to the other two formats as well - Test and One-Day International cricket. When T20 cricket is thriving in the Caribbean this is the moment the Cricket Board should seize and capitalize on.
The closeness of results and the high scoring ability of some of the teams gives a clear indication that in T20 cricket any team can beat anybody at any given time and that includes the associate member sides who performed exceptionally well and even caused a few upsets when Afghanistan the most improved side of the associates pulled off a stunning upset over the eventual champions West Indies in a group match by six runs. Afghanistan were the only associate side that qualified to play in the Super 10 (along with Bangladesh) having come through the qualifying round beating Zimbabwe by 59 runs in the decider.
Right throughout the competition they gave all the Test playing sides they met a tough contest thus underlying the fact that associate teams have a chance of competing equally especially in the T20 format. Afghanistan's performance had the ICC's CEO Dave Richardson talking of increasing the number of associate teams in future World T20s by having a Super 12 instead of the present Super 10 which would give more opportunities for associate members to participate in the second round of the tournament.
Virat Kohli
With the first six World T20's taking place within a space of nine years, the ICC have now made it a four-year cycle from the next edition onwards. It will take place in 2020 in Australia.
Explaining the reasons for breaking off the two-year cycle for T20 cricket, Richardson said, "The danger of course is that if we keep pushing T20 and keep playing T20 events every two years, it will effectively cannibalise the other two. We want to make sure that we keep an even and more reasonable balance between the three formats. Hence, the decision to go with one men's World T20 in a four-year cycle".
The ICC is also mindful not to let the success of T20 cricket overshadow the other two formats and has even decreased the number of teams participating in the fifty-over cricket World Cup to 10 teams in 2019.
"The reason to go with a 10-team [2019 World Cup] tournament was done for a number of reasons. Number one, probably it was a format that would generate more competitive cricket and secondly, more value," Richardson said.
Samuel Badree
With the tournament staged in India, the home country was the favourites to win the title for a second time. Till the semi-final stage India displayed the form that would take them to achieve the pinnacle in the shortest format. But it was in the real crunch games that West Indies started producing their real firepower. As their captain Darren Sammy said they had 15 match winners in their side and so it proved.
The main focus of attention was on one of the biggest names in T20 cricket Chris Gayle. When he started the tournament with a typical Gayle century off 48 balls against England, everyone was of the opinion that Gayle was a one-man show that carried West Indies cricket. That may have been in the past but this West Indies team had many winners. Gayle never fired thereafter; he made only 13 runs in his next three innings. That cricket is a team game was proved by the West Indies in no uncertain manner. In their next game against Sri Lanka it was Andre Fletcher who won it for West Indies with an innings of 84 not out off 64 balls. In the low scoring match against South Africa it was Marlon Samuels' valuable 43 that got them across the line. In the semi-finals against India it was the power hitting of Johnson Charles (52 off 36 balls), Lendl Simmons (82 n.o. off 51) and Andre Russell (43 n.o. off 20) that saw them successfully chase down 193. Then in the final against England it was Samuels 85 not out off 66 balls and that astonishing hitting by Carlos Brathwaite who sent the first four balls of Ben Stokes for six that provided the final twist to an absorbing tournament. It brought the World T20 title back to the Caribbean once again after a lapse of four years. With the next edition of the competition not taking place until 2020, West Indies will hold onto the trophy the longest than its previous four winners - India, Pakistan, England and Sri Lanka.
New Zealand proved to be the most consistent team in the group matches but for all their consistency they faltered in the semi-finals against England to lose by a big margin of seven wickets.
Mitchell Santner
South Africa were talked as one of the team's that could make it to the finals especially after their excellent showing in India last October where they won the ODI series 3-2 and the T20I series 2-0. But despite an abundance of talented players in the side they still failed to make it to the last four and the chokers tag haunted them.
England looked a completely different side to the ones experienced in the past. England are known for being a very good Test side but rather ordinary in the other two formats because they don't give much emphasis to them. But this England team under two former coaches who served Sri Lanka in the past - Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace turned things around so well that England looked on course to win the World T20 title for a second time till that final over when Brathwaite snatched away the trophy which was well within their grasp.
Australia came with the hope of winning the only title that has eluded them in their history, but they fell short of expectations and there was wide opinion that they had got their batting line up all wrong by having the big hitting David Warner coming to bat in the middle rather than as an opener where he could have served the team well.
To the surprise of many none of the Asian teams managed to get beyond the semi-finals despite the tournament being played in the subcontinent. India playing at home had the best record whereas former champions Pakistan and Sri Lanka were totally disappointing getting knocked out in the group stage. Bangladesh who promised a lot in the Asia Cup reaching the final of the tournament fell flat on their face and returned home without a single win in the Super 10. Virat Kohli who won the Man of the Tournament award, Joe Root, Jos Butler, Jason Roy and Marlon Samuels were the top batters in the Super 10 whereas in the bowling it was the spin of Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Samuel Badree, David Willey, Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan and the two Afghan bowlers Mohammed Nabi and Rashid Khan that caught the eye.

World T20: How do the lights on cricket stumps work
Throughout the World Twenty20 cricket tournament, the flashing stumps have drawn plenty of interest from spectators. But how do they actually work, ask Harry Low and Hannah Sander.
Those watching this year's World Twenty20 cricket tournament will probably have noticed that the stumps and the bails, known as a wicket, sometimes start flashing a luminous red.
Traditionally stumps and bails are made from wood, but the new flashing wickets are made from a composite plastic, which are embedded with LED lights.
The use of flashing wickets in international matches was approved by the International Cricket Council in July 2013, and since then they have been used in hundreds of domestic and international matches.
Flashing stumps adds to the excitement of one-day cricket
The rules of cricket say that a batsman is out if they are beyond their batting crease when the stumps are "broken" - that is, when the bails are knocked off the stumps. Both ends of the bail have to come apart from the stumps. However, it can be hard for an umpire to detect this in real time.
However, with the new equipment, known as the Zing wicket system, the stumps and bails will flash the moment contact is broken. It was developed by Bronte Eckermann, a former Australian grade cricketer who was inspired by one of his daughter's toys, which was roughly the size of a cricket bail and contained LED lights.
The bails are powered by hidden low voltage batteries. They each contain a microprocessor that detects when contact between the bails and the stumps have been broken. The bails are illuminated within 1/1000th of a second. "They can be vibrated, knocked, rained upon, but will only flash when both ends are completely dislodged from the stumps," explains Eckermann. The microprocessors then send a radio signal to the stumps which also light up.
Flashing bails might have reprieved Indian captain MS Dhoni in a Test against England in 2006. He was given out because it was unclear to the umpires whether he had been safely behind the crease at the moment the ball hit the wicket, knocking the stumps to the ground.
Hundreds of thousands of Australian dollars have been spent developing the technology, turning the humble wooden stumps and bails into an expensive set of equipment.
This means that the sight of players clutching stumps after victory could become a thing of the past.

Eden Gardens - the worst press box in the world
Eden Gardens in Kolkata maybe famous in many ways for being able to absorb a capacity crowd of 100,000 spectators and provide an atmosphere ideal for cricket but where it falls behind is in its facilities for the media. The venue will easily qualify to be one of the most uncomfortable places for a journalist to cover a cricket match let alone a World T20 event.
The media box we were told can take upto 130 journalist but it was not the capacity that made it uncomfortable but the way the seating had been designed. It resembled a class room. There was one common table fitted with two chairs (which were immovable) where only a pair of journalists can work. The table barely had space to keep the laptop computers and there was hardly any room to take down notes. To make it unhealthier there was a shelf below the table which impeded the free movement of legs. The knees constantly knocked against them and there was no way one could shift the chairs because they were all permanently fixed. If one was stretch a leg you had to turn sideways and place it in the space between tables.
To say the least it was the most uncomfortable press seating ever witnessed at an international cricket venue. One visiting journalist admitted that nothing has been done to make any improvements and it has remained the same since 1999.
To make matters still worse for the journalists covering the World T20 final at this venue, one had to go through the mass of spectators in the stands to the toilet or to dine having to climb up and down several stair cases and travel quite a distance.
For all its history and boast the Eden Gardens press box is a far cry from what Sri Lanka has to offer.

A lasting memory for Madugalle
The 2015/2016 Inter-school cricket season is gradually coming to an end with the completion of the traditional 'big matches' and the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) conducted limited over tournament for the most outstanding teams of the season.
As the curtain of another inter-school cricket season comes down, the heat is on as the final lap for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year 'crown' begins. There has been tremendous enthusiasm among schoolboys as well as the young old boys in supporting the outstanding cricketers of their alma mater.
Hence, the tussle for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketers in Platinum, Gold and Silver categories has become extremely keen as we approach the end of the inter-school season and with it the school vacation for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.
Ever since its inception almost four decades ago, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has remained the most prestigious event in the school cricket calendar, producing a galaxy of Sri Lanka cricketers who have engraved their names in the golden books of Sri Lanka cricket.
Most members of the country's world cup winning team in 1996, including captain Arjuna Ranatunga, are proud recipients of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer awards. In fact, Ranatunga had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice - in1980 and 1982 before he became the first Sri Lanka to score a half century in Test cricket. He achieved this unique feat, still as a schoolboy cricketer from Ananda, in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test against England way back in 1982.
Prior to Ranatunga, it was Ranjan Madugalle, the then Royal College captain, who became the first recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1979. Since then, he has come a long way, captaining NCC and Sri Lanka teams with distinction before finally holding his current position as the Chief Match Referee of the ICC. It was a singular honour to Sri Lanka as a country to have one of its greatest cricketers in that elite position.
In a previous interview with the Sunday Observer, Madugalle has lavishly praised the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL - Lake House) and the country's flagship English newspaper for fostering school cricket. "The ANCL and the Sunday Observer should be complemented for keeping the show going for all these years. Sponsors are essential to keep the show going. May the show continue for many more years," he was quoted as saying.
"In the past, most of the winners of the top awards came from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game," adds Madugalle who had the honour of leading Reid Avenue boys in their centenary Royal-Thomian big match in the same year.
Madugalle, who turns 57 on the 22nd of this month, has represented Sri Lanka in 21 Tests, aggregating 1,029 runs with a top score of 103 against India. He has played in 63 ODIs to aggregate 950 runs. He made a debut half century in Test cricket, scoring 65 runs against England in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test, minutes after Ranatunga had become the country's first ever half centurion in Tests.
Exactly 29 years after winning the coveted title, Madugalle returned to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer victory podium in 2008 to grace the big occasion as the chief guest. "I stand in great sense of nostalgia and I can still remember the day I received the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in the inaugural show hosted by the Sunday Observer. The award is a lasting memory and I will treasure that moment forever." Madugalle said in his special address as the chief guest.
It was on his suggestion that the award for the best behaved team was introduced to the mega show from the following year (2009). "I would like to make a suggestion to introduce a special award for the Best Behaved team so that we would encourage the boys to play the game within the laws," he said in suggesting the special award which has now become a part of the show.
When the success story of the mega event is spoken, one can not the lavish contribution made by Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel which has been the proud sponsor of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show since 2008. With Mobitel's support, the standard of the event entered a new elevation with lavish cash incentives and high quality trophies to the outstanding schoolboy cricketers. Even their coaches and masters-in-change, who have done a silent job behind the scenes, too have been richly rewarded.

Wigneswaran wants two States
Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran presenting a Resolution on the Constitutional Reforms to the NPC has proposed the set up of two States in the country, one by merging the Northern and Eastern Provinces and the other by merging the seven other Provinces.
The Resolution which was presented to the Council was taken up for debate yesterday presided by its Chairman C.V. K.Sivagnanam. The Chief Minister further proposes to declare Muslim majority districts within the Eastern Province as an autonomous region, and a similar autonomous region for Estate Community.
The Resolution is to be handed over to Opposition Leader and TNA Leader R. Sampanthan. Wigeswaran observed no community should feel inferior to another community despite whether they belong to the majority or minority. He stated the need of a federal system to ensure proper power devolution in the country in a manner that everybody gets equal rights.
The resolution also proposes a separate State Parliament for the North and the East. The legislation made by the central government should be directed to State Parliament and autonomous regions before implementation.
As of the Resolution both Sinhala and Tamil should be made official languages while English is used as a link language. All the administrative documents should be in Tamil in the North and East, but their Sinhala and English translations should be available, and vise versa in Sinhala majority areas. The National Anthem should allowed to be sung in both Sinhala and Tamil as appropriate to the gathering present.
The Resolution also proposes that Police powers must be given to State Governments. It states the Prevention of Terrorism Act must be withdrawn completely. It also proposes that the Constitutional Assembly should seriously think on providing a durable solution to the national question. Wigneswaran suggests that there must be a dialogue between Sinhala leaders and Tamil leaders on the rights of Tamil people to live in their traditional areas.

I have stopped supporting JO activites - Manusha
The newly appointed Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said he had stopped supporting the activities of the Joint Opposition as of August 17, 2015.
He stressed: "I have always supported the SLFP".
Nanayakkara on Wednesday left the ranks of the Joint Opposition (JO) to become a Deputy Minister of the national government.
"At the January 8 elections, I supported the SLFP and worked towards the victory of its leader at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Thereafter, we kept working for Rajapaksa because he was the most popular Prime Ministerial candidate for the SLFP. We wanted to establish a SLFP government, not a UNP government,"explained the deputy minister.
He added, "Our aim is to form an SLFP government in 2020, not another UNP government". He further explained that one of the main reasons for his crossover was that certain minor parties in the JO were working towards breaking the SLFP apart and that he could no longer be party to such an enterprise. "Those who left at the time of crisis have come back to take charge and run things in the JO. We lost because of the family bandism practiced previously, but, it seems that we are having that system once again and they are taking things forward," Nanayakkara said.
He also said that many other members of the JO were also holding discussions with the President on the possibility of joining the government,
"There are even senior SLFP members in the JO interested in crossing over,but, they want Cabinet posts to do so. But, on the other hand, there are others who have said that they will join the President when the time is right," Nanayakkara said.
The recent crossovers will take the total number of Cabinet, State and Deputy Ministers to 92. Former President Mahinda Rajpaksa in 2010 too appointed a total of 91 Ministers, Senior Ministers and Deputy Ministers to form his government.

Politicians should be cautious about how to use power: President
All politicians should be cautious about how to use the power vested with them as leaders or members of a political party by the people in a democratic, free country and they should also know the place they are entitled to in that context, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President also emphasised the power given by the people should not be used by politicians to strengthen their own family and political power.
He made these remarks participating in the 100th birth anniversary celebrations of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at the BMICH Thursday.
President Sirisena said Sirimavo Bandaranaike never used the power vested with her in an inappropriate way and she was totally against fraud and corruption as well as her personal qualities like patience, commitment, honesty and the strengthen to face the challenges were exemplary to all in the field of politics today.
He said it is a timely need to emulate those qualities.
The greatest service by Sirimavo Bandaranaike to the country was a timely need in that era and those decisions were important at the international level too, the President said, adding that he had seen tears in the eyes of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in some situations in which challenges were faced by the country or her political party.
"When we fulfill our duties as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party we give top priority for the country and its citizens," the President said.

Chinese president meets Sri Lankan PM on relations
Chinese President Xi Jinping met with visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Beijing on Friday.

Xi spoke highly of the long-term friendship between the two countries, and their support to each other on issues of core interests and major concern.

China is willing to work with Sri Lanka to consolidate traditional friendship, expand reciprocal cooperation, and push forward strategic partnership of cooperation to a new high, Xi said.

He urged the two countries to integrate development strategies, maintain high-level exchanges, strengthen strategic communication, handle bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic perspective, and map out top-level designs for bilateral ties and cooperation in various fields.

Wickremesinghe echoed Xi saying the strategic partnership of cooperation featuring sincere mutual support and long-lasting friendship is in the interests of both Sri Lanka and China. It is also a consensus of all political parties in Sri Lanka.

He appreciated the positive role played by China in promoting global economic stability and growth, and thanked China for its long-term assistance to Sri Lanka.

With regard to bilateral cooperation, Xi said the two countries should take the Belt and Road Initiative as an opportunity to deepen cooperation in terms of trade, infrastructure, industrial parks, manufacturing, production capacity, technology, and ocean.

China will positively consider helping Sri Lanka build health projects and is ready for more cooperation in areas such as tourism, education and culture, Xi said.

He also vowed to strengthen communication and coordination with Sri Lanka under the frameworks including the United Nations, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the South Asian Association Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka will actively participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, strengthen cooperation with China in port and airport construction, trade, investment, transportation and technology, and increase cultural and people-to-people exchanges.

He said Sri Lanka is willing to strengthen cooperation with China within the SAARC.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday night, Wickremesinghe will conclude his official visit to China on Saturday.(Xinhua)
