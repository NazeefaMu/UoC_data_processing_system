A new organisation called `Anti SAITM Peoples Barricade (SAITM Virodhi Jana Pawra) was set up in Colombo on July 10 and the Anti SAITM Peoples Summit will take place in Colombo on July 20 with the participation of its member organizations, National Trade Union Centre Chairman K. D. Lal Kantha said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday.

The President of the Inter Company Employees Union Wasantha Samarasinghe said the Government is trying to kill the rights of 8,000 medical students to save 1,000 `medical students who are waiting to become doctors for money. Now the Government has only two options. That is either let the SAITM function and go home or abolish it and stay in power, he said.
Public Service Trade Union Federation (PSTUF) President W.H. Piyadasa said if the Government does not give a reply to the SAITM, the people will give a reply to the Government, and the country will head for disaster if the President change his decisions according to one ministers wishes.

Family planning is misunderstood in Sri Lanka

The subject `family planning' is similar to a bomb when it comes to Sri Lanka because various parties interpret it in various ways. But the real meaning of family planning is not limiting the number of children in a family, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today he said that since ancient times, rich and educated families in Sri Lanka did not have many children.
Ancient Sinhala kings and their Ministers had only two or three children. Only poor and illiterate people who were engaged in odd jobs had several children in their families, Dr. Bandara said.
Furthermore he said that the Representative of UNFPA in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Ritsu Naken have said that Sri Lanka has good indicators when it comes to family planning and stand ahead of other countries in the region such as India and Pakistan. But still the young people in Sri Lanka have relatively low knowledge on reproductive health.
Meanwhile the Consultant doctors who delivered lectures during the seminar said that in 2015 there were 113 maternal deaths in Sri Lanka and 23 percent of them had occurred due to unmet needs related to family planning. Around 7.3 percent of currently married women had an unmet need for family planning which contributes to maternal deaths.

More attention on Constitution than solving peoples issues
The Government makes arrangements to reform the Constitution instead of paying attention to the problems of the general public, Democratic Left Front General Secretary Vasudewa Nanayakkara said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the N. M. Perera Centre in Borella yesterday, he said they want a leader who would be liable to Parliament and the Executive Presidency should be abolished after the next election.
The Secretary said the general public requires an uninterrupted supply of essential goods, concessionary facilities and a fair price for the products but not a constitutional reform.
He said the Constitution would be reformed to satisfy the needs of the foreign nations and it would be adversely affected to the unity of the country.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka says he is in opposition with the establishment of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and an insurrection will be created if no immediate actions will be taken against the SAITM issue,Nanayakkara said.
The Secretary said the reason behind the instability of the pepper prices in Ratnapura was due to a cheap stock of imported pepper. The pepper had been mixed with Sri Lankan pepper and they would be exported.
It is backed up by a powerful political force, and it will harm the goodwill of the country, he said.

No interruption to projects launched by previous govt
Unlike past governments, the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena has continued the development work launched by the previous regime towards successful completion, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
In the past, governments elected to power had not only harassed and intimidated the supporters of the defeated party but also blocked or discontinued the good work accomplished by it, he said.
The minister was addressing a meeting after launching several development projects under the Ministrys Wewak Samaga Gamak programme at Udukiriwila, Hambantota on July 9.
Amaraweera said as soon as President Sirisena assumed office, he directed his Cabinet of Ministers to ensure that all development projects launched by the previous regime continued to a finish without disruption. Accordingly, all five major development projects launched by the previous government continued without disruption.
Amaraweera said people are today reaping vast benefits as a result of the SLFP decision to form a consensus government with the UNP which was the other major party.
He said SLFP supporters in the Ampara district had fallen into a helpless situation as SLFP Parliamentarians in the district were only concerned about conducting protest campaigns instead of serving the people.
Amaraweera said the allegation made against him that he predicted the possible arrest of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was a complete lie which was part of a conspiracy hatched by certain opponents to slander him. All this opposition and criticism against him began after the President made a special commendation of him and entrusted him with the additional Ministry of Mahaweli Development.

Ananda-Nalanda Big Match 1965
continued from Last week
On last weeks article, my colleague Ananda Sumanadasa described the first days play of the above match, and he does the second day to the finish on this one. Sumanadasa stated at this stage the lead was only 57 runs with 7 wickets in hand. Then the two De Silvas took the score to 100 when the former got out for 20 runs, lunch was taken at 108 for 4 with Tilak de Silva and G.C. Perera at the wicket. These two inform batsmen true to form punished the bowling and the score stood at 130 and a lead of 150 runs with six wickets in hand but they collapsed to 139 for 7 to a deadly spell of bowling by Ponnamperuma who claimed the wickets of De Silva, Dayapriya and Gunaratna, G.C. who was holding the fort also succumbed to Ponnamperuma for 35 runs and Ananda was all out for 160. Nalanda bowlers spearheaded by Ponnamperuma kept a tight leash on the Anandian batsmen to keep them quiet and hence their score low.
Nalanda was to get 145 runs in 160 minutes. One could sense that it was going to be a battle of nerves from the word go. A.G.Perera had Shantha Peiris bowled off his pads. Gunaratne and Perera bowled to a tight length and line gave the Nalandian batsmen no respite. Doolwela the thorn in Anandas first innings hung his bat out to a Gunaratna outswinger and Tilak de Silva snapped up the catch in the slips. Both the openers were back in the pavilion for 5 runs.The batsmen at the crease were Amarasekera and Narangoda, they made matters worse for Nalanda when Amarasekera was needlessly run out when Nalanda could least afford it. Sumanadasa stated that when things go wrong they can go horribly wrong as Nalanda was soon to find out. At tea Nalanda were 9 for 4 with Wijesekera and Jayawardene at the wicket. Their chances of winning had slipped away.
They did not fare any better after tea as Perera and Gunaratna had a stranglehold on them and both were given the marching orders, 16 for 6. The seventh wicket pair of Seneviratne and Gunawardene, their last recognised batsmen. Seneviratne who scored heavily for Nalanda that season showed some aggression putting life into the batting by scoring elegant strokes giving slim hopes to Nalanda. They put on 27 runs in even time, The defiant Senewiratne left caught behind by a hostile ball from Gunaratna, the Score stood at 40 for 7, Ananda was smelling an outstanding victory by now.
Gunawardene was left to carry the can with the tailenders at his disposal; he gave a dolly catch to Dayapriya at short extra cover deceived by Gunaratnas flight. The Anandian fielders were gathering around the new batsman Anura de Silva like vultures, but it was Ponamperuma at the other end who got out, the score was 45 for 9.
Every ball was accompanied by a deafening roar by the Ananda spectators, in spite of the din Sumandasa stated that the last pair was holding the fort stout-heartedly. Anura de Silva even then was showing his courage and talent stroking two superb boundaries getting into double figures, they were going at more than run a minute. A.G. thought enough is enough and brought himself on and immediately got through Anura de Silvas defence to flatten his leg stump, his score of 14 was the second highest by the Nalandians.
In the end Guneratna with match winning figures of 13-5-26-5 and A.G.Perera with match figures of 16.3-3-49-8 were really outstanding, concluded Ananda Sumanadasa the chirpy Ananda opener.
This was a historic win for Ananda and at the conclusion the hat collection started in earnest, it was the reserves role to play the collection game, its needless to say the hats were full to the brim and some portion of it was allocated to our ground boy.
A rich and famous old boy invited the whole team plus the coach and the support staff to dinner at a plush hotel. Drinks also flowed under the table and some tasted the hard stuff for the first time away from the prying eyes of their loved ones.
After the dinner, we purposely isolated ourselves to paint the town red and the first stop was Visaka Vidyalaya hostel, where already established contacts met undercover, not to mention new ones as well. It was all innocent fun and nothing below the belt or waist.
The next pit stop was the Galle Face Green where a large gathering of Anandians congregated to celebrate the win. A band was playing, people were singing and dancing and hugging total strangers and not only their girlfriends and casual acquaintances. Some guys were already walking about wobbly having had too much of the good thing too early. The whole of the Ananda team was still dumb struck, the victory had not entered their respective blood streams just yet, no wonder it took a few days. In a sporting gesture, we invited the Nalandians to join us but they politely declined to come, we heard later that that they were drowning their sorrows elsewhere.
The following Monday was declared a school holiday, and we had time to recover from the revelling of Sunday night. Tuesday morning we were to congregate at the Borella junction to be taken to College in an open decked double decker. We have never come across such adulation which embarrassed me a wee bit because I did not play a major role in this famous victory, anyhow cricket is a team game so be it I thought.
The double decker daubed with the maroon and gold flags stopped at the college gates to a rousing welcome by the teachers, prefects and schoolboys and headed to a special assembly where the entire cricket team but the freshers were awarded the College Colours.
Silently I said to myself, Oh what a feeling, sends you reeling!

Audi manager arrested in emissions probe
German authorities have arrested an Audi manager in connection with the VW diesel scandal.
This is the first arrest in Germany related to Volkswagen's emissions-test cheating scandal.
Munich prosecutors declined to comment on whether the arrested person is a current or former Audi employee.
On Thursday, the US Justice Department said it had charged former Audi manager Giovanni Pamio with directing staff to design emissions-cheating software.
Audi and parent company Volkswagen both declined to comment.
The Munich prosecutor's office has been investigating Volkswagen for some time, and searches were carried out at the company's premises in March.
An Audi employee has now been arrested on suspicion of fraud and false advertising in connection with the scandal, which involved vehicles being fitted with software that enabled them to pass emissions tests despite producing large quantities of pollution.
The employee has not been named, but according to reports in the German media, he is the same man who was separately charged last Thursday by the US authorities, 60-year-old engine developer Giovanni Pamio.
He has been accused of directing Audi employees to design software to undermine the testing process.
The Munich prosecutor's office said the Audi employee was brought before a judge on Tuesday and was now being held in custody.
A spokeswoman declined to discuss the possibility of the detained person being extradited to another country or comment on whether Munich prosecutors were in touch with US authorities.
The German arrest was part of a wider probe into fraud and false advertising and is a consequence of "findings following searches," the spokeswoman said.
No members of the Audi management board are being personally investigated as part of that probe, she added.In a statement released by US authorities last Thursday, US prosecutors alleged that Pamio ignored or suppressed warnings by certain Audi engineers that the pollution control systems being used on the brand's diesel engines contravened US clean air rules.
US prosecutors said Pamio had told subordinates to send false information to American regulators stating that Audi's "clean diesels" did not use technology designed to cheat federal pollution tests.
Pamio could not be reached for comment last Friday. (BBC)

Aussie Kirk wins Thornberry Creek LPGA title
Washington,Sunday:Katherine Kirk birdied the final hole to edge Ashleigh Buhai by one stroke Sunday, claiming a third LPGA tour title at the Thornberry Creek Classic in Wisconsin.
Australias Kirk went into the final round with a four-shot lead over South Africas Buhai and had the LPGA Tours 72-hole scoring record in her sights.
She nabbed six birdies in a final-round 70, and while it didnt threaten the scoring record of 27-under, her 22-under total of 266 was enough to hold off Buhai.
To make that putt (on 18) was huge, Kirk said. All wins are good. Winning out here is hard, and its gotten a lot harder out here since I first did it, thats for sure.
There is so much talent out here now and it makes it so much harder to win. I think Im the 15th-oldest player on Tour, added the 35-year-old. So if youre looking at age its more in favour of the younger generation these days ... but hard work pays off.
Kirk, of Brisbane, notched her first LPGA win since the 2010 Navistar LPGA Classic. She also won the 2008 Canadian Womens Open.
She also secured a berth in the US Womens Open that starts on Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Johannesburgs Buhai rolled in the last of her five birdies in a bogey-free 67 at the 18th and finished alone in second on 267. AFP

It is just like winning for the first time, man, he said. What a day. This is like, so cool.
It was Penskes first win over the 0.89 mile oval in 11 races at Iowa Speedway.
Castroneves hadnt won in over three years but he has had good success this season and says he never lost hope. AFP

China Guangxi Products Expo in Colombo
For the first time the Department of Commerce of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will hold the 2017 China Guangxi Products Exhibition (Sri Lanka) in Colombo at SLECC from July 14 to 16.
This is mainly inspired by the Belt and Road imitative launched by China where Sri Lanka is a key player, said Qin Xiangxiong.
He said that his district hopes to meet Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and build links between Guangxi and Sri Lanka to promote economic and trade cooperation.
Guangxi plays an important role in the Belt and Road Initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping. In April, 2017, during his inspection in Guangxi, president Xi pointed out that Guangxi owns conditions to exert more effect in the establishment of the Belt and Road. Guangxi is rich in natural resources, such as its abundant minerals, agriculture and forestry, ocean and tourism resources.
This expo will be strongly supported by the Economic and Commercial Counsellors Office of the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China, Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka China Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Chambers Of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka China Business Council.
It is the first time for Guangxi Government to hold a products exhibition in Sri Lanka. There are 30 booths in this expo and 27 enterprises from Guangxi participate in the exhibition representing diversified sectors.
The exhibition includes such five categories as electronic products, construction materials and machinery, food and tea-leaves, home textiles and clothing, daily house crafts, covering hundreds of best-selling famous specialties and new high-quality products, which intensively reflect the highest production capacity level of Guangxi.
According to the statistics of China Customs, in 2016, the total bilateral trade value between China and Sri Lanka is 4.56 billion dollars, of which Chinas export to Sri Lanka is 4.3 billion dollars, and Chinas import from Sri Lanka is 273 million dollars, indicating that China has become Sri Lankas largest trade partner and source of imports for the first time. Benefitting from the overall development of China-Sri Lanka relationship, Guangxi, Sri Lanka trade in 2016, has reached 78.88 million dollars, increased by 69.3% year on year, reflecting a huge growth potential.
In 2016, Guangxis GDP is 274.68 billion dollars, its export and import trade is 47.9 billion dollars. This exhibition aims at setting up a new platform for further expanding and deepening bilateral economic and trade cooperation and communication between China and Sri Lanka, said President Sri Lanka China Chamber of Commerce, Thilk Godamanne.

Look for seawater!
Sri Lanka is an agrarian country like India. Paddy is our main product. We face difficulties because of the water shortage during the dry season. The world is 97 percent seawater and it is not used for agriculture.
I understand that in South India, a special paddy methodology has been worked out. It could be worked with seawater. Plants grown in mangroves have been genetically modified and this new brand of paddy proves successful. It is better for the Government to investigate this and obtain assistance from India before it gets too late. We could be self-sufficient in paddy and stimulate export also. More jobs could be created. The foreign exchange could be earned and saved as well.
We should target to be self-sufficient in agriculture, milk and poultry. Special investment programme and tax concessions should be considered to achieve this target.
Over to you Agriculture Minister.

Colin Ingram hits ton, Leicestershire win last-ball thriller
LONDON, Sunday: Glamorgans Colin Ingram and Luke Wright of Sussex hit the first T20 Blast centuries of the summer in a high-scoring clash at Arundel on Sunday.
Ingram made 101 not out off 47 balls and, although Wright later matched his score, Glamorgan won by 18 runs. Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish.
Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent.
Somerset looked dead and buried against Surrey at The Oval as they were reduced to 82-7 after Arran Finchs 61 off 42 balls led the home side to 181-7.
But Surrey had reckoned without New Zealander Corey Anderson, who raced to a 30-ball half-century - and a decision by the umpires to award 12 penalty runs to the visitors because of their poor over-rate.
Somerset needed 12 to win off the last over, but Anderson was run out for 81 - and innings featuring seven sixes - and Surrey scraped home by four runs. A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sundays five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game.
While South Africas Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lords, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan.
Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2.
He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3.
When it was Glamorgans turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown.
And although Wright equalled Ingrams sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6.
At Aigburth, Liam Livingstone (48 off 34 balls) and Jos Buttler (39 off 21) were the main contributors to Lancashire Lightnings 173-9.
Leicestershire looked comfortable needing only six off the final over, but Mathew Pillans was run out after four singles to start the over.
Ackermann was on strike for the final ball from Kyle Jarvis and managed to clear the rope at deep extra cover to finish with an unbeaten 62 off 41 balls as they won by three wickets.
Essex import Mohammed Amir came in for some rough treatment from the Kent batsmen at Beckenham, with Joe Denly hitting three sixes and a four in his second over as they tried to defend a score of 166-8.
Denly (32) and Sam Northeast (33) were removed by spinner Simon Harmer (2-21), but unlike the final over of the Essex innings in which three wickets fell, Kent opener Daniel Bell-Drummond saw his side home with a six off Amir, whose 3.3 overs cost 41 runs.

Dengue infects 10 doctors at Negombo General Hospital
Reports indicate that about 10 doctors attached to the General Hospital, Negombo were diagnosed with dengue fever but the Hospital Director yesterday refused to confirm the number.
I am aware that some of the doctors were diagnosed with dengue but I do not know the exact number and how they got the disease, Director Dr Nilanthi Pathirana said.
The hospital is struggling to cope with the dengue crisis as a serious shortage of staff, beds and equipment continues to hinder their ability to deal with the lengthening queues of patients.
Dr. Pathirana said around 600 dengue patients were admitted to the hospital but the hospital has only 369 beds. She said the hospital was in need of more beds and staff to control the increasing number of dengue patients at the hospital.
I dont know when this is going to end because the number keeps on increasing. Around 150 dengue patients are admitted everyday, she said.
She said several screening centres were set up at the hospital and anyone who suffers from fever can come and check. Pathirana said dengue patients are admitted only if their platelets were very low. If number are not too low, they will be given necessary instructions and sent home, the Director said.

Dengue still at manageable level
The dengue death rate is below 0.3 percent and this is a very satisfactory level. We expect to keep the rate at 0.2. percent.
We will work hard to lower it as much as possible but passing the ball to each other will not solve the dengue issue in Sri Lanka, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that the number of dengue deaths(245) is correct and based on scientific facts but the number of dengue patients(80,732) may not be accurate because it is possible to erroneously identify some as dengue patients.
No one with fever should apply home remedies and do nothing. He or she should seek immediate medical treatment from a qualified doctor or a hospital, Dr.Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara, most of the dengue deaths occur due to late presentation and most of the dengue patients who died had sought medical treatment after reaching the Leeking Stage, which is a very serious condition with very low blood pressure level, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome.
A Moratuwa University student who died from dengue faced the same situation, he said.
Pakistan overcame dengue because of the talent of the Pakistan Chief Minister.
It is up to each and every Sri Lankan to do their duty in connection with controlling dengue. Driving away mosquitoes is not adequate to stop dengue.
Every citizen,no matter whether he/she lives in a palace or a hut should do their duty, he added.

Despicable Me 3 : Double the fun
The third chapter in the life of Gru (Steve Carell), his adorable wide-eyed little girls and the minions, sees them embarking on a new adventure that involves a dancing villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), Grus blonde twin brother Dru (Carell) and a unicorn. Also, having given up his villainy, will Gru partake in a heist to keep his family tradition alive
The latest instalment of Illuminations hit franchise is the Knight and Day and Mission: Impossible of animation films. It has truckloads of action to keep you entertained and a bit of drama to evoke emotions. Fast-paced and loaded with adventure, this one rarely has a dull moment. On the flip side, you miss the heart-to-heart conversation between Gru and the girls that caught your fancy in the first film.
To sum it up, this one's an outlandish and overstuffed sequel that has too many things going on all at once. It comprises a heist, Gru's discovery of his long lost twin brother Dru, bubble gum firing bad guy, minions displaying their singing skills etc. What it lacks emotionally, it tries to make up in the form of constant action sequences. While its not easy to make an exciting instalment with the same template, Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin manage it to a certain extent, thanks to Steve Carell and Kristen Wiigs fantastic and consistent voice contribution.
Though not as endearing as the first film or funny as the second, Despicable 3 achieves what it sets out to - entertain the kids. Unlike the previous films, this predominantly caters to the younger crowd. It lacks the warmth of the original but if you dont mind too many Grus, guns, bubblegums and robots, this colourful, cutesy film can be a fun one time watch.

## Title: Development impact bonds : Pay for success
## Supertitle:

Development impact bonds : Pay for success
Impact bonds: a new approach to development finance. Governments are looking for innovative models to finance their public agendas without substantially higher costs for society. Impact bonds seem an appropriate, innovative financial mechanism to use private funding to support public goals. Impact Bonds, shorthand for social impact bonds, social benefit bonds or development impact bonds, are a new social investment mechanism that is growing in popularity. Impact bonds effectively allow the risk of implementing social development activities to be shared with private sector investors. Social or development impact bonds replace the upfront financing of charitable activities with a pay-for-success contract. Four actors together agree upon the outcomes and their indicators: outcome sponsor, investor, project implementers, and verifier.
Basic structure of an impact bond
Compared with result-based financing, impact bonds include a third party, the investor, who pre-finances the necessary activities to achieve desired development outcomes. The investor is paid based on results achieved. Impact bonds generally involve four actors: investor, service provider, outcome sponsor, and verifier. The investor pre-finances the activities of a service provider, serving a particular societal outcome. An independent verifier assesses whether the outcomes are met according to the contractual arrangements. The outcome sponsor agrees to pay the investor once the agreed outcomes have been achieved. Impact bonds have variable returns, similar to equity investments, including interest on return.
The process to organise the design of an impact bond, including agreeing on the outcomes and the specific contractual arrangements, can be complicated and time-consuming; therefore, an intermediary sometimes facilitates the process to create the structure for the development impact bond (DIB), including the legal and financial specifics.
An impact bond adheres to four criteria. Firstly, measurable outcomes are to be defined that can be measured by the independent verifier. The simpler and clearer the outcomes are, the easier it is to measure success in an unambiguous manner (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015). Secondly, a reasonable time horizon to achieve the outcomes needs to be defined. Thirdly, there should be evidence that the outcomes can be achieved successfully. This will motivate the investor to provide the pre-financing and take the risk. Fourthly, the appropriate legal and political conditions need to be in place to support the impact bond. If governments are involved as outcome sponsors, the legal structure should generally allow them to pay for outcomes achieved beyond the fiscal year (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015).
Target indicators and Development Impact Bond value to sponsor
We can note the following possible options: Replacement value
The value of the result can be evaluated as the cost that the outcome sponsor would need to incur if it wanted to produce the results itself. Results like operationalization of a production facility, construction of a warehouse, or installation of water pumps give a fairly precise approach to estimating their value.
Outcome players are likely to have all the necessary assumptions at hand, and it is immediately clear if financing via a DIB brings any benefits. At the same time, for a wide range of results, such as facilitating vertical diversification of smallholder producers, this approach is not directly applicable owing to the uncertainties of future developments in the value chain as the result of the project.
Activity-based approach
If the schedule of activities to be implemented towards the achievement of the result is known, it is technically not difficult to calculate the cost of implementing these activities. The total budget for activities, plus a certain level of profitability, provides a fair benchmark for projects focusing on issues such as education, vaccination campaigns, or quality certification for market access, among others. The negotiations between outcome sponsor and investor on the value of the DIB would be fairly simple in such cases.
However, this approach faces a natural limitation because the investor would essentially need to take the risk of not reaching the intended results despite full and diligent implementation of activities (effectiveness risk).
This risk would vary by sector, and the negotiation of profitability markup by the investor may be expected to fail if the expected effectiveness of proposed activities is insufficient in mitigating the effectiveness risk. At this stage, it is not entirely clear where such a limit of activity-based approach would lie in practice because the limit will mainly be seen in the failure of negotiations of DIBs. It seems that identifying and examining such cases presents a separate research challenge to provide more insight into the practical applicability of an activity-based approach.
Financializing economic impact
This approach assumes that the outcome player can agree on some measure of the economic impact of a project. The net economic value of a project could be calculated using assumptions as is commonly done in commercial projects. The outcome sponsor may wish to get involved in such projects because the use of normal forms of financing is not possible owing to lack of viable monetization. The determination of the value of such a DIB would best be based on objective economic indicators such as revenue, the price premium for quality, or volume of transactions in a microfinance scheme, among others.
The estimates of a net economic value are notoriously imprecise and, in the absence of some objective indicators, the negotiations of a DIB are also likely to fail.
However, the list of specific activities to be financed under a DIB contract does not need to be negotiated and specified in such a contract, which opens considerable scope for the investor to monitor and mitigate the risk of delivering the intended result by adjusting the activities in the implementation process.

Lausanne,Sunday:The reanalysis of doping samples taken at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics should be completed in August, the IOCs medical chief said Sunday.
The reanalysis of Vancouver samples has started and should be finished in August, said Richard Budgett after a meeting of the executive board of the International Olympic Committee.
The IOC has ordered the re-testing of more than 1,000 samples taken during the 2010 Olympics in Canada.
Budgett said that re-tests of samples taken at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Summer Games were now complete, with analyses from the 2014 Sochi Winter Games still ongoing.
The re-testing came in the wake of a state-sponsored doping system in Russia, whose track and field athletes were banned from taking part in the 2016 Rio Games and will miss out on next months world championships in London, although some have now been cleared to compete internationally as neutrals.AFP

Edible fashion
Fashion isnt just about what you cover your skin with anymore. Offering delicacies to your beloved stomach, in style and inspired by fashion is the budding trend now! The concept has existed internationally for a while now, with the Edible Fashion Awards and designers such as Ami Goodheart and Joelle Mahoney wowing audiences with their unique dresses made out of edibles, but it was spotted recently at an event held in the city where the culinary spread was inspired by various fashion accessories, and city folk seem to vouch for the fact that edible fashion is here to stay.
Food and wine enthusiast Jyoti Balani, who was hosting the event, claims, I got this inspiration while working on an article on high teas. In a lot of upscale hotels in London, high teas are held to announce the new fashion season and all the food created is in sync with fashion. It is always a great idea to create and curate an event where all the elements are perfectly in sync with each other. According to me this trend is here to stay and I feel everyone should create food which is line with the theme of the event. Edible lipsticks made up of white chocolates, sumptuous cakes designed in the form of shoes and mesmerising perfumes made of Cointreau mist  name it, and city-based Chef Padala Mahesh had it whipped for display!
Designer Seema Anand opines that edible fashion is the height of imagination and experimentation  the two pillars which have always been the backbone of the fashion industry. Fine dining has always been a fashion in itself. The fact that youngsters are accessorising with edibles is the latest up and coming thing. Its a brilliant trend but it still has a long way to experiment when it comes to the longevity of these items.
In an attempt to attest this unique craze, fashion blogger and enthusiast Smita Roy Majumdar believes, Edible fashion is such a rapidly spreading craze because who doesnt like cakes and chocolates And once you incorporate interests of the fashion fraternity, like cake resembling a showstopper wearing a red Valentino as the centre piece with makeup items beautifully decorated around, all made of edible chocolates. its a dream come true. Be it a war of taste or a submission to what your taste buds crave, Bengaluru sure loves serving it in style!

FAO, Education Ministry support school garden initiative in SL
The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Ministry of Education hosted a ceremony on July 4 at Wijerama Maha Vidyalaya in Udahamulla, Nugegoda, to highlight the importance of school gardens for child nutrition and life skills.
The event took place in the context of the project on 'Scaling up Nutrition through a Multi-Sector Approach', jointly implemented by FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka.
Through this project, more than 6,000 schools have been inspired to create their own organic and healthy garden within the school grounds. To support each school develop their own garden, FAO together with the Ministry of Education have facilitated a series of training workshops in all nine provinces, training 377 education officers.
At these comprehensive two-day workshops, education specialists have learnt the different aspects of establishing and managing school gardens, from selecting a location and deciding the type of beds to create, to identifying the best tools and equipment. They have also learned about fertilizing, pruning and pest control by utilizing plant extracts and modern technologies.
The education specialists have acquired the skills to impart this knowledge to the school community within each province. They have been provided a guideline and manuals which teachers, parents and children can use in establishing the school garden.
As the project includes knowledge about child nutrition, health and education, it encourages the children to directly apply what they learn in their school gardens and replicate the same healthy habits at home. FAO has distributed gardening tools and resources to participating schools across the island to support the projects sustainability.
A manual available in both Sinhala and Tamil has beenc rucial to the success of the initiative, and has reached over 300,000 children across the island. In many parts of the country that continue to struggle with food insecurity and undernutrition, this initiative has supported children to take responsibility for their diets and share their learnings with their families and the wider community.
Speaking at the event, the FAO Representative Nina Brandstrup highlighted school gardens as a key tool in teaching children the value of nutritious organic food and the importance of sustainable lifestyles. School gardens can be used as a classroom by reconnecting children with the outdoors and the source of their food, she said. These gardens teach children about the importance of a balanced diet and nutrition while opening their eyes to new agriculture concepts. The gardens are also encouraging the children to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables; no one can resist eating what they grew with their own hands!
Jayantha Wickramanayake, Director of National Schools said: This project jointly implemented by the FAO and the Ministry of Education is a good solution to tackle health problems and the lack of awareness about the environment among school children. This programme really takes education beyond the classroom, guiding students to form a relationship with nature.
Brenda Barton, Representative and Country Director of World Food Programme (WFP) highlighted that the school garden initiative ties in with the efforts of WFP to treat undernutrition in Sri Lanka. Our aim is to support behavioural changes through enhanced nutrition education and information on safe and nutritious foods, dietary diversity, nutrient deficiencies and their root causes, she said.
The event concluded with the distribution of gardening tools to 22 school principals from the Sri Jayawardenapura Education zone of the Western Province, and the planting of a fruit tree followed by a visit to the school garden by guests and the school community.

It was a good game of cricket, but in hindsight there were too many extras bowled, 32 is a whole different story at the end of the game and we did well to keep in there at the end, she said.
We gave ourselves too much to do through the middle of our batting and bowling.

Ideal vision Auto & lifestyle Show from Saturday
Ideal vision "Auto & lifestyle show" 2017, a unique concept which is far different to the traditional motor Shows that we witness will be held on July 15 and 16 at Nelum Pokuna.
 We are showcasing our product strengths from a motor cycle, scooter, 3 wheeler, light truck, medium truck, heavy truck, SUV, double cabin pickups, electric cars, to the latest diagnostic maintenance, renewable energy, finance, automotive spare parts, white goods, electronic goods, IT, & many more.
Nalin Welgama, Founder and Executive Chairman Ideal Group, said that this is the first time in Sri Lanka, they will be showcasing the entire range of vehicles marketed solely by Ideal; a step taken by no other automotive major.
We are also proud to be the first auto major in Sri Lanka to introduce a franchised electric vehicle from the house of Mahindra & Mahindra, a global conglomerate which manufactures the widest spectrum of automobiles ranging from the 2 wheelers, 3 wheelers, light trucks, heavy trucks & buses, UVs, construction equipment, SUVs and cars.
Welgama went on to say that an impressive line-up of electric vehicles from Mahindra will also be introduced in the next few months in keeping with current world trends. Speaking further on the electric cars he said that one of the biggest emitters of carbon to the atmosphere are vehicles with combustion engines.
We have witnessed the rapid rate at which Tesla has progressed making it the 4th largest car company surpassing car giants like BMW on valuations. It is believed that we will have 100 million EVs by 2025, he said.
The Narendra Modi government has taken a bold step to have only EVs on all Indian roads by 2030. They are also launching a driverless metro train over a 13 km stretch in New Delhi commencing in October 2017. Prime Minister Modi is also fully committed to transforming India to EVs by 2030. Our president is also a keen believer of renewable energy and was a key participant at the Paris Agreement last November and Sri Lanka too should follow on these lines.
Sri Lanka too is committed to improve solar power generation to around 20% from the present 7%, which is encouraging. This will no doubt motivate both the government and the public at large to improve awareness.
Cementing on the dearth of trained technicians and engineers and how the Ideal Group propose resolving this he said most trained technicians, are overseas in search of better prospects. Time is ripe to try to lure them back home by introducing "state of the art" workshops in keeping with the modern trends. We have successfully achieved this with the setting up of our "Ideal Choice Premier Workshop" in Ratmalana. This has attracted a lot of highly trained Sri Lankan expats particularly from the Middle East.

INSEE Cement launches Road Safety Awareness Programme in Katunayake FTZ
INSEE Cement - the brand behind the countrys leading retail cement products INSEE Sanstha and INSEE Mahaweli Marine, has joined hands with the Board of Investment (BOI) and the Sri Lanka Police to launch a road safety awareness programme targeting the Katunayake Export Processing Zone.
The initiative recently kicked off at the BOI auditorium focusing on creating awareness among the drivers, waste handlers, logistic officers, supervisors, and executives in the KEPZ factories, on the need to be vigilant when it comes to road safety.
Gayan Fernando, Head of Health and Safety at INSEE Cement reiterated INSEE Cement takes the necessary precautions to prevent fatigue, risk taking and the consumption of alcohol by our drivers. We also ensure that the condition of our fleet is maintained at the optimum level. So that when our vehicles are on the road, we are confident that both the driver and the vehicle are geared to perform well, ensuring safety at all times. We take pride, that our contribution to road safety has won prestigious accolades.
Najila Ranganath, the Sales & Marketing Manager of INSEE Ecocyle commented, With industrial development adversely affecting peoples health and safety, INSEE Cement is concerned about the impact this has on our stakeholders, especially those working in the INSEE Ecocycle Pre-processing Facility at BOI, Katunayake. Our knowledge sharing initiative will undoubtedly help to change attitudes and bring about a behavioural change, starting with our own people in the KEPZ, which we believe is the first vital step.
In 2016, more than 3,000 road accidents were reported in Sri Lanka. The primary cause of accidents identified being the negative attitude of drivers, showing disregard for road safety while not adhering to the highway-code. By conducting regular awareness programmes of such magnitude, INSEE Cement is geared towards empowering communities  to build brighter futures for the nation.

Jaguar Land Rover cars closer to driving city streets autonomously
Jaguar Land Rover recently demonstrated prototype autonomous technology called Autonomous Urban Drive that can enable a vehicle to operate autonomously through a city, obeying traffic lights as well as negotiating T-junctions and roundabouts.
This research technology, called Autonomous Urban Drive, is designed and developed in the UK. It is a step closer to achieving level four autonomy in Jaguar Land Rovers future vehicles within the next decade.
Level four autonomous vehicles are capable of carrying out the entire driving task for specific environments such as towns and cities without any driver intervention. Using the Autonomous Urban Drive prototype technology, passengers can select a location and the Range Rover Sport research vehicle will decide the best route. It can navigate a complex urban environment which is being trialled at the HORIBA MIRA proving ground.
Jaguar Land Rover is developing both fully- and semi-autonomous vehicle technologies to offer customers a choice of an engaged or autonomous drive,while maintaining an enjoyable and safe driving experience. The companys vision is to make the autonomous car viable in the widest range of real-life, on- and off-road driving environments and weather. Tony Harper, Director of Engineering Research, Jaguar Land Rover, said: "The automotive landscape is changing faster today than ever before. As a technology company, our innovation is continuous and our cars of the future will become more capable, cleaner, more connected, more desirable and smarter."
Autonomous Urban Drive is being demonstrated as part of the 20 million UK Autodrive research and development project which is pushing the UK to the forefront of connected and autonomous innovation. Jaguar Land Rover is working with Ford and Tata Motors European Technical Centre testing connected technologies that will allow cars to talk to each other, as well as to the roadside infrastructure such as traffic lights.
Following the final trials at HORIBA MIRAs Midlands proving ground today, the first set of trials on public roads are due in Milton Keynes and Coventry by the end of this year. These will initially take place on closed roads before evolving into open-road trials and demonstrations as the project draws to a close in summer 2018.

Johnihamy reveals secret of long life
Be in line with Mother Nature:
Village life, clean air, household chores, and home-grown food helped me live so long Dikmadugodage Johnihamy, who celebrated her 103rd birthday on July 9, said. She was born in Algiriya, Theliijawila in 1914.
My mother was married when she was at 27 to my father, Dikmadugodage Dinoris, who was her neighbour and her childhood love, her eldest son Jinadasa Dikmadugoda said.
My father was a farmer and it was my mother who helped him in his farming. She did all the household chores as well while taking care of six children. She used to carry my fathers meals to the field and help reap the harvest and even carry it home.
It was she who dried, threshed and winnowed the paddy as mills were not in the area at the time. My mother drew water from our well and carried it home in a pitcher. We used to help our parents in whichever way we could as we grew up. I think it is the simple village life that my mother led, the clean air and the home-grown food that kept my mother healthy for her to celebrate her 103rd birthday, he said.
Even at 103 Johnihamy can get about unaided. Being a devout Buddhist, she used to walk to the village temple, about a half a mile away, to observe sil every Poya day since her childhood until the Chief Incumbent of the temple requested her to observe sil herself at her home. A large number of well-wishers including Johnihamys six children, 45 grandchildren and great grandchildren attended the religious ceremony held to celebrate her 103rd birthday.

Kalinga granted permission to represent Aloysius
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday (10) granted permission to Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indratissa to represent Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius at the proceedings.
Indratissa PC made an application yesterday morning at the Commission seeking permission.
Arjun Aloysiuss lawyer appeared before the Commission in the backdrop where evidence was led last Friday (07) regarding certain telephone calls initiated by Aloysius to the Deputy General Manager of the Pan Asia Bank Cooperation Richard Dias, who is a witness at the Commission.
According to Dias, Aloysius may have attempted to tamper with the statement he was giving before the CID team attached to the Commission. Justice Prasanna Jayawardena directed the Attorney General Office to look for legal provisions to take action against Aloysius and Former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera for interfering with witnesses of the Commission.
Application to represent Aloysisus was made under the section 16 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, which grants permission to represent persons whose conduct is the subject of inquiry or who is implicated or concerned in the matter under inquiry.
The panel representing Aloysius also includes lawyers Chaminda Atukorale, Chandrakumara Silva and Theruni Fernando.
Dias, appearing before the Commission for the third day, was questioned on the intermediary role played by the Pan Asia Banking Cooperation regarding the transactions which took place between the Perpetual Treasuries Limited and the Employees Provident Fund. PABC has bid on behalf of the PTL at the auction which took place on the 27 February 2015.
It has also acted as an intermediary to sell the treasury bonds purchased at the said auction by the PTL to the EPF. PABC has received commissions from those transactions.
Dias said generally the agreed rates in these transactions should have been mutually beneficial for all the parties involved in it, however in relation with the said transactions it was not the case.
Certain telephone call recordings which have taken place between PTL, PABC and EPF dealers were marked before the Commission by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake.
Dias said that it seemed the bond purchasing and sales between the PTL and the EPF seemed pre-arranged and pointed out that the price and the volume regarding those transactions seemed decided by the PTL. He pointed out the telephone conversations also give rise to the same doubt. DSG Gunatilake and PTL lawyer Nihal Fernando PC led evidence for the day. Dias will be further examined by Fernando PC today (11).

Kapurala seeks Intl intervention
A former kapurala of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya has sought the intervention of the United Nations High Commissioner, the British Prime Minister, and the International Commission of Justices in respect of the violation of his rights and severe injustices endured by him consequence of malicious conduct of certain individuals and the inability of the judicial system to grant him relief in respect of the hereditary rights for the post of kapurala at the devalaya.
Pathmasiri Ranjith Adhikaram, a kapurala (religious cleric) of Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya, has sent letters to United Nations High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and International Commission of Justices Prof. Robert Goldman urging their urgent intervention in this regard.
Adhikaram said he was Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Kapurala of the devalaya in terms of the ancient rituals and customs of the devalaya. He was inducted to the office of kapurala of the devalaya in or about 1960 to perform the duties.
He stated that, despite his induction to the office, commencing from on or about 1997, certain individuals have collectively colluded and deprived him of entering the devalaya and performing his duties.
He stated that his rights to perform his duties in the temple was recognised by the Courts in Sri Lanka as far back as 2005, but owing to the contrived and determined machinations of some individuals, he has been deprived of his hereditary rights and has been helpless with even the judicial processes in Sri Lanka rendered seemingly impotent to safeguard his rights.
On an earlier occasion, the Supreme Court vacated an interim order issued restraining the Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya from appointing former kapurala Pathmasiri Adhikaram as the kapurala of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
The Supreme Court ordered the secretary of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya that necessary arrangements be made for Pathmasiri Adhikaram to function as a kapurala for one month each year in the devalaya.
A Contempt of Court application was filed thereafter in the Supreme Court against the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya for allegedly not complying with a Supreme Court order.
Adhikaram stated that his family has been holding the post of caretaker of the devalaya since 161 BC. He stated that king Dutugemunu before he launched his battle against king Elara made a vow to god Kataragama and having won the war, he built the devalaya and appointed his (Adhikaram's) great grand father as its caretaker to perform rituals. He claimed that his family held the post for over 2,300 years. The Supreme Court on April 4, 2004 declared that Pathmasiri Adhikaram of Boralesgamuwa had a right to function as a kapurala for one month each year in the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.

Lanka has potential to be a Colombo to India as much as Hong Kong to China
Sri Lanka has the potential to be a Colombo to India as much as Hong Kong to China, said Jagath Pathirane, new Chairman Sri Lanka Logistics & Freight Forwarders Association(SLFFA) addressing the 36th AGM in Colombo recently.
At the same time Sri Lanka as a nation has a lot of catching up to do while neighboring countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam are far ahead, he cautioned.
We are no doubt in a very volatile market situation. The challenges before us are so dynamic and complex.
We are no longer a small player in the international arena. To be more precise, we have the potential to be Colombo to India as much as Hong Kong to China, he said.
Pathirane said that it was very encouraging to note the initiative taken by the Ministry of Ports and Shipping recently to formulate a National Policy for the Shipping and Maritime Sector and expressed hope that there would be a mechanism to include aviation, road transportation and logistics sectors in to it.
We have a list of unclear challenges such as the need for a single window for ease of doing business on a well defined policy framework as a game changer for Sri Lanka, the need for policy and guidelines on emerging e-commerce and online consumerism on movement of goods purchased online, the need for acceptance of digital signature and promotion of a paperless concept and requirement of recognizing and establishing a Dry Port for all ocean freight inbound cargo, he said.
As the list goes on, all these are limited to dreams and fancy words, and we must endeavour to achieve these goals if we are to progress in our industry.

Lankan cricket in the doldrums as Zimbabwe wins series
HAMBANTOTA: Sri Lankas cricketing fortunes took a further dip when they slumped to another humiliating defeat at the hands of low ranked Zimbabwe who beat them by three wickets in the fifth and final One-Day International to win the five-match series 3-2 at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Sooriyawewa here yesterday.
It was Zimbabwes maiden series victory over Sri Lanka in the one-day format and it was achieved by a convincing performance by the visitors who outplayed the hosts in all departments.
Zimbabwe in fact did what Bangladesh failed to do  win a series against Sri Lanka in any format.
It seemed a day where nothing could go wrong for Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer when he won his teams first toss of the series and having inserted Sri Lanka in first strangled them through his spinners to a moderate total of 203-8.
Then Zimbabwes openers Hamilton Masakadza (73 off 86 balls) and Solomon Mire (43 off 32 balls) made short work of that target by posting an impressive stand of 92 off 86 balls that set them on their way towards achieving their score. Sri Lanka fought back to capture four cheap wickets for 29 runs and reduce Zimbabwe to 175-7, but man of the day and the Hero of the Match Sikander Raza followed his magnificent spell of off-spin bowling (3/21) with a run-a-ball innings of 27 not out that included two sixes, one of which was the winning hit.
With his captain Graeme Cremer (11 n.o.), Raza added 29 runs in 21 balls to see Zimbabwe home to a historic series win, only their fourth overseas.
They had previously won in New Zealand (2-1) in 2001 under the captaincy of Heath Streak, the present Zimbabwe head coach, in Bangladesh (3-0) in 2001 and in Kenya (5-0) in 2009. Sri Lankas top order was jolted by Raza who snapped up two of the three early wickets to fall to have them on the defensive.
Zimbabwe came to this match having done their homework very well. They changed their strategy for this crucial game by opening the bowling with a spinner instead of their fast bowlers against whom openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka had scored back to back double century partnerships in the previous two matches.
However yesterday it was a totally different ball game with Raza proving more than a handful with a first spell of 6 overs for figures of 2/11 on a surface that was used for the third ODI and now started to offer more bite and turn.
Sri Lanka suddenly found themselves in deep trouble as the spinners Raza, Cremer and Sean Williams reduced them to 153-8 with only Danushka Gunathilaka (52 off 86 balls) of the top order batters playing with any assurance.
Only a face saving record half-century stand for the ninth wicket between Asela Gunaratne who top scored with 59 not out off 81 balls and Dushmantha Chameera (18 n.o.) saw them reach a respectable 203-8.
However to defend such a small total Sri Lanka needed an exceptional performance from their bowlers and even though they came back strongly the runs they had put on the board was insufficient to defend on the pitch as Zimbabwe after a few hiccups cantered home with 71 balls to spare.
The defeat coming after their disappointing exit from the Champions trophy in England is a bitter pill to swallow and things are certainly not looking all that bright for Sri Lanka cricket at the moment. Incidentally yesterdays match happened to be the 300th ODI played in Sri Lanka. Hamilton Masakadza was named Man of the Series. - ST

Lankan fisheries bill a black legislation: DMK
Expressing apprehension over the Sri Lankan Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill finishing off the livelihood of Tamil Nadu fishermen, besides affecting the Indian fish export policy, Indias DMK on Sunday urged the Centre to take up the matter with Sri Lanka.
Describing the bill as a black legislation, DMK working president M.K. Stalin said the legislation is being brought with the intention of finishing off the vocation of Tamil Nadu fishermen. It will not only affect this state, but also impede Indias fish export policies, he claimed in a statement here.
The legislation, he said, came at a time when talks between fishermen representatives of both India and Sri Lanka had progressed well on resolving the dispute (over traditional fishing rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen in the Palk Bay).
It is a matter of concern that Sri Lanka has come up with such a black legislation with an aim to undermine the intention of the talks, he said. Though Sri Lanka called India a friendly country, it was coming up with such efforts, and wondered whether the latest move suited the friendly country tag. Stalin urged the Centre to exert pressure on Colombo at a consular or Prime Ministers level on the matter. For its part, the state government should take necessary steps.
M. K. Stalin opposed any move to privatise the profit-making Kamarajar Port at Ennore here.
In a letter to Union Road Transport, Indian Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari, on Sunday, Stalin argued that no prudent administrator would allow an economically viable and highly profitable port to be privatised, jeopardising the interests of all stakeholders.
As could be seen from the Annual Reports published under the authority of the Union of India, this port is a profit-making institution and it can never be allowed to be trusted in the basket of ports to be privatised, he said and added that the PSU has been playing a crucial role as an effective and efficient engine of industrial and economic development of the country.
He recalled that the 3,000 acres of land were allotted for the port, which was dedicated to the nation by then Indian PM A.B. Vajpayee and M. Karunanidhi, who was Chief Minister, in 2001. Kamarajar Ports profit was over `480 crores in 2016-17.
I, therefore, appeal to you to kindly use your good offices and take all steps to desist from divesting the hundred percent shares of the Government of India in Kamarajar Port and stop the move to privatise it, he urged.

Lewis ton carries Windies to thumping win
Kingston,Sunday:Evin Lewis blazed his second hundred against India to lead the West Indies to a rampaging nine-wicket victory in the one-off T20 international at Sabina Park on Sunday.
Replying to the tourists challenging total of 190 for six, Lewis stole the spotlight from returning local hero Chris Gayle with a blistering unbeaten 125 in taking the home side to 194 for one with nine balls to spare.
It was the first T20 international hundred scored by a West Indian in the Caribbean, and puts the left-handed opener alongside Gayle and New Zealands Brendon McCullum as the only players to have scored more than one century in the international format of the game.
Lewis innings was highlighted by 12 towering sixes and six fours off only 62 deliveries.
This memorable knock came 11 months after he compiled an even 100 against the same opponents in Fort Lauderdale, where the West Indies sneaked a one-run win a high-scoring encounter.
He completely dominated an 82-run opening stand with Gayle, who fell to debutant Kuldeep Yadav for 18 in the ninth over.
Marlon Samuels then supported Lewis explosive innings with an assured unbeaten 36 off 29 deliveries as their unbroken second-wicket stand of 112 saw the West Indies home in the 19th over.
Lewis fittingly ended the contest with another swing for six off spinner Ravindra Jadeja to achieve the highest individual score in a T20 international chase.
It was at the back of my mind that I didnt get a score in the one-dayers but I just believe in backing myself and playing my style of game, said a delighted Lewis after receiving the man-of-the-match award.
This is a very good bowling team so any runs you get against them is really appreciated.
As well as the 25-year-old from Trinidad and Tobago played though, India did not help their cause by twice dropping him in the deep as he approached the half-century mark, Mohammad Shami and Dinesh Karthik the culprits in the field.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni also missed a stumping chance when Gayle was on one while Samuels benefited from a couple of narrow escapes in what was an untidy effort by India in the field. AFP

Magnitude 5.2 quake hits southern Japan, no tsunami warning

TOKYO: An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.2 hit the southern Japanese island of Kyushu on Tuesday (Jul 11), but no tsunami warning was issued and there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
The quake was centred just offshore from the city of Kagoshima, NHK public television said.
NHK there have been no reports of damage or irregularities to the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, located in the city of Satsumasendai in Kagoshima.
According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the quake's epicenter was 14km southwest of Tarumizu at a depth of 16.7km.
Japan is one of the world's most seismically active areas, accounting for about 20 per cent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.
On Mar 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami. Those events triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.

Mantras and mandalas on art
Padrig Morin was born in 1962 in the county of Penn ar Bed (Finistre) in Brittany (North-West France). He moved to Sri Lanka in 1986 to study Buddhism and Pali and subsequently settled in the Island.
Padrigs artistic journey
Padrig has received no formal art education. His first hand at art occurred in his mid-twenties while studying pre-Buddhist India. He started to draw the Hindu Gods in attempt to fix in his memory the gods symbols, vehicles, consorts and colors. He had his first solo exhibition at the Alliance Franaise in 1993 which was followed by 4 group exhibitions and four solo exhibitions. His last three solo exhibits took place at Barefoot.
Hindu gods, mantras and mandalas have been recurrent themes in Padrigs art. In his last exhibition in 2010, Padrig however explored symbolism mixing elements of Hinduism, Buddhism, Hebrew Kabbalah and Arabic calligraphy, a way to synthesize the various influences he was exposed to during his travels and studies.
Padrig feels that this brought him the maturity to finally express and explore his own Breton cultural identity as translated it in the present exhibition Celtic Soul.
Celtic world
Bretons belongs ethnically, linguistically and culturally to the Celtic world which today survives in Ireland, Scotland, the isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. Bretons are the descendants of Welsh and Cornish people who massively migrated to Armorica (present North West France) between the IV and IX centuries, they renamed their new land Brittany in memory of their native land Britain.
Padrig also signs his painting with the Breton version of his name Patrick. He explained that in 1962 the French law on names did not allow parents to give their children regional names especially when a French equivalent existed, so Patrick it was instead of Padrig. A new law allowing regional names was enacted in 1966.
Padrigs work is being exhibited at the Barefoot Gallery these days. Through this exhibition Padrig wants not only to share the aesthetic, freedom and magic that can be expressed through Celtic art but also a glimpse in the culture and identity of his Breton Nation.

Massive demand for Ron Kaufman live in SL
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing is urging corporates and marketers to take speedy action in availing themselves of the foremost global service expertise that will be available to Sri Lanka when Ron Kaufman conducts a couple of programmes on July 18 and 19.
With very limited seats available given the massive demand from the private sector for the CEO Breakfast Forum and the Knowledge Forum, missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to interact and engage with the worlds No 1 Service Guru would be a significant fall out for companies forging their way through to success in a service oriented culture.
Over 700 tickets have been sold for the Knowledge Forum and 200 for the CEO Forum making it vital that Sri Lanka takes advantage of Ron Kaufmans reputation and stature as a transformer and revolutionary in service excellence.
With SLIM always in the forefront in nurturing, developing and uplifting the marketing fraternity and thereby the business milieu overall by infusing the latest in best practices, learnings and innovations via practical perspectives, Vice President of SLIM Pradeep Edward reiterates that the demand for the Ron Kaufman events have been unprecedented. With this kind of demand, I believe we will see a palpable change in Sri Lankas service leadership culture and I urge those corporates who havent yet made up their minds, to do so immediately. This is an opportunity, which cannot be passed up as Ron has a proven track record of being the best in service culture. He brings with him a wealth of knowledge of the latest international services best practices highly relevant to the dynamic globalised economy that would give Sri Lanka the competitive edge in industry and business.
This has seen companies like EFL (Expolanka Freight) and Classic Travel confirm separate sessions with Ron Kaufman for which the Managing Director of both corporate entities, Saif Yusoof is grateful to SLIM for. We are looking forward to a cutting edge training session, with insights into new tricks of the trade. For us, the idea of a learning culture is deeply imbedded in everything that we do. In a way, thats what defines us, and our love for the fast paced and ever evolving world of supply chain, logistics and travel. We look to inspire and get inspired by the things that make an impact around us. In this regard, Kaufmans unparalleled knowledge on gaining sustainable competitive advantage through service, is certainly ought to be optimised.
Describing Ron Kaufman Live in Sri Lanka as a ground-breaking event that will surely be a life-changing experience for corporates and business professionals alike, Project Chairman Ranga Perera goes a step further and urges entrepreneurs, the public sector and even university academics to take advantage of the knowledge pool Kaufman brings to Sri Lanka.
Kaufmans expertise is so universally applicable that it shouldnt be confined to just the private sector, as I believe a service culture should be instilled in everyone. In any vocation or career we undertake, service remains key to success and sustainability. This therefore enables everyone to inculcate that service leadership culture for which Ron Kauffman has gained a worldwide reputation for.

MOSUL LIBERATION
BELGIUM: The European Union (EU) on Sunday hailed the defeat of the Islamic State group in Mosul as a decisive step in fighting terrorism but called on Iraqis to work together to improve their country.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi earlier announced that pro-government forces had retaken the second city from IS after a months-long battle that killed thousands of civilians and forced nearly a million people from their homes.
The recovery of Mosul from the hands of (IS) marks a decisive step in the campaign to eliminate terrorist control in parts of Iraq and to free its people, the EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and its aid commissioner Christos Stylianides said in a joint statement.
But they urged Iraqis to pick up the pieces of their country, parts of which were easily overran by IS three years ago.
It is now essential that a process of return and the re-establishment of trust between communities begins, and that all Iraqis are able to start building a shared future, they said.
IS still controls swathes of western Iraq including much of the desert Anbar province and rival forces, which largely cooperated against the jihadists in Mosul, are expected to compete for a share of the spoils.
Abadi himself has faced accusations of incompetence and corruption in his government, and followers of popular cleric Moqtada Sadr have staged large protests in Baghdad calling for electoral reform. - AFP

Mosul: US commander says Iraq must stop Islamic State 2.0
(Senior US commander)
The senior US commander in Iraq has warned that the war against the so-called Islamic State (IS) is not over, despite a "historic" victory in Mosul.
Lt Gen Stephen Townsend told the BBC there were still IS fighters in Iraq.
He said the government should now reach out to Iraq's Sunnis to stop the jihadist group from renewing itself.
"If we're to keep... ISIS 2.0 from emerging, the Iraqi government is going to have to do something pretty significantly different," he said.
"They're going to have to reach out and reconcile with the Sunni population, and make them feel like their government in Baghdad represents them."
Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi hasformally declared victory over IS in Mosul, after a nearly nine-month battle that left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced more than 920,000 others.
Abadi waved a national flag with troops after announcing the "collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood".
In a report on Tuesday, Amnesty International said Iraqi and coalition forces had used unnecessarily powerful weapons in densely-populated areas.
IS fighters were also accused by Amnesty of committing serious abuses.
Commanders from the US-led coalition that has provided air and ground support to Iraqi forces said the urban combat had been most intense since World War Two.
Abadi made the declaration of victory at the operations room of the Counter-Terrorism Service, whose elite forces were the first to enter Mosul in November.
Using a pejorative term for IS based on an Arabic acronym of its former name, he said: "I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism, which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul."
US President Donald Trump sent his congratulations to his Iraqi counterpart, saying Mosul had been "liberated from its long nightmare under the rule of ISIS".
"We mourn the thousands of Iraqis brutally killed by ISIS and the millions of Iraqis who suffered," the president said in a statement, promising to seek the "total destruction" of the jihadists.
The US-led coalition confirmed that while areas of the Old City still had to be cleared of explosive devices and possible IS fighters in hiding, the Iraqi security forces had Mosul "firmly under their control".
Abadi had to delay declaring the "liberation" of Mosul on Sunday because a pocket of resistance remained in the Old City, on the western bank of the River Tigris, that was only about 180m (200 yards) long and 45m wide.
Iraqi army officers believed only a few dozen militants were left inside along with their wives and children, who they said were being used as human shields.
Gunfire and explosions were heard coming from the area earlier on Monday.
Mosul has been devastated by the battle, with the UNestimatingthat more than 5,000 buildings have been damaged and 490 destroyed in the Old City alone.
"It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not," said the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, Lise Grande.
"Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable."
IS militants overran Mosul in June 2014, before seizing control of large parts of northern and western Iraq. The following month, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his first and only public appearance as IS leader at the city's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, and gave a speech proclaiming the creation of a "caliphate".
IS blew up the mosque almost exactly three years later as Iraqi troops prepared to retake it - a move Iraq's prime minister called a "formal declaration of defeat".
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Mosul says the jihadists may have lost militarily in the city, but this is not their end in Iraq nor the end of their twisted ideology.
IS still controls territory in three areas of Iraq - around Hawija, 130km (80 miles) south-east of Mosul, around Tal Afar, 65km west, and from Ana to Al-Qaim in the Euphrates river valley, 250km to the south-west.
It also holds a string of towns along the Euphrates in Syria, including Albu Kamal and Mayadin, but its stronghold of Raqqa is besieged by US-backed fighters.

Musical experiments!
Affable and Flexible are two words to describe Sohan Weerasinghe of Sohan & the X-Periments. The band is a huge success due to the values Sohan has instilled in them. In that sense the band is an experiment in itself and the experiment is a success! Daily News speaks to Sohan Weerasinghe, one of the great entertainers of this day and age.
When I was a law student in the early 70s there was a group called the X-Periments already performing in Sri Lanka. All the members of the group migrated to Australia. I met the manager of the group. I asked him  Would you mind if I take over the band and call it Sohan and the X-periments He said I am very happy if you could do that because I want the name to go on!
Sohan Weerasinghe. Picture by Thushara Fernando
At that time I was singing with Gabo and The Breakaways and Moonstones at the same time, having just entered the music field. So I moved away from them and formed my own band called Sohan and the X-Periments. Or course the name was already established in Sri Lanka, said Weerasinghe.
Just like any other band throughout the years you dont have the same line up. Band members come and go just like in any other field.
But I kept the identity of the band right throughout. We dont have regular signed contracts. So if a member wants to migrate or do something on his own, follow his own path they always have the freedom to move out and do their own thing. Just like any band in the world.
Even I moved out of Gabo and the Breakaways and formed the X-Periments. See, I wanted to do my own thing. I learnt a lot working with Gabo and the Breakways and Moonstones. When you perform for somebody else you dont have the freedom to do what you like. I wanted to fashion a band according to my expectations. That is why I moved out and did my own thing, stated Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe wanted to fashion a band the way he wanted and play at the gigs at the prices he wanted.
At that time the Moonstones was led by Annesley Malawana. They wanted a Western Vocalist to do the Western Song because they were an Oriental group. They wanted a guy to do the Western Songs in the band. So I was singing with them while performing with Gabo and the Breakaways. My main band was the Breakaways but when I had time, when I was free I sang with the Moonstones. There comes a time when you feel that you are the master of your own destiny so I formed my own band Sohan and the X-Periments. I wanted to select my own band members and do it my way, explained Weerasinghe.
When the band first began, he wanted the band to get experience by going abroad.
We had never performed abroad till 1980, when we went to the Middle East to perform at the Intercontinental in Oman in Muscat. We went there for four months. They were so pleased with our performance they gave us another one years extension. Finally till 1985 we played at Muscat in the Intercontinental in Oman. It was a long standing contract. And as a band financially we were very stable. So our band members were able to build their own houses and we were able to do many thing because of this contract in the Middle East, added Weerasinghe Also thanks to Sri Lanka Airlines, the band started visiting many other countries.
We ended up going to Australia, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and all over Europe, London, USA and Canada. We performed mainly to Sri Lankan audiences who like bands to come and play Sri Lankan music there. Our song repertoire was Western as well as Oriental. We could play to any sort of audience. So it all worked out really well.
In Oman Intercontinental we were the hotels resident band. We lived at the Hotel for five years. That is where we learnt so much about different types of music. We had a Jazz night, we had a Country and Western night, we had a Disco Night, a normal dance night and we played for Barbecues on the lawn  Italian Barbecue and German Barbecue. So we learnt a little bit of French and Italian Songs and German Songs. Our repertoire widened. Country and Western night  we learnt a lot of country songs. As a result the band became very experienced after going to the Middle East. That was the start of our success.
Once in eight months the hotel gave us a month off. So we used to come twice a year. Once we came for Ramazan, because at that time there is no music in the Middle East. Then again after three or four months they gave us three and a half weeks off fully paid. So twice a year the band came to Sri Lanka. They were all married at the time and had families, pointed out Weerasinghe It was a five start hotel so they were not only playing for Sri Lankan audiences.
All the oil company executives were living there. So we learnt a lot of American/ Western songs. I developed myself as an entertainer really in Oman. Not just singing alone but the interaction you had with the crowd. So I learnt all of that by going to the Middle East. The pay was excellent, said Weerasinghe
There is of course healthy competition with other bands.
Sometimes bands undercut each other but that is there in every field. But the main thing is to be courageous and different and build your band name. So every gig I treat as an audition. To me customer satisfaction is important. I make sure I do what the client wants. If they are happy then we get repeat performances.
If you have too much of attitude, dont do anything extra and you are not flexible people, will not like to work with you in the long run. People like to work with others who are easy going, go the extra mile and who are flexible. If we are booked for a show, I always tell the band it is alright if we perform a little longer. If it is half an hour more I never make a fuss. Of course if it is unreasonable and they want us to play for a longer duration then I charge a little more. It helps if the client recognizes me as flexible guy. It is good for a band leader to have good PR.
It is also important for a band leader to read the crowd and play what they, the crowd wants. I have to make sure we are pleasing the people who have booked us and satisfy the audience, explained Weerasinghe.
The band does not stick to any one type of music. They play a little bit of everything.
For you to survive you should not stereotype. You have to be able to have a wide repertoire. You have to widen your scope. That is one way of becoming successful. We can even satisfy a young audience. Especially at weddings they may want modern day hits. We can play songs from todays charts. If they want Fireball we can do it. Initially it was Elvis who had an impact upon my music. I liked the music of Engelbert and Tom Jones. My band members like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. Then there are the Bee Gees and the Beatles. When we perform we do a little bit of all that. Then there is Backstreet boys and Justin Timberlake. But we admire them! oh yes very much! But at certain weddings we do totally oriental! They tell us that they only want Sinhala! We give them a song list and they select what they want. A success of a good leader is to lead the crowd. I keep on doing that. I have to be careful because at Weddings I cannot play Guns N Roses, summed up Weerasinghe.
Currently the band members of X-Periments at the present are  Trishelle Wijetunga (Female Vocals), Neville Davidson (Lead Guitar/Vocals), Shobi Perera (Bass Guitar/ Vocals), Nuwan Galappaththi (Keyboard/Vocals), Thilak Samarakone (Drums/Vocals), Nishantha Siriwardena (Ethnic Percussion) and Sohan Weerasinghe (Lead Vocals)

NCE leads delegation of exporters to Northern and Eastern Provinces
The National Chamber of Exporters(NCE) led a business delegation to the Northern and Eastern Provinces (Vauniya, Kilinochchi, Jaffna and Trincomalee) from June 21-23. The Chamber carried out this visit in collaboration with the Regional Chambers in the relevant districts, the Via Village Entrepreneurs Centre in Vauniya and the Local Empowerment through Economic Development (LEED) Project of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
The main objectives of the event were to link NCE member exporters with growers and producers in the North (Vavuniya and Kilinochchi Districts) and to promote the NCE Annual Export Awards among the Regional Chambers (Jaffna and Trincomalee). The NCE also wished to encourage regional SMEs to showcase their achievements among prospective buyers.
The President, Secretary General and Assistance Secretary together with few NCE Staff were part of this delegation.
The delegation consisted of 11 exporters representing eight export companies. Their export requirements comprised organic products, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, palmyrah products and processed foods.
Srimathi Narandeniya, Deputy Director of the Agriculture Division, Sri Lankan Export Development Board (EDB) also joined the delegation. She made a presentation on export procedures to fruit and vegetable producers in the Kilinochchi area.
Her presentation was translated to Tamil by the Chamber to gap the language barrier. It was highly appreciated by the participants, as they were able to clarify issues related to export procedures.
The Via Village Entrepreneurs Centre in Vauniya is a US certified non-profit organization funded by Canadian citizens consisting of farmers and producers in the Vavuniya district. The objective of this organization is to ensure the local empowerment of farmers in the Santhipuram area.
S. Thevathas, Business Consultant of the Centre, made a presentation introducing the Via Village Entrepreneurs Centre, the nature of its operations, and the support expected from the exporters. The interactions among participants were beneficial to clarify issues brought up by exporters and producers.
The NCE together with the ILO LEED Project team also conducted an awareness programme for producers in the North which was held at the Friends Inn Hotel, Kilinochchi, at which more than 40 producers were present.
Nihal Devagiri, Head of the ILO LEED Project, Vasu and Viknesh represented the ILO LEEDs project team. The programme which was conducted in both English and Tamil, also comprised short field visits arranged by the ILO team for the delegates.
Thereafter the exporters and producers discussed the benefits as well as the improvements which are needed by both parties to build successful business linkages. These discussions were led by the ILO officials.
Under a separate component of the programme, the NCE officials visited the Jaffna and Trincomalee District Chambers of Commerce and Industries, for the purpose of promoting participation of their member enterprises as applicants at the NCE Annual Exports Awards, especially the SMEs, to enable them to showcase their successes to attract prospective buyers.
It is noteworthy that the Chamber proposes to present special awards this year to regional enterprises. At the discussions conducted with the Yalpanam Chamber of Commerce and Industries in Jaffna, organized by the Chairman of the Chamber Jerusan, four exporters and potential exporters companies participated.
In addition to explaining the structure and application procedure for regional entities, knowledge of export procedures was also provided.
At the meeting with the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Trincomalee organized by the Chairman of the Chamber Kuladeepan, 11 export as well as potential export companies participated.
They too were provided the same knowledge as in the case of the Yalpanam Chamber. The programme was concluded with field visits by the delegates to papaya and passion fruit cultivations in the Kilinochchi area, to the packing house established by CR Exports in Kilinochchi which is a well-established exporter of fruits and vegetables, and finally a visit to a herbal tea producer and exporter in the same area with a view to establish business partnerships, if the samples provided were acceptable by the prospective buyers.
The Chamber appreciates the contribution made by the EDB by joining the delegation, since the work of the Chamber complements the services provided by the EDB to develop and promote exports to achieve national objectives. This relates not only to the efforts of the EDB to link producers to established exporters, but will also enable the development of new exporters, under the programme to increase the number of registered exporters by at least 2000, to enhance overall exports from Sri Lanka.

Paint your palette
Keyt I think is the living nucleus of a great painter. In all his works, there is the moderation of maturity.  [His] figures take on a strange expressive grandeur, and radiate an aura of intensely profound feeling.
- Pablo Neruda
He was born at the turn of a bygone century, 1901. Despite his Indo-Dutch origins, George Keyt did not influence the painting of this country. He framed the industry. He was an instrumental figure behind the picturesque revolution of this countrys Buddhist and Hindu iconography. The circumambulatory shrine room of the Gautami Vihara, Borella, built in the 1940s, stands regally even to this day as a symbol of the Keyt legacy.
That legacy was not to die down. A Foundation was established in memory of the art supremo. The George Keyt Foundation has shouldered several exhibitions to boost the morale of the upcoming local painters. The exhibition will be at the JDA Perera Gallery 1 and 2, University of Visual Arts and Performing Arts from today to July 16. Titled as Nawa Kalakaruwo, the exhibition offers space to emerging young artists.
The Daily News meets Michael Anthonisz, who succeeded Cedric de Silva as George Keyt Foundation Chairperson.
We began this exhibition as Young Contemporaries. Following a break for some time, we revitalised the concept with Kala Pola exhibition. This is the ideal platform especially for the first-time artists, Anthonisz explains.
The exhibition seems to stave off the financial hunger which most artists are now experiencing. Although most artists with degrees pertaining to the subject would apparently opt away from the painting itself to other lucrative careers. Everybody knows why: there is hardly any market or promotion for art.
But that phenomenon is going to be well and truly over thanks to the George Keyt Foundation involvement. Sri Lankas art is 90 percent worth today, says Anthonisz, because the artists have various platforms to showcase their talents. Without a proper promotion, the artists will struggle to find feet. Artists are now on the rise. Sri Lanka too should have a huge market for arts like in India.
In parallel with the artists, the connoisseurs also keep on growing.
But the path before the young artists is not smooth. Many stumbling blocks stand in their way before they manage to reach the destination.
It is not easy to book a hall. They are expensive. Then the artists need a sponsor. Thats why the Goerge Keyt Foundation enters the scene. Now there are other sponsors such as Barefoot and Saskia Gallery who sponsor artists. They are the offshoot of the Keyt Foundation.
The exhibition offers the young artists a chance to come out of their shells and showcase the work. And to be recognised, which is the most important. As the Foundation has been engaged in this project for years, the industry has now produced a clan of senior artists too.
The exposure matters. Because this is a group work, the artists have an opportunity to meet each other. Being at the JDA Perera Gallery, the university students will have an opportunity to meet the non-university artists as well as vice versa.
The George Keyt Foundation, on the other hand, is privileged with a good audience response. As the exhibition lasts a week, over which artists will find ample time and room for networking.
Nawa Kalakaruwo is an extension of Kala Pola organised by the same Foundation. Kala Pola artists also take part in this weeks exhibition.
The base of Sri Lankan art is no longer what it used to be. Only a few artists have earned repute. They manage to go and show around thanks to their repute. The Keyt Foundations attempt is to expand the artistic repute at home as well as abroad.
New artists should come to the fore following the footsteps of George Keyt, Lionel Wendt and other artists of repute. Lionel Wendt was another influential figure in the art industry following his study in England. He followed the western art but syringed them with a Sri Lankan flavour. Wendt, like Keyt, is among the few Sri Lankan who still enjoy the global repute.
The Nawa Kalakaruwo is symbolic of a portrait of George Keyt as a young man (may James Joyce forgive us) coordinated by the Foundation named after the iconic artist of this country.
George Keyt didnt start painting until he was 26, but he quickly went on to become an international giant of Modern art and arguably Sri Lankas most celebrated 20th Century artist. His unique visual idiom combines European Modernist innovations with the ancient South Asian fresco techniques found at Ajanta and Sigiriya. Desipite his clear admiration for cubist and fauvist principles, his subject matter was almost always rooted in local tradition, depicting dancers, shepherdesses and gods, often drawn from Hindu and Buddhist mythology.
His subjects enlarged, almond-shaped eyes are, perhaps, his most consistent stylistic signature, along with an emphasis on bold, crisp lines and a prolonged romance with cubist perspective (his work has been exhibited alongside Picasso and Braque in galleries around the world). His earliest work was distinctly Gauginesquesumptuous pastorals and figure studies free from overt perspectival abstraction, populated by luxuriant nudes and semi-nudes swaddled in robes, limbs graceful and provocatively intertwined. By the early 1930s, the cubism that would forever alter the character of his paintings began to emerge in his work.
Still, Keyt perpetually re-invented his craft, adopting and discarding countless subtle variations in style across seven decades. His famous black-and-white line drawings depicting Sri Krishna and his lover have been reprinted millions of times since he made them in 1947. Keyt was Sinhalese-Dutch by birth and lived in his native Sri Lanka almost his entire life. He wrote poetry in English and converted to Buddhism as a young man. In 1978, he lived in London for six weeks where, according to his obituary in The Independent, he visited many museums and art galleries, went to Stratford-upon-Avon to see Shakespeare, called at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and made a pilgrimage to Gadds Hill to see Charles Dickenss house. He married three times and died in Colombo at the age of 92.

Passion fruits usher economic prosperity in dry zones
Commercial cultivation of passion fruits in dry rural villages around Sri Lankas North-Central Province of Anuradhapura is fast turning into an economic game changer transforming livelihoods of hundreds of poor families in overcoming poverty.
According to farmers engaged in cultivation of passion fruits, the crops once harvested delivers a steady yield on a weekly basis, after an initial growth period of six months and is therefore deemed a highly reliable source of income.
On the other hand, due to the lucrative nature of the investment, it has made a sustainable impact on livelihoods especially amongst the less privileged persons who choose to make productive use of idle land.
At Ipalogama, a remote town 44 kilometres away from Anuradhapura, the man behind popularizing the cultivation of the commercial crop is E.M.J. Ekanayake, the Enterprise Development Officer of Berendina Microfinance Institute (Gte) Ltd (BMI), a leading poverty-alleviation agency in the microfinance sector.
The gentleman has been credited for training and nurturing over 150 laypersons to become agro-entrepreneurs in the field of passion fruit cultivation.
In 2012, during the time I was attached to Berendinas Thirapone branch, I came to know that about two to three persons in the area who engaged in cultivation of passion fruits earlier on, had abandoned cultivation due to a lack of professional guidance and technical expertise.
Therefore, our institution mooted a linkage with a private organization named Laymens Den to conduct training programmes recognizing the lucrative nature of investment, Ekanayake says.
He added that initially, although around 60 people participated at the training session, only about 20 people recognized its viability and ventured into the programme.
Following the success of the peers, more and more people joined and today the number of passion fruit farmers have increased to about 154, the official from Berendina said.
Training is key
In 2013, I was introduced to the programme by officials from Berendinas Ipalogama branch who enrolled me into a training session on passion fruit cultivation conducted by a private company.
Since I had no prior technical knowledge on cultivation, these training sessions were the cornerstone of my entrepreneurial success today, says 48-year-old H.M.P.B. Randeniya, a farmer who lives in a remote village in Yakkallegama, off Eppawela with his wife and two children.
Randeniya notes that Berendina, through its linkage created with few private companies, had provided him around 100 saplings for plantation at the conclusion of the training programme.
This proved to be a major turning point in my life as the crops bore bountiful results for my efforts. Thanks to this venture, today I have been able to purchase household goods and educate my children without much hassle, says Randeniya.
However, he underscores that the success or failure of a venture will be determined by how well one is able to implement the acquired training and skills to the letter through sheer hard work and determination.
The key to success here is to perfectly put into practice the knowledge acquired from the training programme, he says.
Income
On the economic front, Randeniya states that prior to venturing into passion cultivation, he had earned a meagre income of Rs. 8,000 a month by utilizing his available land for banana cultivation although today he is able to generate an additional income of Rs. 41,000 a month through passion cultivation.
In 2015, I obtained a microfinance loan of Rs. 75,000 from BMI to cultivate passion fruits and this loan helped me to successfully cover the cost of planting and maintaining over 200 passion vines, he says.
Through the income earned from passion fruit harvests, Randeniya elucidates that today he has been able to build his house while also leasing out a new plot of land to cultivate passion fruits.
Advantages
On the other hand, Samadi Hettiarachchi  a resident of Kadiyangalla says that one of the key advantages of passion fruit cultivation is that it involves very little hard labour and thus could be easily managed even by women during the daytime while the men are out at other work. Utilizing the income from passion fruits, Samadi had recently opened a new poultry and farm shop and is also now pursuing an external degree.
Passion fruit is also a non-traditional crop for our villagers who have been generally used to cultivate dry-zone crops like cowpea, mung bean and vegetables, etc. Due to its unconventional nature there is a heavy demand for both local consumption and exports and hence the fruit fetches a premium price, Samadi says, highlighting the crops main competitive advantage.
She further notes that as passion fruit farming allows intercropping, crop diversification can be easily achieved depending on the seasonal nature of demand for other crops.
Challenges
The cultivation is however, is not without its own challenges. Dakshina Disna, a married woman from Ipalogama is today a female entrepreneur having acquired the business acumen from scratch. She has planted about 200 passion vines with a half an acreage of land and through the income she generated, has also recently diversified into plantation of anthurium plants.
However, she argues that the need for manual pollination, pruning, frequent irrigation and marketing of the harvest are few of the challenges she is acquainted with.
Flowers start to bloom when the sun is at its peak daily between 12 noon and 2 pm. This is when pollination has to be done manually which can be tiresome if you are not fit enough. Pruning is also an essential practice whereby you need to remove old and excess branches to increase the flower and fruit production, she said.
She further notes that although generally the vines need to be irrigated at least once in 10 days, this becomes a challenge during a period of drought as this has to be done more frequently.
Watering the plants can become a daunting task with the inadequate level of water resources in the area. If the vines are not watered adequately, it can directly impact the volume of harvest or income earned, Disna, who obtained a water connection through a loan from Berendina, pointed out.
However, she explains that one could easily overcome the challenge if there is an efficient rainwater harvesting system deployed.
She also highlighted that although access to better technology like high pressure water pumps and sprinklers could ease off some workload, it may however not be affordable in the long run with the water bills taking a pinch on their incomes.
Pests and diseases
Meanwhile, Thilanji Siriwardena, another housewife who owns an acreage of passion plantation, says the main advantage of planting the crop is because the vines due to their non-acidic nature, tend to have little to zero pests and are therefore less prone to diseases. Hence, she reckons, it is the key reason for its wide popularity and success in the region.
On the other hand, Thilanji underscores that marketing of the harvest could be a burden since in some cases, buyers paid a lower price when they are asked to be collected as opposed to fruits which are delivered at their marketplace.
These days, although the market price at the Dambulla Economic Centre is well over Rs.120 a kilogramme, there are private collectors around the area who would only pay a lower rate of Rs. 80 a kilogram in comparison, she says.
She however said that the rate is reasonable given that she does not have to bear costs involved with transportation (including cost of unforeseen damages).
Moreover, Thilanji notes that even in the case of the Dambulla market, there are also those picky traders who insist on the grading of fruits and are engaged in the practice of picking and choosing fruits they purchased.
With the collectors here, we however do not come across such issues, said Thilanji, who had purchased a motorcycle through the income earned from passion fruits.

Phobia 2 to have a male lead
Phobia', starring Radhika Apte, received rave reviews for its intriguing plot and the makers have now decided to come up with the sequel to the film with a male lead.
Directed by Pawan Kripalani, the psychological thriller released last year.
"I am doing 'Phobia 2', but this time it's with a male lead. The script demanded a male lead. The film was critically acclaimed and it made to the list of top ten films of 2016.
So, we want to get someone who can pull off that kind of performance," Viki Rajani of production house Next Gen Films Pvt Ltd told PTI.
Viki further added that the sequel will have a known actor as the scale of the film is bigger this time. Talking about the genre, Viki says, "There was no bloodshed or the paranormal angle in 'Phobia' but it was the treatment and execution because of which people liked the film. It is not a horror film... It plays with your mind, and it will scare you. It's a new age concept for a thriller."
In "Phobia", the story revolved around protagonist Mehak (Radhika), an artist, who suffers from Agoraphobia (an extreme or irrational fear of open or public places). In 'Phobia 2', the makers plan to touch upon the fear of flying. "There will supporting actors as it's on a flight and about phobia of flying," Viki said.
The makers have locked the script of the second installment and it will go on floors soon. PTI

Plans to invest in low cost domestic airline : LAUGFS to acquire 17 LPG vessels by 2020
LAUGFS will invest a colossal amount in the LPG and Maritime sector and will acquire 17 vessels by 2020, said LAUGFS Chairman. W. K. Wegapitiya.
This would take their fleet up to 20 and make the company one of the biggest private sector maritime companies in Asia.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the celebrations of the first anniversary of its second hotel, Anantaya Passikudah he said that they will either buy these vessels on an outright basis or on wet lease. This will strengthen the companys LPG logistics capability to cater to regional demands as well as their own LPG operations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
LAUGFS acquired its third LPG vessel  Gas Courage, in January this year.
Commenting on their LPG gas operations in Sri Lanka he said that a price revision was long overdue parallel to the escalating global prices. Both of us (LAUGFS and Litro Gas) are losing due to this, he lamented.
Wegapitiya said that in 2015, LAUGFS became one of the largest LPG downstream players in Bangladesh and would now invest on a LPG gas cylinder manufacturing plant there. We will export these canisters to Africa as well, he assured.
Bangladesh is a fast developing country and with LAUGFS there are five players in Bangladesh and the LPG gas penetration was only 2% and there was huge opportunities there.
The LAUGFS LPG Import & Export Terminal in Hambantota will help position Sri Lanka as a service and supply hub in South Asia, by taking advantage of its strategic geographic location in the Indian Ocean.
It is constructed with a total investment of USD 80 million, with a total capacity of 45,000 MT, of which Phase 1 will be of 30,000 MT.  Construction is well on track and we plan to commission the new Terminal in the second half on 2018, he said
He also said that they will also invest on a domestic airline mainly to service their Anantaya hotel in Passikudah from Colombo and also to cater to other hotels in the region. We are looking at two fixed wind aircraft of around 20 seats each to operate from Ratmalana and Colombo, Wegapitiya added.
He said that they want to also have stop overs in some of the other domestic airports like, Palali, Trincomalee, Koggala to make the operation more viable. We will also include Mattala International airport to our radar. He emphasized that they will definitely offer the lowest airfare which would be around USS 50 per passenger and operate schedule flights. He said that this would be an easier and lower cost operation than purchasing ships.
Our second step would be to go regional starting from the Colombo Maldives flights.

## Supertitle:

PLASTICS POSE GREATER THREAT TO OCEANS
Renowned American oceanographer Sylvia Earle has studied the sea extensively for more than 60 years, and logged more than 7,000 hours researching and filming marine life since her first dive at age 16.
Earle, who in the 1980s was the first woman chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, now faces a challenge greater than the round-the-world oceanographic cruise she took in 1964 or the 1970 experiment for which she, and her all-female crew, spent two weeks in an underwater capsule on a coral reef.
Earle is rallying the world to save the seas, which face the deadliest threats to their existence  as do the millions of world citizens whose survival depends on them.
From her bully pulpit, Earle warns that sea life is being destroyed from every direction, by a combination of overfishing, rising temperatures and plastic waste. She notes that since the 1950s, the world has lost 50% of its global coral reefs and 90% of its big fish.
Oceans are choking on plastic junk  millions of tonnes of water bottles, soda bottles, drinking straws and single use plastic bags. Worse still, what we see floating on the surface accounts for only 5% of all the plastic litter that has been dumped into the sea. According to Ocean Conservancy, a US environmental non-profit, the other 95% is beneath the surface, where it strangles underwater creatures and wrecks aquatic ecosystems.
Oceans are now clogged with plastics, especially discarded fishing gear and single-use plastics, Earle told Africa Renewal in an interview.
Today the world is producing 20 times more plastics than 40 years ago. This means that each year more than 8 million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans, wreaking havoc on marine wildlife, fisheries and tourism and marine ecosystems.
Only less than 14% of all plastic is recyclable, and it is high time someone came up with an innovation or technology to deal with the remaining 86%, which could create $80bn-$120 bn in revenues, according to a recent report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which works with business, government and academia to build an economy that is restorative.
MORE PLASTICS IN OCEANS THAN FISH
Sadly, plastic waste that finds its way into the ocean will remain there for hundreds of years because plastic does not rot. In fact, plastic is so durable that the United States Environmental Protection Agency says, Every bit of plastic ever made still exists. Once it gets in the seas, plastic waste leaches chemicals, many of them toxic, into the seas.
Up to 80% of all litter in our oceans is made of plastic. At the rate at which we are dumping items such as plastic bottles, bags, cups and straws after a single use, by 2050 we will have more plastics in the oceans than fish, warns the United Nations Environment, the UN agency mandated to protect the environment. Because of its low density, plastic litter is easily transported over long distances from source areas. The ocean undercurrents scatter it to every corner of the earth, some of it floating on the oceans and others sinking to the seabed.
According to the US-based Center for Biological Diversity, there are 1551 trillion pieces of plastic in the worlds oceans  from the equator to the poles, from Arctic ice sheets to the sea floor. Emerging research suggests that not one square mile of ocean surface anywhere on earth is free of plastic pollution.
Making matters worse, the cosmetics industry now adds tiny plastic beads called microbeads to hundreds of toiletries, such as body and facial scrubs and even toothpaste. These tiny particles easily go through water filtration and drainage systems to end up in the sea, where they are ingested by fish and seabirds. UN Environment warns that about 99% of all seabirds will have ingested plastic by 2050 if nothing is done to reverse the trend.
Africa has not been spared the plastic menace. Even though most of the plastic trash in Africa comes from outside the continent, African cities and coastal towns are grappling with their own mountains of garbage, mostly plastic that ends up in the ocean. Earle cited the islands in the northwest Indian Ocean as the most affected by plastic marine litter in Africa.
Plastics in the ocean kill or harm more than 300,000 marine animals every year, said Earle. Some creatures get entangled in the plastic debris, while others like seabirds, turtles, fish, oysters and mussels ingest the plastics, which end up clogging their digestive systems and causing death. Fish and birds mistake smaller plastic particles for food and feed on them in enormous quantities.
When the young birds eventually die, you can literally see small balls of plastics next to their skeletons after the body decomposes, Earle lamented.
Clean Seas campaign
The plastic menace has become so dire that in February the UN launched the Clean Seas campaign at the Economists World Ocean Summit in Bali, Indonesia.
This is a global effort to convince governments to pass plastic reduction policies, and industry to minimize plastic packaging and redesign its products. The UN is also urging consumers to change their plastic disposal habits before irreversible damage is done to the seas. It is past time that we tackle the plastic problem that blights our oceans. Plastic pollution is surfing onto beaches, settling onto the ocean floor, and rising through the food chain onto our dinner tables. Weve stood by too long as the problem has gotten worse.
It must stop, said Erik Solheim, the head of UN Environment, at the launch of Clean Seas campaign.
Throughout the year the campaign will be announcing ambitious measures taken by countries and businesses to ban or tax single-use bags, eliminate microplastics from personal care products and otherwise dramatically reduce the use of disposable plastic.

President only partly there
President Maithripala Sirisenas observation that a negative picture is being painted of the government by certain media have drawn a host of comments, most of them siding with the media, claiming that the government, in fact, had failed to show results vis a vis its promises made during the elections while also holding that, on the development front too, the Yahapalanaya government is found wanting.
The President, during an event in Ratnapura, claimed that if one were to observe the content in certain media one would come to the conclusion that no development was taking place in the country and that things were at a standstill. He opined that little or no material of a positive nature was been reported or aired and that this was clearly a ruse to shore up the ratings of these news channels.
Here, the President is only partially correct. While it is true that certain TV channels adopt various ruses to draw in the maximum viewers to its channels, given the cut-throat competition between media organisations, it is also true that some of these channels are specifically in existence to plug the line of the political opponents of the government, in this instance the Rajapaksas and the Joint Opposition. At least one TV channel has even given up the pretense of being impartial and blatantly, to use a popular term, now in vogue, goes shopping kade yanawa for the Rajapaksas and the JO. Its news coverage is heavily weighted towards highlighting the points of view of the JO and their more vociferous spokesmen and the views of government ministers or the development programmes are aired in casual terms, apparently in an attempt to maintain at least a semblance of balance.
There is also a morning programme aired by this channel devoted to newspaper headlines and the days top stories therein where the anchor gives out his own views and interpretations of the news items he reads out that shows the government in poor light while giving a leg up to the Joint Opposition spokesmen. This individual also takes it upon himself to readout the editorials in selected vernacular newspapers that are well known for their support to the Rajapaksas, the content of which are rabidly anti-government while leaving out other newspapers from the equation. This channel is now busy airing misleading news about the proposed new constitution, giving much prominence to the views expressed by sections of the Maha Sangha who are opposed to the whole exercise, with particular reference, by innuendo, to alleged harm that may visit the status accorded to Buddhism. This, while repeated guaranties have been given to the Maha Sangha by both the President and Prime Minister vis a vis the preeminent position accorded to Buddhism in the present constitution.
There is also another TV channel which is pathologically obsessed with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and is airing daily doses of news and opinions that are uncomplimentary of the Premier. The same channel, though, goes to great lengths to place another prominent UNPer on a pedestal by highlighting his public relations programmes and events on prime time news. It is this state of affairs, no doubt, that has drawn the attention of the President and has made him react the way he did.
Be that as it may, certain government politicians too are scoring own goals, giving these TV channels opportunities to tarnish the image of the government. The personal battles between certain ministers are being gleefully seized by these channels to portray disunity within the Yahapalanaya regime. The President should strive to put his own house in order and censure those ministers who are offering the Opposition ammunition with which to target the government. He should prevail upon them to fall in line in terms of collective Cabinet responsibility.
GMOA opening another flank
The GMOA appears to be spoiling for a fight again, this time over the appointment of the new President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council in the offing following the end of the tenure of Prof. Carlo Fonseka. GMOA spokesmen have threatened to strike if Prof. Fonseka is not retained in the post. We have been arguing in these spaces ad nausm and would like to reiterate the point. The GMOA should not involve itself in affairs that are beyond its remit. Appointments to government vacancies are a matter for the administration and the doctors have no business to interfere in such appointments. Prof. Carlo Fonseka, who, no doubt, is an iconic figure in the countrys academia is an octogenarian and though his mental faculties without question are still very much intact he certainly will not be in a sound physical state to steer the affairs of the SLMC, particularly at this juncture, when the SLMC is embroiled in many issues. Prof. Fonseka himself has suggested as much, speaking to the media opposite the Supreme Court complex the other day. It is hoped that the GMOA will not add an another issue to the ongoing SAITM imbroglio and steer clear of matters that does not concern it.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday sought a comprehensive plan for the long term conservation of Maha Viharaya premises in the Anuradhapura Sacred Area.
He said that he has already sought a long term plan from the Education Minister to carry out conservation activities.
I have directed the Education Minister to appoint a committee comprising the Central Cultural Fund, Archaeological Department and university academia specialised in archaeology for the formulation a long term plan,the Prime Minister said. He added that the government can allocate funds each year for excavation activities based on this plan. I have instructed the Education Minister to start discussions with Thailand and Myanmar authorities to have a Theravada Buddhist Triangle with the Sacred City of Anuradhapura,he said.
Wickremesinghe added that the Ministers should get actively involved in this process.
The Prime Minister was speaking after attending religious activities at the Sacred Ruwanweli Maha Seya premises on Saturday.
He added that the Maha Viharaya suffered more damage not at the hands of Cholas but heretics.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that Buddhists have failed in conserving their heritage though they are proudly talking of their religion.
He said that there are more Buddhists in the world than Jews but Jews have succeeded in protecting and preserving the Wailing Wall with is sacred to them.
Sikhs are lesser in numbers than Buddhists but they preserve their Golden Temple. The Muslims protect and preserve the Maouselum of Prophet Muhammad. What have we done to protect our Buddhist Centres,he queried.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that the government is on the verge of completing conservation work on a part of the Ruwanweli Seya Dagoba.
Premier Wickremesinghe added that he will make a new proposal that will make affairs of the Buddhist Nikayas free of any government interference once the interim report of the new Constitution is tabled before the Constitutional Council.
If not, the Prime Minister said, whenever a government that does not accept traditions should come into power, Buddhism may be in danger.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that he expects the Mahasanghas support in his endeavor to move the proposal for the protection of Buddhism.

Former Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Prof.Carlo Fonseka has asked that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) not strike on his behalf.
I was quite cut up about it, said Prof. Fonseka when contacted by the Daily News. He further explained that the GMOA had pointed out to him that there was a legal issue and that according to the Medical Ordinance, the chairman needed to serve a full term of five years when appointed, he said. Prof.Fonseka who completed his five year tenure at the beginning of this year, had sought a six month extension which was granted to him, I was not aware of this.
I of course worked on the assumption that my last day of office was June 30, 2017 and I am going to stick to that now, said the 84 year old Professor.
The GMOA, headed by its President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya and Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge had met the former chairman at his home in Nawala last morning and handed over a petition asking that he not leave his position as SLMC Chairman.Earlier they had warned that they would launch an indefinite strike if a new Chairman was appointed in Prof.Fonsekas place.
Prof.Fonseka in return had informed the GMOA that he was not in favour of a strike and asked that the doctors not put the lives of patients in danger as a result of him.
When asked whether Prof.Fonseka would accept an extension of his term if offered,he said, I will have to wait and see what happens. I have not made a decision regarding that,Dr.Aluthge said.

A rebels redemption : From rifle to reverend
Do not look back, your job is to look forward, that was the advice given to us by the movement, said Kanapathi Pulle Selvam, his voice heavy with sadness, yet determined to speak.
Selvam joined the LTTE at the age of 14, but today, he has taken on the role of a Christian priest and teaches the path of the holy bible to 600 families in the village of Illippedi Munmari.
Inside the Christian Family Church
As we investigated into the difficulties the people in the East faced due to the current dry spell in the region, we met Father Selvam, around 100 km from the road to Toppigala, past the Kiran Bridge, in the village of Thikiliwedi-Illippedi Munmari village.
The village is a tourist paradise, but to the people of Illippedi Munmari, their lives remain devoid of hope as little enterprise takes place and villagers point out that the lack of activity is due to the Kiran Bridgethe main access point to the villagenot being built properly.
The area suffers long periods of drought and when it rains, even a little can completely inundate the bridge, making it impossible for people to leave or enter the village.
The villagers explained that since the surrounding areas around the bridge was vacant, the extension of the bridge by a kilometre or so would solve the issue and make it easier for the people to travel.
Promises to improve the bridge, however, were plenty at the last election and since then, neither their area politicians; Ameer Ali, Yogeshwaran nor Sathasivam, have visited the place or fulfilled their promises.
Empty houses
As we embarked on a path towards the village of Toppigala, we saw houses the sizes of tents and the majority of them were unoccupied, and thus, we stopped in the shade of the tree in front of Father Selvams church.
Father Selvam welcomed us with open arms and sat down to relate to us the hardships of his people,
Sir, the people here struggle a great deal to make a living every day. Most depend on fishing, but even for that, they have to walk at least two to three kilometres to Eluwankulam, Korawelikulam, Theevelikulam or to the Upparu lagoon.
Father Kanapathi Pulle Selvam
This land does not yield any water and we have to walk at least two and a half kilometres every day to fetch drinking water from the Theevelikulam well, said Pastor Selvam.
The villagers of Ilippedi Munmari also engage in small-scale dairy farming apart from fishing, but this adds a greater burden on them as forage for the cows and goats they rear become scarce with dwindling water resources.
This explained why most of the villagers were not to be seen at home. As most basic necessities were located miles from home, many were out fetching their daily needs. Schools too, were located at least seven to eight kilometres from the village, which meant that the children spent most of their time walking.
The boy from Toppigala
Toppigala, located at the border of the Batticaloa and Ampara Districts, is situated 534 metres above sea level and the Toppigala mountain range encompasses the mountains of Toppigala, Lindagala, Hengala, Wessibendagala, Kalawagala, Kokgala, Walmandiyagala, Athagala, Narakamullagala and Hatharawakkulama.
This forms a land mass of 800 kilometres and extends to the border between the Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa districts, near the Madurioya National Park. Close to 125,000 people live scattered in this area.
Toppigala was the turning point in the humanitarian operation to liberate the people from the clutches of the LTTE on April 25, 2007. The battle for Toppigala, which commenced under the leadership of Major General Parakrama Pannipitiyage, was complete by July 12, 2007 and Toppigala which had been under LTTE control for over a decade was finally free and came under government control.
Pastor Selvam, who is facing many challenges today, began his story as a prisoner of a tragic history. The year was 1996, and I was just 14 then. I was living happily with my mother, father and four sisters when the battle between the LTTE and the government forces worsened.
At the time, there was a lot of pressure for every family to give up at least one member to the movement and I wanted to save my sisters. And though I was not in favour of it, I volunteered to join, he said.

Selvam was sent to the LTTE camp in Tharavikulam, received training in arms for three months and was stationed under Jayanthan who was known as Colonel Ram.
On the last day of our training, Colonel Ram made a stirring speech. He said, do not look back, your only task is to look forward. That speech motivated me immensely at the time, but today, when I look back, I am full of regret as we had to resort to arms to achieve a political want. As a result of that speech, countless people, property and the hopes of many people in our country, were destroyed. At the same time, all material and physical needs of our people were buried under a bullet, said Selvam.
His group left the LTTE camp in Tharavikulam and fought their way through countless kilometres until the final battlefield of the war in 2009, I have forgotten the miles we walked for battle. If I remember right, it was not only in the East, but on several occasions, we ended up walking to fight in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Pesale and Pudukudiruppu. But the end result was that every day we lost a member of our team. We did not feel the loss at the time, because for every member we lost, the movement was determined to recruit a new member, he continued.
Selvam recalled that they were able to score many a victory during the battles at the time.
The one which really stands out, is the attack we launched on a bus in Buttala. The incident is too painful to relate here, he said.
"As time passed, I was specially trained in multi-barrel attacks and thereafter, I was made the leader of a team of twelve. The East was under the control of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, alias Karuna Amman. It was under his second in command, Ramesh, that my superior, Colonel Ram, worked. Colonel Ram was humane as well as tough. He was constantly motivating us and I feel that if he had used his talents for good, our area would have developed greatly," he added.
While Selvam fought on the frontlines, his mother passed away, but he only found out about her death after the war ended and was released from the rehabilitation camp.
Rehabilitation
When I was at the Settikulam Rehabilitation Camp, the army provided us with various skills to help earn a livelihood. As the training went on, one day, we received visit from a Father called Selvanayagamfrom Wellawatte. Many of the detainees at the camp were depressed due to their past and the incidents in our past made us live a horrible present; every day was like a new death. After the war, all we inherited was either escape, to simple exist or to suffer the pain of death, said Selvam.
"As I awoke from the rubble of my past, I decided that if I was to do something for the betterment of the next generation, I could seek the assistance of religion and faith. In the end, I came to the decision to join the Father and become his disciple.
As a result, today I stand for the spiritual enrichment of the people here," Selvam added.
I would like to make a request from all. Do not simply accept whatever someone says. You need to think about what that person says and understand whether that person is speaking sense or not. Because the result of actions we take without much thinking causes great harm to our nation, he said.

Red Bull Local Hero Tour brings King of The Air to Sri Lanka
Visiting the North Western province of Sri Lanka this July, the Red Bull Local Hero Tour along with professional kitesurfer Ruben Lenten 'Len', the founder of the Red Bull Megaloop Challenge will embark on a week-long kite camp in Kalpitiya in pursuit of the best local kitesurfing talent.
Between July 13 to 17, Ruben will visit Kappalady Lagoon, Donkey's Point, Kalpitiya Lagoon, Puttalam Lagoon and end in Vela Island where he will coach 25 of Sri Lanka's most talented young kitesurfers with an end goal to inspire, educate, push and promote the kitesurfing scene in Sri Lanka. The week will end in a culmination of a free kite surf exhibition session where the local talent will get to showcase all they have learnt during the workshops from the week. The workshops will up level the local knowledge on several fronts such as kitesurfing, kiting gear, workouts, and the business of the sport, yoga and meditation, travelling and finally enjoying life.
Starting at the age of 12, this young Dutchman who grew up near the sea fell deeply in love with kitesurfing. Armed with a kite and a board, Ruben knew what he wanted, to ride hard and fly high.
Following his heart and guided by the wind Ruben uses all of his passion to realize his dream. From ranking at the top of the world's kiteboarding elite to flying off a 100 meter high cliff, Ruben now explores the world and the seven seas have become his playground. However, Ruben's story has not always been about extreme riding and impossible kite acrobatics. In August 2015, Ruben faced the biggest battle of his life: beating cancer. After a tough battle with cancer that kept him off the water for a little over a year, Ruben is now back at full strength and showing the world just what he loves to do.
Making it to the top of kitesurfing is anything but easy, and the help of a mentor is extremely valuable. These 25 Sri Lankan kitesurfers whom Ruben is about to take under his wing will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to learn from a kiting legend. Ruben had this to say about the upcoming project, I am very excited to be visiting Sri Lanka for the first time and to share kite and life experiences with the local kiting community and check out the local talent.

'Retrieval of Katchatheevu only solution to fishermen's issue'

The Tamil Nadu government today reasserted its position that the retrieval of Katchatheevu, an islet ceded to Sri Lanka in the 1970s, was the "only solution" to the vexed fishermen's issue.
Finance Minister D Jayakumar, who also holds the Fisheries portfolio, said retrieval of Katchatheevu was the "topmost agenda" of the state government.
"Retrieval of Katchatheevu back to India and restoration of the traditional fishing rights of Indian fishermen in the Palk Bay area are the topmost agenda of the government of Tamil Nadu," he told the state Assembly.
Recalling that former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa had in her personal capacity moved the Supreme Court for retrieval of the islet, he said the state government had later impleaded itself in the case.
He also referred to the Assembly passing a unanimous resolution "questioning" the legal validity of the two agreements of 1974 and 1976 by which the islet was ceded to the island nation.
Further, Jayalalithaa had taken up the matter in her meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added.
"Retrieval of Katchatheevu is the only solution for the fishermen's issue," he said.
"The government reiterates its consistent stand that a permanent solution to the vexatious problem faced by our fishermen will be possible only by restoring India's sovereignty over Katchatheevu, thereby restoring their rights to fish in their traditional waters," he added.
Meanwhile, DMK deputy leader Durai Murugan said that the then Indira Gandhi government had ceded the islet without the knowledge of DMK chief M Karunanidhi, who was Chief Minister then.
However, Karunanidhi had later taken up the matter with the Centre and also moved a resolution in the state Assembly reiterating that the islet belonged to India, he said.

Rice will be provided at concessionary rate  President
President Maithripala Sirisena says the Government will take steps to provide rice at a concessionary rate to the public by importing rice from other countries if the price of rice goes up further in the local market, as the paddy production decreased due to the recent droughts.
He was addressing a ceremony held in the Polonnaruwa district yesterday
The President recalled an article published in a national newspaper that the heads of the government cannot see the increased prices of rice. He said that as a leader who came from an ordinary family, and who knows the suffering of the people, he always acts according to these experiences and he is never ready to allow people in the country to starve.
There is a transformational change taking place in many fields in the country, including social, economic and political spheres under the present Government and the President said whatever challenges he has to face he will take forward this procedure with commitment.
President Sirisena vested the Janadhipathi Adarsha Primary School, built in Palugasdamana, Polonnaruwa with the students.
Performing to provide similar educational rights to the children in all areas in the country, including the North Central provinces, is one of the major plans of the current government, he said. The President stated that earlier the Janadhipathi schools were limited only to a few areas of the country.
The President opened the school by unveiling the plaque, undertook an observation tour of the school. He also launched the official website of the school.
President Sirisena presented a certificate to Student Vishmanie Manuththara, who demonstrated skills in the 2017 Provincial Drawing Competition.
North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, State Ministers Vasantha Senanayake, and Sampath Sri Nilantha, and Principal Priyanga de Silva participated.

Rohit returns for India Tests against Sri Lanka
New Delhi: Batsman Rohit Sharma has returned to India's Test squad for the three-match series in Sri Lanka that starts this month, the country's cricket board said Sunday.
Rohit, who was rested for the West Indies tour after an injury made him miss most of the Indian Test season, replaces Karun Nair in the 16-man squad. While Rohit injured himself during a one-day international, the 25-year-old Nair made his mark with a Test triple century against England at Chennai in December.
Nair failed to capitalise on that epic knock, managing just 54 runs in four innings after it. Rohit, who last played a Test against New Zealand in October, however scored heavily in the 50-over Champions Trophy.
The Indian selectors played safe by retaining most of the players from the previous series against Australia in March.
India, who announced a two-day warm-up match in Colombo on July 21-22, are scheduled to play the first Test in Galle starting July 26. The next two matches will be in Colombo and Kandy respectively.
The two sides will also play a five-match ODI series and a single Twenty international.
Squad:
Virat Kohli (Captain), Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice captain), Rohit Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Abhinav Mukund.

Singing her own tune
Rasangi de Mels solo singing performance will be held at the Piyasena Kodithuwakku Theatre, C W W Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya, Matugama on July14 at 5 pm. She will be backed by her brother Geeth de Mel and several other singers. A compact disc containing 14 of her songs will also be launched at the venue.
Although Rasangi has 38 years of experience of singing and teaching music she was not in the limelight. Her solo performance will include her own creations and popular songs. She will sing duets with her brother Geeth de Mel, who is a journalist and singer.
The lyricists include veterans such as Saman Chandranath Weerasinghe, Felix Silva, Dr Ajantha Ranasinghe, H M Prasanna Nandakumara, Delthota Chandrapala, Dharmasiri Gamage, Ariyasena Ahangama, Eng Jayasekara Bandara and Ananda S Wijesiri. Melodies are by Stanley M Fernando, Piyal Fernando, Navaratne Gamage, H M Jayawardena, Bandu S Kannangara and Mervyn Perera. The solo performance will be backed by Piyal Fernando and his band of musicians. The performance will be compared by the well-known Independent Television Networks announcer Indrasiri Suraweera.
Rasangi started her musical career at the Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). Thereafter, she honed her singing skills under Visharada Nanda Malini. She also became a member of the SLBC Lama Mandapaya. Rasangi is contemporary of Indeewari Ariyasinghe, Sakunthala Peiris, Sandya Bulathsinhala, Samitha Mudunkotuwa, Champa Kalhari and Supriya Abeysekara. She is an A Grade singer at the SLBC. She held her first solo performance titled Swarna Dehena at the auditorium of C W W Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya.
Rasangi was educated at Uyana Junior School and Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. Her first music teacher was Athavuda Arachchi. Later she was admitted to Ananda Girls School, Maradana for higher education. At that time, her music teacher Visharada Malini Bulathsinhala who spotted her latent talents invited her to join her Aradhana Svara Dehena musical programme.
Rasangi expanded her horizon under veteran musicians such as Premadasa Mudunkotuwa, Rohana Beddage, Sangeeth Nupun Sanath Nanadasiri, H D Jayasekara, Kolitha Bhanu Dissanayake, Ariyadasa Ranawaka, Sandya Kumari, Somadasa Peiris, Sudath Wickremesinghe and Thyyagaraja. Later she came under the influence of music teachers such as Mahinda Premaratne, Shantha Geethadeva, Nishad, Sandun Pathirane, Amitha Bandara and Ramani Pushpalatha at the Giragama Aesthetic Teacher Training College.
She remembers with gratitude the unstinted support extended to her by the former principals of C W W Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya viz Piyasena Kodithuwakku, Ananda Weerasinghe and the present principal Vasantha Kulasekara. Rasa Sara Gee will be presented free of charge to mark 38 years of her musical career.
As far as music is concerned, we cannot forget Beethovans memorable words: Music is the mediator between her spiritual and the sensual life. Although the spirit be not the master of that which it creates through music, yet it is blessed in this creation, which, like every creation of art, is mightier than the artist.
Sometimes musicians and singers may not be aware that music is the fourth great material need of our nature. First we need food for survival. Second, we need shelter. Third we need creature comforts. Fourth, we need music. If a person has no music in him and is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, he is only fit for treason, stratagems and spoils. No one will trust him.
Rasangi says music, once admitted to the soul becomes a sort of spirit and it never dies. It wanders freely through the halls and galleries of our memory. Music is a discipline and a mistress of order and good manners. Rasangi who has been immersed in singing and music for more than three decades knows very well that her songs make listeners minder and gentler.
When we listen to a singer of Rasangis calibre we feel elated, but we do not know how it happens. However, we know that music produces a kind of pleasure which cannot be explained.

## Title: SL exports to rise after regaining GSP+ status

SL exports to rise after regaining GSP+ status
The recent decision by the EU to reinstate Sri Lanka to its tariff exemption scheme, designed to assist developing countries in achieving upper-middle-income status, should serve to boost exports and generate renewed private sector investment says Oxford Business Group.
On May 19 the EU formally restored Sri Lanka and restoration means tariffs on more than 6000 products have been removed, with the complete lifting of duties on some two-thirds of all tariff lines. While Sri Lankan exports retained some concessions under the standard GSP scheme, it was the Plus that conferred many of the advantages that allowed its goods and services to be successfully exported to the bloc.
The easing of the tariff barriers will likely serve to increase trade flows even further, to Sri Lankas benefit. Of the nearly 4bn in bilateral trade recorded last year, Sri Lankan exports to EU member states accounted for 2.6bn, giving it a strong trade surplus. With some estimates putting the immediate boost in revenue from the lifting of many of the tariffs at 300m, and the opening up European markets to Sri Lankan products set to increase this further, prospects for local exporters are on the rise.
If Sri Lankas exports to the EU resume their pre-2010 levels, there could be a surge in growth in a number of key primary and secondary industries. In the five years prior to the revocation of Sri Lankas GSP+ privileges, the countrys exports to the bloc rose at an average annual rate of 16.4%.
While exports have continued to increase in the years since, this rate of growth has been less than half the 2005-09 level, albeit at a still robust 7.4% per annum.
The expected boost in shipments to the EU is timely for Sri Lanka, which has seen its overall exports ease in recent years. Outbound shipments fell by 2.2% in value terms in 2016, dipping to $10.3bn. This was down from the $10.5bn posted the previous year, a result which itself represented a 5.6% decline on 2014.
This easing of exports contributed to a widening trade deficit, which reached 11.2% of GDP in 2016, up from 10.4% the previous year, according to Central Bank data. By end- 2016, the trade shortfall had risen from $8.4bn to $9.1bn.
In addition to reviving its trade metrics, Sri Lankas return to the GSP+ fold should also spur investment in some key sectors  particularly textiles and agriculture, which account for the bulk of current shipments to the EU.
Private sector investment is already on the rise as confidence in the economy gains pace. With the added incentives of an open door to EU markets, there could be a further increase in spending on export focused production. However, as was demonstrated in 2010, GSP+ concessions are not fixed, and remain subject to constant monitoring and revision. Should Sri Lankas progress towards meeting international and EU criteria wane, it could put its status at risk again.
Furthermore, under EU trade regulations, any country benefitting from the GSP+ scheme that achieves and maintains upper middle income country status for three years is deemed to be economically advanced enough to not need the additional support, and is therefore removed from the scheme.

SLGU introduces Garmin golf tech at Urban Greens Golf Room
Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) took another giant step towards developing and training trainers to impart knowledge and swing- analysis to help golfers understand their swing and take their game to a higher level.
Truswing, a device that helps to monitor and provide information to view your own swing and correct the swing action of golfers, was handed over to newly trained coaches at a training event conducted at Urban Greens Golf Room at the Taj Samudra Hotel.
The event was organised by SLGU together with Techinnovators (Pvt) Ltd. - the sponsors and local distributor of Garmin Truswing devices. The handing over ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Professionals, Trainers and Coaches.
Golf swings need more accurate analysis to improve your game said Priath Fernando, President, SLGU.
The small, lightweight and easy-to-use sensor measures the swing metrics golfers need to improve their game, and makes the data available immediately. Unlike other swing sensors currently on the market, TruSwing syncs wirelessly to a variety of approach devices, so golfers can get instant swing feedback right on their wrist after each swing.
This device will truly enable the coach to detect swing action errors and correct the student whilst training.
Device syncs through a smart phone and connects to Garmin connect app. where both coach and student could view a 3D virtual play of the swing action done seconds earlier. All data thats collected is stored in one place within Garmin Connect. Each session is organized by date, so users can go back to see each individual swing and how theyve improved since then. Garmin Connect can show golfers overall cumulative stats, as well as stats per session, which can be broken down by clubs used.
Weighing only 28 grams and measuring only 2.4, TruSwing has an unobtrusive design that can be securely attached to any club below the grip. The robust attachment offers a firm grasps on the club, and the simple, quick design makes swapping between clubs a breeze.
TruSwing can get up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge with plenty of storage to make it through multiple rounds before uploading to Garmin Connect.
TruSwing boasts an IPX-7 water rating, which can withstand the elements if golfers get caught in a sudden rainstorm.
Anyone can visit Urban Greens Golf Simulator at the Taj Samudra Hotel through the week and try your hand in Air-conditioned comfort.
The Golf Simulator provides a driving range, and any selected golf course in the world to play on! The enjoyment of golf is doubled with the availability of coaching and electronic feed-back provided with the swing results on the trueswing device.
Additionally, most of the local professional coaches in Sri Lanka can be consulted via Urban Greens Golf Room.

SLT holds industry forum on cyber security
SLT in collaboration with SL CERT held The Cyber Security Forum, with the aim of increasing awareness and helping CIOs and Heads of IT departments in organizations to improve online security and prevent cyber crimes.
The Forum took place at the Hilton Colombo Residences with the participation of a large number of CIOs, cyber security and IT security experts in Sri Lanka.
Both the organizations aim to work together towards the developmental goals of the country, providing assurance for next generation cyber security services.
The forum addressed latest threats being experienced globally, protecting critical national infrastructure, and encouraging administrations participation in the discussions of national level cyber security initiatives.
During the forum, the resource person, Professor Abhaya Induruwa addressing the gathering said, Cybersecurity was previously an issue for the back room. Now, its made its way to the boardroom and the Situation Room.
Cyber threats are growing in intensity and scale. Weve seen significant breaches at government agencies and in private businesses, including leading global financial institutions and large enterprises, added Prof. Induruwa. It is important that both the public and private sector should come together in protecting critical assets with confidence and trust, which will help manage risks that are known and get ahead of those not known. The timely collaboration of Sri Lanka Telecom and SL CERT is a commendable effort in this light. At present, the focus should be on two primary areas: the concept of enhanced public-private information sharing and developing standards and crafting a cyber security framework for Sri Lanka that addresses risks across government and industry and to do so quickly. Simultaneously, an effective cyber security framework should enable overcoming barriers in continuing economic growth, while creating an environment that protects and nurtures innovation.
The latest unprecedented ransomware attack that has affected organizations in over 150 countries highlights the exploding threat landscape that is faced today. Both the public sector and private sector, as well as economic enablers should take initiatives to secure their digital enterprises from cyber threats.
With cyber crimes continuing to escalate, new approaches to digital risks should be assessed and mitigated by any organization. Professor Induruwa has contributed to Sri Lankas ICT industry by pioneering ICT education and playing a pivotal role in the deployment of Internet in Sri Lanka. He is the founder of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in 1985, the first of its kind in a Sri Lankan state university.
In recognition of his pioneering efforts in bringing the Internet to Sri Lanka, Professor Induruwa was inducted to the Internet Hall of Fame 2014, an honorary lifetime achievement award administered by the Internet Society. Locally, he was honoured by the Internet Society Sri Lanka Chapter with the Internet Pioneers Award at the celebration of 20 years of Internet in Sri Lanka in June 2015. He currently serves as the Director of the Centre for Cybercrime and Security Innovation at the Canterbury Christ Church University in the United Kingdom.

Smackeroo for an old uncontrolled Buckaroo!
I never imaginedthat the mention of my birthday on Wednesday the fifth of July would evoke such a huge response. Being a rather modest scribbler I would never have contemplated that my name had become a household word among so many readers. That would have been a laugh as far as I am concerned. My name isn't even a household word in my own home!
As age sneaks up on me, sure I get older and also bolder. After all I have nothing to lose on the final lap of life. When I was an adolescent my mother used to tell me to act my age. My father wanted me to act older. Now, as a baby boomer, I would like to act any age I want to.
As you see, I have been subjected to conflicting parental advice, not all of it bad, but conflicting nonetheless. As we are all aware, adolescence is that period in your life when parents become more difficult. To make my point clearer, my mother fretfully thought that I was darn too precocious for my tender years.
Now I am not saying she considered me among the intellectually gifted child freaks of the time. Far from it. But she seemed to believe that I was developmentally advanced in language and thought. You know what I mean. It is the kind of adolescent mindset that defies classification, where grown-up ideas and ambition coexist with childish will and bravado.
My fathers perception of my frame of mind was altogether different. He wanted me to be wise beyond my years and stop playing the role of the insufferable wise guy. My Dad accused me of being impertinent when I told him that: Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged men.
Imagine the ridiculousness of having an old head on your young shoulders. Now some 50 years later I enjoy the prospect of having a young head firmly placed on my ageing shoulders. But then again here is where the trouble begins. As an older guy, I am expected to be quiet, stay in the background and stop being my old, or is it young rambunctious self Being blessed with youthful energy and exuberance I am having some difficulty fitting into this unaccustomed role.
The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom. Setting an example for your children and grand children takes all the fun out of ageing. It is not that I am a sky-diver, sword-swallower or fire-limbo dancer, but I am not ready to be consigned to the haansi putuwa or old aunt Ninos rocker on the verandah.
Oh no! No not me. You will still see me sliding down the banister of life while praying and muttering every gaatha that all the splinters are pointed the other way. Having said that, I think it would also be apt to remind you of the old adage that theres no fool like an old fool, except of course a young fool, which I still long to be.
But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realise what a darn fool he was when he was young. Which leads us to the logical conclusion that life is certainly an All Fools paradise in Sri Lanka.
For all of us, old age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature. And of course there is nowhere to run. Certainly, some men talk of killing time, not realising that it is time that quietly kills them.
Many of you who claim to be of my vintage need not worry about avoiding temptation as you grow older. That is because temptation starts avoiding you. I for one have never stopped believing in the apt axiom: You dont stop playing when you grow old. You only grow old when you stop playing!
Now look, we all did silly things when we were young. Some of us still do. You dont have to blatantly court disaster but then a few risks are permissible if you have to live your dream. Ah yes, and most of my dreams are in technicolour.
And when you dream in colour, its not just a pigment of your imagination. In addition, I am not the type to begin lusting after my lost youth when mine was mostly misspent enjoying a life with a crazy immoderation and writing what I like. Two things Im pretty darn good at, even if I do say so myself. As you can see I am still enjoying this privileged lifestyle while retaining my youthful spirit and debonair air.
Whats more, as we are all aware, age is an issue of mind over matter. If you dont mind, it doesnt matter. And even if you do there is nothing you can do about it. I like the way my childhood friend Barbara, the Dowager Duchess, the widow of four husbands put it:  Its not the men in your life that count, its the life in your men.
But there are times when the shadow of old age can lurk up on you in the manifestation of people who claim to be your age, in particular your decrepit former schoolmates. And before you know it, you wonder whether you have been transformed into those mirrored reflections of the golden age of geriatrics. They may have been my schoolmates but I tell you Im too young to be this old!
Wrinkled Who me No its something other old fogeys have similar to my character lines. Besides, age imprints more wrinkles in the mind than it does on the face.
For all you conventional oldsters and unadventurous young punks out there I believe it would be a capital idea to take me as an example of an age-appropriate role model. I really dont know about you but at three score and something more I still live life to the fullest. You see moderation can be a fatal thing. So why rein in your impulses when they are rarin to go. Nothing succeeds like excess.
Come on. Chappies, do it my way. Life is too short for regrets and recriminations. Just do what you like doing best regardless of the calendar. Now that would be really acting your age!
I appreciate your warm birthday wishes and specially those stunning smackeroo kisses for an old, bold and uncontrolled buckaroo. I really appreciate it so much from the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my whisky glass.

Sonia Aggarwal to play a cop in her next
Sonia Aggarwal is all set to play a cop in her next, Yevanavan. The film, which stars Sonia, Vincent Asokan, newbie Akhil and Tharan in the lead, is directed by Natty Kumar. Talking about the project, Natty says, "This one's a thriller. Social media is a boon and bane. While some are using it to their advantage, many youngsters are misusing social media. Sometimes, they make mistakes even without their knowledge and get into serious problems. The film revolves around them and how they land up in trouble. Sonia and Vincent play investigative cops."
The director, who had earlier directed two films  Meiporul and Panithuli, is excited about this one. "Unlike my earlier films, I shot this one completely in Chennai. It is a fast-paced screenplay which will keep the audience at the edge of their seats. Sonia has done a wonderful job and this will be a different character for her. Vincent, too, took six months to sport an eight-pack in the film," says Natty.

Sri Lanka holds onto 8th spot but lose points
Sri Lanka held onto the crucial eighth position in the ICC One-Day International rankings despite suffering their first ever ODI series loss to Zimbabwe (3-2).
However Sri Lanka lost five valuable rating points for their defeat against a low ranked side and thus have a total of 88 rating points which is 10 more than ninth placed West Indies who despite losing their five-match ODI series to India (3-1) gained a point following their win in the fourth ODI against a higher ranked team.
Prior to the commencement of the two series in Sri Lanka and in the Caribbean, Sri Lanka had 93 rating points and West Indies 77 rating points. Sri Lankas next series is at home against India for five ODIs while West Indies travel to Ireland for one ODI and to England for a five-match ODI series.
Sri Lankas eighth place guarantees them automatic qualification for the 2019 Cricket World Cup at the moment. Only the top eight ranked teams at the September 30, 2017 deadline will gain automatic qualification. The teams ranked below eight will have to face a qualification round that involves 10 countries including associate members where only the top two teams will qualify for the main event.
Sri Lanka are currently standing on a knifes edge because if West Indies happen to win the series against England they would improve their standings and may displace them unless Sri Lanka perform well against India.
Meanwhile Zimbabwe who are placed 11th gained six points from their series win over Sri Lanka and have 52 rating points. - ST

Sri Lanka to procure 300,000MT rice from Pakistan

Sri Lanka has shown interest in procuring about 300,000 metric tons rice from Pakistan to meet its domestic shortfall because of drought in the country.
A high-level Sri Lankan delegation, led by Sri Lankas Ministry of Commerce and Industry Secretary Chinthaka S Lokuhetti, showed interest during a meeting with Commerce Secretary Mohammad Younus Dhaga.
Sri Lankan side is looking to procure rice on government-to-government basis because of drought in Sri Lanka.
Dhaga informed his counterpart that considering it is the end of season, Pakistan will initially provide at least 25,000 MT rice to Sri Lanka on urgent basis.
For the remaining quantities the trading arms of two countries, Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) and Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) in Sri Lanka will discuss procurement schedule and price in September/October on the advent of new crop.
Both sides also discussed about signing a Memorandum of Understanding between TCP and CWE - Sri Lanka counterpart in Sri Lanka for supply of other commodities as well such as sugar.

SriLankan Airlines welcomes future leaders
Creating opportunities for dynamic young individuals to achieve their potential, SriLankan Airlines recruited 20 new Management Trainees, following a one-year comprehensive training programme.
The Management Trainee Programme was implemented with the intention of absorbing new blood into the organization. It is vital that key positions are filled by newcomers who will not only benefit the organization by preventing inbreeding of ideas but will also grow with the organization to take up future managerial positions.
SriLankan Airlines has taken six Management Trainee batches in the past and the current intake was inducted in June 2016. The Management Trainee Programme has been in effect from 2000 and many of those who joined the organization as a result of this endeavour have continued to grow with the company.
Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, Ajith Dias stated: Launching a career is a very big step and we are indeed pleased to welcome the new Management Trainees. The airline is going through a decisive period and we hope that they will play a positive part in supporting all our future ventures. A key feature of the entire training programme is the fact that we have been able to maintain full transparency throughout the entire process, which was unbiased and fully compliant to create the environment of trust and fair appraisal.
The selection process was comprised of a number of rigorous procedures in order to ensure that only the best out of potential candidates were selected. Following responses to press advertisements, the company shortlisted applications of those with degrees with a class or equivalent full professional qualification or outstanding collegiate career with 3 credits for A/Ls who have excelled in sports at a national level while belonging to the required age category. From 2,391 applicants, 1,505 were shortlisted and called for a written test.
A total of 20 candidates were officially selected for training after being selected through a multi-stage recruitment process that included shortlisting sessions, an assessment centre, and interviews with the Senior Management Team and the Board.
Colonel Sunil Peiris, Director SriLankan Airlines and the driving force of 2016 Management Trainee Batch said; The Management Trainee Programme is something that most of the top organizations in the world have adopted in order to ensure that new blood is infused into the company. By doing so, we hope to prevent inbreeding in the organization, generate fresh ideas and fill in the void left by the retirement of veteran managers.
The training period lasted for one year, comprising of two stages. The first stage consisted of classroom training which furnished the trainees with in-depth knowledge on the aviation industry which included an IATA examination and Harvard Manage Mentor Certification. The second stage consisted of cross functional training, and the trainees were divided into groups of four, each mentored by a member of the Senior Management Team.
A Special Leadership Skills Development programme was part of the overall training process through a series of workshop sessions, business simulations and business forums, each of which was aimed at developing the essential soft skills and keen understanding of real business situations that are essential tools in management and leadership. Several proposed training topics were undertaken by third parties such as the Employers Federation of Ceylon and the British Council.
Head of Human Resources, Pradeepa Kekulawala further affirmed that the programme is essential for the future development of the company. Our Management Trainee Programme is designed to create and develop leaders. The trainees were given direct, hands on experience from the start, and encouraged to develop and implement new ideas that challenge the norm and drive continued improvement.

St. Johns Nugegoda and the harmful impact of poaching
The subject of this article is rather controversial. It is centered on the recent media exposure besides what some of us knew for a time, the relatively new phenomenon called poaching in schools rugby.
Rugby is a highly interesting and popular sport and if one may say a glamorous sport in Schools.
As a consequence more and more schools take to the game,whereas earlier it was confined to a relatively few prestigious institutions. This is where the trouble begins.More of this later.
The writer has been akeen follower of rugby especially of the schools scene and could state that the progress of the game augurs well for its future, since schools are natural nurseries of rugger.
It is particularly in this context that I wish to refer to the unfortunate, publicly unseen development in school rugger.
The most publicised victim of this insidious practice called poaching is St. Johns Nugegoda, founded in 1915, and one of my old schools. During my time,if I may state over half a century ago, it was a different institution run by the Christian church ,private and fee levying. The entire education except for two Sinhalese classes was in English.It remains the leading boys school within the vast confines of historicKotte.
For a long time St.Johnswas the first and preferred institution of the English educated middle class of Nugegoda and its environs which was a highly cosmopolitan society, structurally different to todays. My I also state that St. Johns and its prolific output of competent old boys in diverse spheres has impacted favourably on the post 1977 liberal era which made Kotte a leading economic hub of thecountry. This is why the old boys of the school are particularly hurt by the situation prevailing in rugger.
The school began rugby in 1989,later than most other schools in the game.The lack of a suitable ground for a hardy game like rugger was a major constraint.
However, eversince it began rugby, its young ruggerites have shown a flair for the game.
More recently,its progress in the schools tournament enabled St. Johns to project its increasing ability.
St.Johns reached Division 2 of the C tier in2011 with some good wins over bigger schools.. In 2013,it was promoted to Division 1 of Segment 2. Also in the under 14 ten a side tournament in 2014
St.Johns became runner-up to Trinity College. On its way it beat two other Kandy schools ,Dharmaraja and Vidyartha Colleges.
It was around this time that the school first began to feel the creeping impact of poaching, creating an ill wind across St.Johns in rugger that eventually turned into a tornado, wiping off the potential the school had in the game.
In 2017 as a consequence of these unfortunate developments the school could not field a side for the under 20 games in the tournaments. Shockingly, 14 of its players had been poached or headhunted successfully by some of the bigger schools.
Some of the old boys learnt with dismay is that the transfer of these boys was conspiratorial and allegedly three dimensional.
It is important for the Education Department to launch an investigation into this matter and identify the culprits.But whether this would be done remains doubtful.

Task force appointed to facilitate property rights

The Housing and Construction Ministry has appointed a task force to develop a mechanism to transfer state owned condominium and non-condominium properties to those who have utilised them for more than 15 years.
The Housing and Construction Ministry has already invited the relevant families to provide their information.
The decision was made in order to establish clearly defined, fair, stable and enforceable system of property rights.
This initiative was taken to fulfil Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes pledge to empower three million citizens to become land and house owners made while presenting his Economic Policy Statement in 2015.
The government is addressing this commitment on several fronts.
Proposals to modernise surveys and registration systems are under discussion and new initiatives to recognise the rights and legitimacy of the urban poor have already been launched.
Transferring state own houses to their long term occupants is one of the key objectives of the government and around 1000 families, including those who have resettled after the Tsunami will also benefit through this initiative.

Tax on abandoned dengue breeding lands in WP
A tax will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province which are not cleaned of dengue breeding sites as a measure to curb the massive spread of dengue, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya.
According to the Chief Minister, a two percent tax from the land value will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province in accordance with the Local Government Ordinance.
The taxation policy, Devapriya explained was already present but few people knew of its existence as it had not been enforced in a systematic manner in the past.
He explained that a large number of dengue breeding grounds were found in abandoned lands and that the tax could be imposed multiple times if action was not taken to clean up by the relevant owners. The authorities also have power to acquire the land if the tax was not paid.
I dont think it would be hard to find the owners of these lands as the commercial value of many lands are high and people will come forward to clean their lands. If the land is clean, no tax will be charged, the Chief Minister told the Daily News.
At present,people do not clean the lands they do not make use of and it is the neighbours that have to suffer. At times people also use these empty lands as garbage disposal sites,he added. Those living in the Western Province have been encouraged to report about uncleaned abandoned lands to the closest local government authority and in addition, Public Health Inspectors are to conduct surveys on these lands to find out if they are potential dengue breeding sites.
According to Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit statistics,the highest number of cases,34,896 have been reported from the Western Province since January this year and of them, 18,186 were reported from the Colombo district.
The Colombo Municipal Council area recorded 3,221 dengue patients, while the other parts of the district recorded 14,965 dengue patients.

The programme was initiated by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office. It is being implemented together with the Department of Project Management and Monitoring, and the Information Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA).
The public can obtain information about the areas in which projects are being implemented and how much money is spent. Data collection is still in the initial phase awaiting confirmation through the District and Divisional Secretaries.
The programme will provide accurate information about all welfare beneficiaries and provide a system to identify the people who are entitled to benefits to eliminate fraud and wastage ensuring transparency.
This is a source which carries island wide information on welfare projects and progress.

Terrorism, visa-exempt travel to take centre stage
Suppression of terrorism and visa-exempt travel between SAARC countries for the promotion of trade in the region are to take centre stage at the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting in Colombo, today.
Parallel to the Meeting of Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs), Colombo will also host the eighth meeting of the SAARC Secretaries of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) and eighth meeting of SAARC Immigration Authorities.
Sri Lanka also hopes that at the meeting would be successful in obtaining approval for the Secure Database of the SAARC Terrorist Offences Monitoring Desk (STOMD) established at the Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) in Colombo, in 2013.
The Secure Database would allow SAARC member countries to share information on terrorists and terrorist-related activities with each other.
The proposal for such a database has been discussed for a long time, but countries have had issues regarding its security. But this year, we hope our proposals will be approved, said Law and Order Ministry Secretary Jagath Wijeweera, at a media briefing held at Temple Trees last week.
He further said that Sri Lanka had volunteered to establish the database at its own Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) in Colombo.
TID DIG Nalaka De Silva in the meantime explained that while the project had been mainly funded by India, the system was home-grown; designed by the University of Moratuwa.
Technical experts from member countries came to study the system and earlier they had voiced concerns regarding its security, but this time, we have improved on it and this time if approval is granted from all member countries, we can go forward with it, said DIG De Silva. The DIG explained that member countries could update the database with information on terrorists and terrorist-related activity in their own country, but the information could only be accessed by another SAARC member after permission from the relevant member country is obtained.
At the Meeting in 2015, SAARC members approved the report on the database with Pakistan stating that in principle it supports the establishment of secure data base and expressed the hope that the database would be utilized only for information and intelligence sharing.
The meeting which is held once every two years has been brought forward by a year, said Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, as member countries had pointed out that this was an apt time to discuss issues related to terrorism in the region.

Toddy and beedi  cottage industries no more
Sri Lanka is home to several cottage industries that villagers all over the island have engaged in for time immemorial.
Although some of these may be deemed controversial in nature, like the toddy trade and beedi, their scale and purpose warranted little or no action against them. For instance, both these domestic industries enjoy the lowest tax bracket in Sri Lankas excise regime and a blind eye is often turned on these meagre income owners.
A toddy tapper simply needs to pay Rs. 250 per tree for a year and is permitted to sell the produce at his or her own premises.
The Tobacco Tax Act states that no product is to be removed from any factory it is made at until the payable tax has been paid. However, for beedi, there is no real manufacturing or consumption data and production is estimated purely by the quantity of tendu leaf which is imported into the country. As per official estimates, the numbers have hardly changed over 25 years.
Accordingly, little or no attention has been paid to these segments as they have historically been tagged cottage industries that serve microeconomies, with production numbers that hardly nudge the needle. During an ongoing islandwide economic and social survey, details are emerging that suggest the need to possibly reconsider our stance.
During our visit to the Northern and Eastern provinces including the Jaffna, Kodikamam, Vadamaarachchi and Kilinochchi districts, we were impressed to note that shops and outlets in rural areas were devoid of tobacco or alcohol products as government and non-governmental agencies prohibit their sale with the objective of preventing social degradation.
But these cottage industries persist and serve local consumers with ample volumes laying waste to the objectives of fighting intoxication. In one village of 400 families, we estimated daily consumption of toddy and beedi at 220 litres and 700 sticks  all of it off the grid.
In addition to the harmful social and health implications of both, the revenue loss to government when extrapolated islandwide is more than significant, with guesstimates at over Rs. 100 million a day.
We have confidence in stating this is an islandwide problem, as we encountered families rolling beedi all over Sri Lanka including the Galle, Matara, Negombo, Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts.
In some instances, these domestic producers served small batches of consumers in their vicinity, but with others we found them producing and packaging beedis for mass distribution and sale sometimes through intermediaries  intermediaries that they did not know were in fact large-scale businessmen.
Priced as low as Rs. 5 a stick at times, consumers can buy beedi in large volumes, encouraging increased consumption. One ailing consumer from Nawalapitiya said he smokes a stack of 20 in two days, as beedi was easily available and far cheaper than a cigarette.
When questioned on his ill health and the impacts of smoking, he added that he was aware of its outcomes but that beedi 'is safer because as it is a natural product'.
It is difficult to place a finger on the exact extent of beedi production and consumption in Sri Lanka, but given the feedback we received from consumers and producers all over the island the number has surely grown.
The North, North Central, Central and Southern provinces yielded some answers as to why this increase is not reflected in tendu leaf imports, as manufacturers were using local leaf alternatives which some of them identified as 'paan'.
There are two facets of concern here. On one side is the serious revenue loss to government, as consumption grows unregulated also spawning illegal businesses. Whilst it is difficult to state a conclusive figure, it is safe to estimate that the government loses over Rs. 8 billion annually from the beedi trade due to the industry being undertaxed.
On the other hand, there are the multiple health issues: that consumers think and traders promote beedi as a safer natural product presents one extremity of the problem, whilst health costs to treat consumers impacted by consumption would no doubt heap further burden on the administration.
Of toddy and beedi, I am of the opinion that beedi is a far more serious concern. I say so because toddy is a far more visible trade and one that is difficult to conduct indiscernibly as a cottage trade or otherwise.
Trees need to be tapped, there is a fermentation process involved and it is difficult to miss a trail of intoxicated individuals if the authorities were to crack down on any illicit or licensed liquor dens.
In addition, almost all domestic producers were paying excise fees to government, though admittedly and by our own estimation over 50 percent of total produce remains undisclosed.
The potential loss to government from the cottage toddy trade was an estimated Rs. 900 million, with a cup of fresh unaltered toddy going for low as Rs. 75 in some places.
In most parts of the country, local authorities seemed aware of local toddy tappers and consumers, but there was a great lack of awareness with respect to beedi, which often happened behind closed doors.
In Negombo and Anuradhapura, it was evident that this was part of a large well-organised racket and that we were in fact just skimming the tip of a very large iceberg, with respondents choosing to answer very carefully.
In a milieu of growth and development and a want for revenue, I believe it is imperative that we revisit our approach towards some of our very traditional industries  to promote them, to safeguard them, and where necessary to further regulate them in order to ensure law and order and due returns and revenue to government. The beedi and toddy trade are top of mind for the latter. Revenue aside, if left unregulated they will spawn - and likely have already spawned  a number of undesirable elements which can spiral out of control at national level. Accordingly, it could become prudent and timely for the government to empower and set up ground level enforcement via the police, excise and security forces to ensure controls.

Top pick Fultz recovering from ankle sprain
Los Angeles,Sunday: First overall draft pick Markelle Fultz is not expected to play any more summer league NBA games as he recovers from an ankle sprain suffered on Saturday night in Las Vegas, the US media reported.
The Philadelphia 76ers draft pick was helped off the court after rolling his left ankle in a game against the Golden State Warriors in Las Vegas.
Fultz, who recorded eight points in 15 minutes in Philadelphias 95-93 win, landed on Warriors guard Jabari Browns heel while trying to stop Brown from driving to the basket.
Fultz was well enough to walk around after the game and the injury is not believed to be serious, American sports broadcaster ESPN reported.
Im ok, thank you for all who were worried! Fultz tweeted Sunday.
Earlier Saturday, Fultz signed a contract. Details were not disclosed, but he is slated to make $5.8 million in his rookie season.
The 6-foot-4 Fultz averaged team highs of 23.2 points and 5.9 assists to go along with 5.7 rebounds during his first and only season with the University of Washington.
Philadelphia have dealt with major injuries to high draft picks in recent years. Third overall pick Joel Embiid missed his first two seasons and played in just 31 games last season.
The 2016 number one pick, Ben Simmons, missed his entire rookie season with a foot injury.AFP

Uber completes 5 bn trips globally
Uber started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get a ride at the push of a button In late 2015, we hit a big milestone: one billion trips. Six months later, we crossed two billion. And just a few weeks ago, on Saturday, May 20, 156 trips started simultaneously at 7:29:06am GMT, putting us over the five billion mark.
These trips happened in 24 countries on six continents, in cities like Mumbai, Moscow and Medellin. One lucky driver was on his first trip: he picked up a passenger on a motorbike in Jakarta, Indonesia, and six other riders were taking their first Uber trips, too. The shortest trip of the bunch lasted just 2.5 blocks in San Francisco while the longest lasted 17 miles in Singapore. Fifteen riders were on the road, using Uber outside their home city.
All of these trips wouldnt be possible without the hard work of drivers. Were giving each of the 156 drivers involved in this milestone USD 500 to say thanks.
Moving forward, were more focused than ever on building features for riders and drivers that will get us to the next five billion. This is just the beginning...well see you out on the road.

Unity in place of division
Given the increasing complexity and pace of change we find ourselves surrounded by, accurately predicting what our world will be like in five years, let alone twenty, is a near-impossible endeavour.
The recent formulation of a National Reconciliation Policy is a major step towards reaching the objective of reconciliation. The role of public service needs to be re-drafted in line with the requirements of the National Integration.
The danger, however, is that when a country is engaged (or pressured) in addressing the most crucial issues in the past, and most intractable issues, many of the other policy areas which are of paramount importance might get neglected or distracted. Therefore, a balance between the two is essential in policy making and implementation.
Managing For Development Results (MFDR)
This is especially overwhelming for educators, policy makers to prepare public officers for jobs that have not yet been created, to use technologies that have not yet been invented and to solve social problems that we dont yet know will arise. Nevertheless, although our world today does not give any clear answers about tomorrow, it does provide some clues.
Many of the policies and projects have implemented in this country, where most of the time has not reached the desired outcome. Many of the time policies and projects are left with only documentation and it does not reach the hearts of the people of this country. The approach of Management for development results is essential in policy and project implementation in our country, especially in the public service. From the grassroots levels of provincial councils, coordinated efforts are needed to resolve the issues to bridge the gaps in the rural mass without confining to the North and East.
Public officers in every sphere need to consider the aspiration of stakeholders such as civil society, academics, youth, the religious leaders (sangha and clergy) in the implementation of policies and projects in reconciliation while considering gender equity and equality in order to reach the objectives of the said policies and projects.
Reconciliation is a process and it cannot be done overnight. Although the violence ended in May 2009, the healing of wounds of over two decades of conflict, achieving reconciliation and national integration, catching up on economic progress and development that eluded us due to conflict, and ensuring non-recurrence, remain challenging tasks for our nation. Public officers have a major responsibility while serving the public to listen to the grievances and the requirements of every community.
Institutional mechanism linked with reconciliation process needs to be strengthened to provide facilities to the public officers to deliver the tasks assigned. The task of improving governance from grass root levels to the top pertaining to government institutions is a challenge while maintaining the rule of law, and putting in place necessary measures to promote and protect individual rights; while ensuring the dignity of all and building a truly national identity while preserving our pluralistic society.
Further, many of the projects have implemented in the name of social harmony and reconciliation, need to have checks and balances to avoid duplication of implementation of such projects in future.
Our strength lies in our people and their capacities to uphold and restore Sri Lankas relations with the outside world and restoring lost credibility. The Government, since January 2015, therefore, started reaching out to the international community, re-engaging with governments and international organisations. The tasks of public officers do not limit to the relations with local institutions and whenever dealing with international organisations, they need to protect the countrys image.
National think tank in reconciliation
Think tank is to define and plan new methods for the advancement of education in reconciliation. Think tank could support the practical application of research and think in education, policy making and leadership development in reconciliation. Public officers could be part and parcel of the think tank giving ideas to further development.
The transformation that Sri Lanka needs to make should be more geared towards minimising the potential damage from, as well as making the most of the opportunities arising from, the increasing complexity and change.
Traumatic memories dont simply vanish and we have learned, through experience since independence that grievances that are left unaddressed, can go on for generations, becoming entrenched, and holding the risk of descending into cycles of violence. Therefore, the role of the public officers in government institutions has a major role to play in prioritising the implementation of policies and projects in reconciliation. The challenges that we have before us are not easy ones. Sri Lanka needs its workforce to adjust and reorganise itself accordingly. This implies that the demands of the workplace as a whole are likely to keep changing and therefore requirements of the public service need to be looked as per the current context to serve the public requirements and aspirations.
Constructive ideas of people need to be valued in the reconciliation process. Shared values will be a culmination of a long process of public consultation. Promoting social cohesion via the principle of multiracialism will be the strategy. In all these attempts maintaining the national identity is important.
