Microsoft, Intel unveiles  new research  from Techaisle
Microsoft and Intel recently unveiled new research from Techaisle, a leading global SMB IT market research and analyst organization, which highlighted the opportunities that Asia Pacifics SMBs have by upgrading to modern devices at work.
The study, which surveyed 2,156 SMB organizations across Asia Pacific, found that the cost of keeping a PC more than four years old is US$2,736 per deviceenough to replace the ageing hardware with two or more new PCs.
The study also revealed that a PC older than four years old is also 2.7 times more likely to undergo repairs, resulting in loss in productivity. 85% of larger SMBs, with more than 500 employees, have PCs that are older than four years, compared to 60% in smaller SMBs employing less than 100 employees.
PCs are the productive engines for most SMBs in the region, where organizations rely heavily on their devices for their day-to-day tasks. However, 7 in 10 SMBs surveyed have PCs that are older than four years, which significantly increases maintenance costs, said Bradley Hopkinson, Vice President, Consumer and Devices Sales, Asia, Microsoft. With budget constraints being the number one IT challenge among SMBs today, business leaders should seek to adopt a device modernization strategy so that they can maintain costs, while safeguarding their organization from newer digital risks.
The new study revealed that in the last year alone, as high as 67% of SMBs may have experienced PC security and data theft breaches, with only 15% of them actually reporting these attacks.
SMBs constitute 98% of enterprises in the Asia Pacific region, and employ half of the workforce in the region yet many of them still have PCs older than four years old. We believe that by having them move to a modern PC powered by an Intel Core processor, they can unlock greater productivity for their business while reducing IT management time and costs, said Santhosh Viswanathan, Managing Director, Sales and Marketing Group, Asia Pacific Japan Territory, Intel.
Respondents in the study identified their top business priorities as increasing profitability, business growth and improving workforce productivity. The study highlighted that SMBs are looking at IT as a response to address their business issues. The top IT priorities included investing in PCs, cloud solutions and security solutions.
SMBs have an opportunity to improve their overall operations with modern devices. For those who have already made the move to newer PCs, the study revealed that:
With a modern PC powered by Windows 10, SMBs can be assured of up-to-date security updates, powered by cloud intelligence that proactively protects their businesses,stated Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager, Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives.
By reducing the potential risk of cyber threats with a modern PC, SMBs can definitely improve their productivity and avoid downtime.

The Gold Award was won by Crystal Martin Garments (Pvt) Limited, the Silver Award by next Manufacturing (Pvt) Limited and the Bronze Award by Sampath Associates International (Pvt) Limited.

Since inception, next Sourcing has built long-standing relationships with the entire supplier base with some partnerships approaching 20 years.
The company works closely with all suppliers to ensure that they continuously improve their manufacturing process to meet the stringent requirements of next Plc - UK when sourcing the finest, most exclusive fabrics and garments from Sri Lanka. The event also included a performance overview of next sales during the last quarter, with an updated indication on the current performance in line with the Key Performance Indicators set by next Plc - UK.

The bi-annual factory evaluations allow the next Sourcing management to make the selections for the top three factories out of a relatively large factory base present in Sri Lanka.
Wilhelm Elias, Associate Director of next Sourcing said, The retail clothing industry has been through a very tough 18-24 months. A decline in discretionary spending as a result of general inflation rising faster than average earnings and the shift in spending habits in the UK and Europe from less stuff to more experiences has taken a toll on many retailers resulting in store closures and jobs to be culled. Whilst Retail is a struggle we will continue to invest by way of shutting down smaller non-performing stores and opening bigger lifestyle stores.
Hugh McConnell, Technical Director of next Sourcing said, Through their commitment to achieving a high standard of quality on a consistent basis across all products Sri Lanka manufacturers have an established reputation for reliability on quality standards and product performance with Next UK. While the competition from other countries to Next UK is improving every year, Sri Lanka is still the top performer in this category which is meritorious when the product has become more varied with increased technical fabrics and embellishments.
Fiaz Ozeer, Senior Merchandise Manager of next Sourcing said, We witnessed a positive growth in the 4th quarter and forecast a potential growth of 6.2% in the year ahead. It is important that Sri Lanka capitalizes on skilled labour and provides an excellent service to all customers in order to remain competitive in the global market.

Our batting options were very  poor - batting coach Samaraweera
GALLE, Tuesday: Sri Lankas batting coach Thilan Samaraweera put down his teams dismal batting performance on the second day of the first Test against England at the Galle International Stadium to poor batting options.
There was nothing wrong with the pitch, no demons on it, our batting options were very poor today. We didnt bat well honestly and thats the bottom line, said Samaraweera at the end of the day.
Its not a 200 pitch because on day two also it behaved really well. Our options were all wrong. Five to six guys were out to very soft dismissals.
Not much technically more mindset. We know Englands spinners bowled with defensive field settings and our options were a little bit wrong, he said.
Summing up the match at the end of day two Samaraweera said, We are behind in this test and the first three hours tomorrow will be crucial.
We can take it from there where we stand. We have to get England out for a small total as possible and then try to chase down whatever target we are left with.
CHANDIMAL DOUBTFUL
Giving an update on captain Dinesh Chandimals groin strain, Samaraweera said that he will undergo an MRI scan before assessing whether he can play for the rest of the series.
At the moment the physio is assessing him I dont think he can field, hopefully he will bat after no. 6 in the second innings.
Chandimal batted for 96 minutes yesterday with a lot of discomfort and did not take the field during Englands second innings.
England are leading overall by 177 runs after dismissing Sri Lanka for 203 in their first innings.

Perfect Meal for  your  kids
Choose fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are like hitting the jackpot when it comes to nutrition. They make your plate more colorful and theyre packed with vitamins and fiber.
Know the facts about fat. Kids need some fat in their diets to stay healthy. It also helps keep you feeling full but you dont want to eat too much of it. Fat is found in butter, oils, cheese, nuts, and meats.
Let whole grains reign. Grains include breads, cereals, rice, and pasta. But as we learn more about good nutrition, its clear that whole grains are better than refined grains. Brown rice is a whole grain, but white rice is not. Likewise, whole-wheat bread contains whole grains, whereas regular white bread does not.
Slurp sensibly. Its not just about what you eat  drinks count, too! Milk has been a favorite lunchtime drink for a long time. If you dont like milk, choose water. Avoid juice drinks and sodas.
Balance your lunch. When people talk about balanced meals, they mean meals that include a mix of food groups: some grains, some fruits, some vegetables, some meat or protein foods, and some dairy foods such as milk and cheese. Try to do this with your lunch. If you dont have a variety of foods on your plate, its probably not balanced.
Steer clear of packaged snacks. Many schools make salty snacks, candy, and soda available in the cafeteria or in vending machines. They shouldnt be on your lunch menu.
Mix it up. Do you eat the same lunch every day Keep your taste buds from getting bored and try something new. Eating lots of different kinds of food gives your body a variety of nutrients.
Quit the clean plate club. Because lunch can be a busy time, you might not stop to think whether youre getting full. Try to listen to what your body is telling you. If you feel full, its ok to stop eating.

PMs appointment in keeping with Constitution  Truth Seekers
Attorney-at-law and Convener of the Truth Seekers movement Premnath C. Dolwatte has written to Lord Naseby reiterating that the appointment of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country is constitutional.
In his letter, Dolwatte explains that the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the office of the Premier and appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa by President Maithripala Sirisena was done so based on the majority support which the Former President wields in Sri Lanka.
Sir Hugo Swire a member of your Parliament stated that he still believes that Mr. Wickremesinghe is the legitimate premier of Sri Lanka. Please go through the constitutional explanation and make a declaration in your Parliament of the appointment of the Former President, he writes.
In a separate annexure, Dolwatte explains that the appointment of the Former President is in keeping with Article 42 of the Constitution which states that the President shall appoint a Prime Minister, who in the Presidents opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.
Therefore, there is no mandatory requirement that the President appoint the actual Member of Parliament who commands the confidence of Parliament or the member of Parliament who commands the majority of seats in Parliament, he says.
Dolwatte reiterates that according to Article 24(4), it is the opinion of the President which matters, regardless of whether the said member commands the confidence of Parliament or not. The deciding factor is the opinion of the President. Constitution does not impose any bar or make any provision as to how he should form this opinion.
He also points out to a difference in the translation of the English text of the Constitution adding that the method of removal of the PM is not legibly stated and as such one needs to refer to the interpretation and Section 14(f) which states that the appointing authority has the power to remove the said apointees.
This fact is open to debate and should be finally declared by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. But Mr. Wickremesinghe to date has not sought any relief from the Supreme Court over his removal, Dolwatte says. As such the removal of Mr. Wickremesinghe and appointment of the new Prime Minister becomes legal within the four corners of the Constitution.

Lord Nasebys statement is objective and non- interfering
Reconvening Parliament, a Presidential  prerogative under Lankas Constitution  - Veteran foreign news analyst Mohan Samaranayaka
Veteran foreign news analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka yesterday said no international state has the right to tell Sri Lanka to reconvene its Parliament.
If any foreign state, institution or lawmaker called on the Head of State of Sri Lanka to reconvene Parliament, they are intervening in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Sri Lanka, said Mohan Samaranayaka,They are acting in a manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.
Samaranayaka said this on being asked his take on the recent statements issued by The Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland and the US Department of States Spokeswoman Nauert Heather and some embassies, calling on the Sri Lankas President to reconvene Parliament as soon as possible.
He said it is the nature of the hegemonic powers to use their privileged positions to influence weaker countries subtly rather than forcefully in their interest which they do through cultural means and economic power, and rest on a mixture of consent and coercion.
Hegemonic powers spread their influence masquerading as the international community, he explained.
Of those statement made by lawmakers and leaders of those hegemonic organisations, which often exercise their hegemonic influence on countries, I must say,the statement issued Tuesday by Lord Naseby, Michael Morris, Conservative Member of the House of Lords, former MP in the UK Parliament, has been the only objective and non-intrusive statement come into being so far, he said.
Naseby has said that it was not for foreigners to to interpret the Sri Lankan Constitution.
He went on to say that he was sure that President Maithripala Sirisena, as the Executive acted in the best interest of the country, Samaranayaka said. He had said that as far as he could see nothing unconstitutional has happened and it is unusual.
He had further said they had had unusual things in the UK and that they had a five year fixed term which was cut short in his tweeted video.
Samaranayaka said that Lord Naseby was just about right.
Asked why he thinks that hegemonic countries act in their interest over issues affecting our country, he said,  They have their economic, geopolitical, trade and cultural agenda which they usually set up subtly than forcibly.
Where were these countries when the previous government of sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was dragging its fet and preventing the holding of Local Government and provincial elections in the country he asked.
Did they say anything against when they established an opposition with 16 members as against 52 members in Parliament he concluded.

Retired England cricketer Alastair Cook all set for knighthood
A couple of months ago, English cricket lost one of its greatest cricketers in Alastair Cook, who eventually decided to hang his boots after going through a rough patch over the last one and half years. He made the announcement after the Three Lions fourth Test at The Ageas Bowl in Southampton.
Cook made his last international appearance in a Test against India at Kennington Oval in London. In his last match, he churned out a half-century in the first innings followed by a superlative ton in the second innings.
To add to his delight, the Poms won the encounter by a mammoth 118 runs and also bagged the five-match series 4-1. After making his announcement of bidding adieu, the veteran mentioned that he had given everything and had nothing left in the tank.
Recently, it has been learned that the 33-year-old is set to be the youngest cricketing knight. The proposal to award Cook with knighthood has been tabled in the House of Lords. Right Hon Lord Andrew Tyrie, a member of the House of Lords, who tabled a Parliamentary question proposing Cook for a knighthood, praised the experienced campaigner.
It is not just that Alastair Cook is unquestionably the best batsman England has produced in recent years but that he can make a massive contribution as an ambassador for cricket at home and abroad. Nobody could be more deserving, Andrew Tyrie was quoted as saying in Metro.
Graham Gooch, Cooks mentor in Essex at the English domestic circuit also spoke highly about the retired batsman. Alastair is Englands greatest run-scorer and has played the greatest number of Tests for us making him an all-time great, so it would be fitting for him to be honoured this way. Hes played the game the right way, behaved the right way and set a brilliant example to everyone. Hes excelled in all areas, Gooch said.

Social auditing: A tool in strengthening rural development programmes
The UN definition of rural development is a process of change by which the efforts of people themselves are united to improve the economic, social and cultural conditions of their communities and to enable them to contribute fully to the national development.
The definition though lofty in meaning, will not happen on its own. Thus, the UN also has recommended the following approaches to achieve what is needed.
Rural development approaches
According to the UN, there are five types of development approaches:
i. State-led development approach - after World War II and decolonisation, the state took a proactive role in planning and development and they were mostly welfare-oriented.
ii. Market-driven development approach - with globalisation and the advent of liberalisation policies, the market became the driving force for development. Goods and services were measured in terms of ability to pay a price.
iii. Community-driven development approach - as people were excluded from decision- making, they were led to mass movements and the rise of civil society organisations, protests, petitions, and judicial interventions.
iv. Participatory development approach  this created an enabling environment for civic society participation and interventions such as participatory budgeting, social programme evaluation, and social accountability mechanisms were included.
v. Rights-based development approach  this emerged due to failure of the state in protecting citizens rights such as food, water, and shelter and this views development as a right rather than charity. In this approach, people pressurise the state for effective implementation of welfare programmes and demand that transparency, accountability, equity and non-discrimination be maintained in implementation.
Rural development process
Whatever development approach adopted, its effectiveness, efficiency and economy should be considered for the maximum benefit. Effectiveness checks whether the objectives are achieved. If the unit is working hard but not delivering the internal requests or the demand, then it is not effective. The best way to asses effectiveness is to set out the objectives before the project kicks-off or activities are initiated and see if they were achieved under the standards set at the beginning. Efficiency includes the concepts dont work hard, work smart, less is more and usage of optimal resources and effort to achieve a given task. Economy relates to the cost.
On the other hand, equitable development should be the target of any rural development programme. There are four essential components necessary for equitable development:
i. Participation  people need to be involved in programmes or schemes which aim to address the difficult situations they are in.
ii. Inclusion  the poor, women and children, and disadvantaged communities should be included in the programmes.
iii. Accountability  authorities have to explain why certain decisions were taken or not taken and then have to face the consequences, as well. Further, accountability is the obligation of power-holders to take responsibility for their actions. For example, citizens grant powers to their government to tax, to spend and to enact and enforce laws and policies. In return, citizens expect the government to explain and justify its use of power and to take corrective measures when needed.
iv. Transparency  transparency is necessary to enforce accountability and also help with participation.
These four essential components can enhance development outcomes and progress towards the achievement of human development by strengthening links between implementers and beneficiaries, which, in most rural development programmes in Sri Lanka, are the government and citizens respectively. If participation, inclusion, accountability and transparency can be ensured in rural development programmes, the following results and impacts would not be difficult: improving the focus of public service delivery; monitoring government performance and fostering responsive governance;emphasising the needs of vulnerable groups in policy formulation and implementation; demanding transparency and exposing government failure and corruption; facilitating effective links between citizens and local governments in the context of de-centralisation; and empowering marginalised and vulnerable groups traditionally excluded from policy processes.
However, ensuring these four essential components in a programme is a significant challenge. Therefore, effective monitoring and evaluation which are integral tools for managing and assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of investments are vital for tracking and measuring results and throwing light on the impact of development interventions. At the same time, monitoring and evaluation of programme or project performances, outcomes and impacts has been also a significant challenge. In this context, the social audit is one of the social accountability tools that promotes all of the above.
Social auditing
Social audit is a process that is conducted by the people, especially by those people who are affected by or are the intended beneficiaries of the programme or scheme being audited and facilitated by the government or the implementers. Further, social auditing is a tool that can be employed to identify and measure the progress and challenges to stakeholders who are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability in commitments and performances.
In the social auditing process, official records are compared against ground realities by the primary stakeholders and the findings are presented at a public platform. At the same time, social auditing does not merely consist in examining costs and finance. The central concern of a social audit is how resources are used for social objectives.
Therefore, seven main objectives can be identified in social auditing:
i. educating people or beneficiaries about objectives of the programme or scheme and about their rights and responsibilities;
ii. proactive disclosure of information;
iii. promoting public participation in all stages such as planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation;
iv. facilitating an accountable administration;
v. minimising corruption;
vi. providing a platform for people to collectively articulate their views and grievances; and
vii. providing valuable feedback about the status of implementation.
Further, there are seven main steps in conducting a social audit:
i. collecting information;
ii. processing the information so that it is simple to understand;
iii. sharing and verifying the information with the ground reality and collect grievances, if any;
iv. public disclosure with the participation of the public, government officials, and representatives from the implimenting party on the findings of the audit;
v. action by appropriate authorities based on the social audit findings;
vi. informing stakeholders about the actions taken; and
vii. using the findings to make relevant policy or programme changes if any, acording to the demands of the community or beneficiries.
At the same time, though it is desirable to conduct social audits in development programmes, it is necessary to institutionalise social auditing to make it a reality. The two main aspects in institutionalising are facilitation and funding.
Social audits are widely conducted in India and the following section presents how they have institutionalised the conducting of social audits. Details of some of their programmes which have social audits are also presented.
Lessons from India
In the Indian context, the following actions have been taken to ensure the conduct of social audits in their development programmes. The state government has established an independent organisation called Social Audit Unit to facilitate social audits and resource persons recruited by the Social Audit Unit facilitate social audits with identified beneficiaries. These social audit facilitators are trained to empower the poor, vulnerable and socially excluded communities or beneficiaries and they should be sensitive to those issues.
Further, they ensure that the social audit process is independent of other processes and make sure that the implementing agency does not interfere with the conduct of the social audit, other than providing information. At the same time, the resource persons deployed for facilitating the social audit are not the residents of the same village or city. In addition, there is a financial allocation from the administrative cost of the respective programme or scheme to meet the cost of conducting social audits.
Further, some of the programmes or schemes implemented in India have legally mandated social audits in their programmes and following are proof of such programmes:
i. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act passed in 2005 was the first Act to make social audit mandatory, to be done by the Gram Sabha.
ii. Every local authority or any other authority or body as may be authorised by the state government shall conduct or cause to be conducted periodic social audits on the functioning of fair price shops, Targeted Public Distribution System and other welfare schemes and publicise its findings and take necessary actions in such manner as may be prescribed by the state government.
iii. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016) stated that the appropriate government shall undertake social audit of all general schemes and programmes involving persons with disabilities to ensure that the scheme and programmes do not have an adverse impact upon the persons with disabilities and that the programmes meet the requirements and concerns of persons with disabilities.
As discussed, social audits can be done for any scheme or programme. However, it is particularly practised in the context of poverty alleviation programmes and is a tool that empowers and gives voice to the poor, vulnerable and socially excluded communities.
In this context, it is desirable to include a component on Social Audit in rural development programmes. Therefore, the aim of this article is to create awareness among programme or project designers and implementers and even the public on the concept of social auditing and its importance in achieving the intended benefits of the development projects or programmes.

Speaker under microscope
A complaint was lodged at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) yesterday stating that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has abused his position.
The complaint was filed by the National University Lecturers Association. It states that the Speaker has abused his post as per the Article 70 of the Bribery Act by first stating that he accepts Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and then issuing a statement which says that he accepts Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.
Open University Law Faculty Dean Dr. Raja Gunaratne explained that the Article 70 of the Act says that if any public officer uses the powers vested in his post to act in a manner that gives a benefit or advantage to another person it amounts to corruption.
He also said that the Act is clear that a person who is guilty of the above offence could be subjected to maximum 10 years jail sentence. He said the Speaker and the officers have to execute the orders of the President as per the penalty article two of the Parliament Privileges Act. As he has contravened this provision, the Speaker has committed the offence of abusing his post, he added.
Association Secretary Prof. Channa Jayasumana said the recent conduct of the Speaker has led to serious doubts. The Law Faculty lecturers in the Association said legal action could be instituted in this regard. Therefore we submitted this complaint to the Bribery Commission. We have doubts as to why the Speaker changed his stance within a few days. He could have done so under pressure of some other party or to get an ulterior advantage or due to aging. However, such contradictory statements are against the Constitution, ethics, traditions and the aspirations of the majority of people. Therefore we hope that the complaint will soon be investigated and legal action be taken, he added.
Ven.Maduluwe Dhammissara thera and Dr. Nemsiri Jayathilake of the Association also participated.

SRI LANKA  A MOMENT OF RECKONING
Had those in the Good Governance Coalition given serious thought to the contradictions they were experiencing and the difficulties encountered in running the countrys democratic administration, their tragedy would not have happened. The Good Governance government should have known better how to conduct its affairs in patience and wisdom realizing that parties in coalition are multiple and that there needs to be cooperation and collaboration in all fronts to keep their governance stable. Coalitions always run the risk of breakdowns unless the parties involved are ready to keep steady despite difficulties and differences they might eventually encounter in running a government together.
This is evident given the fact that parties in coalition are always from different political persuasions and they need to some extent compromise and find common course of action in the interest of the common good of the people whom they are striving to serve thus creating an even field. Politics is no game for politicians only to play as they want with scant attention to the sorry plight of the people. They are elected representatives to care to their interests.
Political leadership
Sovereignty rests in the people: the country belongs to the people. Politicians represent the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the people. It is them that they represent in the august chambers of democracy: the parliament and the Cabinet on the national level. One must argue convincingly about their commitment to work for the common good of the citizens, irrespective of all differences.
Sri Lanka has seen diverse vicissitudes of politics of all hue and colour for the last seven decades of her national life. It has taken stock of the turnings and twisting of political leadership that often times left the people in utter confusion and anger on the one hand, and on the other, insincerity, lack of authenticity, bribery, lying, cheating and corruption kept deranging the nations march towards prosperity and progress. Those who wielded power at the expense of the peoples vote must render an account for this national disaster.
Many lament the shocking speed at which Sri Lanka had deteriorated in the last few decades in comparison with other Asian countries who have prospered by leaps and bounds. Once in the dust of ashes, they have now risen to be economic giants in the continent. Their forward-march will indeed impact the international scene in the decades to come.
We have had serious problems during this post-independence period. The most crucial was the ethnic tensions that conflagarated in violence many a time. These were black events. One remembers the ethnic riots of the late fifties that eventually led, little by little to an armed conflict that struck this poor country which could not afford dumping its little resources on heavy arms. We are not a country trained for war or a war-type culture or ethic. Our religions abhor violence and destruction of life and property. It is the dhamma-deepa of non-violence and metta, this august historical seat of Theravada Buddhism that we are so proud of. How come, it has turned to be a land of cheating, lying, fraud, violence and confrontation many a time How come our politicians have grown to be a breed of irresponsible leaders who dare squander the assets of this beautiful country graced with so much of natural resources and an impeccable culture of our noble people How come that politics in this country had gone in the wrong direction of party-politics that confuses our people even today
When they read our newspapers, the common man in the village and in the fields will go into tantrums of confusion not knowing what is happening to their dear motherland! May be those in the cities and those in high ranks of the social class will conveniently overlook this plethora of media reports and just turn a blind eye to the events that have overtaken us.
Unstable governments
This country has had serious set-backs from the time of the short-lived SWRD epoch that despite its seductive socialism was rocked by a number of hartals and strikes destabilizing the normal functioning of a peoples government. Then came a period of lull but yet with unstable governments. Finally came the poor era of the 1970s to be quickly overturned by one of open economy, free-trade zones and accelerated hydro schemes. While there were no multiple mega-projects, the Premadasa-era brought economic projects and awakening to the villages to be matched with a fitting educational programme to the rural youth. In the meanwhile, the ethnic conflict raised its head once again and devoured this country for three-decades. It was a time of utter disaster and catastrophe to the island nation.
It brewed through a terribly misguided ethnic and language policy.
Our good name was scarred in the inter-national scene and the war-crimes charge was hailed at us, an issue over which we are still battling for clearing our name.
With people unsteady with their choice at the ballot, two major parties decided to form a national government in order to wrest the country of the economic crisis, political instability and work hard to regain the lost name in the international scene. This succeeded to some extent. But much of the bribery and corruption within the country could not be tackled and ideological differences within the leaders of the national government became so intense that radical changes were carried out in the seats of power.
The normal affairs of the government in maintaining peace and order in public life have to be secured. The political leaders at the helm must act with restraint and with immense wisdom and foresight so that the country does not plunge into a worse state of disaster. As soon as possible, the confusion had to be taken head-on and with great humility on the part of everyone. This is not the time to fish in troubled waters. Many pundits will come out with a plethora of opinions presuming to solve the riddle. At this moment, common sense and love for the country must take primacy among all: politicians and the masses at large. Both these sectors are responsible to bring back peace, order, harmony and prosperity to the motherland.
All right-thinking citizens must become aware and understand the serious nature of the crisis that has overtaken us. While the political leaders have to cease playing games, the civil organisations and the religious leadership of the country must intervene to indicate the proper path to tackle the crisis.
Nothing can be achieved with political instability and an ailing economy. A sound economy cannot be built with a status-quo experiencing constant political instability. One depends on the other. This is the twin-challenge that politicians and people at large face today.
The choice is ours to patiently and wisely tackle this phenomenon.
The hour has come for a serious reckoning. Beyond all petty vested interests and greed for power, this is the moment to act with a sense of responsibility inspired by a true patriotic love and concern for the good of the motherland.
If all act tactfully and prudently, the constitutional crisis can be transformed into a moment of opportunity.

England takes command of first Test
Sri Lanka batsmen flounder against spin
GALLE, Wednesday: Sri Lankan batsmen put up a wretched batting performance against spin to hand to England a huge advantage in the first cricket Test played at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
After England were dismissed for 342 half an hour into the start of the second day with Ben Foakes scoring a hundred on his Test debut, Sri Lanka gave a spineless display to be bowled out for a disappointing 203 runs handing to England quite a handy first innings lead of 139.
By stumps England had increased their overall lead to 177 scoring 38 for no loss and are in the box seat to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match Test series.
Rory Burns who had earlier taken a blow on the back of his neck fielding at forward short leg showed that he had recovered from the injury to be unbeaten on 11 with Keaton Jennings his partner on 26.
Sri Lankas chances of exploiting the Galle pitch depended on gaining a first innings lead or getting as close to Englands total. But as it turned out it was the England spinners who dictated terms to the Lankan batsmen who were guilty of playing some loose strokes that led to their downfall. They gave a shocking display of batting on a surface which they could have built on a sizeable first innings total.
Apart from the first two wickets that of openers Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva that were claimed by the two pacies James Anderson and Sam Curran the rest of the Lankan wickets were consumed by Englands three-pronged spin attack of Moeen Ali (4/66), Jack Leach (2/41) and Adil Rashid (2/30).
The only noteworthy innings for Sri Lanka was Angelo Mathews half century. He stuck it out for 142 minutes and 122 balls for 52 which comprised three fours. The next highest scorer for Sri Lanka was skipper Dinesh Chandimal who hobbled his way to 33 off 72 balls and did not take the field when England batted in their second innings.
The pair put on the only partnership of substance 75 for the fifth wicket after which there was hardly any resistance.
Following Mathews dismissal at 136, Sri Lanka lost five wickets for 67 their lower order unable to replicate what the England batsmen had done. Englands last five wickets contributed 239 runs.
Herath playing in his final Test match was applauded by the England players when he came to bat at no. 11 and after the Lankan innings ended Joe Root the England skipper went across to shake hands with him in a wonderful gesture of camaraderie.
When play began on the second day the focus was on Foakes getting to his hundred on Test debut. Unbeaten on 87 overnight It took him just 16 balls to get there with a four straight past the bowler Suranga Lakmal to become only the second England wicket-keeper after Matt Prior to do so and overall the 20th Englishman to make a century on debut.
Foakes was last out for 107 scored off 202 balls with 10 fours, falling to Lakmal who ended up with three wickets and to round off a memorable day for him he also affected three dismissals (2 ct, 1 st) behind the wickets during the Lankan innings.
Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera was Sri Lankas most successful bowler taking 5 for 75  his seventh five-for and first against England.
All the forecast of bad weather was thrown out of the window when the sun shone brightly throughout the day and provided a hot and humid day on the field for an ideal game of Test cricket that was lapped up by the large English audience that outnumbered the locals.
There was support for England not only inside the stadium but also from the ramparts of the historic Galle Fort where several took up positions braving the hot sun to witness Englands dominance.

Stable outlook for sovereign  creditworthiness in 2019
The outlook for sovereign creditworthiness in 2019 is stable, balancing the global economies continued but slowing growth momentum against rising uncertainty over longer-term economic and financial stability, Moodys Investors Service said in a report today.
Although a number of risks could affect credit conditions over the next 12 to 18 months, three-quarters of the 138 sovereigns that Moodys rates currently have a stable outlook and 15 hold a positive outlook. Nineteen sovereigns have a negative outlook, compared to 22 years ago.
The report, Sovereigns -- Global, 2019 outlook still stable, but slowing growth signals increasingly diverging prospects, is available on www.moodys.com. Moodys subscribers can access the report using the link at the end of this press release. The research is an update to the markets and does not constitute a rating action.
Our stable outlook for sovereign ratings in 2019 balances the benefits of continued global growth against emerging domestic and geopolitical risks, said Alastair Wilson, Moodys Managing Director  Global Sovereign Risk. Despite the stable outlook overall, we are more mindful than in previous years of the potential for unforeseen shocks to disrupt economic and financial stability over the next 12-18 months.
Moodys expects G-20 growth to peak in 2018 at 3.3% before slowing to 2.9% in 2019. For advanced economies in the G-20, Moodys believes growth will fall to 1.9% in 2019 from 2.3% in 2018, a pattern that is mirrored in key economies, including the US and Germany.
Slowing growth means that the window for global sovereigns to address longstanding credit challenges - including high levels of public and private debt, as well as longer-term trends related to ageing and inequality - is closing.
High debt, falling growth and rising rates expose sovereigns to the risk of shocks that undermine debt affordability and sustainability. A number of emerging and frontier markets are particularly exposed to tightening global financial conditions and rising US trade protectionism.
Around the world, the longer-run credit trajectory for sovereigns will depend on the success of reform efforts that address these vulnerabilities.
As in previous years, the potential for disruptive domestic or geopolitical events poses the greatest tail risk.
Geopolitical risks could have implications beyond a particular countrys economic and fiscal fundamentals and affect cross-border capital flows and thus funding conditions for many sovereigns.
Geopolitical risk is a broad category that encompasses US trade and foreign policy which poses an increasingly far-reaching threat to global confidence and growth; conflict on the Korean peninsula; regional conflict in the Middle East; and ostensibly domestic political events, including Brexit and recent events in Italy.

TNA must adopt neutral stance  for benefit of Tamils - Minister
It is best if the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) adopts a neutral stance when Parliament convenes, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
This will make it easier for us to build support for a political solution to the national question in future, he said.
As each party counts the numbers in favour of them, the TNA with 15 members hold an envious position in Parliament. Last week however, TNA spokesperson M.Sumanthiran stated that they would support a No Confidence Motion against PM Mahinda Rajapaksa. Yesterday, they met President Sirisena to convey their stance and informed the President that they would oppose the new Prime MInister.
There are one or two MPs within the TNA taking forward the agenda of the UNP because they want to enter Parliament through the UNP National List. But others are speaking with us, Jayasekara said addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road.
He noted that President Sirisena was elected by votes from all communities and the SLFP had always been clear on their stance when it came to a new Constitution, But the UNP has not put forward their proposals on the Constitution, so it is the UNP which is tricking the Tamil people.
He believed that it was only President Sirisena and PM Rajapaksa who could bring about a long term political solution to the national question because the majority Sinhalese would listen to accept them more, The people know that the President and Prime Minister wont betray the country unlike Ranil Wickremesinghe.
If the TNA goes to fulfill the mandate of the UNP, there will be a lot of opposition in the South against it. If they support Ranil Wickremesinghe here, we will not be able to raise our hands for any Tamil issue in future. It is better for them to be neutral here. We are ready to take action to increase understanding between communities and support a resolution.
The main problem TNA has is to deal with the grievances of the Tamil people, it is not Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mahinda Rajapaksa or Maithripala Sirisena, they need to resolve the national question, and they need the support of all, he added.
The President is still Maithripala Sirisena and as long as they remain neutral now, we can in future support their programme.

## Title: A true friend of Sri Lanka

A true friend of Sri Lanka
Lord Naseby Michael Morris or Lord Naseby, as he is known in Sri Lanka, a longstanding friend of this country, both in fair and foul weather, has once again spoken out in Sri Lankas interest. In the wake of the current political developments and President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to appoint as the new Prime Minister former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Lord Naseby has gone to great lengths to defend Sri Lanka against the voices in his country critical of the move.
He has urged the British Government not to be hasty in condemning the Presidents decision which was purely an internal matter in the domestic political scene. This was after some members of the House of Commons from the Conservative Party took up the issue of Sri Lanka during its regular sessions and described the Presidents move as unconstitutional. He (Lord Naseby) airing his views by a Tweet was of the opinion that it was not for foreigners to interpret the Sri Lankan Constitution and that he was certain that President Maithripala Sirisena, as the President, acted in the best interest of the country.
As far as I can see, nothing unconstitutional has happened. It is unusual, yes but we have had unusual things in the UK. We were supposed to have a five year fixed term, but it was cut short, he tweeted. He also condemned the action of a junior Member of UK Parliament, Hugo Swire for raising the issue of Sri Lanka in the UK Parliament. It is not up to a foreigner to decide whether it is constitutional or not. I am unhappy that a British junior minister stated it was unconstitutional. That is not the role of UK Parliamentarians, he asserted.
Hopefully, Lord Nasebys position with the regard to the political developments in Sri Lanka would persuade the critics in the West to observe things in better perspective. We are a sovereign nation and this should be respected by those who are seeking to interfere in the countrys affairs.
Obviously, Lord Naseby has not lent his opinion on the Sri Lankan issue at random but after closely studying the developments and also taking into consideration expert opinion given in this regard. As a close Sri Lanka watcher he, no doubt, would be receiving his own inputs and has aired his views weighing all the pros and cons. That he has been continually keeping his pulse on the happenings in Sri Lanka was amply explained from the manner in which he debunked the charges in the Darusman report that claimed that as much as 40,000 civilians could have been killed in the war by the Forces.
Lord Nasebys stand on Sri Lanka should be viewed in the context where the country has always been a target of the West. The West has always made it its business to harangue this country on alleged human rights violations, practices of good government and now, if some British MPs conduct is anything to go by, the constitutionality or otherwise of the appointment of the new Prime Minister. It is a matter for regret that none of our envoys in the Western countries has been up to the task of setting the record straight and giving the true picture to the outside world. This was clearly seen during the war years where they signally failed to defend the country against blatantly false allegations spread by the LTTE.
It was left to a British national in the form of Lord Naseby to perform the task of our paid diplomats to wash off the black stains attached to this country. It appears that presently too this task has been undertaken by him, at least in his own backyard. For that all Sri Lankans, irrespective of political affiliations, should be grateful to Lord Naseby for, as a British subject, he is fighting for the cause of Sri Lanka in his own country.
Like he opined, it is not for Britain or British MPs to dwell on the Sri Lankan Constitution unless our former colonial masters still harbour the belief that the Sun has not set on the Empire. This is not the first occasion that foreign interference in Sri Lankas domestic politics had been witnessed. There was the famous Gladstone incident in the early nineties. David Gladstone, Britains High Commissioner to Sri Lanka went to extent of entering a polling booth while the Local Government election was in progress apparently to elicit proof that the election was being rigged by which he hoped to portray to the world that democracy was being undermined in this country. Quite rightly he was shown the door by President R. Premadasa.
Of course the British MPs attacks in the House of Commons are certain to be sweet music in the ears of the UNP leader whose pro-Western stance is only all too well known. Lord Naseby would certainly not win a popularity contest with the Greens who are now hell bent on enlisting the support of all Western Governments to bail out their beleaguered leader.

The UNPs nemesis
With the powerful frontline leadership of the United National Party tragically obliterated Ranil Wickremesinghe by luck had the leadership fallen on his lap. JR Jayewardene and R. Premadasa consolidated the power of the UNP with a strong support base to be the strongest single political party in the country, with Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Atulatmudali as protgs to follow. But fate deemed otherwise.
When the UNP with one seat less to claim a power in Parliament at the 1994 General Elections then incumbent young Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe without even of a semblance of a fight to retain power threw in the towel and surreptitiously left the Temple Trees leaving the UNPers aghast. CBK became Prime Minister and thereafter President thanks to the LTTE deciding the outcome by assassinating Gamini Dissanayake.
Six-year reign of Chandrika Kumaratunga
During the six-year reign of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga the economic development rate plunged to below zero and the war with the LTTE took a disastrous turn leaving the country in turmoil. With no other option people elected the UNP under Ranil in 2000. It was a most difficult situation and in fairness to Ranil, he had to refloat a sinking economy. Although considered a complete giveaway to the LTTE the Peace Accord gave a much-needed breathing space to the people and unintendedly though did become a significant factor contributing to the ultimate defeat of LTTE.
Ranils stringent economic measures to better the economy which did seem to go beyond the already unbearable limits and arrogance in governance, suspicions on the motives of the Norwegian brokered Peace Accord did make him despised among the people at large. Those who most suffered were the UNPers whose expectations of jobs and compensation for victimization under the previous regime were completely ignored.
The threat of CBK capitalizing on the situation was becoming clear and imminent which Ranil in his own wisdom wished to ignore even grounding the moves to impeach her. CBK took back two important Ministries and dissolved Parliament in 2002.
New Prime Minister
The UNP had to wait 13 years to come back to power again under similar circumstances that pervaded in 2000. When Maithripala Sirisena became President in January 2015 Ranil should have had the Parliament dissolved in the wake of President Sirisenas election to maximize the UNP victory and form a UNP Government. Instead, he flirted crowning himself as the Prime Minister of a Yahapalanaya coalition with a UNP minority in Parliament, which exercise has boomeranged on him cited as a precedent by the new PM and his advocates.
Sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 26 as Prime Minister was similar to what floored him in 2002 by President CBK. Ranil never seemed to learn or to regret his mistakes. A person with an iota of intelligence saw what was coming to his Premiership in his uncompromising feud with the President.
Ranil in his naivety and complacence wrapped in arrogance failed to sense the very obvious that was unfolding. His stupidity did push the President Sirisena to act as he did rightly or wrongly plunging the country into a precarious situation.
Ranil Wickremesinghe has tragically ridiculed the dignity of the great political party. Under Ranils uninspiring leadership since 1994, for nearly 25 years, UNP has been in the opposition for nearly 20 years with Ranil failing to hold on to power for more than two years on the first occasion he was entrusted by default of the CBK government in 2000 and now for not more than three years. He has cunningly insulated himself from being sacked needing a revolt within.
Under him, the erosion of the support base of the UNP has reached enormous proportions.
For the sake of the country and the Party, Ranil must necessarily quit now and handover leadership for a rejuvenation of the Party to rise again, for the future is more than an enormous challenge for the new Cabinet to fulfil promises being made to the people.

Unpardonable conduct,  says Kamer Nizamdeen
Twenty-six-year-old Kamer Nizamdeen who obtained the support of many after being wrongfully accused and arrested under the terrorism law in Australia, spoke of his ordeal and revealed that there may be a collateral reason in the way his arrest was orchestrated.
Kamer who has been cleared of all charges and granted permanent residency, says the Australian police may have been biased as he was an Asian on a student visa and would not have been able to defend himself.
Nowhere in the world would you have had the media circus which immediately followed my wrongful arrest and a press conference by the NSW Joint Counterterrorism team under acting Superintendent Michael Sheehy. There was obviously a collateral reason for all of this, he said. I strongly believe this happened because I am an Asian on a student visa and detective Darrine Eljarrar had the wrong impression that I did not have the resources to defend or declare my innocence.
Kamer narrated how he was charged and cast into AA Category confinement which is the highest category in Australia which meant that suspects would have no access to lawyers or family. It took six days for my lawyers to contact me. I was in the supermax prison in solitary confinement for six days which is a violation of basic human and fundamental rights.
It had taken Kamers family a month to make contact with him. AFP and the NSW Police and authorities are responsible for the unpardonable conduct and irreparable damage which cannot be warranted, he said.
He also revealed that Arsalan Khawaja is a person of interest in the ongoing investigation. He was one of Kamers supervisors at the University of New South Wales.
The line of investigation now is that Arsalan Khawaja was the person who either manufactured or produced the document with incriminating content.
Kamer however said that it was surprising that this person has not been charged or locked up in the same supermax prison or treated in the same way he was. He was only named as a person of interest and his house was raided. Therefore, on the same piece of evidence there are two different investigation processes.
The only piece of evidence for which Kamer was wrongfully arrested was a spiral notebook which belonged to him, but was not in his possession at the time of the arrest.
It was discovered in an office space on a different floor that Kamer had not been working on for nearly a month. Right from the inception, he had denied the handwriting.
However, Kamer had been detained for 14 days without charges and two handwriting experts had later proved that the notes in the book were not his handwriting.
The whole saga has ruined my future and I have returned to Sri Lanka to carry on my life. The ordeal has left me shattered and all I can think of is to raise my voice and stand in support of other victims of injustice who stand wrongfully accused by any system, he said.

UPFA to take action ,if Speaker continues to act beyond what his role permits - MP Dayasiri
UPFA MP Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday warned that if Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was to continue to act beyond what his role permitted, the UPFA would be forced to take action against him in accordance with existing Parliamentary procedures.
Addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters at Darley Road, the MP stressed that in no instance has a Speaker previously commented or released a statement on the prorogation of Parliament, thus clearly showing the
bias of the incumbent Speaker. The Sri Lankan Parliament has been prorogued on 42 instances from the time of it first being established.
Moreover, Jayasekara noted that the Speaker could not legally accept a motion to bring in a No Confidence Motion when Parliament has been prorogued.
He can only accept such a motion once Parliament is convened. And it is only the President who has the powers to convene Parliament and this is clearly stated in the Constitution, he said.
The Speaker, acting beyond his role is meeting ambassadors and has unfortunately become a pawn in a conspiracy hatched by the West and NGOs, he noted.
By trying to show that there is unrest and instability in this country, he is only playing into their hands.
Stop doing this. We however know he is being pressurised and threatened by the UNP to act thus.
Speaking on democracy, he noted that no one spoke out when former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed in 2015 as the PM with just 47 MPs in Parliament and the JVP did not question the prorogation of Parliament when former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did it in 2004.
Jayasekara asked that all those who had a problem with the way the Constitution is being interpreted should seek an opinion from the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court has the powers to interpret the Constitution.
So no one can say that we have done something illegal.

WAITING FOR THE RED-LETTER DAY
Sri Lankas Parliament will be the cynosure of all eyes when it is reconvened next Wednesday, November 14 as the country grapples with a constitutional riddle triggered by the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister of a new government by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The current political storm began when, in a surprise move, President Sirisena swore in Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in a ceremony that was conducted without much fanfare on Friday, October 26. At the same time, President Sirisena informed Ranil Wickremesinghe that he had been relieved of his duties.
President Sirisena informed Wickremesinghe that he has acted in accordance with Article 42(4) of the Constitution which states that The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.
Removal of the Prime Minister
Wickremesinghe however disputes this and maintains that he is still the Prime Minister of the country, arguing that the Constitution, as amended by the 19th Amendment, does not have provisions for the removal of the Prime Minister by the President, unless through a vote of no confidence in Parliament.
Subsequently political developments have moved at a brisk pace, overshadowing the constitutional debate over the Premiership. Much of it was triggered by President Sirisena also moving to prorogue Parliament on Saturday, October 27, a day after Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new Prime Minister.
The Presidents position has been that, with the removal of Wickremesinghe from office, the Cabinet that existed at the time ceased to function. Accordingly, several new Cabinet ministers were sworn in. Arguably the most significant portfolio was the Finance Ministry, assigned to Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Twelve ministers were sworn initially. Among those who were sworn in were two ministers from the United National Party (UNP): Vasantha Senanayake was sworn in as Minister of Tourism and Wildlife while Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was sworn in as Minister of Education and Higher Education.
By then, two other UNP parliamentarians, Vadivel Suresh and Ananda Aluthgamage had broken ranks with the UNP. They were appointed as State Minister of Plantation Industries and Deputy Minister of Tourism and Wildlife respectively in an indication that more crossovers were pending.
On October 30, Ratnapura District UNP parliamentarian, Dunesh Gankanda was sworn in as the State Minister of Environment. Minutes prior to his swearing in, Gankanda was on social media, hailing the UNPs rally protesting Wickremesinghes removal which was taking place at Kollupitiya in Colombo.
A day later on November 1, two more Cabinet ministers and five state ministers were sworn in. Significantly, Duminda Dissanayake was sworn in as Minister of Irrigation, Water resources and Disaster Management. Dissanayake is known to have differences with Rajapaksa for many years.
Since then, several others have joined the new government. Among them are S.B. Navinna who was appointed as Minister of Cultural Affairs and Regional Development and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP S. Viyalendiran who assumed duties as Deputy Minister of Regional Development.
Joint Opposition
On Sunday, the first ministers from the Joint Opposition (JO), apart from Rajapaksa, were sworn in. They were Dinesh Gunewardena, as Minister of Megapolis and Western Development and Vasudeva Nanayakkara, sworn in as Minister of National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages.
At the same ceremony, another JO stalwart, Keheliya Rambukwella was sworn in as State Minister of Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure while another UNP parliamentarian, Ashoka Priyantha took oaths as Deputy Minister of Cultural and Internal Affairs and Wayamba Regional Development.
Meanwhile, there has been robust debate about the constitutionality of President Sirisenas actions in dismissing Wickremesinghe and appointing Rajapaksa as well as his decision to prorogue Parliament where it has been convention- but not a requirement- that it be done in consultation with the Speaker.
The major political parties- the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the United National Party and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have all held public rallies at Battaramulla, Kollupitiya and Nugegoda respectively presenting their case to the masses. All rallies were quite well attended.
A tense situation arose when former Minister Arjuna Ranatunga visited the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation premises. In the ensuing melee, it is alleged that Ranatungas bodyguard opened fire, resulting in a persons death.
Ranatunga was subsequently arrested and then released on bail. Investigators are now probing the incident and television footage of the incident is being analysed. Fortunately, despite the high intensity political drama, this has been the only serious incident thus far that led to a loss of life.
Reconvening Parliament
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has held discussions with President Sirisena on reconvening Parliament. Jayasuriya stated that the President advised him that Parliament would be convened on November 7, but since then, a gazette notification to this effect has set the date a week later, on November 14.
Jayasuriya has also issued a statement stating that he was compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that the new political alliance proves their majority in Parliament. While the UNP and the JVP have hailed this statement, the government called it unconstitutional.
Jayasuriyas statement came after parliamentarians from the UNP, JVP and the TNA met him formally and requested that Parliament be reconvened. However, constitutional provisions prevent Jayasuriya from acting arbitrarily and convening Parliament as this power is vested with the President.
Jayasuriya also faces obstacles from with the staff of Parliament itself. Parliament staff led by its Secretary General and Seargent-at-arms have indicated that they are bound by the gazette notification issued by the President and have to make seating arrangements in Parliament accordingly.
There have been other interesting developments in this political saga. UNP parliamentarian Palitha Range Bandara accused the government of attempting to bribe him to join their ranks. Bandara released an audio tape of a conversation with S. B. Dissanayake which has gone viral on social media.
It is clear that there is a numbers game on with both the government and the UNP, now the de facto opposition, scrambling to obtain the support of 113 parliamentarians, the number that would be required to demonstrate a majority in the legislature. Both sides claim they have this number of MPs.
With six days to before Parliament is formally reconvened, there will no doubt be plenty of drama on both sides of the political divide.

Walk for rights
Elderly citizens all over the world have a firm belief that the month of October belong to them. During this month, many elders not only in our country but in another 96 countries where HelpAge partners and affiliated organizations are established have engaged in various activities to raise awareness on elders issues, demanding their rights and entitlements for them to live with dignity.
Although the UN declared October 1 as the `International Day of Older Persons many elders organizations in our country celebrate it throughout the month.
HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL), one of the oldest organizations in our country that was established in 1986 by the late H. P. Gooneratne with the objective of providing eye care, medical care facilities and many other projects to empower the underprivileged elders, conducted its annual `Elders Walk on a grand scale at Nuwara Eliya recently.
The ceremony was conducted by HelpAge with the assistance of the `Age Demand Action campaign programme of the HelpAge International, UK and supported by the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariet and the Berendina Development Services.
An unexpected number of over 1,500 elderly citizens, mainly estate workers between the age group of 60 to 85 years in Nuwara Eliya and surrounding areas keenly participated in the walk despite the cold breeze and the mist that enveloped throughout the town during the day.
The walk was witnessed by school children, general public and tourists who were at Nuwara Eliya Town at the time.
Elders shouted slogans and also displayed placards demanding their rights and entitlements. They also took part in fun-filled activities such as singing and dancing.
HASL, Chairman, Tilak de Zoysa said ageing is a challenge in today's world and celebrating the `International Day of Older Persons is an opportunity to highlight the important contributions that older people made to the society.
HelpAge, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge who also keenly participated in the walk highlighted that it displayed the courage and strength of elders and said HelpAge conducts Free Cataract Surgeries at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta and Mobile Eye Care camps countrywide for underprivileged citizens. Elders also took part in programmes at Cinisita Cultural Hall, Nuwara Eliya after the walk.

Water balance study of Kala Oya underway
The Irrigation Ministry will conduct a complete water balance study regarding the Kala Oya river basin.
The irrigation Department has entrusted the project to Actkins Engineering Agency to carry out the water balance study.
The program coordinator of the Irrigation Departments Water Management and Training unit Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said the Kala Oya basin is the third longest river in Sri Lanka.
It is about 145 km in length. Kala Oya joins the sea at Gangewadiya in Wilpattu National Sanctuary. It covers about 2,870 square kilometres. The area falls within two agro - ecological regions that receive a relatively low rainfall with high seasonal and spatial variations.
The lowest occurrence of rainfall has been from June to August while the highest rainfall was received during the Maha season from October to December.
In the dry zone, over two- thirds of the annual rainfall received from October to December, the mean annual rainfall, varies from 1,700 mm at the high elevation in southeastern end of the basin and gradually drops to 1,200 mm towards the northwestern part of the basin.
With the increase in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the area, the government has given priority to cover the entire basin with pipe-borne water supply schemes.
The upper part of Kala Oya basin falls within the Matale district and the middle reach falls within the Anuradhapura and Kurunegala districts while the lower reach is located in the Puttalam district.
Anuradhapura and Puttalam being the districts in the dry zone which faces a huge water scarcity most of the time during a year, finding suitable water sources for various needs has become a major challenge.
Kala Oya, being one of the longest rivers, which flows through the two districts, is the only possible water source to be used in multifaceted requirements of the people.
The priority of water allocation in a basin is first to meet the drinking water requirement followed by ecological, irrigation and other demands.
Palugaswewa said the overall objective of the proposed water balance study is to review the present state of water availability in the Kala Oya river basin and thereby to decide the possibility of extracting 69,300 cubic meters per day in total to fulfill the water supply demand of Eppawala, Rajanganaya, Nochchiyagama, Giribawa and Thambuttegama water supply schemes without compromising the water requirement of other water users in the region.
Specifically, this is to be achieved by conducting a detailed water balance study in the Kala Oya basin giving significant consideration to the present and future demand of all water users in the Kala Oya river basin including ecological demands, the Director (Water Management and Training) said.

Zaheer Khan set to replace Malinga  as bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians
Former Indian pacer Zaheer Khan can make his comeback to the Indian Premier League (IPL), as a coach of a franchise. As per a report in The Mumbai Mirror, he might be appointed as the bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians, taking the place of Lasith Malinga. The latter took over the job in the previous season after going unsold in the auction.
It is expected. Malinga has been playing other leagues of the world. He had even played for Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup, and he wants to test himself in the IPL which precedes the World Cup. He wants to play in the IPL to be match-fit for the World Cup, an IPL insider was quoted as saying by The Mumbai Mirror.
Should Zaheer join Mumbai Indians as the bowling mentor, it will be his maiden coaching assignment with any team. Although, he was the captain cum mentor at Delhi Daredevils during his stay at the franchise but was not the official mentor of the team.
A veteran of 92 Tests and 200 ODIs, Zaheer was expected to join the coaching staff of an IPL team in 2018 itself but that didnt happen. Next year, though, he might be a part of Mumbai Indians staff, a team which he represented in three editions.
Presently, the coaching staff of Mumbai Indians is headed by Mahela Jayawardene, who took over from Ricky Ponting ahead of IPL 2017.

Armys rehabilitation programme, a model for other nations
Since the end of the conflict, the Army has worked in the full spectrum of post-conflict military activities such as demining, resettlement of IDPs, socio-economic and infrastructure development for IDPs and the Tamil community in the former conflict areas.
A successful rehabilitation programme which rehabilitated over 12,000 ex-militants and their reintegration to the society has become a model for other nations in the region to follow, said Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, delivering the Colonel Henry Steel Olcott oration at Ananda College, Colombo.
Our commitment and expertise in these areas are visible through strong civil-military relationship, he said.
Through our experiences, we have introduced engagement and assistance policy to convince the people that the military is the best partner for sustainable peace and prosperity.
It is observed that eighty percent of the population in the conflicted area is with the military forces today. All these endeavours are aimed at preventing re-emerging of radical/ extremism movement, the Army Commander said.
On the topic, The Indo Pacific: The Region of Global Connection, the Army Commander said the region has emerged as one of the areas of geological, geo-strategic, economic, political and maritime prominence to the world.
Traditionally, the Indian Ocean region and the Asia-Pacific region were treated as two separate entities which span over two regions of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Now, there is an increasing tendency to consider these two areas as a single entity, he said.
The shift from Asia-pacific into Indo-Pacific has rekindled the geostrategic and geo-economic interest among many nations.
The Indo-Pacific region can be considered as the Center of Gravity for many converging interests.
These converging interests transcend from economic, geopolitical and security connection between Western Pacific and Indian Ocean region by making well-connected theatre of interest.
The region is also heavily militarized which includes seven of the 10 largest Armies and five of the world's declared nuclear nations are also located in the Indo-Pacific region, the Commander said.
He said the region has become a good marketplace in terms of consumers and investments.
A majority of the region's population boom will continue to occupy in major cities exacerbating demographic flow. The Indo-Pacific region is also acclaimed as "engine of global growth" since the world's most important trade route lies on the waters of Indian Ocean.
Due to the inherent diversity of the region, it encompasses uncertainty in many areas.
It evokes multiple strategic challenges in strategic, political and economic domains. Much of the challenges remain as non-traditional security threats.
However, nuclear deterrence and provocations among major powers have added much volatility into the challenges, the Army Commander added.

Butterflies, a harmless comment - Minister
The term butterflies used by President Maithripala Sirisena during the political rally at Battaramulla had no sexual connotation, Co-Cabinet spokesman, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday he said the word butterflies did not have any meaning related to the sexual orientation of a certain community.
The President meant only that a group of persons who rallied round the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had interfered with the work making it difficult for the President.
Minister Samarasinghe said former Minister Rajitha Senaratne had told a recent press briefing that he can be one of the butterflies mentioned by the President.
When the late Vijaya Kumaratunga was assassinated, Dr.Sarath Amunugama wrote an article to a newspaper and named the assassination as an assassination of a butterfly. Therefore the word butterfly can have many meanings than one.
Minister Samarasinghe said the word `leech should also be interpreted by the person who used it just like the word butterfly is interpreted. Co-Cabinet Spokesman andMass Media and Digital Infrastructure State Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said several projects launched by the previous Government was politicised after the United National Party (UNP) scored just 31 percent of votes during recent Local Government Election held in February this year.
The UNP MPs openly said their supporters should be given employment and all the other benefits in order to gain their votes at future elections. But President Sirisena ordered not to politicise any project and programmes. He instructed the honour of all graduates of Sri Lanka should be strictly protected and employment should not be given on political preferences.

Demand for cyber security jobs on the rise
The wide reach of technological usage and the increase in cyber attacks across the globe, highlights the importance of implementing a uniformed mechanism and uniformed rules of procedure, evidence in a bid to reduce security incidents, prevent IT crimes and most importantly to establish a culture of cyber security.
These sentiments were expressed by Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, at the 11th Annual National Conference on Cyber Security, held in Colombo Yesterday.
The 11th Annual National Cyber Security Conference is an annual event, organized by Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team | Coordination Centre (Sri Lanka CERT|CC) and Ministry of Telecommunication, Digital infrastructure and Foreign Employment.
Cyber crime threats would also certainly enhance the scope for cyber security jobs and the professionals to be involved in the system to ensure that all the stakeholders would have the benefits of a secure cyber world, Jayasuriya noted.
In 2015, Sri Lanka become a fully fledged member of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. He pointed out that hence it is essential to introduce a unformed mechanism and rules of procedure and evidence, while bringing all parties together under the umbrella of Budapest convention to mitigate the cyber security incidents. The convention further provides judicial officers, prosecutors and law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders with capacity building opportunities and also creates more opportunities for better understanding of all relevant areas that are required for an effective and efficient investigation and prosecution.
However having such mechanisms should not distract our attention from having a proper system of prevention. In 2015, the cost of data breaches globally reached US $ 59.6 billion mark, however in 2019 it is estimated that it will rise to US $ 2.1 trillion, Jayasuriya said.
There are certain challenges that one will have to face in mitigating the cyber security threats in Sri Lanka, he said adding that some of them can be identified as lack of awareness among citizens on cyber crimes, Lack of readiness among the stakeholders, Gaps in laws in relation to modern cyber crimes and lack of cooperation among the relevant stakeholders as well as countries.
Cyber security and provisions related to cyber security crimes are interconnected, he said adding that cyber security deals with prevention while provisions relating to cyber crimes would always take care of criminal justice aspects or the criminal justice response to the breaches of cyber security.
Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka has created the necessary policy framework to meet these challenges associated with cyber crimes thereby providing necessary tools to ensure gathering of electronic evidences and to obtain legal assistance.

Ill be able to say more when the movie comes out but there are a lot of very intimate moments for me in this movie that are like, that feel like theyre from my real life and like...its going to make me cry, but like songs specifically that I just gave her a spiel why this particular emotion or particular hurdle in my life was so important and what it taught me and she slid it seamlessly into the character, Bell said.

JVP shedding crocodile tears  about Parliament prorogation
Political analysts are pointing out that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) who did not talk anything about proroguing Parliament when they were in Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas government, is now shedding crocodile tears because they have become ardent supporters of the United National Party.
They also point out that JVP who has no proper understanding of the Constitution is causing a commotion to fulfill their own political agenda, while the President has acted within his powers and furthers that appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and proroguing Parliament have both been done within the powers vested by the Constitution to the President.
The political critics also state that the way JVP is acting, as if nothing happens according to the Constitution, which in fact the opposite, is utterly hilarious. They also state that JVP are seeking UNP support in an attempt to win one or two more seats in Parliament because they are politically up the creek without paddle.
In the history of Sri Lanka Parliament, this is not the first time that Parliament was prorogued but the 42nd time. According to the Information Department, from 1947 to 1978 it has been prorogued at 21 times and from 1978 to present 21 times. Accordingly Sri Lanka Parliament was prorogued for the first time in 31 January 1948 which lasted for 10 days.
According to Parliaments history, the most number of times that Parliament was prorogued was under then President J.R.Jayewardene rule. From 1978 to 1988, Parliament was prorogued on seven occasions of which four times have been for over four months, the Information Department points out.
Under President R. Premadasa, Parliament has been prorogued on four occasions and on three of these occasions the House was prorogued for nearly a month. Then, under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge Parliament was prorogued on five occasions. Interestingly, the longest period of prorogation was also reported under her term.
Under President Kumaratunge, Parliament was prorogued for 26 days, from July 10, 2001 to September 2001. Under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Parliament was prorogued on three occasions.
The shortest prorogation time is also reported during Rajapaksas term, which is two days.
Furthermore, the lowest number of prorogation period is recorded during the term of President Maithripala Sirisena. From last April 12, to May 8, Parliament was prorogued for 25 days and from October 27 to November 14, it has been prorogued for 17 days.

Making a brief speech, State Minister Gamage said the Maithri-Mahinda combine will fulfill peoples expectations and save the country from the economic crisis.
Putting an end to the era of short-sighted rulers, President Srisena has taken a brave decision to appoint a far-sighted people-friendly leader as the Prime Minister of the country, the State Minister said.
The reunion of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is a long-awaited expectation of the people of this country, he said. Members of Maha Sangha and other religious leaders, Secretary to the Women and Child Affairs Ministry, Ashoka Alawatte, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, UPFA General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, SLFP National Organiser, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake, several other Ministers and Parliamentarians participated in the occasion.

Only Presidents policy statement in Parliament on November 14
There wont be any vote for a no-confidence motion in Parliament or an opportunity to show the majority on November 14, on the day Parliament is to be reconvened, Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He was speaking at a media briefing at the Prime Ministers Office yesterday.
Abeywardena added that in accordance with the order paper of Parliament, there is no probability of any member bringing a no-confidence motion before Parliament or an opportunity to show the majority on the day Parliament is reconvened.
The Parliamentary order paper has only the policy statement of the President Maithripala Sirisena. The President will deliver the policy statement on November 14 before Parliament is prorogued again, he said.
After proroguing Parliament, the party leaders will prepare the order paper for the next day of Parliament, he added.
Asked why both leading political parties are making a big noise about showing a majority in Parliament, he said that there is no need of showing a majority as the Prime Minister has been appointed by the President under the powers vested in him by the Constitution.
However, there is a provision for a referendum to ascertain if the step taken by the President is constitutional. The power of voters is supreme and the voters can express their views at the referendum, he said.
When he was asked whether the government is hoping to seek a referendum after dissolving Parliament, he said that the government does not have such an intention, but there is a democratic provision to seek a referendum to ascertain whether the action of the President to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is legal and constitutional, Abeywardena said.
The opinion of people was seen on November 5 at the Parliament Roundabout. But if one needs to test the peoples power anymore, it can be tested by a referendum. However after two weeks from November 14, the situation will return to normal he said.
Parliamentarian Abeywardena added that added that Parliament will not be reconvened before the scheduled day on November 14, since only the President can reconvene Parliament.
Speaking on the present political situation in the country, he said Parliamentarian Manusha Nanayakkara who resigned from his portfolio has been resting with his family in a luxury hotel in Singapore spending a huge sum of money.
It can be imagined how and why a huge sum of money is being drained in this manner he added.
Abeywardena added that the activities of the government are in full swing now. Accordingly, all the sectors are functioning properly, he said.
Speaking on the behaviour of the Speaker, Abeywardena said they do not need a Speaker from Sirikotha. He added that the Speakers comments have to be regretted as previous Speakers never questioned the powers of the Executive Presidents. The Speaker as well as the international forces should understand that Sri Lanka has the Executive Powers and there is a Presidential system of government in our country.
When former Presidents such as the late R. Premadasa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga prorogued Parliament, the then Speakers did not question the powers of the President. Even when Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Prime Minister in 2015 without any majority, then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa did not question the decision, even though his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa lost his Prime Ministerial post. He acted impartially unlike this Speaker, he said.
He added that however, the government has no intention to change the posts of the Speaker and the Opposition Leader at this juncture.

Former ministers such as Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Sagala Ratnayake should join the majority in the Parliament or make a formal complaint at the Supreme Court without getting involved in illegal activities and acts of sabotage in order to mislead the public, Co-Cabinet Spokesman and State Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He was addressing the media at the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department auditorium in Colombo, yesterday.
Rambukwella said that there was no need to talk about the letter sent to public sector employees by former Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara as there was no validity in it.
He is not a Cabinet minister anymore. No one can go against gazette notifications issued by the President, he added.
Minister Rambukwella said it was the same with the letter sent by the former Minister Sagala Ratnayake. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had told that he would act according to the gazette notification issued by the President. All state officials, especially those in Parliament, work according to the gazette notification and nothing else, the minister added. Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the the former ministers should not attempt to influence state officials and make them break the law, or even the Constitutionsomething which cannot be done.
Only the Supreme Court had the power to interpret the Constitution. Therefore, the former Prime Minister should go to the Supreme Court if he wished to get it done, he added.

The powers of the Local Government institutions which were acquired by the Urban Development Authority will be vested in the local government institutions without delay, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday.
The Minister said all the projects that had been initiated by the Urban Development Authority would be continued, while measures would be taken to realise the peoples housing dreams.
Minister Gunawardena was speaking after assuming duties at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday morning.
A new government has been set up with new Ministers and Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, Minister Gunawardena said. This government will recommence the development programmes. Although the development rate has dropped to 3.6 percent now, when the government was handed over in 2015, the development rate in the country was nearly nine percent.
The Minister also said they would take measures to run a stable government and a country, while guaranteeing the aspirations of the people are fulfilled. The foundation for this situation was created with the vote of the public at the recent Local Government Election.
Minister Gunawardena also said the new government has the majority. The Speaker has issues with his arithmetic sometimes. He did not understand that 70 was greater than 16, he said.

Only less than 20% of women are occupied in the government administrative positions and less than 10% are engaged in the senior management, said Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson, Women in Management (WIM).
However in the private sector more women are get involved in the decision making process of companies.
The Women Top 50 Professional and Career Women annual conference will be held on December 4, 2018 at the Galle Face hotel, Colombo. The conference is organized by the WIM under the theme Price we pay for successes.
Through these conferences we are hoping to increase women participation in the administrative sector of the country.
She said that the conference will not only be limited to women but for both genders. It is also open for not only the women who are on top but for young ladies who are newcomers to their career. The conference includes eight sessions with topics chosen by various researches conducted by Universities. Even in our history the earliest queens of the world are from Sri Lanka and even the first woman Prime Minister is also from our country. This shows that Sri Lankan women have good leadership qualities, said Ajith Rohana, DIG Traffic and Road Safety.
He also highlighted that at the time of origin of the Sri Lankan Police, Women were not recruited.
After 1957, Women were recruited to the Police with arising of the need. I expect that there is a huge possibility to appoint a woman Inspector General of Police in Sri Lanka within 15-20 years of time. Currently women Police officers are not limited to police stations but are working in the field now. They have been given the training required. Although 51% of the Sri Lankan population are women, their engagement in business administration is still not up to potential, said Kasturi Chellaraja Wilson, MD Hemas Pharmaceuticals Diagnostics and MD Hemas Logistics and Maritime Cluster .
She further said that the real stories behind the success of the women who are to be recognized at the conference will be revealed. Through this they wish to make a huge impact on the society.
WIM is known for its annual Top 50 Professional and Career Women awards that recognizes and rewards women and their achievements. It includes not only the well-known and listed cooperates of Sri Lanka, but also women from the grassroots who have shown exceptional qualities of leadership. This conference, the first of its kind to be held in Sri Lanka, will have Thalatha Athukorala, former Minister of Justice, Shiromal Cooray, Managing Director, Jetwing Travels and Maryam Shakeela, CEO, SMDI Group of Companies, Maldives as keynote speakers.

WynkAR gives content creators an outlet to engage with their audience in a more personalized manner as well. Readers can now scan traditional print advertisements using their Android and iOS hand-held devices to generate superimposed interactive digital content. Agencies, brands and small and medium sized businesses are welcome to augment their products, services or stories through the platform.
According to a 2017 white paper published by Mordor Intelligence, the global augmented reality market was valued at USD 5.85 billion and is projected to reach a value of USD 70 billion by 2023, registering a projected annual growth rate of 51 percent. With a few usage cases in Sri Lanka already, Arimac believes the time is ripe for augmented reality.
Augmented Reality has been introduced as a revolutionary trend that can add a new layer to the real world, said Arimac Digital Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Chamira Jayasinghe.
It allows customers to be part of a different world, living a new experience that can increase their engagement with a product or service. With more than half of the Sri Lankan population estimated to own a smartphone, there is no better time than now for corporates to adopt emerging technologies to drive engagement.
The WynkARplatform can be used to find a particular location using Immersive Navigation and it is also able to scan movie posters while their respective trailers play in the background. Immersive technology can help companies create a certain emotional connection with their customers.
Unlike images or banners, for example, augmented reality ads are interactive and lifelikeconsumers can see and even interact with them, Jayasinghe said.

CAL advises Hemas on successful sale of  Hemas Southern Hospitals
Capital Alliance Partners Limited (CAL) successfully advised Hemas Hospitals (Pvt) Ltd on the sale of its subsidiary Hemas Southern Hospital (Pvt) Ltd (Hemas Southern) to Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC (Asiri), a giant in the healthcare sector with a chain of hospitals and laboratories around the country.
Following the acquisition of Hemas Southern, the Asiri chain adds yet another healthcare facility to its portfolio, expanding its presence to another city in Sri Lanka.
CALs advisory in terms of the divestment enables Hemas to focus on the growth strategy of its remaining hospitals. Hemas Thalawathugoda and Wattala are now positioned to evolve into state-of-the-art medical and healthcare facilities, specializing in providing critical healthcare services. The renewed focus will also enable Hemas Labs to be positioned amongst the most technologically advanced laboratories in Sri Lanka, servicing local as well as foreign markets.
Acclaimed by the Australian Council of Healthcare Standards International (ACHSI), Hemas Southern is the only hospital outside of Colombo to be felicitated with this international accreditation. Amongst many accolades, Hemas Southern was named the Best Private Hospital in the Southern Province for 2 consecutive years at the Dakshina Suwaviru awards by the Provincial Health Department, which has raised the bar in clinical outcomes among provincial hospitals.
Commenting on the transaction, the Managing Director of Hemas Hospitals Dr. Lakith Peiris said, With the assistance of CAL, who functioned as our financial advisors, we identified Asiri Group of Hospitals as the best fit due to their capability of providing high quality patient care.

CARGILLS BANK records Rs 71 mn PAT in first 9M
Cargills Bank recorded a modest post-tax profit of Rs. 71 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018.
This reflects a growth of 56% over the corresponding period of last year, after discounting the one-off gain of Rs. 481million from the disposal of its subsidiary.
Net Interest Income of Rs. 1,530 million improved by 46%, reflecting increased income from a larger loan portfolio, interest rate benefits from currency swaps and the impact of the inflow of Rs. 1 billion from the disposal referred to. Net Fee- based Income of Rs. 115 million for the 9 months reflected an increase of 43%. Most of this was attributable to income from growth in the loan portfolio and to higher guarantee commissions. This income would have been substantially higher if not for the delay in the launch of credit cards.
Other income for the nine months grew 23% when the exceptional gain in 2017 is excluded, an important contributor being increased earnings on foreign exchange.
Impairment charges increased 223% from Rs 73 million in 2017 to Rs 237 million in 2018.
Growth in the loan portfolio, non-performance by some large customers and delayed settlements on other loans contributed to this. The banks NPA ratio increased from 3.55% at 31 December 31, 2017 to 5.78% at September 30 2018. This is receiving close attention; management considers the increase temporary. The bank stringently assesses credit quality and strengthens monitoring and recovery to contain NPAs at an acceptable level.

FACE FORWARD!
When it comes to your skin, the basic routine is cleanse, tine and moisturize.However the mere cost of a product may leave your wallet weeping. Luxurious ingredients often make products extremely expensive. Here are a few tried, tested and affordable tricks to enhance the healthy glow in your skin.
Benefits of using a toner
Applying a small amount of toner to a soft cotton ball or pad and gently blotting and wiping your face with it will remove oil and give the appearance of smaller pores.
* It restores your skin's pH balance
Our skin is naturally acidic, typically with a pH balance of between five and six (on a scale from 0 to 14). But that balance can get out of whack after cleansing due to the alkaline nature of soap. When this happens, your skin needs to work overtime to return to its normal levels (and that may result in oil), but using a toner can help restore this balance quickly.
* It adds a layer of protection
Toners can help close pores and tighten cell gaps after cleansing, reducing the penetration of impurities and environmental contaminants into the skin. It can even protect and remove chlorine and minerals present in tap water.
* It acts like a moisturizer
Some toners are humectants, which means they help to bind moisture to the skin.
* It refreshes the skin
Toner can also be used in lieu of washing your skin when it's oily or dirty. It will leave your skin revitalized even when you're on the go.
A good cleanser and moisturizer
Cleansers and moisturizers are the most important skin products, particularly for softening dry skin. A skin moisturizer works by sealing moisture into the outer layer of the skin and by pulling moisture from the inner layers of skin to the outer layer.
The key ingredients that seal in moisture are petrolatum, mineral oil, lanolin, and dimethicone. Glycerin, propylene glycol, proteins, urea, and vitamins help attract water into the outer layer of the skin.
Some skin moisturizers also contain an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), which exfoliates dead skin. AHAs are a good choice if you have very dry skin.
Removing your make up before going to bed
It is very important to remove makeup before going to bed because it can cause extensive damage to your skin during the night.
The skin renews itself while you sleep, and when you leave makeup on, you are preventing that from happening. The skin ceases to breathe and fatigue signs appear soon enough.
As most makeup is made of oily substances, when it stays on for the next day, it clogs your pores and leads to the appearance of more acne and blackhead breakouts.
Makeup residue and the substances that make your make up can also cause many skin imperfections, when left for hours on end during the night.
Thats why it is important to use a makeup remover before going to bed, and then moisturizing your face to help your skin breathe right.
A quick way to clean off all your makeup residue, dirt and oil, after a long tiring day, is to use Deep Clean Makeup Remover Wipes. The wipes sweep away all pore-clogging impurities and leave your skin thoroughly cleansed.
Finding the skin moisturizer for you
It may take some trial and error, so be patient. Follow these guidelines as you shop and, if youre not getting the results you want, try a new one the next time.
Note the first five ingredients:
Look for common active ingredients, such as lanolin, glycerin, or petrolatum. Glycerin is less likely than lanolin to cause an allergic reaction, she says. She also recommends picking a moisturizer thats made by a reputable company.
Go for added sunscreen:
Protecting your skin from harmful sun damage is one of the best things you can do to keep your skin looking young, so buy a moisturizer with a sun protection factor of at least 30. Youll have to do some searching, but more companies are offering face and body moisturizers with sunscreen.
Make it skin-type appropriate:
The skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive, so its a good idea to use a different moisturizer on your face than you do on your body, Fusco says and recommends buying one thats labeled non-comedogenic because it wont clog your pores. Of course, choose one thats right for your skin type. If you know you have sensitive skin, its always a good idea to look for a moisturizer labeled hypoallergenic. If you have oily skin, go with a light, oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, get something richer. And if you have combination skin, go with a lighter moisturizer for your whole face and dot drier areas with a heavier cream. Keep in mind that you may need a lighter lotion in the summer, and a cream or ointment in the winter.
Consider using a moisturizer with retinol before bed:
Retinol is vitamin A for your skin. It works by increasing the speed at which your skin cells turn over. You can find it over the counter or by prescription, but use it carefully as it may cause a skin irritation.

FIGHTING WILDLIFE CRIMES WITH FORENSICS
Ravi Perera
Approximately every nine hours a rhino is killed in this world, and every 15 minutes an elephant is poached. Thousands of snare traps are used by poachers in Africa for game meat, and many a big cat and elephant also fall prey to these devices that cause an agonizing death.
While Anti-Poaching Units have increased and poachers have been apprehended, very often convicting them of the crime is impossible without physical evidence. These poachers get away, only to return to the jungle and start poaching again.
Introducing forensic training to Rangers and Anti-Poaching personnel to document the wildlife crime scene, preserve and collect evidence, and using the evidence to substantiate the crime, is becoming successful.
Ravi Perera has been a Crime Scene Investigator for law enforcement in the United States for 24 years. Having graduated from the FBI Forensic Academy in Quantico, Virginia, he is a crime scene instructor specializing in shooting reconstruction and surveillance photography. Ravi is also certified in electronic forensics, where analysis of cell phones and computers produce significant evidence of criminal activity.
Ravi is the CEO of Serendipity Wildlife Foundation, and has trained Anti-Poaching Units in Kenya, and also introduced Gun Shot Residue testing, which helps to identify the shooter when many people are present at a crime scene. Last year a project was started by him to detect fingerprints from elephant tusks and rhino horn, which would help identify individuals involved not only in poaching, but in trafficking as well. The second phase of the project is to start a fingerprint database dedicated only to wildlife crimes.
Ravi Perera will present Wildlife and Nature Protection Societys November installment of its monthly Lecture Series on November 15 at the Jasmine Hall BMICH starting at 6 pm. The WNPS Public Lecture is open to all members and non-members. Free Entrance.

These Government to Government transactions are intact and they will not retract as we have not changed our policies or our attitudes, the Minister firmly assured.

Getting her act together!
She had nothing to lose but her inhibitions. The stage was the mode of transportation which she used to display her acting prowess. Winning the Best Actress award at the State Childrens Drama Festival is no walk in the park but Imaya Bogoda won the title for two consecutive years!
She was the Best Actress 2017 in the English Limited Category for playing the role of a storyteller in Nimasha Fernandos Chairs. She took part in Sachitra Rahubaddas DoReMiFaSoLaTi this year and bagged the Best Child Actress award in the English Open Category.
Imaya Bogoda.Pictures by Ruwan de Silva
Chairs is based on a group of nine storytellers and three magical chairs while DoReMiFaSoLaTi expresses how music came to this world. They were two plays which were poles apart from each other. We rehearsed for nearly a year for Chairs. I never thought that I would win such a prestigious award let alone bag it twice! My aim was to give a good performance, Imaya said.
The 14 year old student of Musaeus College, Colombo, has excelled in a number of extracurricular activities from sports like squash and netball to scouting, western music, painting, acting, public speaking, and debating. She had represented Musaeus College at the Interschool Squash Championship from 2013 to 2017. She was the Under 11 champion of the Interhouse Squash competitions and became the first runners up in the novices girls under 11 category in the Sri Lanka Squash Federation Otter Aquatic Club.
Imaya has IWMS Written Exam Honours in Grade 1 2015 and was a member of the recorder group which won first place at the Western Province Recorder Competition 2015. She has won first and second places and merit awards for her flair for painting too.
Imaya was a shooter in the Interhouse Netball team which emerged first place in a number of events. She had bagged distinctions and honours in elocution and had made a mark for her public speaking skills. She was the Interhouse Debating Competition 2017s Best Junior Speaker and had captained the debating team as well as won the Best Debator award several times. She is a Cub Scout Gold Star Winner and is currently competing for the District Commissioners Award in Scouting.
You never know if something might suit you perfectly until you have tried it. The exposure, knowledge and the experience you get when you multitask is immense. You get a number of opportunities to discover your talents in various fields. They are pretty much like hidden gifts in you, which you still havent opened, Imaya opined.
Queried on what her pet project out of the lot is and she has a hard time figuring it out.
Getting the Best Actress 2017 award at the State Childrens Drama Festival
That is difficult to decide on but I think I enjoy acting a bit more than the other things I engage in. Acting is magical. You get the opportunity to change your attitudes and your looks. You can be anyone on stage. Being someone who is totally different from you is something that has fascinated me, she noted with a smile.
Her parents had persuaded her to take up a sport some years back when she was at the brink of becoming overweight. Imaya had chosen squash. Her first coach was F R Deen who is the current head coach at Royal College. Nalanda College and Kotelawala Defence University coach Mohammed Sulaiman and Mahanama College and Tamil Union coach Lal Wickramasinghe too trained her.
Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy head Nalaka Swarnathilake had recognized her flair for public speaking. She took part and won first place in a competition organized by Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy at the Vishaka College Auditorium in 2014. The topic she took up was My Dreams and she presented it in a manner which was totally out of the frame of the formal orating style. She won over the jury which comprised some well known names in the public speaking sector.
I got goosebumps when I started off for the first time. Public speaking helps to build a strong personality. We can use word power to influence the world! she exclaimed.

She points out that observation, reading books, gathering knowledge and increasing ones vocabulary through such media as well as watching and listening to speeches delivered by professional public speakers enhance a persons gift for public speaking.
Try to be creative and think out of the box. I guess everyone is a speaker but they just have to work a bit harder to add that public part to the front, she noted with a mischievous giggle.
For her achievements do not always mean winning an award. She considers realizing her talents and using them for self actualization as her greatest accomplishment.
Unfurling her thoughts on being a scout Imaya says that you can live your life to the fullest sans gender barriers if you take up scouting.
Girls too love adventurous activities like hiking, outdoor camping and cooking. Scouting also teaches us how to mould our lives. It trains us to be down to earth, move on with the society and overcome our day to day challenges. At the end you are given the scope to serve the society in the best possible way you can, she expressed.
With the other cast members of Chairs
Imaya is currently working on a project about Child Abuse with the police. She has chosen the topic because it has become a timely need as five to 10 incidents are reported every day.
My parents and a few of my friends helped me start this project. Our first step was taken on a village called Thimbilla by joining hands with the Chillaw police. The aim of this project is to create a child -based awareness on child abuse. It is based on how it can happen, how to protect ourselves and how to identify our inner talents. Our goal is to create a society from children who are against child abuse. We have done around three projects so far and we are planning to do more projects in rural villages as well as in schools in the future. Anyone who wishes to join us is welcome, she said.
One of the most interesting things the team had discovered while doing the project was that children listen to their peers more than they do to adults.
Scolding and penalization wont make them better but a friendly tone and a touch of kindness will change them, she explained adding that businesswoman, human rights activist and environmental campaigner Dame Anita Roddick inspires her.
Imaya fathers, Thimira, is a Director in the apparel industry while her mother, Melani, is a drama producer. Her brother, Inush, is a merchandiser in the apparel industry. Imaya is a past pupil of Matale International School and Oxford College International, Udahamulla. Her ambition is to venture into the medical field as well as free the world from child abuse.
Be yourself because no one else in this world is hundred percent like you. Being an original is worth more than being a copy. Dare to take challenges and to do the impossible. Life is short, so make every second count. Try everything and use your talents and skills to the fullest. Never wait for opportunities to come knocking at your door. Just go ahead and open the door. Always keep in mind to be a doer who dreams and a dreamer who does, she concluded.

The blend of experience with the present players should help the Nittawella club to blossom out into a side as the best in the league.
Some the players who should keep Kandy SC colors flying are Richard Dharmapala, Gayan Weeraratne, Danushka Ranjan, Lahiru Ranaweera, Anuruddha Wilwara, Danush Dayan, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamitra Jayasinghe, Nigel Ratwatte,. Roshan Weeraratne, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Heshan Jansen, Tilina Wijesinghe all back division players.

Korean Police book Lankan over oil blaze
Police booked five suspects including a Sri Lankan on Tuesday on charges related to a massive fire that blazed through an oil tank for over 17 hours at a storage facility in Goyang, Gyeonggi, Korea last month.
Mismanagement by the facilitys 51-year-old chief manager and two of its safety engineers allowed a sky lantern to cause the fire at the outdoor oil tank on October 7, police said. A 27-year-old Sri Lankan man, who originally lit the lantern at a nearby construction site where he was working, was also booked on a misdemeanor arson charge.
A 60-year-old former labour inspector for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy was also booked for doctoring official documents related to safety equipment at the facility. Police have resolved not to seek immediate arrest warrants for any of the suspects.
Though it left no human casualties, the fire burned through 2.82 million liters (17,737 barrels) of oil that day, causing over 11.7 billion won ($10.4 million) in damages to the Daehan Oil Pipeline Corporation, which owns the gas storage station. Surveillance footage revealed that the fire had been caused by a sky lantern released by the Sri Lankan man, who said he lit the discarded lantern out of curiosity.
The lantern landed on a pile of dried grass near the oil tank that was left over after workers mowed the grass around the tanks. It started a fire that spread to the gas tank and caused a large explosion inside.
A wave of public sympathy for the Sri Lankan worker followed the incident, with many people blaming the fire on systematic failures and negligence on the part of the oil storage center rather than the foreign workers mistake.
A subsequent investigation by police found that only one of the ten air vents inside the oil tanks had flame arresters installed inside, despite an industrial safety law that mandates that such devices be affixed to all equipment containing flammable materials. Particularly alarming was the fact that a public servant is suspected of forging official documents to make it look like the station had complied with the standards.
The dried grass left nearby and damage to flame traps that allow passage of gas showed that the oil tanks had indeed been exposed to fire hazards, police said. Investigators also found that monitoring at the facility was inadequate at the time the fire occurred. The facility had only four workers on the Sunday of the incident, and only one was monitoring surveillance cameras. At the time of the fire, however, this employee was supervising refueling at a different part of the facility. Police chose not to book any of these four workers for negligence, since there were not enough workers to properly deal with the fire.
Police said they will conduct a final consultation with seven fire safety and construction experts on Tuesday and release the final results of their probe this week.

Krasinski  and Blunt   tease horror   sequel
Back in April the post-apocalyptic horror A Quiet Place hit cinemas and was a critical and financial smash hit. The $17 million A Quiet Place stormed the box office taking a whopping $338.5 million world.
With such success, it should come as no surprise that a sequel will be arriving in 2020. Now husband and wife Krasinski and Blunt, who starred together in the movie, have teased whats next for the Abbott family.
Blunt said, In some ways, the idea of seeing who these people were before this all happened would be interesting. But Im not quite sure because I think actually its now whats the next chapter and what happens next. I think people feel very invested in this family. I think its such an open book right now, and certainly for John who is lasering into something as we speak.
Krasinski added, This is a world you can play in, this isnt just a character to remake. its actually a world, which is a whole different, very unique experience.
He continued, Its not like Alien or Jaws where the main villain is the thing youre repeating; its an actual entire set of rules and the circumstance that the world has undergone that you can play in very different facets.
