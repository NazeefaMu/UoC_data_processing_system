Palestine still suppressed by Israel
Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa extended his support towards Palestine in the 1970s, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the International day of Solidarity with the Palestine people held in Colombo recently, he said that all former Sri Lankan leaders and regimes extended their support to Palestine. It is the same with the current President and the Government. It is very pathetic that world powers and giants could still not do justice to Palestine.
According to Senaratne, the Jewish acquired lands belonging to Palestine by force and chased away Palestinians from their ancestral lands.
Even the UN has declared that the Jewish ideology is racist, but still it prevails in the world with the power of world giants.
The Palestine parliament does not function because the Jewish arrest Palestinian parliamentarians. Visa to travel to Palestine should still be obtained from Israel.
The condition in Palestine is pathetic, added the minister.

ICAO to celebrate 104th anniversary on December 7
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) celebrated its 104-year long service yesterday. Their first flight had taken its inaugural journey on December 7, 1912.
The International Civil Aviation Day is significant for Sri Lankans as it is an important milestone in the local civil aviation sector, Civil Aviation Director General H.M.C. Nimalsiri said.
The day helps generate and reinforce worldwide awareness of the importance of international civil aviation in developing states' social and economic spheres. The ICAO helps states cooperate and realise a truly global rapid transit network at the service of all mankind, he added. The UN and world nations have now adopted Agenda 2030 and embarked on a new era in global sustainable development. Therefore, the importance of aviation as an engine of global connectivity is never been more relevant to the Chicago Convention's objectives to look for international flight as a fundamental enabler of global peace and prosperity, he said.
Coinciding with the ICAO every five-year anniversary, the organization celebrates the way in accordance with a special theme.
The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) was signed on December 7, 1944 by 52 states. Pending ratification of the Convention by 26 states, the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization (PICAO) was established. It had been functioning from 6 June 6, 1945 to 4 April 1947. By March 5, 1947, the 26th ratification was carried out.
The ICAO was established on April 4, 1947. In October of the same year, the ICAO became one of the UN specialised agencies linked to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
A slight decrease in global aviation accidents was reported this year compared to the previous year. Seventy six aviation accidents were reported in this year and 3.6 billion passengers were transported worldwide. However, only five fatal accidents were reported. The number of accidents reported last year was 85, Nimalsiri said.

Cabinet approval to restructure Hambantota Port
The proposal to enter into a Public-Private Partnership with China Merchants Port Holdings to restructure the Hambantota Port received Cabinet approval on Tuesday, said Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday at the weekly cabinet briefing.
The second phase of the Hambantota Port has been scheduled to commence on January 7, in time for President Maithripalas second year in office.
The Proposal was submitted as a joint Cabinet memorandum by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama.
The framework agreement with the Chinese investor would be based upon the final decision made by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM).
They also decided to cancel the Key Terms Agreement signed between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Chinese investor in 2014. According to the decisions made by the CCEM, an Independent Port Regulator would be appointed to oversee activities and collect revenue owed to the government, until it is appointed, the SLPA would oversee such duties.
An oversight committee to handle national security at the port would also be formed.
The Sri Lanka Navy, Police and SLPA would be part of it while internal security within the port will be handled by the company. The agreement also explained that, The joint venture would acquire or lease as the case may be, all operational assets and common user facilities of Hambantota Port which shall include but not limited to container terminals, multipurpose terminals and oil terminals with fuel storage and supply facilities.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka last month announced that Sri Lanka would lease an 80 percent stake in the Hambantota Port to China for USD 1 billion.
The Chinese investors, said the Central Bank Governor had agreed to invest in the Hambantota Port. The first payment of USD 108 million was expected in January while USD 300 million was expected in March.
Meanwhile, workers at the Hambantota Port went on strike yesterday against the move to lease out the Port to the Chinese.
They alleged that they would lose their jobs to Chinese workers when they take over.

President still firm on Rs.25,000 traffic fine:Rajitha

President Maithripala Sirisena has not backed down from imposing the Rs.25,000 fine on serious traffic offenses, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday.
He insisted that only the two offences of imposing the fine on speeding and overtaking from the left had been reconsidered but the other five offences would still have the Rs.25,000 fine imposed.
The government withdrew on speeding and overtaking on the left as we dont have a clear policy yet as to how to or whether we should increase the speed limit or not. Also, the laws dont mention overtaking from the left. Therefore, these have to be fixed. This has nothing to do with the Private Bus Owners Association,he added.
Minister Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex said that the announcement made by the Private Bus Owners Association that their strike was successful and that the government had backed down was false. They only said that they were successful in getting the meeting with the President. The President has not agreed to remove the fines,he said.
The minister also mentioned that since the announcement of the fines, the number of deaths due to road accidents had reduced from eight to two.
This is just by mentioning it. We havent even passed it into law as yet, he said.
The private bus strike on December 2 had resulted in 128 Sri Lanka Transport Board buses been attacked with several passengers injured.
Strict action should be taken against those who damaged government property. At least 128 have to be arrested so far, but we dont see that happening. If the area police are saying they cant find who did it, what is the use of the police asked Senaratne. Globally around 12 million people die due to road accidents a year, with the majority of 9 million being male victims, the Health Minister said.

Tallest Christmas Tree cut down
The process of constructing the worlds tallest and largest Christmas tree, which was intended to set a Guinness world record, has been halted by Ports Minister Arjuna Ranatunga on the instructions of Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Coordinating Secretary of the Ports Minister and Christmas Tree construction committee chairman Mangala P Gunasekara said.
He said that Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith was informed duly through his coordinating secretary prior to commencement of the construction of this giant work. Besides, the constructing committee has taken measures to make the Pope aware through a letter in this regard.
The estimated cost of the project was Rs 12 million and the total amount had been planned to be raised through donations of well-wishers. Of the amount Rs 6 million had already been received as raw materials and all the major construction including the structure has already been completed, he said.
The intention of constructing this worlds tallest and largest Christmas tree was to bring the message of the peace to the world.
In addition it was to showcase and strengthen religious harmony among the ethnic and religious groups. Besides, it had been planned to set a Guinness world record as the worlds tallest and the largest Christmas tree.
Moreover, it was decided to boost tourism through this project as this would attract tourists. It has been reported that most of the hotel rooms in Colombo have already been booked in advance due to this project he said.
When Gunasekara was questioned whether the project did not receive early approval of the Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, he said that they took measures to inform Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith through his secretary before the commencement of the project on August 18 at the Galle Face Green.
The project commenced amidst the blessings of all religions.
When asked whether the project utilised the resources of the Ports Ministry, Gunasekara added that not a single cent of the Ports Ministry was used for the project. All the expenses were to be covered through the donations of the well-wishers.
The project was being initiated by a team of prime-mover drivers of the port with the assistance of other harbour employees.
They worked voluntarily. Apart from ports employees a significant number of volunteers from countrywide joined the project.
Not a single bolt or nut of the Port was used in the project he said. S.D.M. Nanayakkara the chief architect of the project said that this was a dream of his.

Rakna Lanka to be liquidated
Cabinet this week made a decision to liquidate government affiliated security service Rakna Araksha Lanka Ltd.
The company was established through a Cabinet decision in 2006 to provide security to special institutions such as economic targets, public institutions and private institutions during the war as army officers who were responsible for such tasks were deployed for other security purposes around the country.
With the present peaceful situation in the country, it has been observed that such a firm is unnecessary, said Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday.
The work undertaken by Rakna Araksha Lanka is to be reassigned to the Civil Defence Force and the Sri Lanka Navy, he added speaking at the Parliamentary Complex.
According to the Cabinet memorandum on the company, its net assets as of 31 August 2016 stands at Rs 3,264 million.
The company also holds a deposit worth Rs 160 million from Avant Garde Security Services and Rs 2.5 million to be paid to the Sri Lanka Navy for having using the armoury at the Welisara naval camp.
The security service has 1972 security staff on land and 420 security staff at sea and according to the government, many are contract employees and a significant portion ended their contract in September of this year.
The President who had submitted the proposal to liquidate the company, had explained that the government no longer needed a private security firm and that the firm itself had acted beyond their Articles of Association by providing security at sea and for private organizations.
Furthermore the company had suffered considerable losses given that the government no longer provided patronage to it and it was no longer sensible to keep it going as a government entity.
The COPE report in August this year had also pointed out that there were legal issues over the third party agreements Rakna Araksha Lanka had signed on to and that the profit share system of the company was not favourable to the government, as over 75 percent of it was being paid to Avant Garde.
The company was also investigated by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) for having used Rakna Lanka employees for election work during the 2015 Presidential elections.
Rakna Lanka would be liquidated in accordance with the Attorney Generals recommendations.

MCC World Cricket Committee meeting in Mumbai: Sending-off, bat thickness limitations among new recommendations
Cricket is set to introduce sendings-off for the first time next year, while the size of bats is to be limited.
Umpires will be given the power to eject players from a game for serious disciplinary breaches.
The MCC World Cricket Committee met in Mumbai on December 6 and 7 and came out with some game-changing recommendations.
MCC World Cricket Committee member Ricky Ponting explained that sanctions needed to be implemented.
Were talking about a significant change to lower-level cricket because it has got completely out of hand down there, the ex-Australia captain said.
MCC (the Marylebone Cricket Club) remains the guardian of the laws and spirit of the game, and its world cricket committee - established in 2006 and comprised of 12 current and former top international players - has been a leading independent voice on the games major issues.
The new laws will be implemented at all levels of the game from 1 October 2017, subject to approval by MCCs main committee.
When would players be ejected 
According to the proposed new law, agreed at the world cricket committees meeting in Mumbai, players will be dismissed for:
* threatening an umpire
* physically assaulting another player, umpire, official or spectator
* any other act of violence on the field of play
Ponting added: It got to the state where something had to happen to prevent those things happening on the international stage.
The modern player now understands their role in society, about being role models and want to play the game the right way for younger kids.
The committee also debated sanctions including run penalties and sin-bins for lesser offences, but decided it would be difficult to achieve consistency around the world - and may introduce an appendix to the laws in order for governing bodies or leagues to implement their own system.
Bat edges and depths to be limited
Following much debate in the past few years over bat sizes, and a call for restrictions from the International Cricket Council in June, specific size limitations to the edge and depth of bats will be added to the laws as the committee believes the balance of the game has tilted too far in the batsmans favour - with some mis-hit shots clearing the boundary for six.
Bat edges will have a maximum allowance of 40mm and bat depths must not exceed 67mm (60mm plus an allowance of 7mm for a possible curve on the face of the bat).
Many of the top players bats have edges of between 38mm and 42mm, but there are some which have edges of up to 50mm, which was felt to be excessive and in need of restriction, the committee concluded.
While a bat gauge will be used to enforce the new restriction in the professional game, a moratorium will allow amateur players to continue to use their existing bats which may be in breach of the new law.
What are the current laws relating to bat size
Law on ball striking a fielders helmet to change
Catches and stumpings will now be permitted after the ball has struck a helmet being worn by a fielder, or become lodged or trapped in the grille of such a helmet - given the wearing of helmets by close fielders has been made compulsory at some levels.
However, a ball striking an unattended helmet behind the wicketkeeper will still earn five runs for the batting side.
Among its other discussions:
* the committee decided the law on ball-tampering would not be changed
* proposals for four-day Tests were debated but the committee was evenly split
* the committee also reaffirmed its support for (a) Twenty20 cricket being added to the Olympic Games, and (b) a World Test Championship to be introduced.  BBC

Airline chief arrested after Colombia plane crash
LA PAZ: Bolivian officials arrested the head of LAMIA Airlines on Tuesday after a crash involving one of the charter firms planes which killed a Brazilian football team and dozens of others. Gustavo Vargas, director general of the Bolivian charter firm, was arrested as part of a probe into the November 29 crash which claimed the lives of 71 people, including all but a handful of players from Chapecoense Real football club.
There was an arrest order for the director of the company, said prosecutor Ivan Quintanilla, who told reporters he had issued arrest orders for six people in connection with the crash, including a secretary and a mechanic at the airline.
Aviation officials also removed documents from LAMIAs offices as part of the probe, media reported.
LAMIA Airlines is a Bolivian-registered charter company that specializes in flying Latin American football clubs.
Chapecoense had been enjoying a fairy tale season until the crash, and at the time of the accident were en route to a championship game which they were tipped to win.
The flight crashed into the Colombian mountains not far from the city of Medellin. Of 77 people onboard, 71 were killed. Meanwhile, officials said a senior Bolivian aviation official who authorized the flight, Celia Castedo, had fled the country and was seeking asylum in Brazil.
Celia sought refuge in Brazil yesterday in (the town of) Corumba in Mato Grosso state near the border of Bolivia, an government official told AFP in the capital Brasilia.
Officials said she had fled fearing for her safety and that the process of reviewing her petition to remain in Brazil could take up to a year. But Bolivian officials branded her a fugitive.
Her departure from the country is illegal, Interior Minister Carlos Romero told reporters, saying La Paz would seek to have her extradited. Chapecoense were on their way to play Atletico Nacional of Medellin in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final at the time of last weeks crash. Only six people survived, three of them Chapecoense players. Among the dead were 20 Brazilian journalists who were traveling with the team to cover the match.
Investigators from Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia are currently looking into what caused the crash, but officials have said one theory is that the plane ran out of fuel during the flight.
On December 1, Bolivia authorities revoked LAMIAs operating license and ordered an investigation into its operations. AFP
