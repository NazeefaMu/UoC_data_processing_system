Last day on planet earth
Since his childhood, he had been interested in reading books on science fiction, science magazines and astronomy. His interest in Astronomy led him to avidly research on the books about planets and Space. The more he read, the more interested he became.
The Last Days on Planet Earth, a science fiction narrative authored by Udaya Thalangama, will be launched at National Library and Documentation Services Board on July 6 at 5 pm as a Sadeepa publication.
Udaya Thalangama who is a graduate in BSc in Computer Science from the University of Colombo is currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at a leading Bank in Sri Lanka.
When he heard about the Planet X or Nibiru in 2007, he started deep research into this subject to find out what the ancient civilisation like Sumerians, Mayans and Hopi Indians knew about Nibiru and how those civilisations got wiped out due to Cosmic Events. He has mainly focused on the Sumerian Culture in order to find out what the Sumerian tablets and their text in stones had mentioned about Nibiru more than 6000 years ago, based on the books written by Zecharia Sitchin, the linguist who published many books on Sumerians and Nibiru,
He explored what the Ancient text say about Nibiru, what the Bible, Veda and other historical books had revealed about Nibiru.
He has devised his own mathematical models and software applications in order to analyse the behaviour and the orbital path of Nibiru and also to find out the time period of next fly-by of Nibiru.
After the completion of his analysis of this information for a period of more than 10 years, he decided to publish a book which will reveal the evidence of the arrival of Nibiru.
If you have not noticed lately, nature is speaking out to us. It appears that our planet is spiralling out of control, that is influenced by the cosmic force, which affects the inner core of the earth, and thus affecting the earths magnetic field allowing harmful radiation to permeate the earth atmosphere and subsequently endangering the health of the earth inhabitants. It is what we call the dominant effect, in which one concrete object is responsible for the collapse of all other objects in its path.
What exactly is happening around the world at this time Well, not much of these are covered in the mainstream media. But if you follow the social media or alternative news sites, then you will come to know that there are significant events taking place at this time. The question is whether the world is entering a series of cataclysm events or not.
Since the 1990s, natural disasters have consistently increased, and have affected more than 500 Million people every year. And the numbers continue to increase. This category falls into a category of apocalyptic. This is what we need to focus. If you consider the overall geological disasters in that time frame, then the numbers have remained fairly constant. If we then take, the related climate number of disasters, you will see that the numbers have drastically increased. When we refer to earth changes, it is believed that the world would enter a series of cataclysmic events that would cause major alterations on the planet.
If you go through our climate, the atmosphere and the changes that are taking place both on the surface of the earth and below the surface, couldnt get any worst. Then you may pay a close attention and read this book.
There are countless prophecies about future times, but only one is repeated across many cultures: the arrival of a huge planet whose magnetism will alter our world. Since ancient times this planet has been known as Nibiru or Herclubus. However, it is recognised in many traditions, prophecies and sacred books under different names such as Planet X, Nibiru, Baal, Wormwood, Marduk, Nemesis, The Beast, Red Planet, The Planet of crossing and much more.
Nibiru is a gigantic world, it is bigger than earth. In the past, it put an end to the Atlantean civilisation and it is approaching Earth again. In its present encounter, the progressive approach of Nibiru will bring about all type of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tidal waves, which will become more and more infrequent and intense until total devastation come about. The approach of Nibiru is an event that will cause deep changes on our planet. Regarding celestial mechanics, Nibiru will help the pole shift. Indeed, it is a part of the great machinery.
When Nibiru comes closer to the Earth and aligns with the Sun, deadly epidemics will begin to spread over the entire planet. Neither doctors nor official science will know what sort of illnesses they are or how to cure them. They will be powerless in the face of the epidemics.
The moment of tragedy and darkness will come tremors, earthquakes, Volcanoes and tidal waves. What I am affirming in this book is a prophecy that will be fulfilled very shortly, because I am certain about the end of the planet; I know it. I am not frightening, but warning, because I am distressed about this poor Humanity. These events will not be long in coming and there is no time to waste with illusory things.

Loyal to  Royal
Admirable mental faculties honed by decision-making under adversity are Head Prefect of Royal College Dinuka de Zoysas hallmark. Perfect Prefect features Dinuka de Zoysa, a man who is no stranger to multi-tasking, who is motivated by putting Royal before himself.
Actually it is all about balancing everyone at a school. A college is a place where people from different backgrounds meet. My duty as a prefect, along with the other prefects, is to treat everyone equally and lead them all to achieve the common goals of Royal College. It is about basically balancing studies, sports and club activities and reaching and achieving targets. The main role as a prefect of Royal College is to basically uphold and uplift the discipline. That is why the prefect system all began. To maintain discipline. Discipline is the first concern at Royal College. And upholding that is my primary duty, said de Zoysa
De Zoysa believes you also need to prioritise everything you do.
At Royal College, there is a lot of stuff you need to balance. You manage sports while you manage academics as well. When you are in a sport you focus on that, and when you are studying you focus fully on studies without letting your mind get distracted.
The most important thing is correct decision making - Considering all aspects and taking everyones view into consideration. Putting them on one page, and being very open to everyones ideas and taking the best decision possible for the school regardless of your personal agendas, explained de Zoysa.
For de Zoysa the sky is the limit having received three As and excelling in other activities at Royal.
I am right after my A-Ls, which I did in August last year. After that, we get appointed as probationary prefects in September. Then from September to December, we have a short probationary period and in January we are appointed as senior prefects. In February there is a vote within the Council, from which the top 10 are chosen. I was appointed Prefect in September, 2016. My tenure will finish in December, 2017. But I was appointed Head Prefect in February this year.
I have been currently selected to the Sri Jayawardenepura University for Management. I am debating whether I should go abroad for my higher studies or stay here. I want to do a double degree in Economics and Marketing. A double degree is not possible in Sri Lanka in local universities. So that is the dilemma I am facing. I need to take a decision soon, pointed out de Zoysa.
De Zoysa also explained the prefect structure at Royal.
There is the Prefects council and we are known as the Prefects Council of 2016/2017. There is a vote within the Council, for the top 10, and after that, there is an interview with the Principal, the top administration and the Royal College Union Secretary. Collectively they make the decision. The decision is the discretion of the prefects, principal and the management. Basically, the council votes on their top 10 preferences for Head Prefect.
After myself, there are six other deputies. Overall there are 86 prefects including me. The Deputy Head Prefects are divided into academics, sports, 5S, IT and Clubs and Societies. The 5S is a world-renowned system. It is a workplace organisation method teaching values such as cleanliness, sustainability, keeping the right thing at the right place etc.
Then there is a senior deputy head prefect who is in charge of the finances and is the treasurer of the council and generally supports me. I generally oversee everything, elucidated de Zoysa.
At Royal, there are annual projects  around 150 in number.
Right now we are planning on putting up solar panels in the main building to bring the cost of the maintenance down to zero. And Royal College is the only school that contributes to the national grid in terms of electricity. Last Saturday we went to Deniyaya with the Prime Minister to donate items for the flood victims. We do a lot of projects during a year - major and small projects, added de Zoysa
As a Head Prefect along with the other prefects, the duty is to highlight the important fundamental principles of Royal.
Regardless of change, the fundamental principles, the spirit of a Royalist and how you behave in society and how you be a gentleman, such qualities I need to inculcate in the boys. That is my primary duty, as well as organising projects, stated de Zoysa.
The obligations of a prefect at Royal are many.
We have something called the clubs and Prefects Felicitation Ceremony. There are 50 clubs and societies in Royal College and all of them do a fantastic job throughout the year. And at the end of the year, they are graded according to their performance. That is a huge ceremony which is done in December. In March we organise Colours Night and felicitate the sportsmen. Those are the responsibilities of the clubs and Sports Deputy Head Prefects, informed de Zoysa.
At Royal, the College traditions are important. And prefects know the traditions. They support the administration. The prefect system at Royal College is very structured and it has been developed over a long time.
We innovate every year but the project idea is the same. As soon as the hostellers come  the scholarship holders to the grade 6 - we show them around school and Colombo, since they come from rural areas.
Then there is motivation for sports teams before their encounters. Then there is supporting underprivileged students, said de Zoysa
De Zoysa feels that pressure brings out the best in them.
There is a quote that we at Royal College all look up to: Adversity causes some men to break and some men to break records. That is something we at Royal College all follow. At Royal, there is a lot of pressure with a huge amount of stakeholders: 8500 students and teachers and a countless number of Old Boys. There are so many ideas coming around from everyone. It is a government school and we have to follow government regulations as well.
But we, as prefects, actually flourish under pressure. Being under pressure brings the best out of us. We feel that if we are under pressure we can perform better. We tend to cope well with pressure, shared de Zoysa
In Royal, you learn to adapt to everyone.
You need to find your motivation to combat stress. Our motivation is seeing Royal excel. There are 86 people in my council including myself. All 86 are not the same and you cant expect them to be the same. You tend to adapt to each person! You need to get the best out of everyone. At Royal, we are always taught to be loyal to Royal. We want to serve Royal for everything it has given us, elucidated de Zoysa.
De Zoysa has proud words for anyone who wants to take a leadership position at Royal
To be a leader you need to focus on what is important at that time, prioritise. Educational qualifications are number one at Royal. You need to learn well. You need to learn the soft skills. That is why we do sports and clubs and societies. You learn to balance things. Do everything for Royal and not for personal gain. If you do that, you will be rewarded.
If I am someone today it is definitely because of my Prefects Council. They have helped me lead the school. They are behind me as always. My family has made me become what I am today. They have supported me throughout and they have been extremely patient understanding of my obligations, summed up de Zoysa.

Malinga issued six month suspended sentence and 50% fine
Uncapped Wanindu Hasaranga named in Sri Lanka ODI squad :
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday slapped a 50 percent fine and a six-month suspended sentence on fast bowler Lasith Malinga for making comments to the media and thus violating his contract with SLC.
Malinga however will be available for selection for the ODIs against Zimbabwe which starts in Galle on June 30.
Malingas suspension and fine was the outcome of the Disciplinary Inquiry held against him with regard to the breach of his contract with SLC. He had made comments against the Minister of Sports after he (the Minister) had accused the national team players of being overweight and being unfit following their early exit from the Champions trophy in England.
The special inquiry panel comprising SLC secretary Mohan de Silva, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva and chairman Disciplinary Committee Asela Rekawa AAL, found Malinga guilty of breach of his contract after an inquiry held yesterday afternoon at SLC Headquarters. Malinga accepted the charges levelled against him and tendered a formal apology.
The finding were subsequently reported to a specially convened Executive Committee yesterday who imposed a sentence of a one-year suspension, suspended by six months (whereby the punishment would be imposed in the event of a similar infraction within the stipulated 6-month period) and a 50% fine of his next ODI match fee.
NEWCOMER HASARANGA
Meanwhile Sri Lanka selectors named uncapped Richmond College cricketer Wanindu Hasaranga in the squad of 13 picked for the first two ODIs against Zimbabwe in Galle.
Wanindu is one of the best fielders in Sri Lanka right now and batting well and he is in form. Hes got the option of leg-spin bowling thats why we picked him. We want to give chances to some youngsters with Angie (Angelo Mathews), Upul (Tharanga) and Lasith (Malinga) playing with senior players, said Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
Sri Lanka also recalled spinner Akila Dhananjaya and fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Madushanka.
However there was no place for Dinesh Chandimal and Thisara Perera.
We selected the side for the first two ODIs and we are looking at different combinations, that is one of the reasons why we selected this side, said Gurusinha. We wanted to have some senior players in the team as well. With Danushka (Gunathilaka) in the runs and Upul (Tharanga) returning after suspension we wanted them to play thats why Dinesh (Chandimal) was left out for the first two games. Chandimal is in our plans.
ODI SQUADS:
SRI LANKA ODI SQUAD (for 1st & 2nd): Angelo Mathews (captain), Upul Tharanga (vice-captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Asela Gunaratne, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lakshan Sandakan, Akila Dhananjaya, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Madushanka.

More must be done to curb drug abuse in Sri Lanka: Premier

Sri Lanka has become an international narcotics hub and more must be done to curb drugs abuse in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at a ceremony to mark International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking at the BMICH, Colombo, yesterday.
Drug usage has increased in Sri Lanka and has spread even to rural parts of the country. This is a menace, the Prime Minister said, accusing the media of focusing more on other issues and less on the drug scourge that has hit the country.
People have turned a blind eye towards the drug menace in Sri Lanka, the Premier further alleged. He said that the main solution to this issue is to bring about awareness on this matter and to implement laws against drug abuse.
When implementing laws the Police, Navy, Coast Guards, Air Force and the Police Special Task Force must work together. There is an urgent need to pay close attention on laws related to this field and to reform the Constitution, he said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the Police Narcotics Bureau needed to be staffed with more officers, as a first step to mitigate the problem. I have discussed this matter with Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake already, he said.
Furthermore, the Premier said, we should find ways to stop drug imports, usage and trafficking in Sri Lanka.
Drugs come in to the country from Pakistan and India through marine sources. We have taken measures to allocate more money to halt these drug dealings, the Premier said. Another menace is drug distribution. Drug usage in Colombo North and the area surrounding the Kelani river bank has increased, he further alleged.
The Premier said that new Police stations have been set up in the area to nab drug dealers and users and implement the law against them.
It is also important to work together with countries which work against drug abuse, he said.
Concluding his speech the Prime Minister said that though it is difficult to eradicate drug abuse the situation can be controlled through preventive action. He also called on religious leaders to join hands in eradicating the drug menace in Sri Lanka.

MTI's Limoneira case study set for London launch
The publishers Routledge (part of the Taylor and Francis Group) will be launching the book titled Management Consultancy Insights and Real Consultancy Projects'.
The book to be launched in London on August 10 will contain two case studies of the strategy-critical project carried out by MTI Consulting for Limoneira, the Nasdaq listed and USA's largest lemon producer.
The two case studies are titled The Role of Client Knowledge in Consulting Projects: Explorative, Exploitative and Ambidextrous Approaches by Jason Cordier, Alejandra Marin and Hilmy Cader and Making Lemonade from Lemons: The Role of Client-Consultant Knowledge as the Limoneira Company Goes Global by Jason Cordier and Tahir Hameed.
Commenting on the success of this project, the President of California based Limoneira, Harold Edwards said, From our inception in 1893, we have been part of the Sunkist's global distribution system that gave us access to global markets.
However, we were essentially the supply chain, while Sunkist focused on the demand chain. Naturally, we had to share the rewards from the value-chain proceeds. In 2008, we wanted to explore the prospects of direct go-to-market model internationally and that we realized is a high-risk, high reward decision.
Having previously worked with MTI (and Hilmy Cader, their CEO) in the Philippines in my role at Ralston Purina, we reached out to them.
This strategy consulting project with Limoneira, which was based on MTI's 8S (r), involved a comprehensive scan of the global lemon market, based on which the strategizing process took place.
An international team of MTI's strategy consultants and analysts were on the ground in Ventura County, California, working closely with the senior management of Limoneira, through consulting clinics and strategizing workshops.
The key focus areas of the plan centered around demand generation, brand equity development, customer conversion, channel transition management, new market development (especially from newly emerging regions) and then ensuring that Limoneira's structure, staff and systems are all aligned to the strategy.
The project culminated with a comprehensive presentation to the Limoneira Board that was subject to intense scrutiny.At the end of the MTI project we decided to go-to-market directly with our lemon business utilizing our vertically integrated supply chain and the Limoneira brand. Looking back, we are extremely pleased with that decision which has paid off significantly as reflected in our business performance and financial results. MTI played a pivotal role in this exercise and did so while getting the buy-in and inclusiveness of our team, said Harold S. Edwards, President and CEO of Limoneira.
MTI CEO Hilmy Cader who personally led the MTI team on this project said, This was one of most intense international projects we've handled. The exposure our team got, including hands-on front-end market interface in many countries, has helped the team's learning and sharpened our ability to handle such international projects.

Not Our cup of tea!
Glyphosate is poison. There are hundreds of cases of visible damage caused by it. In such a situation, the prior proof is not necessary. The proof should be sought after the ban.
Take one point promoted in favour of glyphosate: it does not affect humans because of the absence of the shikimic acid metabolic pathway in the human body. The shikimic acid pathway exists in plants and some microorganisms. Glyphosate destroys it.
The claim mentioned above may be a truth in regard to glyphosate and the human body taken separately, but it is not the truth in regard to the human body as a whole. Even the weak-minded know that the human body harbours billions of bacteria in the intestines. People who read know that certain actions of these bacteria support crucial brain functions.
Glyphosate either kills or mutates bacteria. In fact, it was first introduced for that purpose. When bacteria in the human gut are killed by glyphosate ingested with food, certain brain functions are adversely affected. The ultimate effects are not even properly scientifically investigated but there is strong evidence that autism is one result. As well, there is strong visible evidence that traces of glyphosate in the body causes serious damage to fetuses  even causing miscarriages.
Calling for definite scientific proof in connection with this visible evidence is inappropriate. Our science is nowhere near a complete understanding of human metabolism. It is nowhere near even having an idea of what kind of research needs to be done. Therefore it is nowhere near having the equipment and laboratory conditions required to replicate natural conditions and metabolism. Older people will remember the liquor ban in the USA with controlled releases. It was labelled prohibition. The law was broken with vicious abandon by gangsters. It led to machine-gun battles between the police and gangsters, to violent deaths and crime on a massive scale.
In Sri Lanka, even now, the tea industry cannot control the controlled release of refuse tea. It is being illegally obtained and distributed by several gangs. It is being exported too, seriously damaging the highly respected Ceylon Tea brand. This export racket has got so bad that the STF has been specially assigned to put a stop to it. Similarly, the authorities cannot control the illegal drugs trade and the kasippu trade.
Do the authorities want a similar criminal problem arising from glyphosate
What is wrong with the tea industry Is it being led by blinkered, uninformed, uneducated and unimaginative people Why do they have such a deep yearning for glyphosate
Do not they know that in Turkey, the state-owned tea company, aykur, is prospering while our state-owned SPC and JEDB were buried alive by irresponsible, semi-educated, unprincipled political appointees and employees The privately managed regional plantation companies are approaching a similar end.
Our tea industry is 150 years old while the Turkish tea industry is only 97 years old. But aykur, based in the Rize region of Turkey, with nine regional directorates, has 75,900 hectares (187,500 acres) of cultivated tea under its command. It has a turnover of US$ 700 million.
It produces 133,000 TONS of made tea, both black and green (133,000,000 kg). It gives employment to 10,670 persons. It has a small-holder population of 207,000 as sole suppliers of green leaf. aykur also has 46 factories and two packaging plants.
How well could our 23 regional plantations taken together, or the smallholders taken together, be compared with aykur Very poorly, from the point of view of profitability, management, production, dedication and whatever else. Consider just a few important points related to Sri Lanka tea industry.
ATTITUDE
The language in aykur website is simple and highly expressive of the deep genuine love of tea. Their god is tea. Ours is money
They say: Only a few countries are as closely connected with tea as Turkey. We want to export Turkish tea culture to the world. After all, for us, tea is more than just a drink  it is happiness, passion and the future.
We want to be better than we already are.
Quality assurance is very important to us.
Tea farmers and their families are the backbone of our business. They work for us and we provide them with secure jobs and pay them well. We want everyone to be satisfied: both the producers and the consumers.
These sentiments strike deeply, not so with our high-pressure marketing language.
ADVANCEMENT
The need to go organic. It is recognised and a plan is meticulously followed to achieve it and preserve the people and their habitat. By 2023 aykur will have all 75,900 hectares in organic tea.
They say: We are part of nature. We do not want to use any chemicals that might endanger nature or humans. We want Rize to become the largest organic tea-cultivating region in the world. By 2023, the entire production will be converted to organic farming. In this way, we will not only be producing naturally aromatic tea but will also be securing the future of Rize residents and their natural environment.
We, on the other hand, are dead set on poisoning the consumer. We over-apply fertiliser that has toxic heavy metals, we apply insecticides and we cry out to use Glyphosate.
We will never go completely organic considering how desperate the industry wants Glyphosate. The proud and respected brand Ceylon Tea will be eventually vilified and rejected by consumers.
This debacle will occur much earlier than expected because of electronic social media. A good example was how the voting pattern was affected at the last presidential election. There is no doubt at all that the consumer is going for organic tea and wants to verify the origin too.
aykur has canned tea for iced tea. Do we We have beer in cans. Why not tea Why not cash in on the Ceylon Tea brand
There are plenty of other options for advancement in the products range.
CARE OF WORKERS
aykur says: Tea farmers and their families are the backbone of our business. They work for us and we provide them with secure jobs and pay them well. We want everyone to be satisfied: both the producers and the consumers.
We cannot expect our workers to live on wages that do not match living standards in the country. Whatever the wages are in other countries, especially so without even a guarantee of daily work and while remaining as workers for generations.
For an enterprise to succeed, the workers must be adequately paid or provided with another income avenue. aykur is supplied green leaf by smallholders. A similar arrangement is being carried out by Dilmah. Such an arrangement would improve production too. The lessees need not be estate workers only.
Genuine farmer families should be selected and their overall output and maintenance examined regularly and closely and maintained without fear or favour. Authorities should not shilly-shally in carrying out changes that are unpleasant to some. Preserving the vote bank is not the priority. The country and people are.
GREEN LEAF PRODUCTION
The aykur CEO of says: When I was young, I had to pick every single leaf by hand. Now, using shears, a good picker can harvest up to 500 kg. Unbelievable but true. The CEO says so. Our per capita production by hand is a pathetic average of around 18kg/day. This is less than half that of a Kenyan worker (48kg) and is only two-thirds of that of a South Indian worker (27 kg). This is highway robbery promoted by politicians. It must be stopped, kindly and firmly.
The Turkish method of using shears must be investigated. Using this method could result in the collection of pieces of mature leaf too, but they can be sorted out just as damaged green leaves are sorted out even now. The waste leaf can be profitably used too. As the worker and the tea bush get used to the aykur plucking method the percentage of mature leaf in the pluck will diminish.
It is worth taking two or three reliable men and women pluckers under a bond to Turkey to learn the process.
The Planters Association is crying out for an increase of just 2 kg in the daily plucking output to show profit. Here is a chance to do very much better. This ensures instantaneous recovery at low cost.
After achieving much better production, the new more productive seed tea must be planted. They can be made to get about 40 percent of their nitrogen fertiliser as legumes do  cutting costs.
The use of chemicals must be completely overhauled. Weeds can be controlled by other methods. It can be done without RoundUp or worse chemicals being tested by the TRI. Continued use of RoundUp will boomerang on us and we will be faced with a worse fate than that suffered recently due to a sluggish market. The tea industry can collapse. Two million livelihoods and the custom of billions are at stake.
Chemical Fertilizer application method must be changed. Pest control must be carried out with care and within limits.
ADVANCEMENTS IN THE PLANTATION AND FACTORY
The following can be done without much of an outlay. They help to increase profits and in cost cutting too. Controlling erosion but not with ditches along contours. A permanent solution, unlike ditches, is required.
Weeds should be controlled without chemicals at least in three ways. Nitrogen should be provided while preserving soil moisture. Getting best results from fertiliser and using less - by avoiding it getting washed away - thereby preserves the environment and does not pollute the waterways.
It greatly increases gliricidia production for biomass fuel, without increasing land use. Growing high-value, high demand short-term crops on unused land is also a necessity. Factory automation should be given proper attention. It gives better uniform quality tea fetching premium prices.
Power generation from tea wastes  both green and black, supplemented with other wastes  should be attended to. There will be plenty of power for export too after in-house needs are satisfied. The process will be cheaper than mini hydro and have two other income streams too.

Security by Obscurity
Belt Road initiative and cyber security:
After investigation, the police arrested a 17-year old school boy on suspicion of hacking into the President's official website in November last year. The school boy, who made his claim as "The Sri Lankan Youth", posted a message on the website demanding a Presidential election immediately, if Sirisena was unable to address his demand of not changing the examination dates to April, the month most Sri Lankans celebrate traditional New Year.
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials arrested the boy in connection with the hacking and he was produced before the Courts, but later President Maithripala Sirisena, met with the student who hacked into his official website. During his meeting with the schoolboy hacker, the President said: It's our duty to encourage our youngsters to use their talents ethically. If the President had not invited the schoolboy hacker to meet him, perhaps his life would have been ruined and the boy would have had to spend his life in Prison.
Being a young, creative boy, this hacker got away due to the understanding of the President in Colombo, but had it happened anywhere else in the world, he would have been in serious trouble as hackers are dealt with in the most strict manner.
Last week, the world was shocked with a statement apparently made by the government of Qatar. Investigators believe that hackers had breached Qatar's state news agency and planted a fake news report that contributed to the crisis. This sort of incidents happen all over the world. Similarly, Edward Snowden, had leaked documents revealing extensive U.S. government surveillance. Computer hacking often revolves around information. Organisations steal information such as research, financial reports and more from one another through hacking operations. Such loss of information to a small business may cost them dearly as they could lose their competitive edge or result in the complete loss of a client base, effectively ruining the organisation.
A bill giving the UK intelligence agencies and police the most sweeping surveillance powers in the western world was passed into law with barely a whimper, meeting only token resistance over the past year from inside parliament and barely any from outside. The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, legalizes a whole range of tools for snooping and hacking by the security services unmatched by any other country in Western Europe or even the US. Sri Lankan sectoral experts are highly focused how to control the hackers activity. Next week the second conference of the CICA non-Governmental forum will be held in Beijing. Pathfinder Foundation will also participate in this valuable event and representatives will discuss the Asian Security Situation: Assessment and Prospect. The participants will discuss the critically important subject of Digital Gap and Network Security. Belt and Road Initiative, is a development strategy proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping that focuses on connectivity and cooperation between Eurasian countries, primarily the People's Republic of China, the land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road". The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries. In this regard, China with Eurasian countries face a backdrop of fears of cyber-attacks.
Digital divide is a term that refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communication technology. This technology can include the telephone, television, personal computers and the Internet. Before the late 20th century, digital divide referred chiefly to the division between those with and without telephone access; after the late 1990s however, the term began to be used mainly to those with and without Internet access, particularly broadband.
The digital divide typically exists between those in cities and those in rural areas; between the educated and the uneducated; between socioeconomic groups; and, globally, between the more and less industrially developed nations. Even among populations with some access to technology, the digital divide can be evident in the form of lower-performance computers, lower-speed wireless connections, lower-priced connections such as dial-up, and limited access to subscription-based content.
The topic of discussion on the world clearly admits the fact that there is a digital gap in countries where economic and technological development has been progressing in the past at a slower pace. And therefore, the issue of cyber security is critically important to such developing countries including Sri Lanka. Although we believe that cyber security is more of an issue of lack of technological or economic development, sometimes it not only a problem in the developed countries. Recent highly publicized claims in USA and a few other developed countries demonstrate the vulnerability of even the most advanced countries and their highly sensitive digital infrastructure. If the Americans and the British cannot defend or protect their most crucial internet related structures almost all other developing and even developed countries are most likely vulnerable to the cyber security related breaches.
The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2017, published recently surveyed 3,000 companies across three countries to assess their readiness to deal with cyber-crime in terms of strategy, resourcing, technology and process. The report found 53 percent of the companies assessed were ill-prepared to deal with an attack, and just 30 percent were rated "expert" in their overall cyber readiness. In 2016, "cyber-crime cost the global economy over $450 billion, where over 2 billion personal records were stolen and in the U.S. alone, over 100 million Americans had their medical records stolen,". Global statistics indicate that 75 percent of cyber incidents against critical infrastructure is all international. More interestingly, this data identifies that the most advanced G20 countries lose 1 percent of their GDP per annum due to cyber-crimes.
Therefore, the vulnerability of less developed economies needs no exaggeration. What do we mean by cyber security As per one definition, Cyber security or information technology security are the techniques of protecting computers, networks, programmes and data from unauthorized access or attacks that are aimed for exploitation.
The major areas covered in cyber security are: Application Security, Information Security, Disaster recovery and Network Security. In this regard, we have to remember that where ever cyber security aspects are to be addressed solutions must address both software and hardware issues. In countries like Sri Lanka, at the current level of economic and technological development, it is hard to assume that we can ourselves manage at an individual country level. We need international expertise, a high standard of digital technology and above all structures so that immediate action can be implemented when and where security breaches take place.
Belt and Road Initiative and The Belt and Road, is a development strategy proposed land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road". The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries.The One Belt One Road Initiative offers a great opportunity for China and regional countries to deepen economic trade and cooperation, cultural and personnel communication and connectivity. However, the security risks could impact the implementation of the Initiative. Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership and leaderships of all connected countries interacted frequently, which injected new impetus into the friendly bilateral relations. Importantly, people-to-people exchanges could serve as a cornerstone for bilateral relations between China and these countries. Therefore we need to strengthen contact, relationship and human interest of every citizen.
The Pathfinder Foundation in Colombo carried out a productive business and people friendly promotion mission to China with the establishment of the Eminent Persons Advisory Council comprising senior personalities from both countries. The council has set up technical sub-committees to realize the spirit of the MoU in such areas as strengthening economic, political, strategic and cultural relations. Taking the above situation into consideration, we have to propose that the countries that have come together as well as others involved in the Think Tank Network, identify cyber security as an area to work together. In this effort China as a technologically and economically most advanced nation in the world, could extend its technological support backed by experts in the cyber security field.

Shakespeare exposed to the street
I am fond of reading biographies and autobiographies of great people of all types. What do I get from reading them Perhaps it is an unanswered question that lies at the bottom of my mind. The book titled Lodger and subtitled as Shakespeare on Silver Street, first published in 2007 was lying on my table for several years. Suddenly I wanted to read the work by Charles Nicholl about whom I have read much.
Nicholl had been in the tradition of writing both which could be termed as alternative biographies or offbeat recordings on people such as Christopher Marlowe, Arthur Rimbaud and Leonardo da Vinci. His works have been translated into several working languages including Chinese, Japanese and French. I held the book authored by Charles Nicholl and determined to start reading.
Court trial
I wasnt distressed or pulled back even for a single moment. It was page-moving mixture of an investigation into the life of the Bard, who is supposed to have been all the way from Stratford to London.
Shakespeare had been a lodger in an apartment in Silver Street to attend a certain court trial pertaining to a family dispute. The facts linked to the court trial are evidenced by authentic documents culled from several archival and museum material hidden from the human eye for centuries. The readers attention is drawn to several court scenes in London where the dialogues that ensue are juxtaposed with some of the lines in Shakespeare plays.
Shakespeare has come as a witness who appears several times in the court case known as a dispute concerning a dowry. A sum of 60 pounds, which a person named Belott alleged, had been promised when he married Mountjoys daughter in 1604 and which had never been paid. The court hearings, it is stated, go on for several days where Shakespeare was one of the three witnesses called on the first day. There are interrogators put to him; five in number.
These look sensitive jottings which create a keen interest in knowing another type of Shakespeare who has gained creative inspiration from real life episodes, which may have given an impetus to build up theatrical situations in such plays as The Merchant of Venice and Hamlet.
Family matters
Nicholl, as a scholar, tries to draw parallels in the life of Shakespeare with those situations he has recreated in his own plays. In this direction, the reader gets the view that Shakespeares world picture as lying in his plays has been drawn from his own day to day experiences. One such example is the life he lived in the Silver Street in London during the early part of the 17th Century. Shakespeare, according to Nicholl, does not actually reveal why he was involved in those family matters of the people known by the name Mountjoy. But Nicholl, as an alternative biographer of Shakespeare, tries to dig into details by collaborative evidence.
Nicholl says that in the oral tradition, Shakespeares deposition in the already cited Belott Mountjoy case has been known for nearly a hundred years, but has been oddly neglected as a biographical source.
But it was found in 1909, along with others in the case, at the Public Record Office in London. Its discoverer, as stated by Nicholl, is one Dr Charles William Wallace a 44-year old American who at the time was an Associate Professor of English at the University of Nebraska. Nicholl attaches a photograph of Dr Wallace in his work with gratitude.
Medium of expression
From another point of view, Nicholls alternative biography too looks like a detective story, where the detective in the work is the biographer. He tries to find a whole host of clues to make an effective biography of Shakespeare not as seen by others as a person who just lived as a great playwright in Stratford got married and died there but as a person who hunted source materials by actually living a complex life finding time to write and produce plays for people as a medium of expression.
The life of Shakespeare too is shown as a rich person who had to lead a competitive life amidst others. Shakespeare image is never tarnished or besmeared by Nicholl by trivialities that linger on in many a Stratford folklore of the period.
Instead, his image is well built akin to a scholar who is well versed in classics.
The most striking episodes in the life of Shakespeare while living in Silver Street, come as encounters with brothel keepers, sex peddlers and prostitutes who have supplied him with an immense amount of human experiences. Some of these experiences according to Nicholl has gone into the recreation of dramatic situations in plays like Othello, King Lear and Much Ado About Nothing.
Emphasis is laid on the poetic structures of Shakespeare as influenced by the various teams of balladeers and singers who lived with the masses of the time. It is accepted by most biographies that Shakespeares life in London is shrouded in mystery. But Nicholl tries to unveil these gaps via his findings. According to Nicholl, there had been professional theatre groups operating in London.
The first public mention of Shakespeare is marked as around 1592. Shakespeare is reputed to have written a narrative poem titled Venus and Adonis in 1593. This is a work which was popular enough to go through nine reprints within a few years. Another narrative poem, The Rape of Lucrece, appears in 1594, perhaps it is surmised that these narrative poems paved the way for his major plays. He had played the role of actor, shareholder and playwright.

A solid answer to current garbage crisis
Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill:
Following the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy which claimed 40 lives, the need for a substantial waste management policy was much spoken of. The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill in Puttalam would become a solid answer to the current waste management crisis that Sri Lanka is now at, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka believes. The project would be carried out under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.
The project expects to collect and manage 1,200 tons of waste on a daily basis. According to statistics of the daily waste generated in the Western Province, only half of it is properly collected. In the Colombo district alone, nearly 2,100 MT of waste is daily generated of which only 1,600MT is collected. In Gampaha district, 750 MT of waste is generated and only 350 MT is properly collected. In Kalutara district, the daily waste generation is around 550 MT of which only 250 MT is collected.
Project Scope
The project is to develop the worked-out limestone quarries in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam, into a sanitary landfill for disposal of solid waste generated in Metro Colombo region with waste transfer using the rail transportation from Colombo to the proposed sanitary landfill. This would include a transfer operation from the Kelaniya site, rail transport and operation of a sanitary landfill at Aruwakkalu in Puttalam.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill falls under the Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Projects. As its initiative step, the project is to use waste disposed in Puttalam area and following the first stage, the project is to manage waste disposed in Colombo, Dehiwala, Kolonnawa and Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte Municipal Councils as well.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill would be an exemplary project which shall subdue the commonly shared fear against waste dumping sites, Minister of Megapolis Patali Chamipaka Ranawaka assured.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill in Puttalama would not be just a location we deposit waste. It would become what we call a waste park. The project would generate a number of income opportunities for the youth of Puttalam area as well. Minister Ranawaka explained.
Difference to dumping sites
The Project Director of Solid Waste Management Project, Jayavilal Fernando pointed out the importance of not using technical terms used in waste management loosely. He explained how the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill differs from an open garbage dumping site or a land fill.
At an open garbage site, waste was merely dumped and done away with. Meethotamulla was a waste dump. At a Sanitary Land Fill, we do not dump waste. We deposit waste and manage it according to scientific methods, Fernando explained. Fernando further explained that the compacted waste would not be deposited directly into quarries.
Waste transported by rail
The earth will be covered by several artificial layers upon which the waste would be deposited, he said.
Fernando said that artificial layers would include a Geo Textile layer, a Benthonite layer and a 1.5 mm HDPE (High-density polyethylene) layer. The thick platform made by these layers would ensure that the deposited waste will not affect ground water sources. Fernando highlighted that the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill project will incorporate with Sri Lanka technical guidelines on solid waste and comply with all international standards followed when constructing a waste deposit site. The deposition mechanism of waste would be a layer-by-layer formation, it was also explained. Thus, only an area about 800 metres in height would be visible to an onlooker, Fernando said. Explaining how waste will be transported by rail, Project Director Jayavilal Fernando explained that the collected municipal solid waste would be transferred firstly to a station in Kelaniya. The daily waste expected to be collected by this project is 1,200 tons. This location would not be a dump site. It would only be a transitional location at which the waste is transferred to a train. The waste would then be transferred from Kelaniya to Aruwakkalu via train, Fernando said.
The collected solid waste would be tipped to a dump pad and then pushed into a compactor. Then, the waste would be compressed into transport containers. The containers will be loaded into trains for transportation, Fernando said, explaining the operations that would be taking place at the Kelaniya transfer operation site.
Fernando pointed out that the project expected to utilize 2 locomotives to make two trips daily (2 up and 2 down) carrying 600 Tons of compacted solid waste. One train will consist of 13 rail wagons and 26 containers (20ft.).
Since the necessary railway lines are already in use, the project would only have to develop a railway line about 500 metres in length. Fernando explained the uniqueness of the site proposed for the Sanitary Land Fill in Aruwakkalu. He said that there were worked-out lime stone quarries which could be used as natural basins to deposit waste.
Importance of proposed site
There is no use of these worked-out quarries. These quarries have been used since 1979. They are freely available. The best we could do is to deposit waste into these quarries and then grow man made forests or turn these sites in to nature parks, Fernando pointed out. The other speciality Fernando pointed out is the absence of human settlements within a radius of 3 km. The closest village to the landfill which is a fishing community, is situated 3 km away from the site, Fernando said. There are no animal activities reported in the area as well, Fernando said.
Fernando also said the land fill is situated about 300 metres away from the coastal area. He assured that the coast or the ocean will not be affected by the land fill. He also explained that the soil quarried from live mining sites could easily be utilized for soil covers which are finally laid upon each waste deposit.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill project is expected to provide a long term sustainable solid waste management system which is socially acceptable, environmentally friendly and economically feasible for the Metro Colombo Region (MCR).

Sri Lanka Technological Campus registration begins for Engineering Students
Completing its second successful year since launching in 2014, the Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC) has opened registrations for new applicants for its September 2017 intake creating opportunities for talented Sri Lankan students to obtain a worlds best Engineering degrees at an affordable price.
The September 2017 intake is for students who wish to pursue a reputed Engineering qualification from world-renowned colleges like Lancaster University, UK and Deakin University, Australia. These colleges offer the 2+2 undergraduate degree programme in the field of Mechatronic and Electronic Engineering leading to a degree awarded by those universities respectively.
The 2+2 degree programme partnership means that the first two years of the programme would be taught at SLTC, Sri Lanka and the final two years at Lancaster University, UK or Deakin University, Australia. This is the only opportunity for someone in Sri Lanka to read for an Engineering degree from one of the worlds top 1% in university rankings while studying in the country, said President SLTC, Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe. We believe that every student must have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and to be able to afford and access great opportunities.
Under the guidance of the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, the SLTC was launched with the motive of realizing Sri Lankas vision of becoming the knowledge hub in Asia. Fully owned by Sri Lanka Telecom, the campus offers a full four-year degree programme for students, designed to provide sound theoretical, practical and analytical knowledge with the fundamentals of engineering and technology. SLTCs Engineering degree programmes are accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways and recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Sri Lanka.
An impressive faculty comprising industry experts and lecturers who have taken on the onus of providing a sound and knowledgeable education conducts SLTC degree programmes.
Studying at SLTC also means affordability and effectiveness. Students are supported through financial aid, low interest student loans, housing and accommodation, and numerous other benefits offered at this residential campus.
The entry qualification for the degree programme is in line with the Sri Lanka Qualification Framework which includes minimum three passes at the GCE A/L Examination in one and the same sitting in the physical science stream including Combined Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics. Students with the equivalent London A/L results and those with pending A/L results are also encouraged and eligible to apply.
As Sri Lankas only corporate powered, fully residential and research based campus, students at SLTC learn to integrate, study, learn and live together in cohesiveness and camaraderie. Apart from classroom study, students are also groomed to become productive citizens with personal and professional integrity by demonstrating leadership, effective decision-making and to hold the highest ethical standards.

Tribute to Dr. Saman Kelegama
Eminent economist and erudite scholar in Sri Lanka, Dr. Saman Kelegama provided the insightful advocacy and guidance in execution of the tasks of the Government on the wider economic arena of international trade under the Committee of the proposed Agency for International Trade which has been established by the Government with the prime objective of immediately synchronizing the trade and investment nexus in the economic policy agenda of the Government to benefit people of the country through new employment and increased income.
Articulation and implementation of the trade policy has been historically scattered and spread over many agencies.This mostly resulted in the development of adhoc and often conflicting rules, regulations and practices affecting adversely on the expansion of trade and making few to benefit from international trade.
Dr. Kelegama provided the required leadership in the Committee which included the heads of all trade-related agencies of the Government and representatives of the private sector in the Committee of International Trade to bring all inter-related policy as well as cross-institutional elements to a single platform.
Formulation of new trade policy, negotiation of preferential trade agreements, creation of national export promotion strategy, introducing the much awaited in-house legislative and regulatory mechanism related to international trade of Sri Lanka, strengthening trade facilitation, and introducing the required modalities to address internal and external non-tariff measures have been some of the salient initiatives undertaken in the relatively shorter period of his tenure since December 2015.
Under his strong research background, he was also instrumental in preparing a number of studies on costs and benefits of FTAs and has guided the relevant agencies to undertake several initiatives such as reforming the standards and regulations related to imports and exports in developing the trade liberalization programme for Sri Lanka under various FTAs leading to formulation of the mechanism to prepare the negative list/sensitive list on objectively driven systematic economic criteria for the first time ever.
Dr. Kelegamas professional engagement with the Ministry was in addition to his role at the Institute Policy Studies as Executive Director, the position he held until demise.
His long-term collaborations as a member of the professional networks facilitated by World Bank, ADB, UNDP, UNIDO, ILO, UN-ESCAP, Commonwealth Secretariat and his deliberations made at a wider range of international fora, his international experience as one of the top regional trade economists with reputation and recognition among academia, the research community and policy makers and his life-long grip as a full-time Sri Lankan professional living in the country has been advantageous in negotiating the country specific elements.
The enormous contribution made by Dr. Kelegama to the enhancement of international trade will benefit the country.

US-India ties have never been stronger: Trump
US: US President Donald Trump declared Monday that ties between Washington and New Delhi had never been stronger after holding his first talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
As Modi hailed the US as his countrys primary partner in its rapid social and economic transformation, Trump paid tribute to the Indian leader for overseeing growth rates which are faster than any other major economy in the world.
The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better, Trump told reporters in the White House Rose Garden as he stood alongside the Indian Premier.
I am thrilled to salute you, Prime Minister Modi, and the Indian people for all you are accomplishing together.
Your accomplishments have been vast. India has the fastest-growing economy in the world. We hope well be catching you very soon in terms of percentage increase -- I have to tell you, were working on it!
The two men, who both rose to power after portraying themselves as outsiders battling a complacent elite, appeared to make an immediate connection. Modi gave Trump a bear hug during their joint appearance before then showering praise on the US leader.
In our conversation today, President Trump and I have discussed all dimensions of US-India relations, he said at the end of a visit which has seen the announcement of several defense deals.
We want to take our strategic partnership to new heights.
Modi said there was no reason for the US and India to be rivals, stressing that both he and Trump shared a joint desire to increase productivity, growth and job creation.
We consider the United States as our primary partner in Indias socio-economic transformation in all of our flagship programs and schemes, said Modi.
Im sure that convergence between my vision for a new India and President Trumps vision for Making America Great Again will add a new dimension to our cooperation, added Modi in reference to Trumps signature campaign slogan. - AFP

Where prodigies  are made
ST.ANTHONYS COLLEGE, BADDEGAMA, TURNS A CENTURY
St. Anthonys College, Baddegama, successfully accomplishes hundred years of service to the nation this year. Such a long period of service deserves to be appreciated as a nation because the school is the place where the children mould their character to become useful citizens of the country in particular and to the outer world in general. My siblings had their early education in this great seat of learning and I myself had the good fortune to serve on the academic staff there to my credit. Therefore writing about our school in my hometown bears much sentimental value to me.
The genesis of the school could be traced back to the golden age of missionary education in Sri Lanka. It was started in the left room of the missionary house of the St. Anthonys Church in Ganegama, Baddegama. No one would have thought that the humble beginning of this school could go a long way illuminating the vicinity and unlocking the potentials of the rural prodigy not in uncertain terms. The available recorded evidence says that it was founded on January 11, 1911.
Magnificent celebrations
The much-respected pioneer of this great feat is known as Fr P Vanosteen. The two names he has entered in the first attendance register were Francis Wickramasinghe and Pethangoda John. The first teachers had been missionary priests and the nuns. It was acquired by the government on June 1, 1992. Thus the history of the school invites the head of the country, the president, to grace the series of magnificent celebrations organised by the principal, teachers, past pupils and the well-wishers.
The development of the school steadily gathered momentum and in the first year of its existence itself the strength reached 78 and by 1956 it reached 178 having classes from grade six to senior level. The recorded history tells us in 1970 it had been 500.
Another milestone in the proud history of the school is that J P Obesekara, who was highly instrumental in injecting new blood to the school, was an illustrious past pupil. The rapid progress of the school paved the way for the division of the primary and senior sections in 1973 and it greatly resulted oriented.
Principal Indrajith Priyantha Gamage
This great institute of education was able to bag the coveted national productivity award under the able stewardship of then principal Nihal Gurusinghe. Sports and aesthetic sections of the school reached dizzy heights to be envied by other schools in the vicinity. Another feather in her cap is the high percentage of the GCE O-L examination results, at the all-island level; it was 83% in 2016. Moreover, the dedicated teacher in charge of Engineering Technology was able to produce the district first in 2016.The state of the art IT laboratory and the well-equipped language and aesthetic units of the school cater to the student needs to the fullest.
Special awards
On June 1, the president is scheduled to declare open and bestow the two-storied spacious building constructed with the funds of the World Bank to the children of the school. A special awards presentation to the students who have brought credit to the school at both island and international level has also been arranged. Centenary celebration trade fair and students performances are on the agenda too.
In addition, a blood donation campaign, a medical clinic, distribution of spectacles to the needy on the gratis basis will take place. Career guidance workshops and other occupational guidance programmes are to be conducted by the Oceanic University and the German Technical College. The centenary celebrations programme is to be ended with dramas, documentary films, street dramas and well-arranged aesthetic programmes.
The St. Anthonys walk was held last week and most of the illustrious past pupils joined their junior in high spirits.
The incumbent principal Indrajith Priyantha Gamage leaves no stone unturned to keep the good name of the school on the educational map of the country indelibly forever. The dedicated staff of teachers is a tower of strength behind him.
The school motto crested on the logo Go Forward has veritably brought many a prodigy to the vanguard to serve the nation since its inception.

WRIT SOUGHT AGAINST ALLEGED Rs 16 bn revenue fraud ON BMW IMPORTS
A writ petition was filed in the Court of Appeal seeking an order compelling the Customs Director General to conduct a formal Customs Inquiry into Rs 16 billion revenue fraud while importing 1675 units of high valued BMW motor cars during the last regime.
This writ petition was filed by Murugesu Thayabaran, a former Director of the Central Investigation Directorate attached to Sri Lanka Customs through his counsel Nagananda Kodituwakku. The petitioner Thayabaran cited Customs
Director General Chulananda Perera, Customs Additional Director General T.W.A. Senanayake, Customs Deputy Director Saman de Silva, Prestige Automobiles Chairman and Managing Director Heinz Adolf Reuter and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that during his tenure in the Customs Department he had conducted a number of revenue fraud inquiries among which the matter referred to in this petition is the biggest fraud ever detected by the Customs.
The value of this fraud runs into over Rs 16 billion of government tax revenue defrauded by Prestige Automobiles, the fourth respondent. The Petitioner stated that the revenue fraud reported involves the importation of 1675 units of high valued BMW motor cars during the the period commencing from March 2011 to Oct 2014.
Thayabaran said that all the vehicles referred to in this case have been imported on tax concessions granted to permits issued by the government to certain categories of people holding public office, wherein strict conditions had been stipulated in the permits, which included the specified sealing on the engine capacity and the value of the vehicle.
The Petitioner states that the investigation findings had revealed that the total number of 1675 units of BMW motorcars had been imported under the tax concessionary permits with false values declared in order to be qualified to claim tax concession, thereby evading the payment of levies actually payable on those vehicles. Yet, it was further revealed that the 4th Respondent had recovered the true value of the vehicles from the permit holders under a false pretence that the said recovery was for handling and after sales services, he added. The Petitioner stated that had the true value of the vehicles been declared, the permits would have become a nullity since one of the primary conditions of the permits, the specified valuation threshold has been violated.
The Petitioner stated that the 4th Respondent had been engaged in this fraudulent trade practice for a considerable period of time and in some cases where BMW motorcars had been imported on concessionary permit schemes, the Customs Department has been able to recover the Original invoice sent by the BMW car manufacturer in Germany to the 4th Respondents Company and also the fictitious invoice generated by Navigare International GMBH in Germany for the identical vehicle, to claim the special concessionary rate of levy chargeable for permit cars.
The Petitioner states that there is a deliberate failure on the part of the first Respondent and the third Respondent to perform their offices as required by law which clearly amounts to abusing, exceeding or misusing of the powers vested in the 1st and 3rd Respondents for improper purposes.
The Petitioner states that therefore, on April 27, 2017 he made a formal complaint on this serious abuse to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption drawing its due attention to this major revenue fraud running into over Rs 16 billion.

Written as if in a trance
Those of us who are interested in Lankan English Literature are familiar with the profile and works of the internationally celebrated prolific writer, Jean Arasanayagam. But the relatively less known husband of her, popularly known as Arasa, is an equally brilliant playwright and poet. He was one of the winners of the prestigious Gratiaen Prize. The couple live in Kandy. Parvathi, one of their daughters, is also a poet.
In his well-constructed book of 16 poems within 66 pages, White Lanterns: Wesak 2011, T Arasanayagam gives us a medley of his varied felt experiences he had had. The writer is an English teacher.
In his acknowledgement, he says: To my family for the continuing encouragement in all literary endeavours and for the trust and belief they have in my talents and potential as a creative writer.
His talents as a creative writer are now proved by the publication of the book.
Let us see what his poems tell us and how poetic is his endeavour.
The opening poem, Mother, is a beautifully compressed account of Hindu funeral rites. In this, a rebellious son succumbs to the tradition.
For the information of the non-Hindus, I give below some aspects of the last rites as narrated by Arasa:
Holding flaming torch behind,
go round thrice, they tell me,
dont look back but forward, they tell me,
now stop, face away walk backwards holding torch behind, they tell me,
and I in a trance hear a voice distant, exhorting,
place it, place it, look not back, walk away.
Walk.
Crackling dry wood touching my senses,
and I led away from burning pyre,
duty done with an umbilical tug of conscience ashes to ashes,
words reverberate
as urn flung onto ocean
tide will carry her away back to the elements as will I in time,
going back to Brahma, from whence I came.
His second poem is both nostalgic and the present, using the bird Koels (Kuyil in Tamil) sad song on the plight of the displaced but ends the poem with a positive note as singing your song of hope for the displaced.
Even though I am a Hindu, I feel jealous over Arasanayagams selective words to describe another Hindu act of worship in his poem, Pooja to Saturn. Please read it yourself as I want to save space in this review.
Arasanayagam writes about his observations and experiences of his youthful days in such an authoritative manner as a Tamil who has not forgotten his roots and cultural traits.
This attempt serves the useful purpose of telling others via the English medium some aspects of Tamil culture in Lanka.
He liberally uses Tamil words that in turn would educate the non-Tamils to equate the meanings of the words in their respective languages.
An Elegy to an IDP is a telling commentary on the immediate past where most of us in the North and East encountered.
The title poem to the poet concludes with this stanza:
The Spirits of the Dead
I see them now,
white in the darkness
moving, floating, flying,
and waving their whiteness
in the ocean of Darkness, Spirits of the Dead.
Please read rest of his poems as well. I like the freshness of thought, although the bitterness in the poets life overwhelms over some positive things in life, and of course the employment of creative use of language. Thiagaraja Arasanayagam should continue to write more poems and fiction.

The state of Zimbabwe cricket today is a sad story. When they were granted Test status in 1992 Zimbabwe were looked as one of the top contenders in world cricket with a galaxy of cricketers of the calibre of Dave Houghton, Andy Pycroft, the Flower brothers Andy and Grant, Eddo Brandes, Heath Streak, Alastair Campbell, Neil Johnson and Murray Goodwin to name a few.
But over the years Zimbabwe cricket has deteriorated to the extent that they are no longer the cricketing force they were once in the world, but just another team making the numbers with countries like Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland who were granted Test status after them forging ahead.
At present Zimbabwe is ranked tenth and last in the Test standings and 11th out of 12 in ODIs.
Fast bowling all-rounder Heath Streak who was part of the Zimbabwe team when it was at the zenith of its powers and who is currently their head coach described the decline as the lack of international cricket that Zimbabwe plays today that have made players seek greener pastures.
Its well documented theres been a lot of players who have left and are playing around the world who come from Zimbabwe, said Streak at the media conference held at Movenpick Hotel yesterday after the Zimbabwe cricketers arrived for a five-match one-day international series and a one-off Test against Sri Lanka.
Its been tough for Zimbabwe to retain some of these players and hence we are constantly rebuilding. As we speak now we got a lot of young guys in our team. If you look round the world and look at Zimbabweans internationally we got the likes of Gary Ballance, the Curran boys (Sam and Tom) who just started playing for England, Kyle Jarvis playing county cricket successfully.
We got a lot of these guys out there whom we are trying to lure back. Part of their problem is that the volume of cricket that Zimbabwe plays, thats something that we cant address, obviously its a catch 22 situation. Weve got to play good competitive cricket for other countrys to give matches for us and thats something we are really targeting and hopefully get some of those players to return to Zimbabwe and complement a talented group of players that we have brought to the shores of Sri Lanka, he said.
Having to coach a team that is constantly losing some of its best players Streak described as a big challenge to any coach.
You inherit the players and your job is to try and get the best out of them. I certainly think that the team weve got here has got the ability to win against any side, said Streak.
Its going to be a challenge because of the lack of cricket. We have these big gaps in between series and thats probably our biggest challenge to get the guys to get used to playing at elite level. We had some good preparation coming into the series and I am looking forward to a lot of guys who can pull around. The future of Zimbabwe cricket is brighter if we keep doing the right things, he said.
Streak and the team manager represented Zimbabwe at the press conference as Graeme Cremer the captain was indisposed.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said that the off-field incidents that had taken place ahead of the series would not affect his team when they take on Zimbabwe in the first of five ODIs starting at Galle on June 30.
The team has been in the limelight after the cricketers were accused of being unfit by the Sports Minister following their dismal performance in the recently concluded Champions Trophy in England, the resignation of coach Graham Ford and the comments made by fast bowler Lasith Malinga against the Minister.
What happens outside the cricket field we dont think a lot about it. Our job is to concentrate on our cricket. As players we always look to perform well, said Mathews.
Its beyond our control (Graham) Ford leaving. Our job is to go out there and perform at our very best. Fordy has been fantastic, one of the best in the business but weve got to move on and look ahead towards this series.

Cabinet decides SAITM Hospital to be nationalised
Equitable solution to all parties to be given:
The Cabinet approved a proposal made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to nationalise the Neville Fernando Hospital, United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Kabir Hashim said.
Adressing the media at the Governments Information Department together with the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) he said the Government will continue to execute South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) through a trust fund or as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) or through stocks of SAITM being traded in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) while 51 percent of the ownership of the stock capital would be held with the Government.
The Government will explore the three options and choose the most effective and the suitable mechanism to run SAITM, he added.
He also said that the SAITM issue was solely a production of the previous regime and no contribution was made to the SAITM issue by the present regime.
The UNP General Secretary said, However, a solution which will be equitable to all aggrieved parties including medical students and doctors will be taken by the Government. Measures will also be taken to ensure that free education will not adversely affected by any of the solutions taken.
Hashim further said that there was a shortage of 6000 doctors in the country and the Government will make allocations to uplift the medical education and its facilities to overcome this shortage.
New medical colleges will be established in Moratuwa, Sabaragamuwa, Ruhuna and Wayamba, he added.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said that ministers could have personal opinions on the SAITM issue but what should be officially considered is the Governments statement issued by the Presidential Secretariat.
Dissanayake also said that what made university students and doctors voice opposition to the execution of SAITM as a medical college was mainly due to the suspicions they had on the quality of the medical education of the SAITM and that how it would affect the free education. He further said, 300,000 students are admitted to grade one annually while only 25,000 students enter universities for higher education every year.Therefore, we request the university students to be more responsible in their behavior as they are the future of the country.

## Title: That breach of protocol
## Supertitle:

That breach of protocol
Sri Lankas envoy in Japan Ganganath Dissanayake has been given a rap on the knuckles by the higher echelons of the Yahapalanaya government for extending protocol assistance and courtesies to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during the latters visit to that country. The envoy, by way of explanation had stated that he was acting in terms of the instructions he received from the Foreign Ministry, which wanted the protocol assistance and courtesies be extended to the former President and his entourage, citing two circulars in this regard. However, it was pointed out by the higher authorities that there was only one circular that is applicable and this permitted protocol assistance and courtesies to be extended only to the President, Prime Minister, Speaker, Leader of the Opposition and state ministers. Ganganath, in his response, has also cited an instance, where during a visit to Japan last year by Rajapaksa, the Foreign Ministry had deferred from the latest instructions. Since he had not received a response from the ministry seeking a clarification he had proceeded with the original instructions.
Be that as it may, nobody will begrudge the protocol and courtesies extended to a former Head of State during his/ her visit to another country, never mind any circulars to this effect. On the contrary, cold shouldering a Lankan Head of State in a foreign country by the government will smack of, not just ingratitude, but could also bring public opprobrium on the countrys rulers and allegations of envy, nay revenge. However, the dignitary concerned should also act and conduct himself/herself in a manner that befits the extension of such official courtesies of the state and desist in any way from being critical of the incumbent regime, openly or by innuendo.
However, this was the last thing that Rajapaksa has been doing during his foreign visits so far undertaken since his ouster from office two and a half years ago. On all these occasions Rajapaksa never missed an opportunity to badmouth the government on foreign soil, and what is more, make pronouncements that could even have an economic impact on the country. In Japan, during his latest visit, Rajapaksa stated that Sri Lankan businessmen in Japan, particularly vehicle importers, were complaining that they were no longer able to survive due to the disastrous policies of the Yahapalanaya government. One would have thought that Sri Lankan businessmen in Japan hardly relied on Sri Lankan government policies to prosper as businessmen in Japan and particularly dependent on Sri Lanka for their vehicle exports.
But the statement, coming from a former Head of State of Sri Lanka, no doubt, could create doubts among prospective Japanese investors to the country as to the state of its economy. Enjoying the protocol assistance and diplomatic courtesies extended by the Sri Lankan envoy, Rajapaksa, addressing a gathering of Sri Lankans says that all Lankans living in Japan were critical of the Yahapalanaya government and was clamouring for a regime change. What is more, the envoy had gone the whole hog and extended official courtesies to Rajapaksa and his entourage up to the point of customs clearance after being privy to all that was said against the government by MR in Japan. Is it therefore anything to wonder at the highest in the land being incensed at the official courtesies being extended to Rajapaksa ala the pithy Sinhala saying Illan kewa (asked for and got it.)
It is time that the government lay down in explicit terms as to who should receive diplomatic protocol and official courtesies during their visits abroad. Rajapaksas, indeed, was a private visit and certainly did not warrant such niceties- not going by his past performances anyway, when abroad. Rajapaksa himself should consider his position with circumspection. He is, after all, a former Head of State and ought to know better. He should take a leaf out of the book of his predecessors and conduct himself with the dignity and honour befitting that of a former Head of State. JRJ took it easy after retirement, confining himself to after dinner speeches and gracing selected events as Chief Guest. DBW was virtually unheard of after he exited the scene. CBK no doubt is still in the limelight but never aspired for political office after remaining at the helm for just over a decade. Mahinda Rajapaksa broke with this tradition and once more ventured into electoral politics, after serving two terms as President and failed going for a third.
In that context, MR is the only retired Head of State among Sri Lankan leaders who has opted to stay put, even though he has passed the psalmists life span of three score and ten years, perhaps still harbouring the prospect of grabbing the crown that was which was taken away from him. Rajapaksa cannot be found fault with, though, for trying to extend his political career and also for his attacks on the government as an Opposition MP, except when he goes beyond the ken and demeans himself and the high office he once held, in his quest for power.

## Title: Petrol underpriced in SL

Petrol underpriced in SL
Sri Lanka should not miss the opportunity to implement the long-delayed fuel pricing formula since oil prices have softened, said Economist Murtaza Jafferjee from J. B. Securities.
Petrol is in underpriced in Sri Lanka, and there remains a case to further increase prices to fully reflect all externalities especially congestion and traffic accidents. Further, with more fuel-efficient vehicles due to hybrids and small engines the tax intensity per unit of road mileage has gone down over the years, Jafferjee said.
Diesel which is significantly underpriced, enjoys a post-tax subsidy and there are no corrective taxes applied although consumption is more than 50% of Petrol.
Although international oil prices were down by 50% in 2016 in comparison to 2014 the trade deficit increased from USD 8.26 billion to USD 9.09 billion (+10%) due to high imports.
Over the last one month Brent crude has dropped by 16.5% (however, it had rallied in May), Gasoline (Petrol) is down by 8.33% and Gas Oil (Diesel) is down by 10% - there is always a lag between crude and distillates due to inventory that refineries carry.
There is also a strong case to gradually introduce corrective taxes to both petrol and diesel to account for externalities; this can be done with increments of Rs 0.5 a litre per month so that the consumer will not feel the pinch, he said.
On a per liter basis Petrol retails at Rs 117, the taxes are approximately Rs 56.50, one month ago based on spot Gasoline prices the loss was Rs 12.50, it has now reduced to Rs 8. Sri Lanka consumes around 130 million liters a month, even at reduced world market prices the loss to the industry due to under recovery of taxes is Rs 1.04 billion a month, if the current trend holds it works out to Rs 12.48 billion a year.
On a per liter basis Diesel retails at Rs 95, the taxes are approximately Rs 29.50, one month ago based on spot gas oil prices the loss was Rs 6.70, it has now reduced to Rs 0.45.
The country consumes around 200 million liters a month, at the current reduced world market prices the loss to the industry due to under recovery of taxes is Rs 90 million a month, it was Rs 1.34 billion a month ago.
At the refinery level Diesel is normally a few percentage points more expensive than Petrol. Due to lower taxes and under the current administered price Diesel is at 23% discount to Petrol. Most items accrue a duty of 30%, NBT of 2%, PAL of 7.5% and VAT of 15% thus the taxes on a finished good import is 62.5%, the tax on Diesel at current spot prices is 51.3% and on Petrol it is 97.6%.
Petroleum products are imported, if they are not priced appropriately demand will be more than what it should be, for example in 2016 Petrol volumes grew 19% and Diesel volumes grew 16% whilst real total consumption grew only 0.73%.
Underpricing leads to excess consumption creating massive traffic jams on the roads, pressures the balance of payment and results in exporting the countrys meager wealth to oil exporting countries.
Compared to Sri Lanka Petrol in Chennai (India does not have uniformnational prices) and Bangladesh is 36% and 39% more expensive respectively but 9% cheaper in Pakistan. In the case of Diesel, it is 42%, 25% and 30% more expensive in Chennai, Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively.
We price diesel at a 18.8% discount to Petrol but it is at a 15% discount in Chennai, at premium of 11.3% in Pakistan and at a discount of 24.4% in Bangladesh, he said.
Sri Lankas GDP per capital (2015 World Bank figures) at USD 3,926 is more than double that of India (USD 1,593), Pakistan (USD 1,435) and Bangladesh (USD 1,211).

SLs unitary status, Buddhism upheld during foreign relations
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said his ministry will maintain relations and dealings with the international community in a manner which will uphold the pre-eminent position given to the countrys unitary status and Buddhism in the Constitution, while protecting Sri Lanka's identity.
The Yahapalana government has been able to win over the international world by changing the countrys unfavourable international image during the last two years and former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had made a great stride in this direction, he said.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake stated this when he called on Most Ven Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his aramaya in Kandy and received his blessings.
The Malwatte prelate in his anusasana said skilled youthful officials should be selected to serve in the diplomatic service instead of retired persons. Some members of Sri Lanka's present diplomatic corps didnt seem to be making any contribution towards rebuilding Sri Lankas image abroad.
He had pointed this out on several previous occasions too and previous governments had not taken any account about the matter. The prelate said even though the international world appreciated the Yahapalana Government, certain local groups could not see its values. Minister Karunanayake said three Sri Lankan diplomats who failed in their duties had been recalled recently after discussions with the President and the Prime Minister. The government would always make it a point to appoint capable and efficient individuals as ambassadors. He said at present, there were 63 Sri Lankan diplomats serving in foreign stations. He said diplomatic relations would be set up with several new countries shortly as trade and investment were much needed to steer the country forward. Later speaking to the media, Minister Karunanayake said former Foreign Minister Prof G L Peiris gave a series of written undertakings to the International Community on the instructions of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. When the former government failed to abide by them, the International Community started placing obstacles to the country, he said.

SL can serve as fulcrum of modern Indian Ocean region
Given the shift in global power to the Indian Ocean, Sri Lankas geostrategic location places it in a unique position to serve as the fulcrum of a modern Indian Ocean region, said Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake.
Speaking at the IOMAC-ONS Certificate Course Awards Ceremony in Integrated Marine Affairs Management at the BMICH, he said that in a modern context, one of the most important sea lanes of communication runs just South of Dondra Head where close to 200 ships traverse daily.
These ships take energy supplies to countries in East Asia and beyond, the Minister said.
Sri Lanka can exploit its location to gain significant economic benefits while simultaneously shouldering the responsibility of ensuring the safety and security of the vessels passing so close to its shore, he said.
Being an island nation the Ocean that surrounds us can be both a source of strength or weakness, depending on our ability to effectively exploit its geostrategic potential.
The sea is a strategic part of the countrys security. Maritime security is of critical importance for the protection of our resources and keeping the country safe from external threats. Our waters are expected to contribute significantly to economic growth in time to come. This necessitates the balancing of competing interests in order to conserve our waters and protect the sea as a long-term resource, Minister Karunanayake said.
Whilst fortune has favoured Sri Lanka with a unique geographic location, it remains in our hands to identify and develop our strategic potential and value. I believe the development of our strategic potential is intrinsically linked to the Indian Ocean and Sri Lanka is well placed to play a central role in Indian Ocean Affairs in the future.
I believe this well captures the centrality of Ocean Affairs to Sri Lanka. Our very survival will depend on safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed oceans.

5-year-old girl's dying wish to "marry" her 6-year-old best friend comes true

With a sparkly crown, pink tulle skirt and rhinestone-lined silk top, 5-year-oldEileidh Patersonfelt like a princess as she walked down the aisle to meet her future "husband."
It was a fairy tale the terminally ill girl dreamed up with her mom after she was diagnosed with stage 4neuroblastoma-- a cancer that is commonly found in the adrenal glands and, in her case, had spread to other organs.
"When we were told in February that any treatment now would just prolong her life and that ultimately she wouldn't survive, we decided to make abucket listof things she would love to do and make as many memories as possible," Eileidh's mother, Gail Paterson, told CBS News.
A trip to Disneyland Paris, a room decorated bright pink and a trip to the zoo are among some of the things on Eileidh's list.
But none compared to her No. 1 choice: marrying her best friend, 6-year-old Harrison Grier.
"Harrison has said for over a year that he was going to marry her," Paterson said. "He even 'borrowed' one of his mom's rings to give to her."
On June 18, Eileidh and Harrison finally got their wish.
Surrounded by family, friends and Disney characters, the pair stood in front of an altar as they were readtheir very own fairy tale, written by Eileidh's mom.
Eileidh was described as a princess who would "stop at nothing to survive," despite her cancer -- the "beast" -- continuously trying to destroy her.
"It took her hair but it couldn't take her smile," Paterson wrote.
Thousands of people stood behind Eiledh in the fight as members of her army, which includes Harrison, Paterson said.
"Harrison wants to marry Eileidh more than anything so that's what they decided to do," the story read. "If Eileidh and Harrison can be happy, smile and enjoy the little things then that's what we should all do. Make the most of every single day as no one knows what will happen the next. Enjoy life, enjoy each other, stand strong and more than anything, believe, hope and love. If anyone deserves a happily every after, then it is most definitely them."
As the story came to a happy ending, Eileidh and Harrison were declared best friends forever. Instead of rings, they exchanged St. Christopher necklaces.
"It reflects the journey through life that they now face together," Paterson explained.
Eileidh was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma at the age of 2.
Since then, the little girl has spent the majority of her young life in and out of hospitals, receiving countless chemotherapies, surgeries, anesthetics, blood tests -- the list goes on and on, her mom explained.
For once, on her daughter's "wedding day," Paterson was happy to see her child be just that -- a child.
She danced, laughed with friends, read stories with princesses and ate cake with her best friend, Harrison.
"Anything we can do to make her life that little bit easier, comfier and most importantly magical, then we owe that to her," Paterson said. "She most certainly deserves it. Eileidh is the bravest little girl in the world and is definitely a superhero."

South African-born Nic Pothas appointed as interim head coach of the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming series against Zimbabwe and India is being looked at as a long term coach as well according to Sri Lanka Cricket.
In confirming Pothas appointment as interim head coach, Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala, said, We have every confidence that Nic Pothas can take on the role of head coach and carry on thats why we have appointed him for the Zimbabwe and India series. We have a strategic plan to engage the next coach and Nic Pothas is also a good contender for it. There are professional coaches who are currently engaged and shown a lot of interest and we are confident we will have one at the end of the Indian tour. We will not have to look too far to find somebody who will be competent to take this team till the 2019 World Cup.
Pothas was engaged as a fielding coach of the national team on August 8 and following the shock resignation of Graham Ford as head coach after the Champions Trophy he has been promoted to undertake the role of interim head coach in addition to his duties as fielding coach.
Sumathipala also said that there were also Sri Lanka Cricket coaches who have shown interest in the job but added, We will have to first discuss with our cricket committee and our support team the plan and structure - what kind of coach that we are looking at. When we looked at Dav Whatmore he was a developing coach, he could develop an ordinary team to a world class side.
There are coaches very good at looking after professional advanced ongoing teams. We have to make an assessment on the situation and deploy the right person with the right spirit.

After much wait and anxious anticipation, the 13th edition of the Raigam Telees saw the light of day last Saturday. The gala ceremony, forced to be put on hold for several weeks by the floods, dedicated a good portion of its first half hour to remember, appreciate, revere and pay a tribute to immortal Amaradeva who bade farewell to the nation just a few months ago. It took a beat to recognise the talent radiant with creative brilliance.
Podi Malli and Chuti Malli injected a little comedy into the audience while many other vocalists and choreographers inundated the audience with unique aesthetic opulence. The ceremony moved on at a steady pace well into midnight with President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and a spectacle of distinguished personnel on board.

Bolt to make European bow in farewell season
OSTRAVA: Jamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt will on Wednesday make his first appearance in Europe in his farewell season.
Bolt, winner of eight Olympic and 11 world gold medals, will bring down the curtain on his glittering career at Augusts world championships in London.
After kicking off his season on home soil in Kingston, the 30-year-old chose Ostrava and the Diamond League meet in Monaco as his two pre-worlds warm-up events.
It will be Bolts ninth appearance in the northeastern Czech city, where organiser Alfons Juck has unashamedly gone out of his way to tailor the meet to the Jamaicans plans for the season. We gave priority in our preparation and the whole set-up of the meet to Usain, Juck told AFP.
Bolt said a Czech visit was always on the cards. One meet I was always going to come to was Ostrava, he said.
That is not to say the meet has not attracted other stars, although there is a dearth of US and Jamaican athletes.
South African Wayde van Niekerk will compete in the rarely-run 300m, aiming to shoot down Bolts meet record of 30.97sec, set back in 2010.
Kenyan 800m star David Rudisha goes in the 1,000m, while Britains Mo Farah competes in his final 10,000m on the IAAF circuit before quitting the track for road racing after the London worlds.
Van Niekerk summed up the athletes sentiments that the meet was all about one person, however, Bolt.
All about Bolt
This years really about honouring him and what hes done for the sport, said the 24-year-old South African, who beat Michael Johnsons world record when winning Olympic 400m gld in Rio last year to add to his world crown.
Hes been a massive inspiration to myself and to many other athletes out there.
Hopefully, we as an upcoming generation can take the baton and continue what hes done. Farah has similarly dominated his events.
Since winning silver over 10k at the 2011 world champs in Daegu, the 34-year-old Londoner has enjoyed an unbroken streak of nine global final wins (the 5000m in 2011, and the double at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and the 2013 and 2015 worlds).
Due to trade in the track for a pitch at conquering the marathon, Farah was full of praise for Bolt.
The guys incredible, what hes done for the sport, he said.
Its going to come to an end at some point. I see him as a role model, someone I look up to. When you go through a down patch and say how am I going to do it, hes shown us the way and Im just glad to be part of it. Bolts presence has ensured a sell-out 15,000-capacity crowd at the Mestsky stadium.
Also competing will be Kenyas Olympic steeplechase gold medallist Conseslus Kipruto, and American double Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor returns to the place of his first major medals at World U18 Championships in Ostrava 2007.

Books  no longer stationary
For all those interested in reading books but who have very little access to books and have to walk several kilometres to access a library, `mobile libraries are an easy way out. With this in mind, Abhimana Development Foundation, Matale has rolled out a mobile library truck and a Media Centre in Monaragala district.
In an ambitious drive to promote early literacy and a reading culture amongst rural children in Monaragala district, a mobile library will travel into remote village areas to reach such children and to give them a chance to access new books and expand their knowledge.
Friendly environment
Moreover, the project launched by Abhimana Community Development Association and funded by ChildFund Sri Lanka aims to improve the competitiveness of children both in-school and out-of-school, while establishing a friendly environment to access reading, writing, and media facilities.
And plans are also afoot to extend the project to Mullaitivu district shortly.
Stocked with hundreds of titles on various topics, these mobile trucks cater to numerous book lovers. The mobile libraries are stocked with a wide collection of well-chosen, age-appropriate and context relevant books mainly targeting school children.
The books and reading materials include children story books, novels, translations and books in a variety of categories such as the social sciences, languages, pure and applied sciences, literature, religion and history, teaching, learning and educational materials and much more. There will be books in Sinhala, Tamil and English languages.
Speaking on this, Child Fund National Director, Katherine Manik said, I am very happy that we are able to support this initiative with our partner Abhimana Community Development Association. Its a great way to take books to rural neighbourhoods and classrooms, and a wonderful way to encourage children to read.
Reading activities
The mobile library trucks will be stationed in a school during school time in the selected divisions. During this time, children will have a chance to read books and they will be provided facilities such as desks and chairs to read. The truck will visit one school twice a month.
And also reading activities and storytelling, reading sessions with children will be conducted in the school premises.
The mobile library truck will also be stationed at community centres (especially at child resource centres) daily for the duration of three to four hours in the evening, to engage children in reading activities according to their reading level. This is expected to foster the healthy use of community recreational spaces.
One book at a time
The children are encouraged to take the books home and return them during subsequent visits to the mobile library, just the way a library functions. However, one child can only take one book at a time.
At the child resource centre learning programs will be conducted in the evenings. There will be a set of learning videos, childrens movies, songs, and other resources including the internet during that time.
Multi-media facilities will be used to conduct awareness sessions to communities on the importance of education and the ability to read and write as well as on current affairs.
Abhimana Community Development Association encourages those interested in donating books to this worthy cause. If anyone interested, they can contact the foundation on (94) 662284100/ 0718723663/ 0718034863 or via [emailprotected].

In its third edition Swim Week Colombo launched the Art Connect on June 27 at Trace Expert City. Art Connect returned for its second season and features six of Sri Lankas most acclaimed artistes. Swim Week Colombo, with its title partner Olu Tropical Water, hosted this curated event that is highly anticipated by many a fashion personality and is an initiative that explores a meaningful interaction between art and fashion.
Art and Fashion has a deep relationship. The expressive nature of these two creative streams is encompassed in Art Connect. This edition of Art Connect is the interpretation of the Green Conscious position of Swim Week through the eyes of 6 important artists.  Ajai V. Singh
The artists collaborating with Swim Week Colombo for the exhibition are Anoma Wijewardene, Mahen Perera, Bandu Manamperi, Vajira Gunawardena, Chathurika Jayani and Ajith Susantha. These six acclaimed artists will exhibit their expressions of the theme REVIVE.
Anoma Wijewardene, an alumna of Central St Martins College, University of the Arts, London, was also a visiting lecturer there. She is known for creating images that depict mans existential anxieties, contemporary concerns about the human condition and internal tussle with his nature and his fellow man. Anomas work has been displayed at the V&A Museum and the House of Commons in London and she has also exhibited at Sothebys Gallery Hong Kong.
Mahen Perera is an artist who works mainly with found objects and material detritus that are often ignored and seeks to analyse and challenge the conventional language used to talk about issues of identity and representation. Trained in multidisciplinary design at the National Design Centre in Colombo, he went on to pursue his BA in Fine Arts from the Lasalle College of the Arts, Singapore in affiliation with the Open University, UK.
Bandu Manamperi is a leading figure in recent social art projects carried out under the aegis of Theertha, including Lets Take a Walk and Ape Gama. He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture and is a core member of Colombos Theertha Artists Collective, Sri Lanka. Bandu was one of the first performance artists in Sri Lanka, creating highly personal art experiences based on the transformation of his own body, but he doesnt limit himself to any one genre and his art practice also encompasses sculpture, drawing and painting, and installation art.
Vajira Gunawardena questions the reality and the representations of reality in a bargaining world. Hence he concentrates on subjects such as politics, metaphysic, culture, history, consumerism, myths and ethics. Internal body of his work is interested in using the figurative forms, assemblage and stencil techniques. Each motif is a specific archetype that uses line, colour and space to form a cognitive-based narrative that explores inhuman space in daily lives.
Chathurika Jayani is a young gifted artist who establishes a story that is defined by both dimension and texture. The use of mixed media creating a layered three-dimensional visual on her canvas is effective in illustrating this aesthetic. The artist completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo and has participated in numerous group exhibitions both locally and abroad.
Ajith Susantha is a dynamic experimentalist who is forever coming up with innovative design ideas in acrylics, mixed media & 3D sculpture of various types. Ajith holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Institute of Aesthetic Studies, from the University of Kelaniya and ever since has exhibited his works in England and Norway, as well as the Colombo galleries.
These artistic interpretations shared at Art Connect stimulated thoughts and inspired new ideas among designers and manufacturers, as with last years edition. Through these unconventional, yet related means, it is expected that a new wave in Sri Lankas fashion realm will be initiated.

Minister assures to look into salary issues:
Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, while assuring to look into the salary issues of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers, yesterday requested them not to resort to inconvenience the public through trade union actions.
The minister addressing a press conference at his Ministry said a Committee headed by the CEB Vice Chairman has been asked to submit a report by August on the CEB workers salary issues. Several TUs of the CEB has organised a strike and demonstration today urging the immediate intervention of the authorities to resolve their salary issues.
The minister said the CEB Director Board was having series of discussions with regard to this problem with its 60 TUs. He said he hopes to submit a Cabinet paper next week to resolve the salary issues of the CEB workers.
Towards the end of 2014, the CEB engineers received a salary hike and they received another salary hike when all CEB employees received 30 percent salary increase as per a joint agreement. Non-engineers were of the view that it was unfair by them. We have paid our serious attention to this matter.
The CEB has about 22,000 employees and increasing their salaries must be done after careful thought. Four court cases have been filed in this regard and we have to consider the legal aspect as well, he said.

Whither are we, as a nation
If we consider our progress for the last 60 years, we cannot be happy.
Financially, our country is not in a stable good position. This is not a secret. The government is telling that we are in a debt crisis.
Our GDP is very low compared to a country like Singapore.
Our salaries are very low compared to other progressive countries.
What has happened to our industries Can we be happy
Did we have peace and harmony in our country during the last 40 years What is the position now
Have we been able to settle our disputes satisfactorily
All these failures indicate one thing. There is something wrong with our values. About 50 years back, we respected our teachers and our native doctors. We respected our religious leaders. We respected our politicians who were doing a real service to the country. They never came to politics to earn money or accumulate wealth.
See what has happened today. We respect people by looking at the luxury car they are using. The bracelet they are wearing. The luxury houses they have. A number of foreign trips they make. The mobile phones they use.
Take an actor or actress. We respect her or him from their outer look. The perfumes they use. Their makeups. The expensive dresses they wear. We do not value their real talent.
We must understand that our values define us.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act. It is a habit.

Medical Officer of Health, Biyagama, Kumari Wijesuriya said, The recent floods in Sri Lanka caused devastating loss to life and property, leaving many communities helpless.
Commenting on Coca-Colas flood relief operations, Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd said, Coca-Cola responded to the recent floods by providing those affected with access to water and medical camps.

Confusion REIGNS among Lawyers
Lakshan Dias controversy:
Contradicting the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretarys letter, Convener of the Lawyers for Democracy Presidents Counsel J.C Weliamuna said that the BASL had not adopted a decision to call for an affidavit from Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias.
BASL President U. R Silva PC speaking to the Daily News said that it was not an order made to Dias but instead was a request.
However, the letter sent by BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya to Lakshan Dias on June 24 states The House decided that the BASL request you to submit an affidavit with all the facts pertaining to the matter, in order to take necessary action in this regard.

Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Weliamuna said that the calling for an affidavit from Dias was a decision taken by the President of the Bar Council in his capacity as President and that such decision was not adopted by the body.
U.R De Silva also affirmed to the Daily News that there was no decision taken by the body calling for the affidavit.
Weliamuna said that during the Bar Council meeting held on Saturday the June 24 four senior lawyers raised serious concerns over Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes comments on Lakshan Dias and they emphasised that the Bar Council should take serious note of the Ministers statement.
The seniors requested the council to release a statement either condemning or to take serious note of it (the Ministers statement). Meanwhile, some other lawyers argued in favour of the Minister. As there were differences of opinion within the Council itself, the President decided to call for an affidavit from Lakshan Dias.
The President said he will refer it to the Bar Council after the affidavit is submitted, he said.
When questioned whether Minister Rajapakshe asked BASL to take disciplinary action against Lakshan Dias, Weliamuna refuted it by saying that it was never mentioned by the President at the meeting.
I dont know whether it came after the council meeting but it was never mentioned at the meeting, he said.
The President of the Bar Association also affirmed that the Minister had not called for such action from the Body.
BASL Secretary Attorney at law Amal Randeniya said that an email was sent by the Association to Dias requesting him to submit an affidavit to the Association.
Weliamuna further said that the association should not be a political stooge of the executive or legislature. They would have sent a letter stating that the house has adopted it, which is very wrong, Weliamuna said.
The issue came to light after Lakshan Dias said on Television that 195 places of worship belonging to Christians had been attacked after the election of the current government.
The President, the Cardinal and the Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana rejected the claim calling for accountability on the numbers mentioned by Dias.
The Justice Minister of also called for the derobing of Dias. Reports said that Dias had fled the country as a result of the uproar.

Court temporally releases Mahindanandas passport to obtain US visa
The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to temporally release former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamages passport for him to obtain United States visa.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage sought Courts permission to travel to the United States from July 15.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne made the order following a request by defence counsel.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in connection with an indictment filed against him by the Attorney General for alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs.3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union, Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa and Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appearing for the accused raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the case over a jurisdiction issue. Defence counsel argued that the trade union, Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress, was located in Nawalapitiya and bank transaction pertaining to the incident had been taken place through a state bank in that area.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing for the Attorney General told Court that the concerned money pertaining to the transaction had been deported in a bank account in Colombo, belonging to a security officer of Mahindananda Aluthgamage. He maintained that there is no jurisdiction issue pertaining to the case since money had been deposited in a bank account in Colombo.
The High Court Judge ordered the both parties to file their written submissions regarding preliminary objections on July 25.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs.1,000,000, misappropriated Rs.1,900,000 and misappropriated another Rs.1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress in October, 2012 till April 2013. The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code. The Attorney General has listed 13 persons as the witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items of the case.

De Villiers on brink of Test retirement
AB de Villiers is expected to retire from Test cricket as early as August, in a second attempt at hanging up his whites, unless CSA can convince him to stay on again.
It is learnt that de Villiers informed CSA of his decision to give up the longest format late last year, but was instead offered a year out of the game in a bid to get him to reconsider. However, de Villiers is understood to contemplating Test retirement when he meets CSA officials following the appointment of a new coach in August, in an attempt to continue playing white-ball cricket for South Africa until the 2019 World Cup. CSA have declined to comment.
Before leaving the UK for a two-month break at home, de Villiers said he and CSA would make a final decision about what happens for the next few years when they meet in a few weeks time, and indicated that the appointment of the new coach would be key to his future.
Incumbent Russell Domingos contract is up at the end of the current tour to England and several sources have confirmed he has not reapplied for the post despite the support of the players, including de Villiers.
But, insiders have revealed there is more on de Villiers mind than the question of who will take charge of the side. Those close to de Villiers say the batsman has wanted to retire from Test cricket since sustaining the elbow injury that kept him out of the New Zealand, Australia and Sri Lanka Tests last season.

Extra RS. 33 B incurred for electricity in 2017
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had to bear an additional cost of Rs 33.8 billion from January to May due to high dependency on oil to generate power during the prolonged dry spell the country experienced. Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitya said the Treasury provided Rs 6 billion to cover the additional cost. Siyambalapitiya said the recent floods and landslides also caused a loss of nearly Rs 300 million to the CEB. Observing that the power supply of 770,000 consumers was affected due to disaster situation, he said the CEB workers worked round the clock to restore supply within a short period.
He said despite the monsoon rains in the South western part of the country, the water level in many reservoirs was not satisfactory. The total reservoir storage is about 47 percent now, and this percentage was high over 70 percent in other years. We still need the support of public to use the electricity sparingly, he said.
Siyambalapitiya said the Government in the next two months will open tenders to add about 890 MW to the national grid to cater to the power demand predicted in 2020. He added this includes 100 MW LNG plant, 220MW solar power plants and 170 MW wind power plants.

Favourite song, an untold story
Sihinayaki Re with lyricist Malini Jayaratne
Sihinayaki Re is a trendy television programme which has been telecasted on every Sunday night over the Sri Lanka Rupavahini channel for two hours until midnight. It has had a tremendous viewer enthusiasm and now it is reaching its 100th uninterrupted series program. The guest is predominantly a prominent personality, head of a government department, famous singer, actor or it could be a successful reputed business magnate.
The program is produced by Jayamini Illeperuma Gamlath and her team while the presenter is the skilled and accomplished Mahesh Nissanka, who via his ability to pierce into the hearts of the guest has made the Sihinayaki Re program spellbound and nail- biting. The guest has the option to choose his or her singer to sing the 10 songs that are chosen. The guest has to justify why he chose the song has to be clarified in between each song. It is pertinent to mention that a lot of spade work necessitates being geared up by the production team with the guest before the program as it is telecast live.
Owing to the incredible curiosity and enthusiasm of this program shown by viewers overseas the Sihinayaki Re was held for expatriates in Oman, London, Kingdom of Qatar and the USA.
Incredibly superlative
One of the keen followers of this program had been lyricist Malini Jayaratne, wife of popular singer T M Jayaratne. It is pertinent to mention her program has been acclaimed by viewers and pundits as one of the incredibly superlative ones. This is so as she had enlightened appropriately the motive for selecting the 10 songs for which she had explained every line of the related lyrics in each song with her extensive knowledge in her vernacular of the Sinhalese vocabulary.
She had selected a young duo Raveen Kanishka and Arosha Samaradiwakara to sing the songs chosen as they have musical talent in abundance having demonstrated via our television channels. The musical backing was headed by musician Susantha Madurapperuma.
At the start of the programme, Mahesh asked Malini Jayaratne whether to address her as Amma Sandaki as she is called by many as she had written the lyrics for the popular song sung by her husband TM Jayaratne, amma Sandaki mama lowe hiruya ridi, was recorded in 2012. She wished to remain as Malini the wife of innocent husband Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Jayaratne and as the mother of a son and a daughter but not as the lyricist as it was something she had achieved lately. To the question asked by Mahesh whether she encountered any complexity in choosing the songs, she said as in real life as she is able to choose correctly, hence it was not a hassle to her. Malini confided that after selecting the songs she had endeavoured to communicate with all the musicians, lyricists and singers to obtain permission for which all had consented.
Rated highly
The song she had selected initially was a Buddhist song principally as she is a staunch Buddhist. The song was nirvana swarna composed and sung by Sangeeth Nipun Visharada Sanath Nandasiri. The lyrics were by late Ajantha Ranasinghe. With her far-reaching knowledge in the Sinhala language, she was able to explain properly to Mahesh for selecting this song. Although there are many Buddhist songs sung only a few like this are sung to bless the Noble Triple Gem. For Malini, this is more a Buddhist stanza than a song. She was full of praise for Ajantha Ranasinghe for his lyrics and confessed that his songs are always at high ebb and rated highly on top.
The next song selected was the song was buddhanu bhavena also a Buddhist song sung and composed by Visharada Nanda Malini with lyrics by Professor Sunil Ariyaratne an acclaimed very versatile multifaceted journalist who has contributed many sensible lyrics to songs. Malini described him as a compassionate humanitarian. She explained the significance of some lines in the song. She said panegyric songs were sung in the ancient days only for Kings. But this has been sung by the ignorant people of this country. It invites the people in the country and provokes those ignorant people to light a lamp to brighten and bless the nation.
She quipped that there is only one Nanda Malini and no one could ever become another Nanda Malini. She describes legendary Nanda Malini as the Kiri Mawa of the nations natural song.
The next song chosen was amma nubai sung by Pandit Amaradewa to his own music composition for the lyrics of expert lyricist Professor Sunil Ariyaratne. Here too Malini was once more full of admiration for the Professor as he had depicted a factual image at a home without his own experience as a father. She explains the meaning of the lyrics unquestionably. The father - though he is the breadwinner - bestows all credit to the wife, the mother, who looks after the children, feeds them and executes all the supplementary behaviour in the house. Malini elaborates that this song she believes had been written absolutely for her as the lyrics are specifically that as she executes this precise temperament at home.
Bordering villages
Then she as her next song had chosen mathotin ena uthuru sulange sung by Deepika Priyadarshani, music composed by another giant maestro in the field Rohana Weerasinghe, lyrics by talented Mahinda Chandrasekera. This song according to Malini is the best song composed among the many songs that were sung during the period of the cruel ethnic war. She had first heard this song while travelling in a bus. She had been overwhelmed by the music initially. Later, she had interestingly listened to the lyrics. She explained why this song was selected by her. The lyrics explain adequately how the lives of people particularly in the bordering villages got shattered and the mockery of destruction and loss of lives that took place elsewhere. A little girl Saroja in a school in a bordering village listens to her teacher who says owing to the tremor of gun fire her letters have got distorted.
The teacher says to Saroja that she cannot say how many of your class friends would escape and return. In the event, the ethnic war continues she would not be able to complete the education and would have to take up domestic work in order to survive. For the appropriate lyrics, Deepika had sung the song with her bottomless voice magnificently.
The nest song chosen was sanda sumudui madu sisilai sung by Samitha and Athula Adikari for the lyrics by Malini herself to the musical composition of music prodigy Rohana Weerasinghe. What had prompted Malini to pen this song was to obey to a request of Samitha who was then expecting her son. She had called Malini saying Nanda and Samitha have a distant relationship to TM. It explains that we all treat our children like our eyes as they are the ones who give mothers the motherhood. It is pertinent to state Malini is a very clever narrator, she says walking with the son is a real pride not now but then.
However, she says that as Buddhist we should develop and grow our minds to relinquish the bonds with the children. Malini says the lyrics were so emotional and touching. Hence Samitha had not been able to do justice to her singing, had left the recording area several times before the final take. Mahesh quipped that he had not heard this song to which Malini said is a song that should be heard over our airwaves and it is the precise cause she selected it.
It is pertinent to cite that Malini Jayaratne as the guest in this Sihinayaki Re program had won the hearts of millions of viewers for a very triumphant manifestation and has been hailed and acclaimed by even participants who were guests subsequently. This program is worth viewing over and over again would anticipate those who possess the internet facility to view as there are a huge magnitude of essence to be learnt from the lyrics of the songs by expert lyricists enlightened very soundly with her diverse knowledge of the Sinhala vocabulary.

Ford resignation: SLC owes an explanation to the public
The events and reasons that led to Graham Fords sudden departure after serving only 17 months into his 45-month contract has not been properly explained by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) who employed him till the end of the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
The media release that was sent following Fords resignation was a total eyewash and never gives the proper reasons why he decided to leave.
All what the SLC media release revealed was the SLC president praising the efforts of Ford and Ford praising the national cricket team.
Its been a privilege to work with these talented young men over the past 15 months. Their passion for the sport is inspiring, as is indeed this nations, Ford said in a statement released by SLC. Sri Lanka has grown on me, and although weve made the decision to part ways where coaching is concerned, she will always have a little piece of my heart. I look forward to sitting up on that beautiful Fort down in Galle and taking in a birds eye view of Sri Lankas special brand of cricket  this time without having to chew my nails to the bone. I wish Sri Lanka Cricket and the boys the very best, and I must offer a word of advice to the young men  Always believe in yourself, believe in your team, and play from your heart.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala thanked Ford for his invaluable contribution to the country and issued the following media release: He joined us at a time where we were quoted by the ICC as being on the verge of suspension and at a time where things were volatile and uncertain, Ford had faith in us and has given us his fullest support. This was a decision arrived at mutually after careful consideration and deliberation and we are both confident of its propriety. Ford epitomises the character of cricket as a true gentleman, and we are indeed sorry to see him go.
But there is more to it than meets the eye and SLC should come clean and explain the reasons for the coachs sudden change of mind at the end of the ICC Champions Trophy when there was still 28 months of his contract left.
Reports appearing in the media indicate that Ford was not happy working with cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha as he was encroaching into his areas of coaching and that he had to report to him. When Ford had brought this up to the notice of SLC he was told by their top brass to either toe the line or quit. Ford opted for the latter and Sri Lanka has once again lost a good international cricket coach. Such instances are not uncommon with SLC. Remember the way former Australian cricketer and coach Geoff Marsh was treated after guiding Sri Lanka to their maiden Test victory on South African soil. Marshs exit came at a princely sum for the SLC who had to compensate him for such a hasty termination of his contract. In Fords case it is reported that both parties had mutually agreed to part company. However these are all unconfirmed reports and SLC if it is transparent with its decision making must come clean and explain to the public why Ford had to leave.
Initially Ford was reluctant to accept the Sri Lanka contract as he was well settled with English county Surrey. However it was through the persuasion of former Sri Lanka captain and cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara who was playing for Surrey at the time and who holds Ford in high esteem as a coach that SLC managed to finally persuade him to undertake the job.
When Ford was offered the job there was no mention of him having to report to a cricket manager or anything of that nature, he was given a free hand till the 2019 Cricket World Cup to uplift the standard of the Sri Lanka cricket team and work towards winning another World Cup.
Heres what the SLC president Sumathipala said of Ford when he was appointed on February 2016: We have secured the services of one of the best coaches in the world. We have appointed him for 45 months [from February 1] so that he covers the 2019 World Cup in England, where he has first-hand knowledge of the conditions having coached the counties.
Ford is highly rated by Sri Lanka players and his reputation for being good with young players had been among the reasons why SLC offered him the job, as the national team continued its transition following high-profile retirements.
But after the recent turn of events SLC is back to familiar grounds  head hunting for a national cricket coach. The way SLC has been treating international coaches and the bad reputation they have built in terminating their services at their whims and fancy it is very hard to see any top class coach from overseas risking his neck to accept a contract with SLC.
It has been reported that SLC has shown interest in securing the services of Chandika Hathurusingha, the former Sri Lanka cricketer and coach who is doing an exceptionally good job with the Bangladesh side. Hathurusingha is a hard task master and if he is to be roped in SLC will have to come down from its high pedestal and act according to his terms. SLC will not be able to call the shots as they have been trying to do with Ford and with national selections because Hathurusingha will not certainly stand for any kind of interference and will want to work the way he thinks is best for the team. Whether that kind of relationship is workable is the key question.

Fresh initiatives on economy
After several eventful weeks in a row, the past week was somewhat of an anti-climax in the local political scene. With the troubles in the Northern Provincial Council seemingly out of the way for the moment, attention was once again turned to the SAITM (South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine) issue.
Public anger was rising against the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) doctors for organising an indefinite strike amid a huge dengue outbreak. Worse, they were striking in support of an unruly mob of students, from the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) who had stormed the Health Ministry premises, damaging buildings and vehicles in addition to virtually holding the staff hostage. Several arrests have been subsequently made, but the question remains as to who is going to pay for the repairs.
As far as we know, there is no law in Sri Lanka which allows for collecting the damages from the perpetrators (except in certain traffic incidents that cause damage to public property such as telephone poles). So the chances are that the repairs will be funded by the public. Ironically, the public had already funded the education of these youths and they are again being taxed, literally, to effect repairs to the Health Ministry. Many have commended the Government for deciding that government jobs will never be given to identified perpetrators who are found guilty of causing damage to public property.
While the GMOA will not admit it, the viral video clip of the doctor who was caught red handed doing private practice even as the strike was going on, caused a severe embarrassment to the organisation. The doctor made things worse by running across the road to reach the hospital. In another viral video clip, a relative of a patient was seen pointing fingers at doctors and warning them of dire consequences should anything happen to the patient. The GMOA later earned more flak for having booze and dancing girls at their AGM. Unfortunately for the GMOA, several cameramen from leading TV stations had videoed these moments which were shown on prime time news bulletins.
Foreign professionals
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
Nevertheless, when a reporter asked a GMOA official whether it was appropriate to dance and pay homage to Bacchus when the whole country was engulfed in dengue, he sarcastically replied should we cry then (Api Andannada). This too did not go down too well with the public. The GMOA would have also received a shock at seeing a banner headline in a Sinhala newspaper (not of the Lake House Group) which proclaimed that the Government was considering bringing in 5,000 doctors from overseas to tide over the health crisis. Although the report was unsubstantiated and the Government had clarified it had no intention of bringing in foreign professionals including doctors, it nevertheless caused ripples within the local medical community. By this time, the GMOA had got a hint that the indefinite strike was clearly untenable in the long term.
The GMOA had wanted a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena, which was duly granted because the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were keen to resolve the SAITM issue and restore normality to university education. Accordingly, the Government reached an agreement with the GMOA based on five main points. The five-point agreement comprised suspension of new admissions and issuing of degrees until SAITM met all conditions, gazetting minimum standards in respect of medical education, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to be free of interference, curricula of SAITM students to be in line with SLMC standards and to work out a system to those who had received degree from SAITM to receive SLMC registration and lastly to obtain the Attorney Generals advice before the Government informed the Supreme Court regarding its stand. Measures would be also taken to run SAITM as a public-private partnership while the Government was in the process of taking over the hospital owned by SAITM. The Government would also examine the possibility of listing SAITM in the Colombo Stock Exchange or establish a public/private fund, he said. The Secretary to the President, P B Abeykoon, said the Government was ready to address any other issues in addition to those mentioned above.
The GMOA said that they had reached an understanding on four matters:
1. Expedite legal measures to stop fresh admissions and issuance of degrees.
2. The Attorney General to inform the Supreme Court regarding the Governments stand on SAITM.
3. President Maithripala Sirisena guarantees the independence of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof Carlo Fonseka and his colleagues.
4). Initiative to resolve the crisis caused by SAITM in a way not inimical to the people.
The GMOA later said a statement issued by Secretary to the President has violated the agreement they reached with the President, adding that they retained the option of resuming trade union action. It remains to be seen whether they will keep their word.
The other controversy that was raging in the mainstream and social media  the arrest (or the lack thereof) of Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) fame came to an end when he surrendered to the Police. Since the Police did not object to the granting of bail to the Thera, the courts had no option, but the Magistrate made her displeasure known to the Police. She pointed out that the law must be equal to all and the Police could lose public confidence if different people are treated in different ways.
Speaking at a religious ceremony, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe castigated those who had accused him and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka of providing refuge to Venerable Gnanasara Thera. He charged that certain NGOs hell bent on sabotaging reconciliation were behind these stories aimed at sullying Sri Lankas reputation in the eyes of the international community. Speaking at a religious function on Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too emphasised the importance of fostering racial and religious amity. President Sirisena, who too spoke at the same ceremony, said it was disheartening to notice many attacks on the Maha Sangha and religious dignitaries on social media sites such as Facebook. These vicious attacks could spur discord and rancour among different communities, he warned. Incidentally, MP S.M. Marikkar won praise from the Most Venerable Dr Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera for attending this Buddhist function on Ramazan day, thus showing how reconciliation should be practised in real life.
The Justice Minister figured in at least one other matter last week. He had criticised lawyer Lakshan Dias for making statements which he perceived as being against the State. This matter figured at the Bar Council meeting held on Saturday presided over by the BASL President U R de Silva.
Garbage issue
Presidents Counsel J C Weliamuna raised the matter and said that Dias is being persecuted for a statement he made over the electronic media. He said that Minister Rajapakshe is pursuing the matter and wants him to be disenrolled as an Attorney-at-Law. Weliamuna said this move to disenroll him should be condemned. Former BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam also joined Weliamuna to condemn this move. However, W Dayaratne PC and Hemantha Warnakulasuriya argued against. The argument had apparently taken religious lines. At this stage, de Silva said he would dispatch a letter to Dias asking him to elucidate his statement by affidavit. The lawyers who stood for Dias said U R de Silvas decision does not reflect the view of the Bar Association and the Bar Council, noting that it was an individual decision by the BASL President.
We are still not completely out of the woods vis--vis the garbage issue, but Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka explained to the media an elaborate master plan to process garbage at Puttalam. This, he said, will be a long-term plan with full recycling capability for paper and plastic. In the meantime, the clearance of garbage in many areas has been accelerated. The garbage issue has also been extensively discussed at several Cabinet meetings in a row.
The controversy over the handing over of the two lotteries boards to the Foreign Ministry shows no sign of dying down and Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake convened a news conference to explain the decision. He pointed out that several other seemingly mismatched ministries exist, with hardly any complaints from anyone. He lashed out at some of his detractors, saying some of them had lost out on lucrative lottery printing deals and were now gunning for him. The minister later visited the Chief Prelates of Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters to seek their blessings.
His predecessor and present Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera too met the Most Venerable Chief Prelates in Kandy. Just a couple of days earlier, he had made a somewhat controversial statement in Parliament, which he admitted was strictly his own opinion, on the possibility of reducing the prices of soft liquor including wine and beer with the aim of veering drinkers way from moonshine, known as Kasippu in local parlance. This is indeed a noteworthy proposal and had been tried once before during the previous Peoples Alliance administration before various circumstances forced it to restore the status quo on high liquor taxes. The Minister then waded into hotter waters questioning the rationale of keeping Poya Days dry, given that drinkers are known to hoard the hard stuff the previous day. He indicated that there should be a shift in this policy, at least for the travel and tourism sector in the light of booming tourist arrivals.
Most experts agree that a mechanism should be found to drive people away from moonshine, due to the huge burden on the free healthcare system and the loss of revenue to the Government, as moonshine producers do not pay a red cent to the Government in the form of taxes. Although the minister did not mention it, some politicians on both sides of the House have previously called for legalising Kasippu so that the producers can be taxed. There was no opposition per se top the Ministers speech in Parliament, with Joint Opposition firebrand Bandula Gunawardena calling for a wider debate and consensus on a viable liquor policy. However, his de-facto leader former President Mahinda Rajapaksa criticised the Ministers speech at a public function. In any case, a process of wider consultation including discussions in the Parliament and the Cabinet are expected before any changes are made.
Most outsiders have little or no idea about what goes on in Cabinet meetings until they are given bits and pieces of information at the Cabinet news briefing, which is to be telecast live soon. In fact, the Cabinet and Consultative Committees in the Parliament are two places where a lot of work gets done. Last week, the Cabinet was busy going through several Cabinet papers of critical importance.
One of the most significant proposals was from the Prime Minister for the establishment of a ministerial committee to coordinate UN Human Rights Council recommendations. Noting that several ministries and institutions were currently engaged in these initiatives, this will be a central coordination and monitoring mechanism for the said initiatives. The Committee is expected to be chaired by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and will include around six or seven other ministers including the Foreign Minister. A sub-committee comprising their ministry secretaries will assist the committee.
Sri Lankan economy
The Cabinet was also presented with a proposal for an Active Liability Management Bill, which will enable the raising of loans in or out of Sri Lanka for the purpose of active liability management to improve public debt management in Sri Lanka. This will give more leeway to the Finance Minister to raise any sum of money by way of a loan whether in or outside Sri Lanka in terms of the relevant laws. Coincidentally, the Cabinet also got a look at the current status of negotiations on proposed Free Trade Agreements with China and Singapore.
The Cabinet was also informed of a Proposal to establish an offshore Sri Lanka Rupee bond programme by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector lending arm of the World Bank. The proceeds are to be used for IFC projects in Sri Lanka. The bonds will be sold in the international market to international investors, signalling greater confidence in the Sri Lankan economy.
Last weeks Cabinet meeting also saw a proposal for several amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT). Among the proposals are: removal of Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) scheme; legal provisions to refund the VAT paid by foreigners on their spending in Sri Lanka, as practised in the UK and Australia; exemption of goods and supplies such as infant milk powder, books and magazines; renewable energy goods, certain electrical goods, energy saving bulbs, childcare services and several other categories. This shows that reducing the CoL is uppermost in the Governments mind despite the attention paid to a myriad of other issues that have gained prominence recently.

Global ransomware attack causes turmoil

Companies across the globe are reporting that they have been struck by a major ransomware cyber-attack.
British advertising agency WPP is among those to say its IT systems have been disrupted as a consequence.
The virus, the source of which is not yet known, freezes the user's computer until a ransom in untraceable Bitcoin is paid.
Ukrainian firms, including the state power company and Kiev's main airport, were among the first to report issues.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down.
In a statement, the US National Security Council said government agencies were investigating the attack and that the US was "determined to hold those responsible accountable".
The US Department of Homeland Security advised victims not to pay the ransom, saying there was no guarantee that access to files would be restored.
The Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab saidits analysis showed that there had been about 2,000 attacks - most in Ukraine, Russia and Poland.
The international police organisation Interpol has said it was "closely monitoring" the situation and liaising with its member countries.
Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by the Wannacryattack last month.
"It initially appeared to be a variant of a piece of ransomware that emerged last year," said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward.
"The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap.
"However, now that's not so clear."
Kaspersky Lab reported that it believed the malware was a "new ransomware that has not been seen before" despite its resemblance to Petya.
As a result, the firm hasdubbed it Not Petya. Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine.
Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative.
"ASouth Korean hosting firmjust paid $1m t get their data back and that's a huge incentive," he said. "It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal."
A bitcoin wallet associated with the outbreak has received several payments since the outbreak began. The wallet currently holds just over 3.3 bitcoins (6,175; $7,920).
An email address associated with the blackmail attempt has been blocked by German independent email provider Posteo.
It means that the blackmailers have not been able to access the mailbox.
Problems have also affected:
the Ukrainian central bank, the aircraft manufacturer Antonov, and two postal services
Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft
Danish shipping company Maersk, including its container shipping, oil, gas and drilling operations. A port in Mumbai is among those that has halted operations
a Pennsylvania hospital operator, Heritage Valley Health System, which reportedits computer network was down, causing operations to be delayed - but it is not yet clear if it was subject to the same type of attack
Spanish food giant Mondelez - whose brands include Oreo and Toblerone - according to the country's media. A Cadbury factory in Tasmania, Australia is affected
Netherlands-based shipping company TNT, which said some of its systems needed "remediation"
French construction materials company St Gobain
USpharmaceuticals-maker Merck
The local offices of thelaw firm DLA Piper- a sign in the firm's Washington DC officesaid: "Please remove all laptops from docking stations and keep turned off - no exceptions."
The attacks come two months after another global ransomware assault, known as Wannacry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service.
Veteran security expert Chris Wysopal from Veracode said the malware seemed to be spreading via some of the same Windows code loopholes exploited by Wannacry. Many firms did not patch those holes because Wannacry was tackled so quickly, he added.
Those being caught out were also industrial firms that often struggled to apply software patches quickly.
"These organisations typically have a challenge patching all of their machines because so many systems cannot have down time," he said. "Airports also have this challenge."
Copies of the virus have been submitted to online testing systems that check if security software, particularly anti-virus systems, were able to spot and stop it.
"Only two vendors were able to detect it so many systems are defenceless if they are unpatched and relying on anti-virus," he said.
Ukraine seems to have been particularly badly hit this time round.
Reports suggest that the Kiev metro system has stopped accepting payment cards while several chains of petrol stations have suspended operations.
Ukraine's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture appearing to show government systems have been affected.
His caption reads: "Ta-daaa! Network is down at the Cabinet of Minister's secretariat."

GMOA threatens another circus
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is yet to receive the amended statement from the Presidential Secretariat as promised and the date for another islandwide strike will be fixed in the next few days, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the Executive Committee of the GMOA will meet next Thursday (29th) and make a decisive decision.
No matter what Cabinet papers bring in, the country cannot be fooled.
The law cannot take effect for something that is inherently fraudulent he said. GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said the GMOA asks Police Media Spokesman what happened to SAITMs former CEO who shot himself.
The GMOA will produce a report on the brutal attack launched by the police on unarmed state university students who came to the Health Ministry,he said.
Similar to the Rathupaswala attack, the attackers will be punished one day because the politicians come and go but public servants stay.They will be answerable one day, when a commission is appointed to probe the incident.

Govt. can be toppled only through election: Sajith
Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said only 'hooniyama' that can topple a government is an election.
He was addressing a meeting after distributing dry rations to the flood affected at Walasmulla. He said state officials, private sector organisations, media channels, and philanthropists got together and reached out to the drought-stricken peole and provided them with relief, while those in the opposition went to Horowpathana to perform a 'hooniyama' to President Maithripala Surisena. The minister said dashing coconuts at devalayas by the opposition in the past brought landslides and floods and the people were the victims.
Minister Premadasa said the opposition politicians have to wait patiently about a couple of years if they are keen on toppling the government and form a new regime.
"The President and the Prime Minister are following far-sighted policies to develop the country, while the opposition engages in performing hooniyams," he said.

Group sending students to Russia behind SAITM protests - Chairman
No stopping of degree awards :
SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando yesterday alleged that a group involved in sending students to Russia to study medicine was deceiving children and inciting them to stage demonstrations and protest campaigns against SAITM.
Dr. Fernando was speaking to the media after attending a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. Fernando said he visited the Presidential Secretariat for a meting with the Presidents Private Secretary.

Dr. Fernando alleged that there was a group sending students to Russia within the GMOA which was opposed to SAITM and one of them was Samantha Ananda who is a gem merchant there was another person called Prasanna Ranaweera.
These groups within the GMOA and the SLMA had teamed up to protest against SAITM. GMOA members had enjoyed free education with the help of public funds.They are also paid and given all other perks and privileges with public funds.
Dr. Neville Fernando said that this group is inciting university students against SAITM to achieve their petty objectives. Those university students who join protests are paid Rs.10 million when they are arrested and remanded on the charge of participating in illegal protests.
If the members of GMOA resort to take trade union action at the expense of thousands of innocent patients, the public should start beating them up.
Dr.Fernando added that GMOA members who keep on insisting that SAITM has to be closed down, will have no other option than jumping into sea off Galle Face. 
The Colombo Port city is coming up.They can by buried there,he said.
He said that the Government should take firm action against the GMOA members protesting against the SAITM by holding the innocent patients hostage
The Government should chase these GMOA members,
Dr.Fernando adding that he is unable to agree with the governments condition to stop student recruitments and awarding of degrees to the SAITM students.
He added that the awarding of degrees or recruitment of students can not be stopped by a Gazzette Notification.
However, recruitment of students to the SAITM has been suspended temporarily,he asserted.
Dr. Fernando said he would request the government to declare the health service as an essential service and confiscate the properties of those flouting this order and engaging is strikes as done by late justice Minister Felix R. Dias Bandaranaike in 1970. He said he believed that SAITM would be able to register new students after the court ruling on July 5.
