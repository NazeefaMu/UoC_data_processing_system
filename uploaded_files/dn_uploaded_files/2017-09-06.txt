It is important to keep Indian Ocean open and free
Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma, who completes two years in office, outlined details about bilateral relations, Japan funded development initiatives and future areas of cooperation and other relevant issues in an interview with a select group of journalists from mainstream newspapers at his office last Monday (September 4). Here are edited excerpts.
On Japanese funded development projects
There are many projects in Sri Lanka and the total funding amounts to almost Rs. 1.8 trillion. The overall assessment of the projects is very good and they have contributed to the development of Sri Lanka significantly. We have a system of evaluating the results of the projects by a third party committee.
The committee report is very positive and says that almost all projects have been successful. We have been trying to improve the efficiency at the projects on recommendations. Wherever I go, I do not forget to talk with the people and they say the projects have been highly beneficial to them. If it is appreciated by the people, then it is the most important thing. There are many other projects, cultural exchanges as well. When it comes to development projects, we cannot do everything and we have to be selective. In the case of Sri Lanka, we have mainly three sectors.
One is high quality infrastructure which will help country's overall growth, particularly exports. The second is addressing the issue of income disparity and third is reduction of social vulnerabilities.
Maritime cooperation and the development of Trincomalee Port
Sri Lanka is in strategically important location. It is between East Asia, South East Asia and the Middle East and East Africa. In the South of Sri Lanka, we have a most important sea lane in the world.
About 100,000 ships pass this region every year. Sri Lanka has a deep harbour in Colombo. It is very important when you take the sea routes in the Indian Ocean. You can cover the Southern region of the Indian Ocean with this Port. As Japan depends on sea trade a lot, this is very important for us.
This is why we think keeping the Indian Ocean open and free is vital for not only Japan but also for other countries. We hope to discuss how to improve maritime cooperation further with Sri Lanka.
With regard to Trincomalee port development, we have already allocated Rs.1.3 billion for selected areas.
The project is to procure the products such as mooring buoy and vessel, light buoy, automatic identification system and lights, which are all manufactured by Japanese enterprises to improve the facilities at the Trincomalee port to enhance its daily operations.
We have also begun discussions with Sri Lanka and with India on how to develop the port further.
Tripartite Agreement between Japan, Sri Lanka and India for supply and power generation from LNG
Sri Lanka power demand will grow in the future and the government has identified power generation through Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as one of the areas of focus. LNG based power is very environmental friendly. We have started discussions with Sri Lanka and India for a tripartite cooperation for LNG, supply and power generations. LNG is a new experiment for Sri Lanka. The country needs a lot of new technology and expertise. So we are discussing with the government and India how to go about in developing LNG power generation in Sri Lanka.
Potential areas for Japanese Investment
Sri Lanka is a hub of the Indian ocean. Many companies like coming here and setting up investment because of the location. South Asia as a whole is growing fast, so we have a big market. Sri Lanka is strategically located in South Asia and thus becomes a very important destination. Sri Lanka is also a middle income country and the potential for further growth is very high. We are looking at several areas, power, development of ports and also tourism. However, the Government should ensure a consistent economic policy and an investment friendly climate.
Sri Lankas first elevated Light Rail Transit (LRT) line
Japan has assisted in making the Urban Transport Master Plan in 2013. Sri Lanka has officially requested for a STEP loan for LRT. Both sides agreed to conduct JICA feasibility study which commenced in February 2017. JICA feasibility study will be done by February 2018 and hopefully, we will commence the project immediately after that.
( LRT line extends from Malabe to Union Place and Kollupitiya)
On Hambantota Port Deal
We think it is important to keep Indian Ocean open and free. For that purpose, all ports should be operated transparently and openly. We are against a country using ports of another country for its exclusive purposes or military purposes. We hope that in future Sri Lanka ports will be controlled by the Government. We hope they will not be used for military purposes by another country and that all security matters and Customs operations will be handled by Sri Lanka.
Support for Peace and Reconciliation
We are trying to support Sri Lanka so it doesn't have to face a calamity like it had in the past. Our support extends to both political and economic fronts. We think reconciliation will play a big role in ensuring a healthy growth, stability and peace in Sri Lanka. We are supporting Government's efforts fully in this regard.
Japanese help for digitilisation of television broadcasting
The digitilisation of terrestrial television broadcasting has become a worldwide trend. Broadcasters are now turning to digital technologies to reduce their operating costs and offer enhanced services to the public. Television broadcasting is a universal service and is an important infrastructure, which most people rely on as a source of information.
It is, therefore, essential to make television more accessible to people to allow Sri Lanka to keep pace with the rest of the world. Japan is helping Sri Lanka to digitalise television broadcasting.

Police sources said FCID officials faced many difficulties in unearthing information related to the alleged fraud due to the disappearance of documents related to these transactions and unavailability of information from officials who are holding office now. Most of these transactions had been carried out with foreign agencies and investigators faced inconveniences in getting information.
Police sources added that they faced many difficulties in obtaining statements from the politicians, heads of institutions and government officials who were allegedly involved in these financial irregularities and corruption.
The FCID succeeded in completing 97 out of 300 complaints. The Division has forwarded 80 files to the relevant institutions to obtain details of transactions with foreign financial institutions.

Arrest this decline
Crisis hit Sri Lanka cricket took another nosedive on Sunday when the national team suffered its first ever whitewash on home soil, in a one day series, at the hands of India, to the dismay and consternation of the local cricket fans and all Sri Lankans in general. Sunday's debacle followed the 3-0 whitewash in the test series that preceded the one dayers. Much the same fate is expected at today's sole 20-20 fixture, following the serial losses, with India set to sign off on a winning note.
The writing was on the wall when we lost to Bangladesh in a test for the first time and also handed a One Day series defeated by Zimbabwe in the run up to the current Indian series. In another country, the entire cricket management would have handed in their resignations following a debacle of such proportions, but here in Sri Lanka, as is the case with all politicians, the Cricket Board too, which is governed by politicians, will not resign.
True, the knee jerk reaction will be to sack the Board, as once happened in Pakistan, when the entire Cricket administration was asked to step down following a similar crisis. However, sacking the Board is not going to solve the problem, which, experts see as a deep seated malaise encompassing the players, the Board and politics. The players themselves are partly to blame. Playing for the country does not have the same allure and feeling as before. Attracted by filthy lucre, our players give the country second preference to playing in lucrative tournaments abroad. If not how can one explain a player like Lasith Malinga hanging up his test boots at such an early stage in his career to reserve his energies for the Indian Premier League.
The high paying contracts offered to players by the Cricket Board has made many of our cricketers complacent. They care little or nothing for failure, knowing their cup will be full even if one scores a hundred or get out for a duck. Commitment is lacking in players due to the knowledge that they could reap their bounty, come what may. The Board should therefore consider performance based payment to players to force them to display more commitment, instead of long term contracts. This way, we can get the best out of our cricketers. After all, most of our cricketers are backed by sponsors and receive handsome payments for endorsements and guest appearances.
True, one could argue that cricketers have a short shelf life, where the game is concerned, and deserve all the rewards showered on them (most feel that our boys are pampered too much). Also the game has become more demanding in the present day, requiring much sacrifice viz. physical fitness and strenuous regimens to keep oneself in good shape. All this, no doubt, takes a heavy toll on the player, justifying the immense earnings
But one should also see things from the perspective of the fans and the spectators who feel cheated when they are forced to put up with poor performances of the type currently being witnessed. The ugly scenes at Pallekele are but a release of these pent up feelings of the fans. Cricket is today a religion in this country and is followed and adored with religious fervour. The followers want the gods (read players) to deliver as they do gods, at their requests or pleas.
Be that as it may, a master plan should be evolved to raise cricket from the depths it had fallen to at present. The blame games must cease, to begin with. Finger pointing and washing dirty linen in public can only further exacerbate matters. Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera, has, apparently, in a desperate bid called for assistance of past cricketers, coaches, officials etc. to pool in their knowledge to resurrect the game from its current status. These gentlemen, played the game purely for its pleasure, expecting no rewards and are bound to look at things from a different perspective and have ideas on how to lift the game from the present depths. Their inputs should be accepted and acted upon by the authorities.
Schools have been the cradle of national sides in the past and this system should be promoted and nurtured if we are to harvest the cream of the cricketing talent. Whatever happened to our scouting system in the past where past cricketer of repute scoured the outstations to spot talent In Pakistan, most of the outstanding players and household names today, were picked from the streets by talent spotters and moulded into greatness. Now that the war is a thing of the past, the North and East too should be drawn into the mainstream of national cricket. There certainly will be a countless number of youth, with the necessary physique and other attributes for a cricketer, in the Wanni, who may fit the bill. There may be a Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda de Silva and Lasith Malinga in the once war ravaged North, waiting to be picked, and answer the national call.

Australia scramble vital win over Thailand
MELBOURNE: Australia beat Thailand 2-1 in their final World Cup qualifying group game on Tuesday, but they faced a nervy wait to see if it will be enough to book their ticket to Russia 2018.
The Socceroos were searching for a big win to put pressure on their Group B rivals Saudi Arabia, who started the evening level on points and who host already qualified Japan later.
Saudi Arabia have a superior goal difference to Australia, meaning victory in Jeddah would hand them the second automatic World Cup spot and consign the Socceroos to the play-offs.
It wasn't until the 69th minute that Tomi Juric got the opener, and the Thais -- who earlier had a strong penalty appeal turned down -- hit back through Pokklaw Anan before Mathew Leckie's late winner.
We got at them, it was a little bit disappointing their goal on the counter, but overall we got ourselves in good scoring positions, Australia skipper Mark Milligan said.
I don't know how many times we hit the post, we gave it everything we had tonight. Credit to Thailand, they hung firm on their 18-yard box for a long time. The Asian champions peppered the Thai goal from the outset, with Hertha Berlin's Leckie featuring heavily on the right wing.
Aaron Mooy and veteran talisman Tim Cahill both hit the post, and Tom Rogic's long-range volley was saved by goalkeeper Sinthaweechai Hathairattanakool.
Juric wasted a direct free kick, blasting high over the bar, and also had a great goal-bound chance blocked by Adisorn Promrak. Thailand's best moments came through their skipper Teerasil Dangda, and Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan was fortunate to escape punishment for bringing down the forward wide of the goal area.
The Socceroos had 15 shots to Thailand's three in the opening half, with two on target and four blocked.
Thailand looked unlucky not to be awarded a penalty when Teerasil, on a breakaway, was brought down inside the box by defender Trent Sainsbury.
Juric finally got the home side in front with his glancing header off a Mooy cross.
Thailand, who had only two points from their previous nine group games, rocked the Australians with an equaliser through Pokkhao Anan in the 82nd minute.

Becoming a Godman..!
For the last few days I have been fascinated by the support the self-styled godman in India, arrested and convicted of rape, has been receiving throughout the country. No one seems too bothered about the mans crime. I looked at the classified ads this morning and saw one which said, they could make a godman out of anybody. Become one, said the wife, Anyway you do have a beard, just grow your hair a little longer and continue with your eccentric ways!
I dont have any such ways! I said stiffly looking out of the window.
There, you were looking at her, werent you
Who I asked, puzzled.
Our pretty neighbour! See you already have one of the most essential characteristics! said the wife with a sneer. I picked up the paper and rang the number.
Did your wife ask you to call this number asked a voice, at the other end.
Yes, I said surprised, How did you know
The wife is the first to see such qualities in her husband, said the voice at the other end patiently, And were you looking out of the window
Yes! I said nearly jumping out of my chair, very happy about the godman school, Yes, but I was only looking at some trees and bushes!
Excellent! said the voice from the godman school, You already know what to tell the judge!
I have a beard! I said eagerly, And I can grow my hair long!
Those are not important, said the voice, And can be fixed with a good wig and a clipped on beard. What we are interested in is whether you should go in for the beginners course or the higher one. From these few questions you have answered I feel you can go straightway into the higher study course!
Thats very good of you! I said, Are there any other qualities of mine you would like to know off
Are you a ladies man asked the voice, Does the opposite sex like being around you
I looked at my wife, who was hovering around me, trying to key onto the conversation. She put her ear close to the mouthpiece to listen even more keenly.
Yes! I whispered hoarsely, They love being all around, and near me!
There was some whispering at the other end, Guruji, we will come to your house in a few minutes, you are the godman we have been looking for! You have all the qualities needed! said a new voice.
You mean I can go to an even higher course I asked excited.
We will enrol you immediately as our principal, said the voice, With you in charge, we will build our godman school into a premier institution in the country. We will pick you up in half an hour, meanwhile continue looking out of the window..!

## Title: Central legislature under 13th Amendment
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, September 6, 2017 - 01:00
Central legislature under 13th Amendment
The Thirteenth Amendment has introduced a new conception of a unitary  decentralized State based on a system of Provincial Government at a sub-national level. This description is of extreme importance, since the Constitution specifically provides that the Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State and the majority of the people attach much sentiment to the unitariness of Sri Lanka.
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the establishment of Provincial Councils. Article 154G (I) introduced by the Amendment vests legislative power in respect of matters set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (the Provincial Council List) in the Provincial Councils.
The 13th Amendment transfers competence over certain specified areas from the supreme Central legislature into elected provincial assemblies representing clearly defined spatial units. Basic to the structure of devolution is the competence jurisdiction  the separation of subjects and functions assigned to the Provincial Council and the Centre.
This separation is set out in the three lists under the Ninth Schedule to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution: Provincial Council List (List I), Reserved List (List II) and Concurrent List (List III).
Article 154G enables the Provincial Council to make statutes. However, this power is subject to provision in the Constitution including Article 75 and Article 154(G) (10). A statute enacted by the Provincial Council does not attain the constitutional status of law as the definition of law in Article 170 remains unamended. Similarly it does enjoy constitutional immunity or protection that is accorded to an Act of Parliament. (Article 82(3)).
Article 154C vests the executive power within a Province extending to the matters in List I in the Governor to be exercised in terms of Article 154F (I) on the advice of the Board of Ministers. In terms of Article 154F (6) the Board of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to the Provincial Council.
The main Constitutional provision relating to the Governor are found in Article 154B. The findings reveal that the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Provincial Councils in the exercise of their legislative power is not found in the area of the exercise of their executive power.
Executive powers
The relevant provisions of the 13th Amendment and the Provincial Councils Act demonstrate that in the exercise of executive powers, the Provincial Councils are subject to the Centre and are not sovereign bodies.
The provisions relating to the Governor and his powers show that the Governor is not a mere figurehead, but is an active participant in the activities of the Provincial Council.
In terms of section 2(1) of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No.12 of 1989, the powers and functions of (a) Minister or (b) a public officer under any written law made prior to November 14, 1987, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council list could be exercised by
(a) the Governor or the relevant Minister of the Board of Ministers (b) and officer in the Provincial Public service holding an office.
According to the above Act, for example, while Provincial Councils implement the functions and responsibilities given in Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, they do not have the power to implement functions and responsibilities given under the Agrarian Development Act. No. 46 of 2000 as the latter Act has been enacted after November 14, 1987.
In Alawwa v Katugampola MPCS, the Supreme Court commented on the effect and advantages of the Act. In the first place it eliminates a situation where no law will prevail (in respect of matters in the Provincial Council List) until Provincial Council makes statutes, secondly it obviates the formidable task on the part of a Provincial Council to legislate virtually overnight, a mass of statutes relating to several subjects in that List so as to substitute which is already in force enacted perhaps during a long course of year.
Provincial Councils
As revealed in the analysis, there are two important matters that require consideration in relation to these Lists.
Firstly, while Provincial Council cannot make statutes in respect of any matters set out in the Reserved List, the first item in the Reserved List is the National Policy on all subjects and functions. Secondly, all subjects and functions not specified in List 1 and List 3 are brought within the Reserved List.
The residuary power is vested in the National Government. The Provincial Councils have no power in respect of national policy, even on subjects and functions included in the Provincial Council List. It is for the Parliament to lay down national policy.
The statute of a Provincial Council is subject to such policy.
It is therefore clear that Parliament retains its control on all matters and where appropriate may dictate to the Provincial Councils.
The National Transport Commission Bill is a classic example of the plenary power of the Parliament. Article 154G (1) provides that a Provincial Council may make statutes with respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.
However, such legislative power is not exclusive. Parliament may also legislate on matters in the Provincial Councils List but under certain conditions.

INTERNATIONAL DAY OF NON-VIOLENCE
The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on October 2, in honour of the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. He was one of the most influential political activists of all time.
On June 15, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly voted to make the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhis birth the International Day of Non-Violence. The day is mostly dedicated to spreading the message of non-violence to as many people as possible in all countries of the world.
The world has seen its share of bloody wars that ended countless lives and filled many more grief. No matter what country you go to, there are stories of how someones greed or lust for power resulted in the killing of innocent people and the destruction of beautiful cities.
Gandhi used nonviolent civil disobedience to eventually overthrow the British, who ruled India at the time. Despite being thrown in jail numerous times, but nothing ever caused him abandon his peaceful approach, which eventually resulted in India finally gaining the independence they had wanted for years.
Even wars that that were fought for a good cause, like Civil War of the United States of America, that resulted in slavery being abolished, have been responsible for a great many deaths.
Fortunately, however, there are people in this world who have gone about making changes they thought necessary without violence or pure brute force, and these are the people that the International Day of non-violence celebrates.
United Nations UN International Day of Non-Violence is a global observance that promotes non-violence through education and public awareness. It is annually held on October 2 to coincide with renowned Indian leader Mahatma Gandhis birthday.
Many people, government organisations and non-government organisations around the world observe International Day of Non-Violence through various events and activities such as public lectures, seminars, discussions and press conferences about non-violence.

Coconut cultivators at Julampitiya in Middeniya were educated recently about the mite disease that heavily damages the cultivation. The programme was organised by the Walasmulla Coconut Cultivation Development Office Project Director.
Coconut Cultivation Development Officer A.P.A. Gunawardena said many cultivators were not aware of the disease.

Commercial Bank to fund Sri Lankas first puppetry museum
Ambalangodas rich but partly-forgotten tradition of puppetry is to be revived and developed with the establishment of Sri Lankas first puppetry museum with funding support from the Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
A regular sponsor of initiatives to preserve the countrys cultural heritage, the Bank has pledged to support a proposal by Ganwari Supun Gamini, a science graduate of the University of Peradeniya and a fourth generation descendent of Podisirina Gurunnanse, considered the father of puppetry in Sri Lanka, to set up a museum and theatre dedicated to the art in this southern coastal town.
To be set up in a building leased from Sarvodaya, the proposed puppetry museum will also be supported by final year students of the University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo, to stage puppet shows for locals as well as foreign tourists.
Commercial Banks funding will pay the costs of rent, decorations and costumes for the puppets, set design, curtains, lighting, sound, stage design, stationery and advertising, enabling the projects proponent to realise a long-nurtured dream.
Traditional Sri Lankan puppetry and the associated folklore are well worth preserving for future generations, Commercial Banks Head of Operations Priyanthi Perera said. They are in danger of being obliterated by the proliferation of new cultural influences. The Bank was impressed by the vision of Supun Gamini to revive the art and happy to fund the project.
The proposed museum will display puppets depicting many well-loved characters from Sinhala tradition and mythology as well as traditional devil masks that inhabit folklore. A stage to be erected in a large hall in the backyard of the building is to be used to perform puppet shows in the diktala kaalagola and Jathaka story genres. It has also been proposed to use the puppet shows for public awareness programmes and campaigns on important social issues such as drugs, smoking, healthcare and road rules.
Preserving Sri Lankas cultural heritage is one of the focus areas of the CSR Trust of Commercial Bank.
Among some of projects the Trust has supported in this sphere are the construction of a museum at Kirivehera, the donation of lamp posts to Dambulla Temple and the renovation and repair of the steps to the summit of Sri Pada.

Consensual Governments journey is clear victory for people: President
President Maithripala Sirisena says the journey of the consensual government during the past two and a half years is a clear victory for the people, whatever said to the contrary.
President was participating at the launch of the Vision 2025 A Rich Country , the Economic Development Plan of the government, at the BMICH on Monday. The event was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The President said that forming a consensual government, a new political experience which has never seen before by anyone was given for the country, for the betterment of the country and its people.
"Even though whatever allegations were levelled against the consensual government, or how challenging that journey is, it is a must that we should fulfil for the benefit of the country and its people," he said.
"Although we cannot achieve 100 percent successful results from the consensual government in a short span of time, which was built uniting two main rival political parties over 60 years, all were able to fulfil that challenging responsibility while fulfilling their duties in a more disciplinary manner during the past two and half years," the President said.
The President said the responsibilities towards the country and the people would be fulfilled with commitment, while taking forward the concept of consensual politics with a comprehensive understanding.

Constitution must guarantee womens political representation
A petition signed by 221 Sri Lankan citizens, women and men, from different regions of the country, concerned with democracy and good governance, including Dr. Kumari Jayawardene, Deshabandu Jezima Ismail, Prof. Savitri Goonesekera, Prof. Maithree Wickremasinghe, Dr. Selvy Thiruchandran was presented to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly on September 6.
They called for Constitutionally guaranteed provisions to address the critical under representation of women in political institutions.
They reminded MPs now sitting in the Constitutional Assembly deliberating on a new Constitution that women are less than 6 percent in Parliament; 4 percent in Provincial Councils and 2 percent in Local Authorities.
They said that womens groups in particular and the Parliamentary Womens Caucus have advocated strongly for affirmative action including before the Steering Committee and the Dinesh Gunawardene Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms.
They reminded MPs that successive UNP and UNFPA manifestos since the early 2000s promised to increase womens representation in Provincial and local government as did the Maithripala Sirisena manifesto titled A New Sri Lanka for Women, all of which acknowledged the under-representation of women in politics.
They noted that the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform (PRCCR) established by the Cabinet, in its report of 2016, heard resounding calls for special measures to ensure greater representation of women in political bodies and all other decision-making bodies indicating this call was made by both women and men across the country. The PRCCR said Many submissions suggested special measures such as quotas ranging from 25 percen to 50 percent in order to ensure the participation of women.
The petitioners recommended that all candidates, women or men, nominated to contest first past the post (FPP) seats from each party under the majoritarian system shall be in the proportion of not less than 30 percent or more than 70 percent; under the Proportional Representation (PR) system and for bonus or compensatory seats, all political parties entitled to such seats shall submit a closed zippered list alternating between female and male candidates; the proportion of either women or men in all independent commissions appointed by the Constitutional Council and in all current statutory bodies and those that may be established in the future, shall be not less than 30 percent or more than 70 percent.

Crash victim Rossi misses San Marino
Paris: Crash victim Valentino Rossi was confirmed as a non-starter for this weekend's San Marino MotoGP, his Yamaha team announced on Monday.
The Italian nine-time world champion is recovering from a broken leg after a training crash last week.
The 38-year-old motorcycling legend underwent surgery in Ancona in Italy on Friday, discharging himself from hospital the following day. His Yamaha team said it "regrets to report that Valentino Rossi will not be able to compete" in the 13th race of the 2017 season.
Rossi's enforced absence leaves his teammate Maverick Vinales to fly the Movistar Yamaha team's flag in San Marino. Vinales is placed third in the world title race on 170 points, 13 behind Ducati leader Andrea Dovizioso.
Rossi, who is placed fourth on 157 points, is facing a race against time to be fit for the following race in Spain on September 24.
On leaving hospital Rossi vowed to get back on his bike as quickly as possible.
"I will begin the rehabilitation as soon as possible and we'll see how my body reacts before making any decisions," he said.
"It will depend a lot on him but I think that he will have to rest at least 40 days," Dr. Raffaele Pascarella, who carried out the surgery, suggested on Friday. AFP

Del Potro sets up Federer US Open showdown
New York: Juan Martin del Potro shrugged off sickness to save two match points and defeat Dominic Thiem in a five-set US Open epic on Monday to book a quarter-final showdown with five-time champion Roger Federer.
Argentina 24th seed Del Potro claimed a heroic 1-6, 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/1), 6-4 victory over the sixth-seeded Austrian on a rocking Grandstand court, describing it as night he would remember forever.
Del Potro famously defeated Federer in the 2009 final for his only career Grand Slam title before his career was almost torpedoed by a succession of wrist surgeries.
Federer, the third seed, eased into the last-eight with a 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 win over Philipp Kohlschreiber, taking his record over the German veteran to 12-0.
Elsewhere, top seed Rafael Nadal claimed his 50th win at the US Open and will meet Russian teenager Andrey Rublev.
In the women's event, world number one Karolina Pliskova set-up a quarter-final date against America's CoCo Vandeweghe.
Estonia's world number 418 Kaia Kanepi also reached the quarter-finals, just the second qualifier to make the last eight.
But the day belonged to Del Potro, who celebrated his win, which came off a Thiem double fault, by stretching out his arms, head facing the night sky, as his legion of fans, many dressed in the light blue colors of Argentina's famed football and Pumas rugby teams, celebrated wildly.
"Oh my God," said Del Potro, who had been 2-5 down in the fourth set.
"I was sick the last two days. I came here trying to play the best I can and then when I see this crowd cheering for me, I was trying to play better every game. I will always remember this."
- Federer's 'bum' note -
Federer has a 16-5 advantage over Del Potro but they have split their last six meetings.
The 36-year-old Swiss maestro didn't face a break point against Kohlschreiber with his biggest challenge having to take a medical time-out off court at the end of the second set.
"I needed a rub on my back... or bottom and I didn't want to do it in front of you guys," he explained before he turned his attentions to Del Potro.
"It's great to see him back on tour. He's had a rough ride with wrist problems. He's a good guy."
World number one and 2010 and 2013 champion Nadal, who could meet Federer for the first time in New York in the semi-finals, crushed Ukraine's Alexander Dolgopolov 6-2, 6-4, 6-1.
The 31-year-old Spaniard goes on to face Russian 19-year-old Rublev, who stunned Belgian ninth seed David Goffin 7-5, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to become the youngest quarter-finalist since Andy Roddick in 2001.
"I played a solid match with not many mistakes," said Nadal, the reigning French Open champion.
Rublev, ranked 53, has won 13 of his last 17 matches after breaking the top 100 for the first time in June.
"Rafa is a real champion. I will try to do my best -- I have nothing to lose," said Rublev.
Meanwhile, the 32-year-old Kanepi, a former world number 15 whose career was almost ended by illness and a crippling injury, downed Russia's Daria Kasatkina 6-4, 6-4.
She will next face Madison Keys of the United States, who put out fourth seed Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/2), 1-6, 6-4, ending the Ukrainian's hopes of taking the world number one spot.
It will be Kanepi's sixth quarter-final at the majors and second in New York after also reaching the last eight in 2010.
"It's very tough to believe where I am now after all that has happened. I didn't expect it," said Kanepi, who is playing in the main draw of an event for the first time this year.
Top seed Pliskova, the runner-up in 2016, needed just 46 minutes to sweep past American Jennifer Brady 6-1, 6-0 and make her third Slam quarter-final of the year.
She will next face American 20th seed CoCo Vandeweghe, who made the last eight for the first time by beating Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 6-4, 7-6 (7/2). AFP

Director Colin Trevorrow has dropped out of Star Wars: Episode IX because he and Lucasfilm have differing "visions".
Episode IX is expected to star Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and is due out in May 2019. Lucasfilm will now seek a replacement for Trevorrow, who is best known for directing Jurassic World.
His departure comes less than three months aftera Han Solo spin-off film also lost its directors.
Phil Lord and Christopher Millerwere replaced by Ron Howard.
On Tuesday,a statementon the Star Wars website said: "Lucasfilm and Colin Trevorrow have mutually chosen to part ways on Star Wars: Episode IX.
"Colin has been a wonderful collaborator throughout the development process, but we have all come to the conclusion that our visions for the project differ. We wish Colin the best and will be sharing more information about the film soon."
British writer Jack Thorne - who wrote the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child -is reported to beworking on the screenplay for Episode IX.
Lucasfilm has a reputation for ruthlessness when it comes to hiring and firing directors. In 2015, Fantastic Four's Josh Trank was dropped from directing a standalone Star Wars story.

Unilever Fair & Lovely MEN is the title sponsor for this tournament and seven teams will bat against their opponents for the Fair & Lovely MEN Challenge Trophy.
Men in modern era are geared to set new standards on both on field and off the field. On field, they work hard to achieve their goals and do what it takes to get them there.

Fate of 800,000 young immigrants in Trumps hands
US: President Donald Trump plans to announce Tuesday his decision on whether to end an amnesty for hundreds of thousands of people brought to America illegally as minors and who for the most part are thoroughly integrated into US society.
His predecessor Barack Obama implemented the so-called DACA program -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- five years ago to help bring these young immigrants out of the shadows of illegality, permitting them to study and work without fear.
The debate over DACA has been intense on both sides. For days White House officials have insisted that numerous options are under study, warning against any hasty conclusions before the official announcement.
But one reporting line has repeatedly surfaced: that the US president, determined to keep a central pledge to his political base to fight illegal immigration, plans to end the symbolically important program after a six-month delay intended to give Congress time to find a solution for the approximately 800,000 Dreamers, most of them from Latin America.
Several Republican lawmakers have warned against the temptation to cancel the popular program outright, a decision that could lead to the expulsion of many Dreamers.
Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma summed up the concern of many, saying that we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents. But the prospects of a badly divided Congress reaching a compromise in months on a subject that has eluded agreement for years -- immigration -- seem dim.
Trump, despite his inflammatory campaign-trail diatribes against immigration, has publicly agonized and equivocated over the fate of the young immigrants since arriving in the White House.
Calling his decision one of the most difficult facing him, he has promised to deal with DACA with great heart. We love the Dreamers, he said Friday during a brief exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. He added, We love everybody.
Trump advisers indicated over the weekend that the presidents decision would be guided as well by economic considerations.
The president wants to do whats fair to the American worker, whats fair to people in this country who are competing for jobs, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News.
Much of the business world, and particularly the high-tech firms of Californias Silicon Valley, stands firmly against a DACA repeal. The program offers the equivalent of a residence permit -- renewable every two years -- to young people who were under 16 when they arrived and who have no criminal record.
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg changed his profile on the social network on Saturday, adding a simple message to his photo: #Here to Stay -- I support DACA. - AFP

FCID to receive AGs advice on Karuna Amman

The FCID conducting investigations into an incident where former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman had allegedly misused a Presidential Secretariat bullet proof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million, informed Court today that they have sought Attorney Generals advice regarding future legal action against the former Deputy Minister.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the FCID informed court that they were yet to receive Attorney Generals advice regarding the incident.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had purposely ignored his duty to hand this vehicle over to the Presidential Secretariat following losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the FCID on November last year over the allegation that he failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat following losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The FCID further alleged that the former deputy minister had failed to return this vehicle until August 2016 by violating the provisions of Public Property Act. He is currently out on bail.
Defense counsel Kanchana Ratwatte appeared for the suspect

Feel healthier in one week
You might not have been successful in attaining your fitness and diet goals in time for summer but heres how you can start doing things that can make you look and feel healthier.
Youre probably not going to wake up looking like a model tomorrow - but you can certainly start feeling better and improving your digestion in a week, according to dietitian and nutritionist Andy Bellatti.
Here are a few things Bellatti and other nutritionists recommend:
DO: Drink lots of water
Water is essential - it regulates the shape of every cell inside our bodies. If we dont get enough, in fact, these cells begin to shrivel up. The CDC recommends choosing water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages to help with weight management.
DONT: Go on a juice cleanse
If youre considering a detox or juice cleanse, you might want to reconsider. Drinking just water, juice, or any other liquefied concoction for more than a few days can set you up for unhealthy eating behaviors, and can often lead to spikes and drops in blood sugar levels, which can spawn cravings and mood swings.
DO: Cut back on sodium
Not drowning your sushi in soy sauce can be a good start. Too much salt in your diet can cause puffiness and bloating, so cutting back can help you avoid that.
DONT: Start banning foods
Theres a difference between cutting back on things you eat in excess and banning certain food groups entirely. Diets that rely on avoiding ingredients (like sugar or gluten) can lead to replacing those things with other ingredients that play the same role in the body (like honey or corn-based foods). Doing this can be dangerous if the replacement products are nutrient-deficient.
DO: Fill up with fibre
Fresh, high-fiber vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, and brussels sprouts - which the CDC calls powerhouse foods - are a great source of key vitamins and nutrients, including fiber, which helps keep you feeling full and satisfied until your next meal.Whole, plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds) are best, Bellatti said. One quick way to add extra fiber to your day: sprinkle chia, hemp, or ground flax over whatever youre eating for a boost.
DONT: Rely on powders and pills
The problem with diet powders and pills, Bellatti says, is that they often take something that was once a whole food, like a fruit or a vegetable, then process it to separate out one ingredient. Thats alright for things like cocoa powder, which does have nutrients, but it shouldnt make up the bulk of your dietary intake.
DONT: Focus exclusively on calories
Focusing too much on calories can be dangerous, too, since the measurement falsely makes it seem like a calorie of one food is exactly the same as that of another. This is especially true when eating at restaurants, Bellatti said.
Many low-calorie items are loaded with sodium, which retains water and can leave you feeling bloated.
DO: Think positive
Thinking positively about eating and feeling better can help motivate some people to stick to a new lifestyle. In terms of changing the way you eat (its much more than a diet), focus on the opportunities and what you can eat as opposed to what foods youre trying to cut down on, Dr. Donald Hensrud, who chairs the Mayo Clinics division of preventive, occupational and aerospace medicine, wrote in a blog post.
There are many wonderful foods and recipes to explore, and believe it or not, we can learn to like new foods.

Fitch rates PABCs outstanding debentures BB+(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLCs (PABC, BBB-(lka)/Stable) outstanding Sri Lanka rupee-denominated Basel II-compliant subordinated debentures a National Long-Term Rating at BB+(lka).
The debentures mature in 2019 and amount to Rs 3 billion.
The outstanding subordinated debentures are rated one notch below PABCs National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured creditors. PABCs National Long-Term Rating of BBB-(lka) reflects declining capitalisation following its rapid growth in the past. The bank raised Rs 2.1 billion in March 2017 via a rights issue to increase its minimum regulatory capital to meet the Rs 7.5 billion target which was due on 1 January 2017.
PABC is required to increase this further to LKR10 billion by 1 January 2018. Fitch believes that the banks earnings retention alone is not likely to be sufficient to achieve the capital standards, despite improved profitability. The rating on the outstanding debentures will move in tandem with PABCs National Long-Term Rating.
An upgrade of PABCs rating is contingent upon the bank achieving a sustained and significant improvement in capitalisation, alongside a moderation in risk appetite. PABCs rating would be downgraded if loss-absorption buffers deteriorate further, either through aggressive loan-book growth or a greater share of unprovided NPLs.
A full list of PABCs ratings are as follows: National Long-Term Rating: BBB-(lka); Outlook Stable Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior unsecured debentures: BBB-(lka) The following outstanding Basel II-compliant subordinated debentures are rated BB+(lka): - Rs 1.91 billion 9.75% listed subordinated debentures due 2019  Rs 1.09 billion 9.523% listed subordinated debentures due 2019

Fresh demands to amend Local Authorities Bill will further delay Local Government Elections: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out the fresh demand by the Joint Opposition to once again amend the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance would further delay the long awaited Local Government Elections.
The Premier was responding to a question by JO MP Dullas Allahapperuma in Parliament today.
The Prime Minister, observing that the space to hold the LG elections by the end of December or early January has been created, stated that bringing in more amendments at this stage would cause further delays in holding the elections.
The new electoral system may not be perfect. Let us experiment it at the LG polls. Then we can study its loopholes and bring in more amendments as necessary. That was the agreement of the House. Most of the issues raised now have been debated prior to passage of the Bill. It is up to the Party Leaders to discuss and decide whether to bring in more amendments or to go for elections as soon as possible, the Premier explained.
MP Allahapperuma, taking his turn at the PMs question round, stated several new problems have cropped up due to certain Amendments incorporated at the third reading of the Bill.
He insisted that disqualifying a selected category of public servants (field officers) from contesting at elections and applying this law retrospectively are a violation of fundamental rights of those public servants. He also objected to the removal of 30 percent quota to the youth. He also complained against the removal of bonus seats and cut off marks and the removal of the provision to hold by-elections.
The Premier, replying to these concerns, said many proposals came up with regard to the bonus seats, adding that the final agreement was to test the new system sans bonus seats at the LG polls and then take a final decision.

An indefinite island-wide strike will be carried out by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with the Anti SAITM People's Barricade after September 15 if the Government fails to resolve the issue soon, GMOA Media Committee Member Dr. Prasad Kolambage said.
He was addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo on Monday.
Prasad said an anti SAITM vehicle parade would take place covering the entire country and it would reach Colombo on September 15.
The final protest against the SAITM prior to the island-wide strike would take place on September 15 at the Lipton Circus, Colombo on the same day, he said.
Dr. Kolambage said the SAITM issue must be solved by the Government without delay.
"Over 90 percent of the committee appointed by the President comprises pro SAITM individuals who openly supported the SAITM before. One is Prof. Mohan De Silva. Therefore, a solution for the issue will not be given in this way," he said.
The Government came into power promising good governance and action against corruption and malpractices. Former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe clearly stated that the Health Ministry was utterly corrupt before his removal from the post," he said.

Great Naval Tragedies: USS Indianapolis (CA-35) reclaimed
August 19, 2017, is a special day for US navy, researchers and world war history enthusiasts because after 72 years and several unsuccessful expeditions later an expedition team finally managed to identify the wreckage of USS Indianapolis.
USS Indianapolis was one of two Portland-class heavy cruisers (Other ship was USS Portland). Her construction started in March 31, 1930, and launched in November 7, 1931. After USS Indianapolis commissioned on 1932 November 15, this vessel served as a flagship under several commanders. After a lengthy list of important missions during Interwar period and World War II period, one fateful mission standout above the rest because it helped form the geopolitical power balance of the todays world.
July 16, 1945, was the day that Manhattan project conducted its Trinity test. Trinity test was the codename of the first artificial nuclear explosion in human history. Same day within hours of the Trinity test USS Indianapolis left San Franciscos Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for a top secret mission. It was ordered to deliver parts and enriched Uranium 235 for the nuclear bomb Little Boy. (Little Boy was the first nuclear bomb to be used in history of warfare and the second artificial atomic explosion in the history while Trinity test being the one. Little Boy dropped on Hiroshima in Japan on 1945 August 06.) With nearly a half of Uranium 235 supply on Earth at that time, USS Indianapolis traveled from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor with record breaking speed of 74.5 hours with an average speed of 29 knots. From Pearl Harbor she reached her destination of Tinian Island on July 26, 1945.
After completing the secret mission Indianapolis was sent to Guam. In July 28 1945, she left Guam to go for Leyte. July 30, 1945, USS Indianapolis crossed her path with Japanese I-58, a B3 type cruiser submarine. I-58 submarine managed to sink Indianapolis by shooting two torpedoes to the ship. Ship sank in 12 minutes. Approximately 300 of 1196 crew members went down with the ship, others was manage to remain adrift. Remaining crew faced hyperthermia, dehydration, saltwater poisoning and shark attacks. After 4 days when the rescue came only 317 crew members were survived from initial 1196 crew thus making this is the greatest loss of life from a single ship in United States navy. Survived Captain Charles B. McVay III was court-martialed and convicted for hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag. The commander of Japanese I-58, Mochitsura Hashimoto testified that zigzagging would have made no difference. McVay was the only captain to be court-martialed for sinking his ship even though US navy lost many ships during the World War II.
Several expeditions were conducted to find the remaining of Indianapolis ship during past. On August 19, 2017, the USS Indianapolis Project group on the research vessel named Petrel finally managed to discover the wreckage on the floor of North Pacific Ocean. This research team was led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Since 1960, the survivors of this tragedy held reunions to honor their lost companions. This discovery will be a long waited closer to those remaining survivors.

Hayleys Puritas Sathdiyawara continues rejuvenation of rural communities in SLs dry zone
Sri Lanka continues to grapple with a rising number of cases of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu), with estimates of thousands of cases across Sri Lankas North Central, East, Uva, Southern and Northern provinces being recorded over the past decade alone.
The Hayleys Group has been actively combating the spread of the disease through the installation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants all across Sri Lankas dry zone under its flagship CSR programme, Puritas Sathdiyawara.
Awareness and concern over the ravaging effect that this affliction has had on families and communities across the region is on the rise and it appears that the spread of CKDu is closely correlated with harsh, hot, and extremely parched conditions prevalent in these areas and resulting water-scarcity in the area.
Dutuwewa is one such village in Sri Lankas North Central Province which has for decades endured these harsh conditions with little to no outside assistance until recently when a dedicated RO water purification plant was established in the village as part of the continuing efforts of the Hayleys Puritas Sathdiyawara, ending the scarcity of drinking water which area residents had weathered for so many years.
Speaking at the ceremonial opening of the plant, Chairman and Chief Executive of Hayleys Group Mohan Pandithage said: Our goal with Puritas Sathdiyawara from the outset has been to ensure that we are able to make a lasting and meaningful improvement to the lives of these once vibrant rural communities. It is our duty to ensure that the basic needs of the people and communities of this nation are met, and their aspirations nurtured. Access to, safe, clean drinking water for these communities is absolutely imperative and we at Hayleys are fully committed to do as much as possible to fulfil this fundamental need and help to ease the plight of our people.
Following the construction of its first RO plant in Maithreepura, Padaviya, one of the villages worst affected by CKDu in 2014, Puritas Sathdiyawara has gone on to install 16 RO plants across four districts, providing life-saving access to clean drinking water for over 33,000 people across 19 villages in the North and North Central Provinces.
In keeping with the established model of Sathdiyawara where key sectors of Hayleys Group companies sponsor the construction of a new RO plant, the Dutuwewa facility was sponsored by the Hayleys Groups tea marketing and export business, Mabroc Teas.
As one of Sri Lankas most respected exporters of premium teas sourced from 38 tea estates in Sri Lanka, Mabroc tea gardens are certified by Rainforest Alliance and conform to HACCP and ISO 22000:2005, ISO 9001:2008, EU and other international standard. Consequently, the company maintains a long-standing engagement in sustainable initiatives which aligns well with the objectives of Puritas Sathdiyawara.
It is a true honour for Mabroc Teas to be part of the Puritas Sathdiyawara initiative. This is our very first RO plant commissioning and we consider it a privilege to be able to contribute towards a project that will drastically improve the lives of so many families and communities in Dutuwewa, Mabroc Managing Director, Niran Ranatunga said.
Abeyratne a village farmer commented Not having clean water all these years has been extremely difficult. And this contaminated water has caused a fast increasing rise in CKDu affliction. There were many relatives and friends who were diagnosed with CKDu and for them life has been hard. They get exhausted very easily, and get angry and frustrated as the disease affects their moods and disposition. It has been a great relief for all of us that we no longer have to worry about the poor quality and severe lack of water. We used to get water from the wells located in the area. This water has always been very hard and brackish. We are now so used to drinking clean and pure water that we realize how unbearable the previous water we have had all our lives tasted, and the harm it caused our families. We could not bear to drink that again.
My parents moved here from the Kandy district almost 60 years ago. At that time we had of course never heard of kidney disease and we would get the water we needed from wells that we usually had to dig ourselves. While life was never too easy for us, I feel that especially over the last 10 years, it has become much more difficult. The droughts are worse than ever before and it saddens us greatly to see how many of our friends and members of the community have lost their lives to kidney disease, G. R. Sugadathasa, a local farmer and former Treasurer of the Regional Welfare Society explained.
The families that first settled this area following the construction of reservoirs in the area so many decades ago, still have their descendants living and working the same land. However changing climate patterns and a rising epidemic of CKDu, together with lack of basic comforts that draw younger Sri Lankans out of the rural lifestyles and into increasingly densely populated urban centres have taken a severe toll on these communities. We want our children to stay here and help the village grow and prosper and become like the cities one day. If everyone leaves, our villages will remain unchanged," Sugathadasa added.
In charge of the Dutuwewa RO plant is Nandana, President of the villages Community Based Organization. Having worked in close collaboration with Hayleys, Nandana is now determined to ensure that once the plant is up and running that a systematic but simple process is established to manage the plant.
Before Hayleys got involved, we had requested assistance from every person we could think of, because we could see members from our community fall ill and we knew that something had to be done. We are fortunate and extremely grateful to the Hayleys Group in hearing of our need and coming to our aid when it was most needed. This gift was totally unexpected. When we heard that our village would be receiving this RO plant, we never knew that it would be such a massive one. This unit is capable of supplying the total water needs of our villages consumption. Now that they have done their part, we must do ours and ensure that this invaluable gift is well maintained and managed for future generations.
He noted however that with the prolonged hardships that area residents had to face, many from the younger generation seem to have gravitated towards the idea of seeking out jobs in the city.
In the process, he felt that some of the sense of community that he had enjoyed growing up had been diluted. However he noted that the fact that the RO plant was also built to with a dual purpose of serving as a community centre equipped with computers, internet facilities, and books and toys for children, as well as regular deliveries of newspapers, would in addition to quenching the thirst of residents, also bring them together in a shared space, thus serving to revitalize the ties that had helped establish this community over six decades ago.
It is true that many of our young people are thinking about moving away from the village and they think that this will give them more freedom than what they have here. But my goal is to keep working and build our village to be as good as Colombo or any other big city when it comes to the ability to make a living. We believe this is possible and we will not give up on this dream, Abeyratne, a farmer from the village explained.
Imasha Udara, a Grade 10 student with aspirations to complete her education and share her learning with others, said, Now that we have computers here, this will be so much easier for us students to read and to learn how to use computers. We can use them to learn so much more so we are all very excited.
Location is naturally crucial to the success and impact of each Puritas Sathdiyawara plant, and a lot of effort is channelled into ensuring that an optimal location is found which the closest and most central point is for area residents. Remarkably, the land on which the new Dutuwewa RO facility (approximately 10 perches) and community centre is located on was freely donated to the Community Based Organization by one of the families.
R.A. Mallika Ranawaka a member of the Ranawaka family shared her reasons for donation. We inherited all this land of 1 acre from my father, and since we wanted to honour our parents memory we wanted to contribute this 10 perches of it to this very worthy cause which will help uplift the lives of families and friends in our village, and do our part for an important social cause.
After I discussed it with my brothers, we all decided that it was the right thing to do. We have seen how our community has suffered from a lack of clean drinking water and from the agonizing CKD affliction. The fact that this plant is now installed and that it will help all the 3000 families in our community makes us all very happy, she explained.

HC allows Prasanna Ranathunga and his wife to go abroad

The Colombo High Court day permitted Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife Maureen Ranatunga to go abroad for a period of three weeks.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs.64 million.
When the case came up before Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, defense counsel appearing on behalf of the accused sought Courts permission to release their passports to obtain Australian visa. Accordingly, two accused were permitted to leave country between September 9 and October 2.
At a previous occasion, Colombo High Court decided to proceed the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading Courts since the beginning of investigations.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences during the period between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as Courts productions against three accused in this case. The prosecutors maintained that businessman Gehard Mendis who purchased a 2.5 acre land in Meethotamulla sometime back had allegedly requested the former Chief Minister to evacuate the unlawful occupants of that land and fill it with soil. The prosecutors alleged that the former Chief Ministers wife along with two others had entered into an agreement with the businessman and the latter had already paid Rs.15 million to the former for the services.
The businessman Gehard Mendis had lodged a complaint with FCID saying that the former Chief Minister had threatened him over the phone demanding the rest of the money involved in a promised deal.
The prosecution maintained that the investigations have revealed that the accused had misappropriated a sum of Rs.15 million and the voice recordings of the alleged incident had been listed as a production

Huawei join hands with Just in Time Group for CSR in Deniyaya
Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) company joined hands once again with Just In Time Group (JIT) a Sri Lankan owned ICT Systems Integration Company to initiate a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity in Deniyaya.
The initiative was brought forward in order to support students who have been affected by the recent floods which occurred in that region.
Affected children from Deniyaya received donations of school bags, each containing educational appliances necessary for their study needs, which would help them continue with their schooling. The CSR event was patronized by Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Sagala Ratnayaka, Huawei Sri Lanka CEO Shunli Wang and other dignitaries.
Deniyaya was reported to have encountered massive landslides and persistent rains, especially in the area of Morawaka Kanda, which had resulted in a number of deaths and displaced residents. School children were affected due to this epidemic.
In light of these events, requests from benefactors which included Huawei and JIT decided to come forward and assist flood affected students with their education. School children had their books and educational material destroyed as a result of these rains.
Previously, Huawei had also collaborated with JIT as strategic partners to work together in projects that were aimed towards supporting Sri Lankas ICT and digital economy. Many initiatives that Huawei had conducted in their quest to empower Sri Lankas futuristic goals through CSR, Seeds for the Future was one such initiative which took place recently supporting and sponsoring young minds from state universities who were selected to travel to the Huawei Headquarters in Shenzhen, China on a study trip.
Commenting on the initiative that was taken by Huawei, Huawei Sri Lanka CEO Shunli Wang stated, We were saddened to witness the recent epidemic which Sri Lanka had to endure recently. We identified with the areas that highlighted their need for assistance. Huawei decided to join hands with our strategic partners JIT and provide support to young school children who were especially affected by this issue.
The purpose of this concept that was introduced to Sri Lanka was to enable opportunities for networking and the chance to connect with the rest of the world with the hope of exchanging latest technologies and best practices which would one day prove influential for Sri Lankas evolving digital landscape.
The CSIC was also endorsed by the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando as an ideal learning centre which would benefit youth and students through excursions and get to witness the innovations of a global ICT company.

Hurricane Irma: Leeward islands, Haiti, Florida prepare for 'potentially catastrophic' storm

Islands in the Caribbean have made last-minute preparations for Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade, with officials warning of its "potentially catastrophic" effects.
The category five hurricane, the highest possible level, has sustained wind speeds reaching 295km/h (185mph).
It is starting to hit the Leeward Islands and will move on towards Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
In the US, Florida's Key West area has ordered a mandatory evacuation.
Visitors will be required to leave on Wednesday morning, with residents due to follow in the evening, and the international airport will halt all flights.
"We're emphatically telling people you must evacuate. You cannot afford to stay on an island with a category five hurricane coming at you," said Martin Senterfitt, the emergency operations centre director in Monroe County in Florida.
Closer to the storm, thousands of people have been evacuated from at-risk areas. Residents have flocked to shops for food, water, and emergency supplies, and in several locations goods were already in short supply.
Airports have closed on several islands, popular holiday destinations, and authorities have urged people to go to public shelters.
US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, mobilizing federal disaster relief efforts for those areas.
In Puerto Rico, a 75-year-old man died during preparations for the storm, which has been described by Governor Ricardo Rossello as "something without precedent".
Storm surges, life-threatening winds and torrential rainfall are expected along the Leeward Islands, which include Antigua, Barbuda and Anguilla.
Alison Strand, originally from Staffordshire in the UK, is on the island of Anguilla. She said her family had spent the last several hours fortifying her home on the coast, which "will be the first house hit by the storm".
"Our house is 5m (15ft) above sea level and we're expecting 8m swells, so we're just crossing our fingers," she said. "We are expecting to lose our wooden roof."
Gary Randall, head of the Blue Waters Resort on Antigua's north coast, said: "I wasn't that nervous yesterday, but today I'm nervous."
Staff had boarded up windows, stripped trees of coconuts to stop them damaging property and secured anything that could become a hazard.
Predicted path of Hurricane Irma
Carolyne Coleby, in Montserrat, said: "Irma is about to hit us full force."
"I am a goat farmer and have to consider my livestock. Last night I moved 20 goats to a backhouse at a hostel I manage which is on slightly higher ground," she said.
"I am hoping the galvanised roof of the backhouse doesn't fly off. I can't go to the shelter because I can't leave my animals."
The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said Irmawas moving at a speed of 24km/h (15mph), saying that the storm was "potentially catastrophic",
There are hurricane warnings for:
Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis
Saba, St Eustatius and Sint Maarten
Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy
The British Virgin Islands
The US Virgin Islands
Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra
Dominican Republic, for the northern region
Guadeloupe
Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the south-eastern Bahamas are on hurricane watch.
How hard has Harvey hit the local economy
Parts of Texas and Louisiana are dealing with the damage done by Hurricane Harvey in late August. But it is not yet clear what impact Hurricane Irma might have on the US mainland.
The mainland has not been hit by two category four hurricanes in one season since the storms were first recorded in 1851.
A third tropical storm, Jose, has formed further out in the Atlantic behind Irma, and is expected to become a hurricane later on in the week.

I didnt make decision to place bids: Salgado
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue on Monday questioned the Chief Dealer of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited Nuwan Salgado on the February 27, 2015 auction. He was also questioned on the final sales of the bonds purchased at the auction, to the Employees Provident Fund.
Salgado told the PCoI that he did not make the decision to place bids worth 15 billion at the auction. According to Salgado, CEO of PTL Kasun Palisena took the decision to place the bid.
Arjun Aloysius would have been consulted regarding the decision as well, Salgado said.
Justice P.S. Jayawardena: February 27, 2015 bids opened ways to earn phenomenal earnings, am I correct
The witness remains silent, followed by a Come on! from Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda. Witness then replies Yes.
ASG Kodagoda: You were the Chief Dealer. Was it you who decided on the bids
Salgado: It was Kasun Palisena.
ASG Kodagoda: Was it on or not on Arjun Aloysiuss instructions Kasun Palisena placed these bids
S: Would have.
Salgado became the Chief Dealer of PTL on February 1, 2015. Consequently, Kasun Palisena had become the PTL CEO, meanwhile former CEO of PTL Arjun Aloysius stepped down from his post.
The commission then asked Salgado regarding the way in which PTL business decisions were taken and by whom.
Salgado said the decisions regarding transactions would have come from CEO Kasun Palisena. He said he was not privy to conversations between Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena to confirm that the former gave instructions to the latter.
Justice P.S. Jayawardena: Now, Arjun Aloysius remained in the board of PTL and kept contacting Kasun Palisena on business transaction. So when Palisena was out of the country, who contacted you regarding daily business transactions
Salgadu: Aloysius.
JJ: So the overall control was with Arjun Aloysius
It was evident that the witness was rather hesitant to give an answer.
JJ: Who was in the final control of the company
S: There would have been collective decisions from Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius.
According to Salgado on the same matter, Arjun Aloysius kept his eyes on PTL business frequently.
Justice Jayawardena: Frequently It should be on a daily basis. It is a lot of money you are talking about.
Salgado: Yes.
JJ: Was not Aloysius the overall chief in charge
S: yes.
The PCoI also questioned Salgado on PTLs transactions with the Employees Provident Fund.
Salgado said he was not able to close much deals with the EPF and went on to say that he contacted one Udayaseelan of the EPF regarding deals.
The commission asked if Salgado ever contacted Indika Saman Kumara of the EPF. Salgado said he has never contacted Saman Kumara. It was difficult to reach him. I do not even have Saman Kumaras mobile number, he said.
Chairman Justice Chitrasiri: So was it like Kasun Palisena kept you away from dealing with EPF even though you were the Chief Dealer
Salgado : Kasun Palisena handled EPF more than I did. I have an impression that Kasun Palisena and Saman Kumara knew each other well.
Salgado also disassociated himself from the final sales of the treasury bonds purchased at the 27 February 2015 auction. The final sales have been done mainly and on large volumes with the EPF.
Chairman Chitrasiri : Why do you say you have no responsibility on deals with Saman Kumara and PTL
Salgado: I can stand by the deals that I have done with the EPF. But not with deals done by someone else.
CC: Why dont you want to associate with the questioned auctions final sales to EPF
Salgado: I can only tell about myself and what deals I made. I cannot tell about deals made by others.
Justice Jayawardena: You know that the largest profit from the bonds purchased at the 27 February auction was realized by selling them to the EPF
Salgado: Yes.
JJ: All these deals were done by Palisena and Saman Kumara
S: Yes.
The witness, speaking on the deleted PTL telephone call recordings said he cannot remember either the content or the parties who were involved with these conversations. Even though Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri, Commissioner Jayawardena and ASG Kodagoda questioned the witness more than several times on the matter, the witness stood by his statement that he does not remember much.
However, the witness pointed out he has handed over all telephone call recordings including the ones deleted are now with the PCoI investigators.
Chairman Chitrasiri: Cant you recall the conversations Surely you can remember what type of conversations they were! At least one
Justice Jayawardena: Mr. Salgadu, if you were sitting here, even you would think the same!

India Supreme Court allows 13-year-old rape victim to terminate pregnancy

India's Supreme Court has given permission to a 13-year-old rape victim from the city of Mumbai to terminate her pregnancy.
The girl, who is 32 weeks pregnant, needed the court's assent since Indian law allows terminations after 20 weeks only if the mother's life is in danger.
The pregnancy was discovered after her parents took her to a doctor to seek treatment for obesity.
The abortion is set to take place on Friday, her lawyer told the BBC.
The girl alleges she was raped by her father's colleague. He is under arrest.
Her case comes just days after a 10-year-old, also a rape victim,gave birthto a baby girl in the northern city of Chandigarh.
Her plight madeglobal headlinesafter the court turned down her request for an abortion on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy.
In May, a similar case was reported from the northern town of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, wasallowed to abort. None of the girls can be named for legal reasons.

Instrument of love
Veena, an ancient historical instrument, is traced back to 1500 BC. Initially, the total number of strings range from one string to one hundred strings. There is some evidence about Altharvana Veda.
Before the existence of Veena, another string instrument named Yazh was in use. Yazh was replaced by Veena with the passage of time. One of the oldest treatises on Indian music named Sangeeta Ratnahara clearly indicates about another Veena called Eakantri Veena and its construction.
Decorative sculptures
Earlier Veena was played in vertical position. Veena with vertical positions is still depicted in ancient temple decorative sculptures. According to the ancient history, the great Carnatic maestro Muthuswamy Dkshitar was the first one who played the Veena in the horizontal position.
Veena was considered as one of the more sophisticated instrument to display the different nuances of different Ragas. The present day Saraswathi Veena instrument was brought in use during the regime of King Ragunatha Nayaka.
In his royal courts, it is said that his prime minister named Govinda Dikshakar was the first one who constructed the Veena. Initially, the Veena had twenty frets. But Govinda Dikshakar constructed the present day Veena with twenty-four metallic frets.
Numerous varieties of Veenas are mentioned in numerous ancient texts. Among them, Saraswathi Veena is considered as one of the most divine instrument. Goddess Saraswathi is always depicted with a Veena in hand. This variety of Veena is quite popular among the present day Carnatic music world. Obviously, it is a South Indian musical instrument. Chitra Veena, Vichitra Veena, and Rudra Veenas are some of the Veena varieties are also much more popular in the music world. Saraswathi Veena and Chitra Veena are now in use for Carnatic music.
Rhythmic purposes
A total number of strings for Saraswathi Veena are seven in number. Four strings are main strings. These four main strings are especially attached to the peg of the neck. For the rhythmic purpose, three strings are allocated. These three strings are served for the drone and rhythmic purposes. Meanwhile, the supportive strings are very much needed for the instrument which is seen over the body part of the string instrument.
According to the great Indian musicologist Prof Sambamoorthy, Saraswathi Veena was developed out of one earlier form of Veena known as Kinnari Veena. Saraswathi Veena is also referred to as Ragunatha Veena. Because this particular variety of Veena was developed and introduced during the Nayaka ear of Tanjore. The Veena was first modified and constructed during the Nayaka regime of King Raghunath Nayak. Thats why this Saraswathi Veena is often called as Raghunath Veena or Tanjore Veena. Goddess Saraswathi is often depicted with this string instrument, thats why this string instrument is called Saraswathi Veena. One of the very important concepts in Carnatic music is Tanam.
It is a technique of using a Raga, in three different tempos. Those tempos are in slow, medium and fast tempos. Playing tempos through Veena is a unique style. During his regime his Prime Minister Govinda Dikshitar who constructed the Veena with twenty-four frets. Earlier total number of frets used in Veena was twenty. Today Saraswathi Veena has twenty-four metallic frets. It was stated that this was the main cause for the development seventy-two Melakaratas in Carnatic music system. It is stated that the style of presentations in Carnatic music system has more or less developed out of the Veena technique. All the great Carnatic music maestros of yester years were the outstanding Veena players.

Kantar Worldpanel names Munchee as SLs number one FMCG Brand
The Kantar Worldpanels Global Brand Footprint Report, have yet again named Munchee as Sri Lankas Number One FMCG Brand for 2017.
This survey was conducted in Sri Lanka by the UK based International research company and Munchee was able to secure its position as Sri Lanka's No. 1 brand for the year 2016.
The flagship brand of CBL (Ceylon Biscuits Limited), Munchee, has been consistently rated the leader in the FMCG market in Sri Lanka.
Every year, Kantar Worldpanel conducts an exhaustive study of FMCG brands across the globe and selects the strongest FMCG brands from each country. Rankings of Kantar Brand Foot Print 2017, reveals the strength of brands in 43 countries around the world, across the Food, Beverage, Health & Beauty and Home Care categories. The report is the largest of its type, covering 15,300 brands, 200 categories, 43 countries and five continents, representing 73% of the global population. The Brand Footprint Report further states that household consumption drives the majority of sales in the FMCG segment due in large part to long-term trends such as a growing urban middle class with rising disposable incomes and changing consumer preferences for traditionally Western products.
Reflecting this trend, Munchee remains a household name in Sri Lanka, supported strongly by a strong distribution network, high quality and innovative products suited to the local palate.
On receiving this accolade, the Marketing Team at Munchee commented, We are grateful to the people of Sri Lanka for having given us their seal of approval! Universal approval from the nation is the ultimate endorsement of our brand quality and this gives us immense pride.
In the global survey, to select a country's number one brand, key consideration was the consumer reach points, which is based on the number of households in the country (population); percentage of households buying the brand (penetration); and number of interactions with the brand across categories in a year (occasions).
Munchees secret to success has been its scientific and well informed brand decision-making; agility in evolving to suit the macro environment; leveraging on advanced technology; and resonating with an increasingly divergent buyer base, not just in terms of positioning but also format, pricing and promotions.

Lanka look to salvage something out of wreck
Beaten comprehensively in the three Tests and five One-Day Internationals, Sri Lanka looks to salvage something out of a tour by India that has left them with more questions than answers when they play a one-off Twenty20 International at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
The match will conclude what has turned out be a highly successful tour of Sri Lanka for Virat Kohli and his Indian team who have played a brand of cricket that has left Sri Lanka high and dry unable to counteract the relentless manner in which the visitors have approached every game.
Todays game wont be any different to the previous ones as India will look to sign off on a winning note in a format they have been masters of having started a highly successful Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament a decade ago  one which has given international exposure to their lesser known cricketers and thereby benefitted Indian cricket immensely.
One of the key areas Sri Lanka needs to address is the batsmen to put sufficient runs on the board to give them a chance of competing.
T20 is a very quick game where at the end of the day we need to score runs and put some runs on the board. That was our biggest issue in the ODIs, not just our bowlers we just couldnt get 250 in a game, said Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
We looked at the averages here batting first at R Premadasa Stadium the average total is around the 160-170 mark. It is the score to get on this ground but we havent seen the wicket yet, he said.
We will only see it now before the game. It has been covered the whole of today (Tuesday) and the ground staff cannot open it or do anything on it because of the rain. Its very windy as well so it will covered till tomorrow morning and if it stops raining then we will have a look at it. When its kept covered Sri Lankan wickets will always do something.
Gurusinha said that Sri Lanka was looking to salvage something out of the Indian tour by trying to win todays game. Thats why we have brought in two hard hitting allrounders  Dasun Shanaka and Seekkuge Prasanna.
The former member of Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup winning team believes T20 is one of the games where wrist spinners do well right around the world.
We are thinking at it from that point of view, thats why we have included leg-spinners Jeffrey Vandersay and Wanindu Hasaranga, although Hasaranga is more of a batting all-rounder, said Gurusinha.
Vandersay and fast bowler Suranga Lakmal are returning to the national side after injuries and Gurusinha said, We got fitness reports from our medical staff and everyone is 100 percent fit to play, after that only we selected the squad. In fact Lakmal actually came and bowled with us before the fifth ODI in the nets, he is fresh to go.
Leg-spinner Vandersay has recovered from a fractured ring finger to his bowling hand and Lakmal from back spasms. The two teams have not met in a T20I since the Asia Cup in May last year. Of the 10 T20Is played between the two countries India has won 6 and Sri Lanka 4.

A friend in need surpasses any other friends!

It knows no divisions, nor borders nor creeds. But thrive among thoughtfulness, Sowing fresh seeds.
Unseeking, unselfish and eager to share,
Love triumphs in trouble and shines / through despair
Zris Hesselden
In the meantime I saw him grow step by step in the field of art; actor, assistant director (I guess), lyrics writer  (which I felt his medium of expression) and up to the peak of events director. He excelled in lyrics writing which brought him fame in the one act tele drama of (late veteran) Wijaya Dharmasris Bhagya; It was created for the Mahapola Scholarship Promotion within a night Bandaras theme song lyrics were murmuring in our lips.
Maha merak lesata  Sithe upan barata
Hada doda velapena hinda//
[a giant of a rock  weighing is within mind]
His lyrics are derived from the classical prose of the Sinhala Literature, the words, the rhythm and rhyme is always visible in his lyric writing.
He belongs to the school of Yovun Pahan Veta (a youth creative programme of the  late Dharmasiri Gamage. Though a graduate of Peradeniya University, he has roots in the soil of the village. He is down hearted as a human being, who is always with his colleagues reasonable needs. The mutual trust is his motto.
Beginning from tele dramas he graduated in film lyric writing with the most successful film maker for entertainment in Sri Lanka, Udayakantha Warnasuriyas Rajya Sevaya Pinisai(on public service) theme song; it bagged his Award for Best Lyrics Writer in films.
Apart from that, Bandara has not lost his links with the theatre where he began his first rehearsal in Dr Jayalath Manoratnas musical Andarela for which he wrote lyrics based on folk tradition.
Bandara since then has worked with many filmmakers. He has written lyrics always with a difference grown into a fully-fledged artist. Bandara was one of the producers of Serenity Productions, which last year (2016) won majority of the prominent Raigam Tele Awards.
As an events director he is in charge of the Swarna Pusthala Award Ceremony (Golden Book Award for the Best Sinhala Novel of the year) for several years from the beginning of the ceremony.
He had the knack for building himself. With a long way of ups and downs, he has risen to the pinnacle of success. Actually its an exploration, of himself. In 1994 he had some links with politics, but slowly and steadily he has faded away from the unruly political arena.
Bandara is now grown up as an independent artiste in Sri Lanka. It is a hard task with the blessing of his admirers.
A faithful husband and father of three children Bandara is a man of courage with a vision. He enjoys through creations and writings. One of his songs, written on the occasion of his daughters wedding, is now an added feature in all wedding ceremonies.
Most of all other beautiful things. In life comes by twos and threes! By dozens and hundreds plenty of Roses, Stars, Sunsets, Rainbows but, the creation of an artist is a song of life. Bandara Eheliyagoda has created something unique for his admirers and to all Sinhala song lovers. As a friend and admirer I wish him good health and pray for more adorable creations too.
Blow  Blow thou winter wind,
Thuo art not so unkind
As mans ingratitude

Maternal, infant mortality rates satisfactory: Rajitha
Around 30 mothers die in Sri Lanka for every 100,000 deliveries and only around eight infants die for 100,000 live births. Both maternal and infant mortality rates in Sri Lanka is very satisfactory when compared with other developing countries in the world, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lanka has already achieved an excellent improvement in the region when it comes to lowering maternal and infant mortality. The existing challenge is reducing the rates further, which is a very difficult task. He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that more attention should be paid to the health of pregnant mothers and infants in order to further reduce maternal and infant mortality rates. I will extend my fullest support towards all the programmes implemented by the Sri Lanka Perinatal Society, he said.
Minister Senaratne specially admired the programmes led by Dr. Kapila Jayaratne to educate the public and train health staff. Minister Senaratne also launched the new web site of the society.

Mendis, Sandakan priority for Test cricket
Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that special priority will be given to batsman Kusal Mendis and left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan to play Test cricket over one-day matches.
We rested Kusal for the fifth ODI and the T20I and we havent played him in the T20Is against Bangladesh either. At this stage we dont want to play him in T20s we prefer to wait for another 6-12 months before we look at playing him in that format, said Gurusinha who is also a national cricket selector.
Kusal will probably not be playing the T20Is against Pakistan either. We just want him to focus on Tests and ODI cricket for him to get first established and then look at the T20. He is a player for the future and we prefer to work with him closely.
On Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman, Gurusinha said, We want Sandkan to settle down in Tests first because he is a wicket-taker. Without putting him into Tests, ODIs and T20Is we first want him to play only Tests for the next six months or so. Once he has settled down and has more control and confidence we can get him into the ODIs. These are the guys in the next 5-10 years who will be the main players that people will talk about. - ST

New hopes spark as Milan brings surfing glory to Sri Lanka
Arugam Bays peak season is on the wind down in Sri Lankas famous coastal surfers paradise where from May through to October travelers gather to ride the swell, lay in the sun and party til dawn.
To 28-year-old Milan Andrahennadige, this is home. Milan and fellow Arugam Bay resident Praneeth Sandaruwan have just returned from India, where they competed in the annual Covelong Surf Point Competition in Kovalam, Chennai. Milan returns triumphant, winning second place in the competitions open event having gone head to head with skilled international surfers. This is a huge achievement for one of our sons and with their return comes a determination and a more focused view for the future of surfing in Sri Lanka. This is the second time both Sri Lankan surfers competed at Covelong with the support of the Surfing Federation of India. The Federation invites surfers from around the world to compete in national tournaments providing them with accommodation, food and transport. Most laudable is the Federations efforts to make the surfers feel welcomed and involved in the advancement of surfing in India.
Milan is sponsored by Bay Vista Arugam Bay where he currently works as a surf instructor. Born and raised in Arugam Bay his enduring love for the ocean brought him to surfing, making the ocean his lifeblood. When Milan began surfing at the age of 15 his board was a slat of wood shaped to a form that made surfing possible. With this precious implement, the boys in the area took coveted turns to ride the wave crests. A benevolent tourist gifted the young boy with his very first surfboard as he acknowledged the potential. This is the story that most gifted surfers in the area would repeat. Virtually all local surfers of Arugam Bay would have had their first initiation of capturing the oceans waves through surfboards gifted or left behind by foreign surfing enthusiasts. They also benefited through the lessons learned from various international coaches who holidayed in the area. A strong sense of solidarity and camaraderie exists among all who live and surf in the bay and collectively they were the first on the island to be ISA certified surf instructors. Not in his wildest dreams did Milan imagine that he would be able to support himself with his passion, but the wonderful reality is that this determined young man is now a much sought-after surf instructor in the bay. Happiest when he is in the ocean with the wind on his face, riding the waves, surfing with his friends. Milan appreciates and values the international competitions of this magnitude as those became eye openers for him to improve surfing education and conservation of Sri Lankan beaches, specially surf destinations.
Passionate about protecting the environment, Milan laments on the results caused by negligence and human activities in our neighboring seas. While surfing in India I had to duck dive several times to avoid plastic bags in my face and hit twice by two big plastic bottles. We are lucky that our waters are still relatively clean, but for how long People who live by the coast have an enduring love for the ocean and to them the ocean is their source of contentment and economic prosperity. This sentiment is palpable amongst coastal residents who are more than willing to dedicate their all towards conservation. However they agree in one unified voice that there should be more undertaking to protect the environment by the local authorities.
As tourism in Sri Lanka seems poised to be propelled on a new and exciting trajectory, a large proportion of the island remains unequipped to cope with the volumes of visitors who are eager to discover this island. The future of surfing is bright  with surfing now recognized as a competitive sport in the 2020 Olympics and it is only a matter of time before Sri Lanka is capable of having its own surfing team compete at the Olympics. This is the dream of the inherently talented young men along our coasts.
Their journeys have been epic. Devoid of resources, instructors, equipment while battling economic hardship, adverse weather and lack of infrastructure, their victories must taste all that more sweet. If the necessary support by the authorities is provided to these determined young surfers, there is no doubt that Sri Lankas flag will one day fly high at the Olympics with a surfing team the world will need to contend with.

Offensive gesture was 'joke'
London: England's Dele Alli said he was having "a joke" with team-mate Kyle Walker after he was caught on camera raising his middle finger during Monday's 2-1 win over Slovakia. "Just to clarify, the gesture tonight was a joke between me and my good friend Kyle Walker!" Alli wrote on Twitter after the game. "Apologies for any offence caused! Great win 2nite." Television footage of the World Cup qualifier at Wembley showed Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Alli make the gesture in the 77th minute of the game, but it was not clear at whom it was aimed. Pictures and video footage of Alli's gesture were widely shared on social media, but manager Gareth Southgate played down the incident. "Kyle and Dele were mucking about and Dele's made a gesture towards Kyle," Southgate told reporters at Wembley. AFP

Pollard does a Randiv at CPL match - denies Lewis chance of century
Kieron Pollard has been criticised on social media after bowling a no-ball which denied opposition batsman Evin Lewis the chance of a century in a Caribbean Premier League match.
Pollard bowled a big no-ball when Lewis was on 97 off 32 balls, with St Kitts and Nevis Patriots needing one run to beat Barbados Tridents in the Twenty20 competition.
The no-ball gave 25-year-old Lewis side the win but saw him miss out on the chance of a ton after he and captain Chris Gayle reached 129-0.
Cricket statistician and journalist Mazher Arshad said: So Kieron Pollard bowls a no-ball to deny Evin Lewis a hundred in CPL. Suraj Randiv was suspended for a match when he did that to [Virender] Sehwag in 2010.
Cricket supporter Mainraj Paudel called Pollard's actions a shameless act on Twitter, while another spectator, Abhishek Chaturvedi, accused Pollard of showing zero sportsmanship.
Lewis, however, was more diplomatic.
In a televised post-match interview, he said: It hurts [missing out on the hundred], but hitting 97 not out off 33 balls I'll take that any day.
I've been hitting the ball long and hard in the nets. I'm confident now and looking forward to the play-offs.
If Lewis had completed his century in 33 balls, it would have been the second fastest of all time - just behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball IPL knock in 2013.

An employee of the Railway Department reportedly had prevented a massive train accident by acting wisely and efficiently on August 4.
An officer in the Hatton railway station said the employee was assigned to check the railway line from the Kotagala to Hatton. When he was travelling on foot, he had noticed a disconnected rail track near the Singimale railway tunnel.
A train from Hatton was to run through the tunnel within a few minutes. Realizing the destruction it would cause if the train reached the tunnel, he had run over a half km on the rail tracks towards the approaching train signalling the driver to stop the train.
He managed to get the attention of the engine driver at last and stop the train on time. Thereafter, he informed the situation to the Hatton railway station and taken necessary steps to repair the track.
The brave employee, P.M.Bandara, is attached to the Hatton railway station. The incident delayed the up-country train service about two hours.

Rashford redemption sends England closer to Russia
London: Marcus Rashford atoned for a costly error to bring England a 2-1 home win over Slovakia on Monday that left them within touching distance of next year's World Cup.
The 19-year-old was at fault as Stanislav Lobotka stunned a two-thirds full Wembley to give Slovakia a third-minute lead, but set up the equaliser for Eric Dier and then netted a sumptuous 20-yard winner in the second half.
Victory sent England five points clear of Slovakia at the Group F summit and means Gareth Southgate's side need just two points from their last two games against Slovenia and Lithuania to seal qualification.
"To come from behind against a side with very good footballers, particularly in midfield, we had to show character," said Southgate.
"Marcus Rashford showed, like the rest of the team, great character. He made the mistake for their goal, but he kept persevering."
England have endured turmoil since edging Slovakia 1-0 in their opening game a year ago, after which Sam Allardyce was felled by a newspaper sting and replaced by Southgate, but though they remain a work in progress, Russia now beckons.
For all their neat passing and intelligent movement, Jan Kozak's Slovakia find themselves in a perilous position in the group, with both Slovenia and Scotland just a point behind them.
"I'm sorry about the result, but the opposition were better, especially in the second half," Kozak said.
"Before the double-header against Slovenia and England, we wanted to have the situation in our own hands before the last two games and we still have the situation in our own hands."
While the group winners will qualify automatically, a two-legged play-off awaits the team who finish second.
Slovakia face a pivotal trip to Scotland on October 5 and then close the group at home to Malta, while England host Slovenia in their next game before signing off with a trip to Lithuania.
Rashford was rewarded for an enterprising cameo in England's 4-0 win over Malta on Friday with a starting berth, but the Manchester United forward's night began in forgettable fashion.
He lost the ball to Lobotka and then failed to track the Celta Vigo midfielder's run as he swapped passes with Adam Nemec and ran through to steer a left-foot shot past the advancing Joe Hart.
It was the first goal England had conceded in a home qualifying match since a Jordan Henderson own goal in a 3-1 win over Slovenia in November 2014.
Rashford began to redeem himself in the 37th minute with a low corner from the right that Dier neatly flicked into the top-right corner after darting in front of Nemec at the near post.
Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dubravka was worked by Ryan Bertrand and Rashford as half-time neared, but England had a let-off when Kyle Walker escaped punishment for bringing down Vladimir Weiss as he bore down on goal.
The visitors served a reminder of their threat 10 minutes into the second half with a slick break that culminated in Marek Hamsik crossing for Nemec, who chested the ball down and drew a smart save from Hart with a lusty volley.
But after Harry Kane had cleverly worked some space inside the box and forced a parry from Dubravka with a low shot, Rashford completed his atonement act by putting the hosts ahead in the 59th minute.
After Alli won the ball back mid-way inside Slovakia's half, Henderson worked the ball on to Rashford, who took a touch and then unleashed a vicious, dipping shot that flew inside the left-hand post. AFP

Rohingya crisis: Suu Kyi says 'fake news helping terrorists'

Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has claimed that the crisis in Rakhine state is being distorted by a "huge iceberg of misinformation".
In her first comments on the latest Rohingya crisis, she said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorists.
Suu Kyi made the comments in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, her office said.
More than 123,000 Rohingyahave fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in two weeks.
The latest outbreak of violence has sent waves of refugees fleeing the country, which is also called Burma.
What has Suu Kyi said
The latestgovernment statementsaid Suu Kyi told Erdogan that her government had "already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible".
Suu Kyi is quoted as saying: "We know very well, more than most, what it means to be deprived of human rights and democratic protection.
"So we make sure that all the people in our country are entitled to protection of their rights as well as, the right to, and not just political but social and humanitarian defence."
The statement also said there were many fake news photographs circulating which were "simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists".
Is it 'fake news'
There has certainly been a large amount of "fake news" surrounding recent events.
By 5 September there had been1.2 million tweets talking about the crisissince refugees began flooding over the border, and many contain pictures purportedly showing a glimpse of the violence which has engulfed the region.
The problem is, according to the BBC's south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, "much of it is wrong". Acloser look revealsmany - but not all - of the pictures come from other crises around the world, with one tweeted by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek dating back to the Rwandan genocide in 1994.
But the BBC Burmese Service's Tin Htar Swe said much of the blame for Suu Kyi's "iceberg" could be laid at the government's door.
"The fake news is generated because the government is not allowing media access to the troubled areas," she said. What's more, she added, "if they allowed the UN or human rights bodies to go to the place to find out what is happening then this misinformation is not going to take place".
Some 123,600 people have crossed into Bangladesh since 25 August, the Inter Sector Co-ordination Group reports.
In addition to the numbers shown on the map, about 36,000 additional refugees are also living in host communities and spontaneous sites dotted around the border region.
As a result, all people outside the affected areas have to rely on is the conflicting accounts of the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar and the government - with the space in between ripe for "fake news".
However, we do know the latest conflict was sparked on 25 August when Rohingya militants attacked police posts, triggering a military counter-offensive.
The military says it is fighting against Rohingya militants who are attacking civilians.
But the Rohingya families streaming north into Bangladesh have been reporting that security forces, sometimes backed by armed Buddhist civilians, burned their villages and opened fire on their inhabitants.
Their story has been contradicted by Myanmar's Minister in charge of Border Security in Rakhine, Col Phone Tint. He told our correspondent Jonathan Head who is travelling on a government-organised visit to the border town of Maungdaw that the destruction of villages was a deliberate strategy by the militants, aimed at forcing the Muslim population to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
But on Monday, Suu Kyi's spokesman Zaw Htay questioned who exactly had placed the explosives.
Why are people so disappointed in Suu Kyi
Suu Kyi was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for her work bringing democracy to Burma, but some havecalled for her Nobel Peace Prize to be taken back.
While she has previously acknowledged problems in Rakhine state,she has denied there is ethnic cleansingof the Rohingya, Several fellow laureates have called on her to act in the latest conflict, and the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar this weeksaid she must "step in".
Her biographer Justin Wintle said he was "flabbergasted" by Suu Kyi's response - telling the BBC he thought she was "impervious" to international opinion and was now "in the army's pocket".
"She has achieved a lot and we shouldn't hide away from that fact," he said. "But then you get into a zero sum equation where she won't stand up to the generals then what's the point, quite frankly"
Who else is willing to take the Rohingya in
There have been outpourings of support from politicians like President Erdogan, and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, among others.
In Indonesia, thousands marched on Myanmar's embassy in a show of solidarity with the Rohingya, while Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi has already travelled to meet Suu Kyi to urge an end to the bloodshed.
However, Myanmar's neighbours have come under criticism for not doing more to deal with the crisis. Bangladesh has previously refused to recognise the Rohingya as refugees, with Amnesty International accusing the country of sending people back to Myanmar to face an uncertain future.
Earlier this year, the government in Dhakasuggested relocating all Rohingya refugeesto a low-lying island vulnerable to flooding and without roads in the Bay of Bengal.
Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Myanmar meeting with Suu Kyi as the crisis continued to unfold on Wednesday.
All he would say was that he shared the government's "concern" about extremist violence in Rakhine State and the innocent lives lost - sidestepping the issue of criticising his neighbour.
Suu Kyi, for her part, thanked Modi for his "strength" in regard to the "terrorist threat" her security forces were facing.
Modi last month vowed to deportthe 40,000 Rohingya living in India.
Thailand appears to have a more welcoming stance towards the Rohingya, with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha telling reporters they were preparing for arrivals and "will provide them with shelter like in the past... and send them back when they are ready".
AnAl Jazeera reportfrom January 2017 noted the Thai authorities, working with the European Union and a number of NGOs, were improving access to education and other basic services.

SANASA Posathugoda turns fifty
The SANASA movement is strengthened with the hard earned savings of its members and not with ill-gotten gains of scrupulous individuals, said the Chairman of the SANASA movement, Dr P. A. Kiriwandeniya.
He was addressing those present at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the SANASA society at Posathugoda which was once a little village in the Dikwella Divisional Secretariat area.
Recently I was informed by a branch that an individual wished to deposit ten million rupees with SANASA but I asked them not to accept it until we had met with the intended depositor and found out how he possessed the large amount of money. In the course of the ensuing discussion we were convinced that this money had not been earned legitimately so we refused to accept the deposit, Kiriwandeniya said.
In my opinion the deposits you have accumulated as a society situated in a developing area such as this should improve. Through the SANASA movement we must prevent the people being fleeced by unscrupulous financial institutions and various dubious credit schemes and scams. It is the cooperative schemes that have been most successful partners in enhancing the livelihood of the people in many developed countries, he said.
This society was started in 1967 with just 39 members but today, fifty years later, we have a membership of 400 and deposits of Rs. 72.5 million, said Branch Manager Nadika Dedunu.
As you know fifty years ago Posathugoda was a little known village where the majority of the people toiled to earn a living by agriculture. This society was named the best SANASA society in the Matara district in 1988 just 21 years after its inception and third best society in the island in the year 2000, said founder president D H Gamage, reminiscing on the fifty-year history of the society.
Mementos of appreciation were presented to founder members, D.H. Gamage, H.G.K. Punchisingho, L.P. Chandradasa, D.A. Pemawathy and Soma Dissanayaike by Dr. Kiriwandeniya. In addition, scholarships were awarded to those who had gained admittance to university, while child account holders who had won the painting and essay competition conducted as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations received their gifts.

Short story : Nightmare
Abhimani, Sudu duwa, come soon we are at the dinner table. Nanda, her mother told her several times. There was no answer. Siri, go to her room and ask her to join us, please. Siri, being a good husband, a trapped husband is a good husband, went to her room and found her fast asleep. He came back.
She must be very tired today. Sudu was filling her university applications with Sitara, the whole morning. Yes, mama, they were talking about their university and laughing. Sithumi, the youngest daughter said. Siri, can you remember, when Chamara came last week he told her not to postpone. The dead line for applications is 19th September. Yes, it is always advisable to forward the applications before the due date. Nanda agreed. Nanda, their mother also peeped into the room and found Abhimani in sound sleep. In their house, they never disturb sleeping children.
Siri and Nanda are veteran teachers. They passed out from the same university, the university of Peradeniya. Their university education had a great impact on their family, their eldest sons university admission last year was really a motivation for Abhimani to come off with flying colours at her A/L Examination. She had three A passes for each subject, English literature, Sinhala and Logic. Isuru, their youngest son is in grade eleven and is at the forefront of studies among his peers. Sithumi is in grade nine at the village school and she was able to secure the first place of the class due to her eagerness in studies. She is the apple of the eye.
Abhimani is the pride of the family as she always brought much credit, not only to her school, but also to the family. Parents academic excellence and constant encouragement for studies are the driving force behind the children and all of them have been behind one goal all these years, to achieve their objective of the family; to be academically and morally excellent in life.
Their home is another school away from school for them. The home library is their usual rendezvous and they kept pin drop silence in it as guided by their parents. It spreads over a very large area and almost all the books in most of the discipline are available in it. Deweys classification system made them able to find any rare book within a very short time. The library epitomizes parents vast knowledge of not only books, but also of library science. Parents had translated theory into practice and the children are in a good stead in education.
People in the vicinity always encourage their children to be Abhimani like as she is a good product of reading and learning. She has a flair for learning psychology and so Sigmund Freuds analysis of dreams was at her fingertips. She had made a profound case study of dreams under the able guidance of her parents for her school magazine. She is almost a bookworm in proverbial sense and her parents happiness knew no bounds.
Yet, the last few weeks kept her fully occupied with newspaper reports and hearsay about university ragging not only in Sri Lanka but also in other countries. She told parents and her siblings all the dreadful stories of ragging making their eye brows raised. Ragging at OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE and other universities and how our own leaders had been severely ragged for being dark in complexion, how they had carried white students on their shoulders around the university grounds were among her anecdotes.
Yet, she was trembling when she was telling her family members and others how some students fell off high buildings and embraced death in their fatal falls, how some university students have become maimed for their life time, some others even saying goodbye to their university education and went to garment factories to earn a living. Whole trajectory of ragging at the universities and other institutes of higher education was in her mind.
It was a dreadful night. The owls were screeching. It was raining cats and dogs. Power failures were constant. Thunder and lightning visited them several times. Their parents rushed to Abhimanis room frequently as she is very afraid of darkness and nocturnal animals and their sounds. Bulky bodies of the people had made an unpleasant emotional experience from her early childhood. Once she had awakened from her sleep by seeing a big man putting his head through the window into her room, like what had happened to WILLIAM BLAKE. Reading SHERLOCK HOLMS and other detective stories had made a negative effect on her. Siri, their father, has warned her several times not to read them or to sleep alone.
Nanda, whats that big sound Oh, its terrible! Siri, run to Abhimanis room quickly. Mama, Sudu akka has fallen off her bed. She has soaked in sweat. Come on, hurry up. She is crying. It was Sithumi. All were in her room. Abhimani was lying on the floor. Sweat was pouring down. Her bulky body was unmanageable for them. All of them managed to keep her on her bed. Yet, on second thought, they took her to the master bed room.
She was half conscious as a patient who is coming to consciousness after a long operation. It took almost half an hour for her to come back to her senses. Sudu duwa retired to her bed again and the whole family was fully excited to listen to what had happened to her the previous night. Even their eldest son Nihathamani came all the way from the University of Moratuwa to join them.
This is what she said. I saw a frightful dream, veritably, a nightmare. I was walking along a well-kept path among very huge buildings and trees which I had never seen even in my wildest dreams before. I was all alone with some files full of notes and there was nobody in the vicinity. All of a sudden, I heard a terrible screaming and a girl was falling from a four storied building. She was in a pool of blood. Her broken legs were lying nearby. No one came for her rescue and I took to my feet.
I was surrounded by a cluster of trees, a thick grove. I have always been a victim of claustrophobia, I remembered. By adding insult to injury some bearded bulky guys gave chase to me. I ran helter skelter and finally came to a place where there was a large pond, but not deep. Some girls, seemingly older than me started laughing at me and told the boys that they had found a good bite.
They commanded me to address them as JESTER UTHTHAMAYO and not to utter a single word to the UNIFORMED CUSTODIANS of the university. They threatened me not to wear bright dresses or high heels as it is prohibited for the KUNU FRESHAS. It took me some time to understand what the said and I was flabbergasted. A lanky young girl and a bearded JESTER UTHTHAMAYA grabbed me tightly and threw me into that pond. They burst into laughter at my calamity and I managed to come out of the pond and ran away summoning all the courage that my body could give. Again I was pushed into a big puddle by some other JESTER UTHTHAMAUO and I cannot remember anything beyond that. My dress was irreparably muddy.
You had fallen off your bed. Sithumi told her. They told the whole story to Sitara who helped her to fill the applications for university admission. Abhimani made a diary entry of the unforgettable happening and started rereading SIGMOND FREUD.

South Asian Travel Awards - celebrating regional hospitality
It is important for Sri Lanka Tourism to play a major role in South Asian Travel Awards (SATA) and encourage our hospitality brands to participate along with the other participants in the region, said Tuan Saabir Vaffoor Co-Founder/Vice President of SATA, who is also a Director of Highrise Events as well as a Director of the Colombo Chamber of Commerce.
This year over 450 nominees - doubling the number from 2016 - from the Maldives, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka will participate. The judging process in all destinations has commenced and evaluation of hospitality brands is in progress.
SATA is endorsed by the Tourism Boards of the Maldives and Nepal and associations across the nations in the region.
SATA is an idea initiated in the Maldives. The first edition in 2016 was hosted in Sri Lanka with nominees from the Maldives, India and Sri Lanka. This year, Nepal and Bhutan too, have come on board.
SATA's objective is to identify and reward hospitality organisations in the South Asian region by providing them opportunities to improve standards in terms of service and facilities.
The big brands in the region have participated with over 100 brands from India and the Maldives. Nepal and Bhutan have participated as first timers and they will certainly improve on numbers in the years to come
"In Sri Lanka, currently the hospitality brands are doing their share of marketing, but identifying a particular market and giving it full focus and approaching them with a full force will result in tremendous outcome," said Vaffoor
He said Sri Lanka should implement cohesive methods of marketing the country as a destination. The travel shows do play a major role but more marketing methods could be implemented. An area that requires detailed attention is staff training.
"An influx in tourism could be identified but then we also need to look at how we could increase the hotel stays where the government would benefit, as there's major competition with non traditional accommodation like home stays, etc," Vaffoor said. "SATA is a platform that has been created for the hospitality industry to flourish and we invite all hospitality affiliated brands in the region to participate and celebrate South Asian hospitality."
SATA will continue to conduct the evaluations annually in order to recognise and develop the hospitality industry standards in the region.
The grand finale of SATA is scheduled for October 27 and 28 at Equator Village in Addu City, Maldives. Addu City is the most southern atoll passing the equator.
SATA brings together world renowned hospitality brands to one platform.
"We are thankful to the government of Maldives, City Council of Addu and their people. The warm hospitality of Addu is remarkable, Vaffoor said.

In order to advance towards a diversified, high-value tradable sector growth process, alongside domestic private investment, we must attract the right type of FDI that brings in modern technology, access to GPNs and managerial know how.
The Government will strengthen the drivers of growth and make growth more inclusive. The Government is undertaking macro economic, factor market, institutional and regulatory reforms to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the economy. These reforms are expected to raise private investment, especially knowledge intensive and technology driven FDI for export growth in both goods and services.
The Government will strive to create a strong and influential middle class towards an inclusive society. Mobility up the socioeconomic ladder allows people to achieve higher incomes and living standards. We will ensure that all people have more equitable access to public services, job opportunities, and living conditions.
We will introduce supportive legal reforms, in particular the new Inland Revenue Act, Foreign Exchange Act, Voluntary Disclosures of income, Act, State Land Bank Act, Anti Dumping Act, State Commercial Enterprises Act, Ports and Airports Act, Ruhunu Economic Development Corporation Act, Lands (Special Provisions) Act, Sustainable Development Act, Liability Management Act, and National Debt Office Act will considerably improve the business-friendly environment.
Strengthening the macroeconomic framework
The Governments strategy to strengthen the national macro economic framework will have three prongs: fiscal consolidation, ensuring price stability and maintaining a market based competitive exchange rate.
Fiscal irresponsibility, budget deficits, and public debt are constraints consistency growth. Sri Lankas tax revenues, which declined steadily until 2015, are paltry in comparison to other middle-income economies. The result has been Government reliance on borrowings to finance the deficit which in turn has enlarged public debt to 79.3% of GDP, making Sri Lanka an outlier among its rating peers. Loss making SOEs impose a heavy burden on the Treasury and distort prices across the economy. The bunching of external debt repayments from 2018 requires strong fiscal consolidation measures for debt sustainability and growth.
We will use revenue based fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt in the medium term. The tax base will be broadened to ensure a tax revenue of 16% of GDP. We will rationalize the tax system by minimising exemptions, holidays and special rates, towards a fair and effective tax administration. We will strengthen administrative capacity to minimise evasion and improve tax compliance, bolster public finance management such as financial planning and discipline, and commitment controls. To increase tax progressivity and fairness, we will gradually change the ratio of direct to indirect taxation from the current 20:80 to 40:60 in the medium term, as the burden of indirect taxation falls heavily on the less affluent section of the population. We will generate more on tax revenue as a necessary condition for revenue enhancement.
We will rationalise government expenditure. The Government will strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act with mandatory binding targets for the fiscal deficit and overall government debt levels. Our medium term priorities are to rationalise public expenditure while eliminating unproductive expenditure. We will restructure SOEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable enterprises with accountability. Pricing of goods and services provided by SOEs will be at market clearing rates, and any form of subsidisation will be provided directly to the targeted population in a transparent manner. The Statements of Corporate Intent of the selected major SOEs provide a framework to pursue these objectives.
The Government will sustain fiscal consolidation to support the growth framework. We will implement fiscal reforms to achieve medium to long term targets for macroeconomic stability and an improved investor climate. However, the bunching of external debt repayments from 2018 requires tight budgetary control. Due to this lack of fiscal space, economic growth can no longer be driven by Government spending growth will instead require expansion of tradable activities, driven by private investment to service external debt.
We will initiate liability management strategies for domestic and foreign debt. We aim to progressively bring the debt to GDP ratio down to 70% by 2020. To this end, we have formulated a forward looking liability management strategy for domestic and foreign debt portfolios under the medium term debt management strategy (MTDS). This will address the high public debt stock while focusing on meeting Governments cash flow needs using an appropriate composition of domestic and foreign debt instruments and maturities.
We will prioritise capital expenditure outlays for development with a comprehensive Public Investment Programme (PIP). After a fifteen-year lapse, the Government has published a detailed PIP for 2017-2020, which can be consulted by investors and other interested parties. The PIP lists over 1,000 ongoing, annual, matured, and future projects, only a limited number of which are included in this document. We will maintain public investment at 5-6% of GDP for the period 2016-2020. We will use this for economic infrastructure development, and for human resource development projects in education, health care, research and development (R&D), and vocational training, instead of buildings as has been the past practice.
The conduct of monetary and exchanges rate policies in the past during an era of fiscal excess dampened long term growth. Large debts necessitated monetary financing of deficits, resulting in uncontrolled inflation. Fiscal dominance over monetary policy prevented the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) from adopting policy adjustments when needed. Loose fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies aimed at boosting short term economic growth without introducing required structural adjustments resulted in sharp credit cycles and frequent balance of payment difficulties. Corrective measures adopted too late caused disruptive boom-bust cycles and lowered investor confidence.
The Government will take measures to ensure price stability. Our strategy to battle food price volatility and ease peoples hardships is two pronged. To address short term price fluctuations, we will encourage improved domestic supply and distribution networks, and allow imports of food products and essential commodities at reasonable costs within a competitive market framework. For medium to long-term price stability, the CBSL will move towards a flexible inflation targeting regime. They will present a comprehensive Inflation Targeting Roadmap by the end of 2017, aimed at continuously maintaining low inflation while supporting economic activity and competitiveness. Price stability, which means low, stable and predictable levels of inflation, will keep nominal interest rates low and thereby support investment and long term economic growth. The Government will implement the legislative and operational changes necessary.
We will allow the exchange rate to be market determined. This will enable cost reflective pricing across all goods and services produced and traded in the economy, strengthening the competitiveness of Sri Lankas exports to global markets. Greater flexibility in exchange rate determination will help build international reserves and strengthen the resilience of the economy to external shocks.
Strengthening the growth framework
The Government will strengthen the growth framework by empowering the private sector. Accordingly, we incentivise domestic and foreign investment, revamp trade policy to enable an export driven economy, facilitate services expansion.
Shortcomings in investment facilitation and policy uncertainty are constraints to attracting investment. Private investment will be the key driver growth in Sri Lanka complimented by increased inflows of FDI. However, shortcomings in the investment climate have held back the expansion of large businesses, the growth of new business ventures, and the graduation of SMEs, especially micro enterprises. This has stunted private sector growth and reduced the competitiveness of the Sri Lankan economy. FDI inflows since 2009 have been notably low, averaging 1.1% of GDP, concentrated primarily on real estate and mixed development projects.
We will move Sri Lanka into the top 70 countries on Ease of Doing Business global rankings from its current ranking of 110 through legislative and regulatory changes. The Task Force for Investment Climate Reforms has identified the reforms needed to create an enabling business environment. One hurdle that investors currently face is a large number of Government agencies they have to deal with. We will establish a Single Window for new business registration that brings together 20+ Government agencies to streamline procedures and improve the investment climate.
We will clarify and reform investment incentive policies to improve investment policy predictability. We propose to phase out tax holidays, which have been the main traditional incentive offered to investors, and switch to other forms of efficiency improving incentives. The new investment framework will ensure policy coherence and consistency and streamline procedures to improve the overall business climate and attract FDI. We will stipulate a standardised package of incentives with clear eligibility criteria. Incentives while appropriately designed incentives will be offered for those in high technology and innovative industries. These incentives will be second to none in attracting the kind of investments that are appropriate for Sri Lanka at our current stage of development.
We will encourage Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The Government will support PPS as a means of reducing reliance on loan agreements in the provision of public assets and services. We are formulating a clear PPP policy with a well defined legal, regulatory and institutional framework to attract private players with the requisite capacities. PPS currently focus on the provision of public amenities such as transport services, energy generation, drinking water, waste management, and industrial parks. Potential areas for expanding PPPs include health care, leisure, tourism, education, ports, and aviation. We will prioritise expanding opportunities for alternate financing, including securitisation, to support PPP programmes.
The Government will take steps to integrate SMEs into the formal sector. To boost domestic private investment, we will better integrate the SME sector into the formal sector through the financial system. We will establish hard and soft infrastructure frameworks to help them improve their brand value, and access credit and new markets. We will implement policies to increase project based lending rather than collateral based lending, remove taxes that prevent firms from expanding, and encourage knowledge sharing between R&D institution and SMEs.
The Anti-export bias in Sri Lankas trade policy has reduced the export share of GDP. Sri Lankas share of global exports reduced from 0.09% in 2000 to 0.06% in 2016, while its exports as a share of GDP declined from 33.3% in 2000 to 12.7% 2016. The export composition is stagnant and dependent on a few low complexity products. Export markets are undiversified with respect to markets and products. Para-tariffs have contributed to a highly complex, protectionist import regime, inhibiting Sri Lankas entry into GPNS.
We have formulated a new Trade Policy, along with an original National Export Strategy. These aim to create a more liberal, simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. These policy changes will attract more export oriented FDI, improve trade logistics, make customs procedures transparent and quicker, and boost firms abilities to compete in global markets.

Sri Lankan living in Sharjah  jumps off building, family commits suicide

A Sri Lankan man jumped to his death while his wife and their son committed suicide in a hotel apartment in Sharjah, police said.
The incident, which police described as a planned group suicide, happened on August 29 in the hotel apartment that they have occupied for more than a year.
Police identified the deceased Sri Lankans as J.K., 55, who was a gold designer in Dubai, his wife B.S., 54, and their son J.N., 19. Their bodies have been transferred to the Al Kuwaiti hospital for autopsy.
Two women in the group survived the suicide attempt. Police identified them as the womans 17-year-old niece, D.I., and her 27-year-old sister, P.I.
The Sri Lankan women were treated at Al Kuwaiti hospital before being transferred to Obaidallah Hospital in Ras Al Khaimah for psychological assessment.
Police said that on August 29, they received a call from a witness that a man had jumped off the 7th floor of the building at 2:30am.
Police and forensic experts who responded to the call said the mans body had landed on the bonnet of a parked car.
Inside the apartment, police found B.S., D.I. and P.I. lying in a pool of blood, with their wrists slashed. On the ground, covered in white sheet, lay the young mans body.
Police also found various kinds of medicines and cups containing red liquid and small white balls on the table.
Initial investigation suggests that the young man died first, followed by the womens suicide attempts. The father of the family was the last to commit suicide.
According to reports, the family had stayed in the apartment for more than a year on a monthly rent of Dh6,250.
The woman reportedly approached the hotel apartment owner for a rent reduction and was given a new rate of Dh5,750. She reportedly told the building owner that her husband has not received his salary for three months and that he was also conned by a foreigner.
Investigations into the incident are continuing

Taking a leaf out of Indian cricket
With Sri Lanka cricket going through one of the darkest periods in it cricket history being thrashed across all formats by all and sundry it would be pertinent to focus our thoughts on how our closest neighbours India are planning for the 2019 Cricket World Cup that will be held in England.
At the moment Indian cricket which two years ago was struggling like Sri Lanka  although not to the same extent, is riding high having unearthed a crop of youngsters who are serving them well with match-winning performances as has been witnessed in the recently concluded Test and ODI series against Sri Lanka.
Whether a struggling Sri Lanka team provided India with the kind of opposition that tested them to the limit is questionable. Did we see the full might of India during the two series or is it because of the poor opposition that Sri Lanka put up that India were simply able to run through them
We didn't analyse the opposition at any stage in this series, we only wanted to focus on our strengths and make sure we keep repeating those things out in the middle, said Indian captain Virat Kohli. That way the opposition is not something that you need to focus on. We just wanted to execute the plans we made for ourselves as a team regardless of the opposition. It didn't matter to us whether we were playing Sri Lanka or we're going to play Australia back home. For us it was focusing on our team. We didn't sit and think what the difference is between the two sides. If you have an opportunity to win international games you're going to pounce on those opportunities and win, and perform as well. So that's exactly what we did.
When India arrived in Sri Lanka at the inaugural press conference head coach Ravi Shastri said that his team would play a ruthless brand of cricket and to win at all costs.
We want the guys to out there and express themselves and play a brand of cricket thats ruthless, where you play to win at all costs. No compromise on that, said Shastri. If you look at Sri Lankas track record playing at home is as good as any side in world cricket right upto the best. As an Indian team we are not going to take them lightly, we will not take things for granted. We like to be consistent so that we keep our no. 1 position in place and above all we look to improve. If we dont look to improve there is no point playing. Youve got to try and raise the bar.
The way they have played in Sri Lanka making a clean sweep of the 3 Tests and 5 ODIs series, India has certainly played the ruthless brand of cricket that Shastri had demanded from them. Whether a full strength Sri Lanka team would have given India a good run for their money is questionable because Sri Lanka were never able to have a settled team in any of the matches because of the number of injuries that kept occurring from match to match. In such circumstances it is very difficult to plan and strategise against an opposition that looked well organized and with hardly a chink in their armour.
Analysing the two series Kohli said, We're doing very well in Test cricket, ODIs we didn't win three games in a row before this. So from the last game in West Indies to now we've won six, that's something that we wanted to address and which we did in this series.
We wanted to be relentless, we wanted to create good habits and make sure that we're challenging ourselves every time we go out on the park. That helps you when you're going through difficult situations. That's one thing that we addressed before this series and it's really helped us come out here and play how we wanted to play and not let complacency get to us at any stage.
Good habits are hard to create and once you create them and then if you take the game easy then the game will find out those things and sort you out on the park. We respect the game and that's something we decided to do all throughout regardless of what was happening otherwise.
Sri Lanka once they come out of the present predicament should take a leaf out of Indias notebook and play the brand of cricket like their neighbours  ruthless and to win at all costs - if they want to recapture their past glory and become a cricketing force they once were.

Thomas holds off jittery Spieth to win Dell Championship
Norton: Justin Thomas fired a final round five-under 66 to win his fifth tournament of 2017, outduelling fellow American Jordan Spieth on the back nine at the Dell Championship on Monday.
The two Americans battled hard down the stretch until Spieth saw his hopes dashed on the fairway at 18 when his approach sailed right and landed in a large bunker. His next shot travelled clear across the green as he finished with a bogey six on the hole.
Thomas completed the second tournament of the PGA Tour playoffs with a 17-under 267 total for a three-shot victory which propelled him into second place in the FedExCup standings behind Spieth.
"I have had a great year, just two more events to finish it off," said Thomas.
Spieth's bungle on 18 allowed Thomas, who was in the group behind, the luxury of taking a victory stroll up the fairway on 18 which he easily parred.
Spieth's self-destruction at the Dell came one week after he blew a five-stroke lead in the final round and lost to Dustin Johnson in a playoff at The Northern Trust to open the postseason.
Spieth, who shot a 67, finished solo runner-up at 14-under 270 while Aussie Marc Leishman fired a 70 to place alone in third, four strokes back of Thomas.
Spain's John Rahm (68) and England's Paul Casey (70) tied for fourth at 12-under 272 at the par-71 TPC Boston.
Thomas, who won the PGA Championship last month, erased a two-shot deficit over the final nine holes for his Tour-leading fifth win of the season.
Thomas bogeyed No. 11 but closed with a pair of birdies and five pars to pull away from Spieth.
"Yeah, it was a good day. It was a patient day," said Thomas.
"It just was a great week because I felt like I didn't have my best stuff at the start of the week and that's just something I've gotten so much better at, and I'm proud of myself more than anything."
Spieth had a bogey at the 12th and a birdie at No. 13 before making bogey at Nos. 14 and 18. He got off to a strong start with three birdies and an eagle over the first four holes. AFP

Together in good times and bad
Life is diverse and it brings to ones fold various relationships and at times these relationships colour your life in the most unexpected ways. It is believed that many of those who you would meet in your life are your fellow travellers in samsara. The traveller which may have one of the most significant impacts in your life will be your partner in life; the one who promises to stand by you until death do you part. But, as divorce rates soar and stories of husbands beating their wives daily sometimes as brutally as to kill them with an axe or where wives murder their husbands are plenty, we bring to you the story of a man who has sacrificed it all for his wife.
The passions of youth brought them together but marriage solidified their love for each and as they reach their twilight years, the couple has stood strong despite the tragic circumstances they now find themselves in. We met this couple; S. Selliah and Magi Nona by sheer coincidence, in the Mahameddewa division in the Nawattegama Divisional Secretariat. Their story was related to us by Selliah, he was the narrator of their story while Magi Nona remained silent.
Standing by her
The old couple, living in a thatched hut on Temple Road, Ralapanawa, Nawaththegama live a difficult life. Selliah and Magi Nona have been married for over 25 years and throughout that journey they have both sacrificed much for each other and Selliah especially has had to give up much. Magi Nona suffers from a debilitating illness which makes her unable to do many things on her own, but Selliah has stuck by her and has looked after her every need with love and kindness. Though Tamil by descent, he has over the years chosen to pay homage to Buddhism and the monks along with alms being regularly presented to them.
It has been over 25 years since we got married. Though we live here now, I am from Kekirawa. My wife is from Hiripitiya. At the start, I made a living through the sale of sesame. I met my wife on one of my trips. Her mind has always been slightly unstable. When I went to her village to sell sesame, she followed me round and came with me. I felt sorry for her. Since that day we have been living together. Though I am Tamil and she is Sinhala; that did not matter to us much. With much difficulty, I tried various charms Gurukam and cured my wife. We lived very happily together for a long time. I even sent her to temple every Poya day, related 78- year- old Selliah.
I was born a Tamil but over time I learned to work alongside Sinhala people, said Selliah. When he first arrived in Nawaththegama, the area was a jungle. He had to clear the jungle to make a home for himself and his wife and at the time, he also abandoned selling sesame and took to chena cultivation.
Magi Nonas failing health
Five years ago my wife started to get sick once again. But, I could not leave her just because she was sick. Moreover, my wife and I love each other dearly and the idea of separation is unimaginable. One day, all of a sudden, she developed a back pain. Gradually that pain worsened, I visited every doctor I knew and used every medicine possible. It did not cure her. In the end, she became paralysed. I spent all the money I had on her treatment, I even sold the milking cows I had to find money to treat her. Even then she was not cured. Today I attend to all her needs, I am able to look after her with these two hands of mine, he said.
It is Selliah who is not only the primary caregiver to Magi Nona but he also takes care of all the housework as well. He cooks for her, cleans her and must also find means to earn an income for them.
I attend to all her work. I bathe and clean her and wash her clothes. I cook food so we can have it for two meals. Otherwise I just cook one meal a day for us. We have water problems in this area. Bowsers deliver water to us. We have to manage everything with that water. Earlier I had a good cultivation going and we used to make a living by growing vegetables. But now it is very hard for me to engage in such work. My knees have started to ache. Those who live around us and even some from far away give us some food rations to live by but that doesnt happen every day. On average we might have two people coming to see us every month.
We also receive a ping padiya of Rs. 2,000 per month. We make do with that. Even though I might not have food to eat, I somehow manage to get some rice for my wife. I provide some alms to the temple with the little means I have. I carry on with her work no matter how difficult. That is how we live, explained Selliah.
Perhaps Magi Nona has done much good in her life to have a husband such as Selliah in her twilight years. Their fates entwined, they have lived their lives together in love and kindness; their lives have become an inspiration to all.
I undergo much difficulties and suffering in my day to day life. If there is someone to help us out, we would wish great merit on them. We too will soon pass away and until then my only solace and happiness is to take care of my wife until the last. It would be great if someone can assist me in fulfilling that, said Selliah as we prepared to leave.
He appealed for help with eyes filled with tears. Despite the little means they have, they have become accustomed to making the maximum use of whatever they have. Given the circumstances, Selliah has mastered this art. Having spent over 25 years of his life with Magi Nona, their journey has come to a standstill here. Happiness, sadness, a smile, a tear; they have all been cemented together into one, on his face.

As the tough get going
Head Prefect of Carey College Joel Dilshan Siriwardena is a young man but he is experienced. He knows the pitfalls of life and understands that nothing in this world comes easily. Perfect Prefects features Siriwardena who understands that anything of value in life must be purchased with blood, sweat, and tears. He believes in never giving up.
I believe in the phrase When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going. You need to talk less than you know and show less than you have, said Siriwardena.
Own prejudices
In human society conflict very rarely is one sided. You cannot pin all the blame on one person. Most of the time tensions could have been festering and building up to the point of explosion. The abuse could have been going on for a long time. People can misunderstand. Most often people judge other people by their own insecurities and their own prejudices. What people think you are is mostly what they think of themselves. Therefore a leader must grasp all of this. He/ she needs to understand that humans are complex creatures.
Society is torn apart because of political, racial problems and gender based problems. People hate what they fear. People often fear what they dont understand. A leader must take all of this into consideration. And when they dont understand they judge through their own fears and insecurities.
As a head prefect, your problem-solving skills should be as sharp and effective. One technique I use is to look at the situation from the eyes of another  What would I do if I was him or her. This is no easy task and I need to consider multiple views. I think as a leader what should I do Harsh reprimands sometimes are not the right thing to do. At the same time being soft will not also work. So there needs to be a lot of understanding, said Siriwardena.
Encouraged and motivated
Siriwardena also believes that you need to be young at heart. He does not view youth as an age related factor. He believes it is a temperament. He believes it is state of mind. This is essential for leaders. He firmly believes in appreciating people for the work they put in because if you make someone feel that his/her work is appreciated then they will continue to work enthusiastically doing their best for you. They will feel encouraged and motivated.
He also feels that one should never give up on things easily. Sometimes you put in your very best and work very hard but you do not achieve it. But that does not mean that you are weak in any way or at fault. You should not feel so dejected.
I believe you need to have a strong faith in God. God has a plan for your life. Your life is a garden and he wants to work on it. You need to have faith in God, learn from everything and never falter. The day you give up is the day you fall. The harder things you go through the better you will become. Give God first place and everything else will fall into place. Impress God with all your heart and anyone who needs to be impressed will be impressed, said Siriwardena.
Character built
Siriwardena points out that no one is perfect and leaders are human. He is not running a one man show and when his loyal prefects of the Prefect Guild come together then everything works well. A leader should not rise alone but to rise up as a team.
A school, though a school, is a group of human beings. You need to be able to help fighting factions reconcile. A school is a cross section of society. You need to help students settle their differences in a peaceful way. We need to help them understand Carey College has a history of 104 years and it has produced strong men. And we need to understand that these men had character. And character is built not through violence, pointed out Siriwardena.
Siriwardena has experienced everything that Carey College has to offer and the Head Prefect-ship was not something he anticipated. The best part of his school life is that he has been in almost every stage a student can be in. He attributes his success to Jesus. His life has steadily progressed. Success has been measured in his life.
Quick decision-making
He became the Best Athlete in 2016 with one new school record in 800m in Athletics and then in 2017 broke 3 new school records in 400m/ 800m/ 1500m at the Under 20 level. He has also won medals in Basketball. At the district level, he became 2nd in 1500m and 3rd in 800m.
Basketball is the second fastest game in the world which requires quick decision making. You need to have patience and never lose your cool. Team work also matters in Basketball.
I have been blessed in every way from God. The rugger coach wanted me to play rugger but I did not have the time. I have so many other activities with classes, basketball, and church, said Siriwardena.
Siriwardena believes that you should dream, sometimes you may fail after coming so close to it. But that does not mean that you do not deserve it. God always has a plan. He has a better plan for you. You need to motivate yourself. Your tough times have not been in vain. You have to work for your success.
Siriwardena is also the President of the Literary English Association at Carey College. He has been the former Vice Captain of Carey College basketball team and Vice President of LEO club of Carey College. He is in the band as well (Drum Stand leader of Carey College Senior Brass Band)
He wished to thank especially the two Masters in Charge Bandula Pushpakumara and Janaka Ruwanjith and Principal Hemamali Bibile.
His family has helped him a lot in every way and they are a family of prayer, believing in the power of prayer. Though initially, he wanted to become an accountant Siriwardena has been prophesied to become a pastor. Now he says he wants to be whatever God wants him to become. A pastor who came from abroad prophesied about Siriwardena. From speaking to Siriwardena it is obvious that he has a bright future. A young man with a heart of Gold he wants to take care of his parents and make them happy.

The Twins launch
Foremost Books launched its publication The Twins a story by Ananda Liyanage at the National Library and Documentation Services Board Auditorium recently under the patronage of Anoja Weerasinghe.
Ananda Liyanage has as up to now authored four novels: The Legacy, The Deception, The Vengeance, The Prophecy in addition to a collection of detective short stories Adventures of Rudra an Investigator, a textbook Mechanics of International Trade and a brief biographical essay Reminiscences & Reflections. All books have been translated into Sinhala. He is currently working on his sixth story.
The Twins commences with the return to Spain of a republican fighter, after the death of Franco, who took refuge in France at the end of the civil war. Upon his return to his home in Tarragona he identifies a Gestapo official who was probably responsible for his brothers death while in Gestapo captivity in occupied France. Afterwards he identifies the Gestapo official obtaining the help of a fellow republican fighter to do so.
At their wits end what to do next they seek help from an institution in Paris specialising in capturing fleering Nazis. The institution investigators find the strange event that the suspect took charge of a woman from a monastery who subsequently gave birth to twins a boy and a girl.
This leads to the involvement of the Israelis after the Paris based institution suspects a much larger and sinister motive behind the activities of the Nazis. Meanwhile the suspect goes to Argentina and joins forces with the elder twin. He first goes to Buenos Aires and then to Ushuaia at the southern tip of the South American continent closely followed by the pursuers.
He is traced to a facility in Antarctica where the Nazis have been developing a vengeance weapon of unparalleled proportion.
Having found the facility abandoned the pursuers follow the quarry from Antarctica to the Mediterranean across the Atlantic not fully aware of the extent of the plan but only of a vague suspicion of its intent.
Meanwhile the other twin while on holiday in Nepal meets an Englishman who is the BBC representative in Katmandu.
They fall in love while on a trek to the Everest base camp.
Known only to a few people he is also the MI6 representative in Nepal. She displays her dancing skills one night at the hotel restaurant with him as a partner when she receives a request to dance the flamenco from a guest.
Later the guest provides startling revelation of the activities of her brother. She hurriedly plans her departure home but a last minute confession from her lover leads to his accompanying her.
At home she finds her brother and step father in the company of another man at their home.
Meanwhile the investigations at MI6 headquarters leads her lover to undertake a trip to Cornwall in search of an answer to a 30 year old riddle.
A final confrontation between brother and sister takes place in the sand of Tarragonas famed Roman Amphitheater. The reappearance of the dinner guest from Katmandu lays to rest the unanswered questions.
The concluding chapter is a recap of the whole riddle from the moment a Gestapo official receives instructions, in the Berlin bunker in the dying days of Hitlers 1000 year Reich, to carry out a plan to seek vengeance on the victors of the war to its final outcome three decades later.

The ultimate life haven
What makes a miracle At The Sri Mangalarama Temple, Wahalkada Kebithigollewa patients do share stories of extraordinary recoveries.
Comments made by a Leukemia patient who got cured
There is no magic here but a devoted mindset fine tuned to be empowered by Vishvashakthi through Buddha Shakthi with the spirit of Sri Patthinidevi. Commit yourself to a calendar to practise an honest religious, medical, physical, clinical, social, and spiritual lifestyle.
As you drive deep into the countryside in the North-Central Province, passing the Morawewa Elephant Orphanage adjoining the Wahalkada Natural Tank and the Yan Oya Reservoir at Kebithigollawa, you enter a certain atmospheric condition that makes you feel good physically and mentally. Miracles do happen, and its proven right here.
Pattini anklet
The legend has it that Gajabahu I of Anuradhapura (A.D. 114 - 136) on his return from India victoriously with 12000 men as prisoners, also brought with him the Pattini anklet. The king built the Devalaya enshrining the Pattini anklet at a place where he stopped to rest on his return to Anuradhapura. A different presentation of the legend says that the Goddess Pattini came from India with 12000 devotees formed 16 castes and settled in this area.
Patients who seek cure must live within the temple premises for at least 21 days and undergo a highly disciplinary procedure of conduct of medication which must be continued with the present medication until you get scientific evidence to prove that your problem is no more!
At the end, a comparison is made through medical reports which are submitted by the patient himself by going through the hospital or a reputed laboratory.
The physician monk treats the patient on early hours on Wednesday and Saturday and informs the condition. Chief Incumbent of the temple Most Venerable Rathnapure Dhamma kusala Thera uses the spirit of Goddess Patthini and surprisingly some patients get cured within a few hours some within days as some take time as per the medical treatment that patient had obtained. Many locals irrespective of religion, community, most rich to the poor queue up here at an equal platform for survival.
Sri Lankans across the globe have got the word of mouth publicity on same and have experienced the positive outcome of the mysterious conduct and the spirit within him and his territory. He recommends some indigenous/native medicine of which some are available on site and some to find and prepare.
Last-ditch effort
I had cancer the inevitable and bought a cemetery plot. The cancer had spread throughout the body even after going through chemotherapy, radiation and many surgeries. But as a last-ditch effort, I managed to find the ultimate life support heaven and had my rebirth in the within three weeks and found the tumors had shrunk to nothing. This is amazing and nothing but a miracle. This extraordinary event that manifests divine intervention is experienced by thousands of Sri Lankans who go through simple lifestyle for the minimum of 21 days, one patient remarked.
In the face of such unusual and unexpected recoveries, patients often give thanks to a higher power.
Eranga Kandambi, a Sri Lankan engineer in Australia, has more to add.
Miracles take place in my country. I am so proud and feel indebted. I have no words to express but need to convey the message to all Sri Lankans worldwide.
Eranga Kandambi reveals the mystery gift received from Most Ven Rathnapure Dhamma kusala Thera through the goddess Sri Paththini Devi by the merits of Buddha Shakthi. Then he was totally freed from his cancer widespread in his Lympode.
Hodgkins lymphoma, formerly known as Hodgkins disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system.
Stage 4
I was suffering from various disorders and finally found that I have Hodgkins Lymphoma. By the time I informed Most Ven Rathnapure Dhammakusala Thera, my cancer was at stage 4 in medical terms. The doctors kept me informed that I have to spend time happily as all efforts have failed. Though I felt a slight progress at a certain stage my hips were badly affected after taking two therapy treatments per month over six months to be 12 in total. You name any test recommended Ultra sound, CT scan to PET I had gone through all of them. Eranga and wife wondered what to do. They required to be healthy to work and had no other alternative source of living. When he was young, his parents consulted his horoscope which read that Erangas life would be rescued by a Buddhist monk.
When I was happily living in Australia I shared this with my wife and had a good laugh over this. We wondered how it could be true. But now I know what happened. I need to share my joy with all, said Kandambi amid tears.
What is special about the Wahalkada Mangalarama temple
A series of customs/ programmes is lined up. You must live in a camping hut that looks like a basic room. You are required to undergo a pure Buddhist structured programme 100 percent based on Buddhism including meditation, poojas, blessings of gods, live in small huts and shelter with below basic facilities where patients feel equal.
Face value
No one is favoured. All are alike, this could be the only wedamedura or the hospital where patients are not taken at the face value, influence as per their political or social strength or outlook. The majority of them have spent so much on their critical illness. I offer this treatment at no cost apart from the cost of medicine which will be negligible, Venerable Dhamma kusala Thera added. Most of the cancer patients have gone through every possible treatment and reach the temple as an ultimate destination.

UN ESCAP welcomes new trust fund to promote regional cooperation between East Asia and Latin America
The Foreign Ministers and Heads of Delegations of the member countries of the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation (FEALAC), meeting in Busan on August 31, have agreed to strengthen the interconnectivity between the two regions and broaden the areas of cooperation by establishing a FEALAC Fund.
FEALAC has called for strengthening cooperation with international organizations, think tanks, civil society and the private sector, among others, in East Asia and Latin America in order to intensify concerted efforts and effectively conduct projects in various realms. Attending FEALAC, United Nations Under Secretary-General and UN ESCAP Executive Secretary Dr. Shamshad Akhtar said, Strengthening the partnership between FEALAC and the United Nations Regional Commissions  ESCAP and ECLAC  is a timely initiative as it falls squarely within our brief as UN regional think tanks to provide solid analysis to inform effective multilateral action.
The FEALAC Fund, unanimously endorsed by the 36 member countries attending the 8th Foreign Ministers Meeting in Busan with expressions of strong support for the role of UN Regional Commissions, will create new opportunities to support enhancement and diversification of trade by promoting innovation and tackling tariff and non-tariff barriers, along with advancing public policies for sustainable growth and development.
The two regions need to promote and transfer advanced technologies and develop mutually supportive ICT infrastructure, which can help overcome the vast physical distance separating them. Through these efforts, FEALAC can open a new chapter in East Asia-Latin America cooperation, said Dr. Akhtar.
Much potential exists for cooperation in science, technology and innovation as well as green growth policies as key means of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, added Dr. Akhtar.
Established 18 years ago, FEALAC brings together 36 countries on two continents accounting for a third of global GDP. Linking these two dynamic regions, FEALAC offers a platform to nurture economic cooperation beyond the ambit of bilateral arrangements.

## Title: The very words of Aristophanes

The very words of Aristophanes
As far back as early sixties, a Greek play by Aristophanes came to be adapted into a Sinhala text by the Douglas Amarasekara, the late professor of Mathematics. The original play which was translated into English was known by the name The Clouds. The Sinhala play production was known as Attha Kumakda (What is Truth).
I remember the day I went to see it at the University of Colombos King George Hall. It was quite unusual to see a packed house full of scholars of the time. I knew next to nothing of the Greek theatre and its impact on the world theatre. But I recall how I was immersed in the central theatrical experience. It revolved round a certain son of a farmer who was sent to the well known philosopher, Socrates, for further education under his tutelage. The truth seeking son happened to be overshadowed by logic to the extent that he became a nonsensical unrealistic character to the parents. It so happened when later I had the chance of reading the original play of Aristophanes.
Greek influence
I rediscovered the nature of the comedy element in the original, which presumably Professor Amarasekara wanted to drive in. Though the play in Sinhala evoked many a laughter in the audience, the performance may not have received the required degree of response. This, I believe, was the only initial Greek influence we had on the local theatre scene.
I recall the experience when I finished reading the latest research work by Journalist Sagarica Disanayaka, dealing with the subject of Comedy Plays and Aristophanes. The work deals generously on the aspects of Greek theatre, with emphasis on the comedy plays of Aristophanes (450  385 BC). As Disanayaka points out, Aristophanes was born during the great era of Athenian history that followed the defeat of the Persians at Marathon and Salamis. He wrote most of his plays during the Peloponnesian War (431  404 BC) that brought this period to an end and lived on into the postwar period when Athens were stripped of power and freedom by the victorious Spartans.
As noted by Disanayaka, Aristophanes was not lighthearted in his comedy element as he opposed the Peloponnesian war and the decadent Athenian democracy.
The democratic policies as Aristophanes depicted in his comedies was geared to show that they were mere free thinking factors. In his comedies, therefore Aristophanes attacks the democratic institutes of the Athenian people, inclusive of the thinking pattern of Socrates and Plato. He tries to ridicule the political and intellectual climate that existed at the time. His earliest extant play The Acharnians, produced in 428 BC is a direct attack on the wartorn climate of the Athenian culture.
Better climate
Disanayaka attempts to picture the Athenian culture during the time of Aristophanes which leads him to create his comedy play. She takes a special view on plays such as Lysistrata (411 BC) and The Frogs (405 BC). I am not too sure whether these play scripts are translated into Sinhala. If they are available, it should be noted Disanayakas work in the discussion could help build a better climate of knowledge for further study of Greek theatre.
The chapter four of the work centres around the opinion formation as taught in communication studies leads to the understanding of the concept of comedy with a special reference to Aristophanes. How Aristophanes utilizes the concept of comedy to perceive opinion making, and the same to bring about a change in the formation.
As such, what the researcher tries to say to the reader at large has to be regarded in a better perspective. This being the understanding of comedy not as a creative process leading to mere laughter or merriment, but as a process that culminates in the understanding, learning and interpreting what opinions are. On writing what Aristophanes I personally would prefer to see interpretations of plays such as The Clouds which lampoons Socrates and through him, the new movement in education led by the Sophists and The Frogs (405 BC) which ironically abuses Euripides for lowering the moral tone of tragedy, which would have been an ongoing issue at the time.
The play The Wasps (422 BC) makes fun of the Athenians passion for learning lawsuits and its best scene is that in which the dog named Labes on trial for his life brings his pups into the courtroom to whine for him.
Upper stratum
In this manner, the great playwright has to be rediscovered enabling our own budding dramatists to usher in a new Sri Lankan theatre era, devoid of mere laughing merriments but to elevate the level of comedy to an upper stratum. Perhaps this work may pave the way for the local theatre enthusiasts to find more on Aristophanes.
Transcending the barriers of the playwright, Aristophanes is regarded as a great poet, with a vision. It is observed via some of the English translations that in transforming his basic ideas into plays Aristophanes makes use of every device known for moving men to evoke a smile. He is said to have excelled in parody, burlesque, and farce. Hw as a master of word play. He has known the impact of the word not merely as a verbal tool given to the performer, but as a twist and turn gift, which means the comic verbal value of the sentence patterns and the unexpected turn. I remember this concept being taught by many a theatre teacher in the interpretation of the textual material before an audience. All in all Disanayakas work is a commendable effort.

Warner, Handscomb give Australia momentum
Chittagong: An unbeaten century stand between David Warner and Peter Handscomb led Australia's strong reply against Bangladesh on day two of the second and final Test in Chittagong on Tuesday.
The visitors were 225-2 at stumps in their first innings, trailing by 80 runs after Bangladesh were bowled out for 305.
Warner was batting on 88 with Handscomb on 69 at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
Skipper Steve Smith hit a gritty 58 off 94 balls before being bowled by left-arm spinner Taijul Islam as the visitors slipped to 98-2.
The left-handed Warner and Handscomb then put together 127 runs to thwart the Bangladesh bowling attack, which failed to take a wicket in the final session of play.
Handscomb, who recorded his fourth Test fifty in just his 10th game, took regular drinks breaks as he battled exhaustion and dehydration in the final half-hour.
The swashbuckling Warner played a sedate innings, having hit just four boundaries during his 170-ball stay at the crease so far.
Warner rode his luck with two reprieves. He was dropped at short-leg on 52 and then Mushfiqur Rahim missed a stumping when he was on 73, with Taijul and Mehedi Hasan being the unlucky bowlers.
Warner's opening partner Matt Renshaw departed early, dismissed by fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman for four before the lunch break.
The left-hander tried to tickle a sliding delivery down the leg side but wicketkeeper Rahim took a stunning catch. Warner was then involved in a 93-run second-wicket partnership with Smith as the pair steadied the innings.
Smith, who registered his 21st Test half-century, was done in by an arm ball from Taijul that sneaked through the bat-pad gap to hit the middle stump.
Earlier, Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed seven wickets to help bowl out the hosts for 305 in the first session. Lyon returned impressive figures of 7-94 including Rahim's prized scalp for 68.
Bangladesh lead the series 1-0 after registering their first-ever Test win against Australia last week. The home team has tightened security after the visitors' team bus was hit with a stone following the end of play on day one. AFP
