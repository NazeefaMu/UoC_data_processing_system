Blood donors contribute to health sectors progress
Sri Lankan blood donors contribute immensely to saving lives and to the success of many transplants taking place in the country, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He was speaking at the World Blood Donor Day - 2018 celebration, held at Nelum Pokuna, on Thursday.
Minister Senaratne said their donations have been supportive to the achievements made by the health sector after the good governance government came to power.
He said during this period, under his guidance as the Health Minister, two blood banks were set up in each district to cater to the people who face accidents, which are increasing at a high rate. He added that during this period, the number of hospitals with an Accident Service was increased to 24 - one for each district. He added that earlier, there was one accident service in the country. The minister added that only eye and kidney transplants were conducted in government hospitals before this government came to power. He said even kidney transplants were minimal but now, more than 485 kidney transplants are being conducted in hospitals. Around 35 liver transplants are conducted in the country.
"Meanwhile, we commenced pancreas transplant in the country and we have been successful in dual transplants of liver and pancreas," Minister Senaratne said. "We have been successful in lung transplant, heart transplant and limbs transplants as well. There have been only five leg transplants in the world and four out of the five patients died. The only one who survived is the Sri Lankan."
The minister said bone marrow transplant is being conducted successfully which is a solace to Thalassaemia patients. He added that an eight storey building is being constructed in the Colombo National Hospital premises to treat Thalassaemia patients, with facilities to conduct bone marrow transplants. He added that construction work would be completed by October and treatment would commence by January next year.
He also said that nearly 600,000 have been registered to donate blood in Sri Lanka and nearly 450,000 donate blood annually.
"This is the highest rate in the world compared to the population in those countries," Minister Senaratne said. "This is because Sri Lankans tend to donate due to the influence of Buddhism."
"Even until this government came to power, the plasma of the blood was discarded as clinical waste," Minister Senaratne said. "After I was appointed the Health Minister, I exported plasma to India for drug production and now we have found a US investor. We hope to produce 85 percent of drugs required by the country and hence we would be able to save around USD 250 million each year."
National Blood Transfusion Service Director Dr Rukshan Bellana also spoke on the occasion.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Blaze Trophy once again with Kingswood
Kingswood, far superior in the back division, scored a win over Wesley in their L.E. Blaze trophy rugby encounter. At the final whistle the scoreboard read 31-13. Wesley made a big impact, although they lost, they were superior in their forward play, and had the power and knowledge and were well in control. The Wesleyites failed to drive home the advantage, due to too many mistakes being made. Kingswoods resolute tackling spoiled the determined efforts of Wesley from scoring. The encounter for the trophy started in 1986, and the trophy was donated by the late Roy de Silva, who was a prominent Kingswoodian and one time NOC Chairman. Kingswood has won it on 22 occasions and Wesley 6.
Netball
A residential netball workshop was held in Kandy organized by the sport section of the Ministry of Education. Nearly 40 were present to follow the netball and physical training for coaches. Some netball coaches and followers were not informed and they failed to attend.

Ronnie helps Kingswood, Antonians
Ronnie Ibrahim a top class coach who helped St .Anthonys College and Kingswood College in the second round league as a consultant, will not be there to give his support in the knockouts.

Schools knockout rugby
The six top teams in the Cup championship along with the top 2 teams in the Plate segment will be competing out of which three Kandy schools Kingswood, Trinity and St .Anthonys have qualified to play in the Presidents Trophy knockout competition. In the quarters on Sunday at Nittawela it is going to be a home and home clash between Trinity College and Kingswood College, on Monday June 18 Plate runner-up St. Anthonys College will meet St. Peters College at Racecourse.
Sports can improve with more support and facilities
Despite all boys schools playing top class cricket and rugby in Kandy, they havent been able to produce a champion team. This is mainly due to poor ground facilities. Except for three schools at cricket and one school at rugby, others have no playing field. That is the main reasons for the drop in standards.
Antonian and Sumangala second
Kandy schools St. Anthonys College and Sri Sumangala College were second in the inter school rugby league in the Plate and Bowl. Preparation of these two schools in the second round was good and they were able to finish in second place and qualify for the knockouts.

Bouhaddouz own goal hands Iran late victory over Morocco
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Friday - Iran's players stormed the pitch at full-time as if they had won the World Cup rather than just their opening match after an own goal from Morocco's Aziz Bouhaddouz gifted them a dramatic 1-0 victory on Friday.
Wasteful finishing looked to have consigned this compelling contest at the Saint Petersburg Stadium to a goalless draw but Bouhaddouz's mistake in injury-time means Iran emerge as the early challengers to Spain and Portugal in Group B.
Iran coach Carlos Queiroz, once of Real Madrid and Manchester United, insisted the chaos that has engulfed Spain this week offered no boost to these teams' chances, but this victory certainly cranks the pressure up a notch.
When Bouhaddouz nodded in at the near post, Iran's substitutes could not resist rushing onto the field and when the final whistle blew moments later they were sprinting over again in delight.
Morocco should at least take heart from a blistering first half an hour, during which their zip and zest deemed them virtually unplayable. But Hakim Ziyach, Ayoub El Kaabi and Mehdi Benatia all failed to capitalise.
Instead, Iran showed the same grit that had frustrated Argentina for 91 minutes four years ago but while Lionel Messi was the difference that day, this time it was their turn to snatch a last-gasp winner.
Their build-up had not been smooth. Nike had blocked the players' supply of boots four days previous while further back, friendlies against Greece and Kosovo were cancelled.
It gave Queiroz good reason for positioning his team as the group's outsiders but both teams had cause for optimism after his side strolled through 18 games of Asian qualifying without defeat while Morocco were unbeaten too, with the added coup of not conceding a single goal. Morocco's fans, at a World Cup for the first time in 20 years, belted out their own national anthem and then applauded Iran's, the 67,000-seater arena a sea of red and white, and buzzing with the hum of vuvuzelas in a throwback to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

Celebrating Rata Wiruwo
Around one million Sri Lankans are working abroad, not counting the nearly 600,000 Lankans permanently domiciled overseas. They are one of the biggest contributors to the local economy, sending around US$ 7 billion back home per year. Along with the garment industry, Ceylon Tea and tourism, this is one of the biggest drivers of the local economy.
Indeed, this is why the Government has coined the term Rata Wiruwo (Expatriate Heroes) to describe the overseas workforce. Over the last 10 years, departures of female workers who are mostly employed as housemaids, have fallen while the number of male workers has increased. All expat workers sweat and toil in often inhospitable and non-ideal conditions to seek a better tomorrow for their loved ones back home. Today (June 16), we celebrate their commitment and dedication, on The International Day of Family Remittances (IDFR).
The money migrants send home helps families put food on the table, send their children to school and support economic development and job creation. Worldwide, expatriate remittances are one of the biggest funding sources for economic development. We are looking at one billion senders and receivers, and a projected US$6.5 trillion in remittances to be sent to low- and middle income countries between 2015 and 2030.
India has retained the top position as recipient of remittances with its Diaspora sending about $69 billion back home last year, the World Bank said. In its latest Migration and Development Brief, the World Bank estimated that officially recorded remittances to low-and middle-income countries reached $466 billion in 2017. This was an increase of 8.5 per cent over $429 billion in 2016.
India was followed by China ($64 billion), the Philippines ($33 billion), Mexico ($31 billion), Nigeria ($22 billion) and Egypt and Pakistan ($20 billion each) last year. Global remittances, which include flows to high-income countries, grew 7 per cent to $613 billion last year, from $573 billion in 2016. Global remittances are expected to grow 4.6 per cent to $642 billion in 2018. The Bank said remittances to South Asia grew a moderate 5.8 per cent to $117 billion. In 2018, remittances to the region will likely grow modestly by 2.5 percent to $120 billion.
The upsurge is likely to continue into 2018 on the back of stronger economic conditions in advanced economies (particularly the US) and an increase in oil prices that should have a positive impact on the Gulf Cooperation Council countries which absorb most of the workers from developing nations.
In the early days of migrant labour, there were only a few legal channels for sending money back home. Today, legal methods (banks and money transfer specialists) are widely available, but commissions and transmission costs can sometimes lessen the impact of the monies sent home. The global average cost of sending US$ 200 was 7.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, more than twice as high as the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 per cent. Better partnerships between national post office systems and money transfer operators are needed to widen the appeal of easy remittances. However, many countries are still reluctant to allow more efficient technologies - such as Internet and smartphone apps and the use of crypto currency and blockchain in remittance services. More must be done to bring down the high cost of remitting money so that families receive more funds.
Current estimates show that 75 per cent of remittance flows go to meet immediate family needs, but the other 25 per cent  over US$100 billion a year  is available for other purposes. Given better opportunities to save, remittance families will save more. Given appropriate investment options, remittance families will invest more. The potential impact of remittances can only be fully realized in concert with coherent public policies and priorities. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare must formulate such programmes in consultation with other relevant institutions. The idea behind foreign employment is that they will have a higher living standard  and a mechanism of continuing that once they settle down here for good.
There should be more facilities for expat workers on their return to the Motherland. The duty free allowance of US$ 1,750 granted to them for purchasing household goods seems rather puny by comparison to the massive US$ 50,000 duty free vehicle concession granted to our public representatives. Workers who have been employed abroad for 5-10 years should be given a duty-free permit to buy a motorcycle or a small 1,000 CC car, considering the funds they would have remitted during that period.
The welfare of migrant workers and their families should be uppermost in our minds. Many problems crop up in families where the mother or father has gone abroad  mechanisms should be drawn up to address these issues. Indeed, while we do have welfare officers in the Middle East and elsewhere, there is no equivalent service locally to inquire into the well-being of their families. This must be rectified. Expatriate workers are a precious resource for our economy and they must be given all necessary facilities and incentives.

The State Medical Students Parents Union has complained to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption yesterday on the method of recruiting foreign medical students to state medical faculties, State Medical Students Parents Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He said complaints were made against the University Grants Commission Chairman and the Higher Education Ministry Secretary.
Corruption and malpractices had taken place when recruiting foreign students to state medical faculties.It is alleged that some foreign students had paid around Rs. 3 million to certain persons.
Alwis said that recruiting foreign students to the faculties had not been transparent.
A large number of highly qualified local medical students lose the opportunity to study in in the faculties because of this corruption and malpractices.
It was found out that some of the foreign students admitted to the faculties do not posses the required minimum educational qualifications.
This means that the Government subject highly qualified local students to pure discrimination and prevent them from receiving free education, the Union said.

Eid-ul-Fitr Greetings
A month of goodwill and tolerance
I am pleased to express my sincere greetings to all Muslims in Sri Lanka who had completed their fasting during the Holy month of Ramadan, while celebrating Eid ul Fithr with full satisfaction, expressed Minister of Posts, Postal Services & Muslim Religious & Cultural Affairs M H A Haleem. In his message, the Minister further said that the fasting month was a great month for tolerance, while taking note of the sufferings of the underprivileged people. Muslims take this opportunity to spend the month with charity and prayers.
We have spent our time in prayers which would be answered, while our hearts are with the people who have suffered during the recent calamities and let Allah answer our prayers regarding them too. Patience is not only a part of the humanity of life, but also a month to demonstrate the necessity to succeed in mental satisfaction and determination. Lessons learnt during this period are necessary for every Muslim in our country to go forward not only with their community, but also satisfaction with all communities with love and tolerance. We need determination and changes in our thinking and lifestyle, such as relationships between communities for mutual unity and reconciliation. I would wish to express my greetings to all Muslims globally and not only to the Muslim people living in Sri Lanka.
Ramadan reminds us importance of self-sacrifice

The month of Ramadan grounded us in a spiritual journey of solace, patience, honesty, purity and the ability to experience the pain of hunger and the needs of others.
Our hearts go to the Muslim brethren suffering from strife and wars pain and hunger in many parts of the world. The holy essence of Ramadan must be allowed to dwell in our hearts throughout the year, to strengthen our spirit to foster peace for all. Eid Mubarak.

Eppawala Mango Processing Zone to boost cultivation
The post harvest loss of fruits and vegetables had been estimated at over 40 percent annually. We are not systematic in food security at ground level. Due to negligence, carelessness and lack of knowledge in simple post harvest techniques, a large extent of what our farmers produce through hard work is getting spoiled in harvesting, storing, transporting and marketing, said Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said so at the inauguration of the Eppawala Mango Processing Zone project, initiated to boost the mango cultivation and harvest. It is a value-added production, adopting the latest fruit processing techniques, initiated through the Anuradhapura Institute of Post Harvest Technology by Minister Dissanayake when he was the Agriculture Minister.
Cultivators who have been selected to participate in the mango processing zonal activities, have been offered appliances, including mango ripening cubical, specially designed crates for packing mangoes to minimize damage, fruit grading and washing machines costing Rs. 500,000 per set, to enable mango growers to market quality mangoes at high prices.
The institute has also intervened to get the chain of supermarkets onboard for purchasing processed fruit in bulk. The mangoes will be marketed under the brand name "Eppawala Mango" under the standardization certificate of the institute guarantying high quality.
Speaking at the farmers gathering, the minister said primitive fruit processing methods shall be done away with to enhance the income of farmers. Farmers are used to transport mangoes by dumping the fruits in a gunny bag.
Having stacked heavy bags of mangoes on top of each other and sometimes sleeping on top of the mangoes, the fruits get spoilt. They are only interested in transporting fruit as much as possible without caring to preserve the quality.
The minister said under these circumstances, he had instructed the institutes staff to provide post harvest technology to farmers.
The minister said the government is providing fruit processing equipment worth Rs. 500,000 per mango farmer as a self-employment gratuity, along with the provision of free extension services, planting materials etc as incentives.
The Institute of Post Harvest Technology officials headed by its chairman Kavinda Dissanayake and a large number of villagers were also present.

FCID records Deputy Ministers statement
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) yesterday recorded a statement from Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara over a complaint he made in connection with an alleged corrupt deal behind the purchasing of two ships to the Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd. during the previous regime.
The Deputy Minister has lodged the complaint in July 2016. After giving the statement to the FCID, he told the media that an underhand deal running to USD 15-20 million has been revealed behind this purchase which occurred in 2014.
This deal amounts to USD 70 million, but only USD 40-50 million had actually been spent on the purchase of two ships. A Peoples Bank loan has been obtained to buy these ships and we have to pay USD 15,000 daily as the loan installment. The operation and maintenance cost of each ship is about USD 5,000 per day. However, if we hire out one of them we get only USD 5,000 per day, he said.
The loss the state incurs from each ship when they are in use amounts to Rs.2.5 million per day and this increases to Rs.3.5 million per day when they are not in use. The names of the persons and officials behind this deal will soon be revealed.
The FCID has made a lot of progress in its investigations with regard to this complaint, he commented.

Guide to Chinas legal system
The law of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is officially referred to as the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. The formation and development of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics are compatible with the basic national conditions in the primary stage of socialism; the historical process of socialist revolution; the construction, reform and opening-up of the economy; and are in line with the development of Chinas productive forces and changes in the economic base.
Governing the country according to the law and building a socialist country under the rule of law is the basic strategy of the Chinese Communist Party. Forming a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, ensuring all aspects of the country and social life to be followed by the law is the precondition and basis of the full implementation of the basic strategy for the rule of law, and also the institutional guarantee for Chinas development and progress. The reform, opening up, and modernization provide internal demand and motivation for the construction of the legal system and provide practical foundations and experience. The more the reform and opening up move forward, the greater the development of modernization, the more profound the development of economic society, the more urgent it is to improve and improve the legal system, and the more stable the economic and social foundation upon which the legal system is built. It can be said that the continuous development of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics has promoted the construction and formation of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics.
There are separate legal traditions and systems in the Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The legal system of Mainland China belongs to the civil law system. The legal systems of Hong Kong and Macau are based on English Common Law and Portuguese civil law respectively. The legal systems of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) and the Macau SAR are excluded from the legal framework of Mainland China by the doctrine of One country, Two systems. The National Peoples Congress (NPC) of the PRC enacted the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (April 1990) and Basic Law of Macau SAR (March 1993) to ensure state sovereignty and at the same time the special economic position of those two regions. Since both statutes are national laws, no local laws, including ordinances, administrative regulations and other normative documents, can violate the Basic Law.
The socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics covers laws that fall under seven categories, namely, the Constitution, civil and commercial law, economic law, administrative law, criminal law, social law, and procedural law (the law on lawsuit and non-lawsuit procedures). These seven categories of laws exist at three different levels of state laws, administrative regulations and local statutes.
Constitution
The constitution is the fundamental law of the country. The current version was adopted in 1982 with fifth revisions in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004 and 2018. The Constitution assumes the commanding position in the socialist system of laws with Chinese characteristics and provides the fundamental guarantee of lasting stability and security, unity of ethnic groups, economic development and social progress of China. In China, people of all ethnic groups, state organs, the armed forces, political parties and public organizations, and enterprises and institutions in the country must take the Constitution as the basic standard of conduct, and they have the duty to uphold the dignity of the Constitution and ensure its implementation. The constitution-related law is the sum of the constitutional legal norms supporting the constitution and directly guaranteeing the implementation of the Constitution. It includes the Constitution of the National People's Congress, the National Regional Autonomy Law, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.,The Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region, the Law of the Legislature, the Law of the Local People's Congress, the National Flag Law and National Emblem Law, etc.
Civil and Commercial Law
At present, China does not have a complete civil code. It is based on the General Principles of Civil Law as the basic law, which is the first part of Civil Code in the future, aslo called Civil Code---General Part, supplemented by other single-line civil laws, including the Property Law, Contract Law, Tort Liability Law, Trademark Law, and Patent Law, Copyright Law, Marriage Law, etc. Commercial Law mainly includes Company Law, Insurance Law, Document Law and Securities Law.
Administrative Law
General administrative law refers to the laws and regulations concerning the general provisions of administrative subjects, administrative acts, administrative procedures, and administrative responsibilities, such as the Civil Servant Law, the Administrative Penalty Law, and the Administrative Reconsideration Law. Special administrative laws refer to laws and regulations that apply to the management activities of various specialized administrative departments, including defense, diplomacy, personnel, civil affairs, public security, national security, ethnicity, religion, overseas Chinese affairs, education, science and technology, culture, sports, medicine, and health. Laws and regulations concerning the administration of urban construction and environmental protection also form part of Administrative Law.
Economic Law
Economic Law is composed of the laws that create an equal competitive environment and maintain market order mainly include macroeconomic control laws and market regulation laws, and national macroeconomic control and economic management laws. The main laws include the Budget Law, Audit Law, Accounting Law, People's Bank of China Law, Price Law, Tax Collection Management Law, Personal Income Tax Law, Urban Real Estate Management Law, Land Management Law, etc. Market Regulation Law mainly includes Anti-Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Protection Law, Product Quality Law, Advertising Law, etc.
Social Law
Social Law includes the Labor Law, Labor Contract Law, Trade Union Law, Law on the Protection of Minors, Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly, Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women, Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities, and Mining Safety Law, Donation Law for Public Welfare, etc.
Criminal Law
Criminal law is the law that stipulates crime, criminal responsibility and penalty,includes the Criminal Law revised on March 14, 1997 and subsequent amendments, and the decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the punishment for crimes.
Litigation and Non-litigation Law
This branch of the law mainly includes the Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Procedure Law, Administrative Procedure Law, Special Procedure of Maritime Litigation, Arbitration Law, etc.
The court system of China
There are four levels in the court system of China: the Basic Peoples Courts (at country level), intermediate, higher and supreme people's courts, in addition to special courts such as the military, maritime, railway and forestry courts.
People's courts
Under the Organic Law of the People's Courts (1983), judicial power is exercised by the courts at four levels:
Basic people's courts; also called local people's courts): Courts at county or district level. Tribunals may also be set up in accordance with local conditions.
Intermediate people's courts: Prefecture-level courts.
Higher people's courts: Provincial-level courts.
The Supreme People's Court (or National Supreme Court, or Supreme Court)
The highest court in the judicial system is the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, directly responsible to the National Peoples Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee. It supervises the administration of justice by the people's courts at various levels.
Cases are decided within two instances of trial in the people's courts. This means that, from a judgement or order of first instance of a local people's court, a party may bring an appeal only once to the people's court at the next highest level, and the people's procuratorate may protest a court decision to the people's court at the next highest level. However, a limited number of civil and commercial cases may, according to the Civil Procedure Law, be heard for the third time, a regime called trial supervision. Additionally, judgments or orders of first instance of the local people's courts at various levels become legally effective if, within the prescribed period for appeal, no party makes an appeal. Any judgments and orders rendered by the Supreme People's Courts as court of first instance shall become effective immediately.
In accordance with Article 11 of the Organic Law, the people's courts at all levels shall set up judicial committees within the courts in order to sum up judicial experience and to discuss important or difficult cases and other issues relating to the judicial works.
Professional and special courts
Other special courts include military courts, maritime courts and railway courts. The military court, established within the People's Liberation Army, is the relatively closed adjudication institution in charge of hearing criminal cases involving servicemen. The maritime courts are located at the major sea and river port cities. They have jurisdiction over maritime cases and maritime trade cases of first instance. It ranks equivalent to an intermediate court in the judiciary hierarchy. The railway transport court deals with criminal cases and economic disputes relating to railway and transportation.
Law making in the PRCNational Peoples Congress (NPC)
The highest legislative authority is the National People's Congress. It has the power to revise the Constitution and create major legal codes referred to as basic laws. In addition, the NPC also enacts laws and decisions. Decisions may contain legal norms in the form of amendments or supplements to laws. They are often used to delegate lawmaking authority to the State Council.
The NPC Legislative Affairs Commission is the key organ that is responsible for the law drafting work. Since the 1990s, scholars and experts are increasingly entrusted by the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission to form drafting groups to prepare the first draft of the basic laws (for instance, this was the case for the Contract Law (1999), the Law of Rights in rem (2007), the Law of Tort Liability (2009) and the Law of the PRC on the Law Applicable to Foreign-related Civil Relations (2010).
The State Council
The next tier of the PRC's legislative hierarchy is the State Council which is elected by the NPC. The State Council is the head of the nation's executive. It is empowered under Article 89 of the Constitution to adopt administrative measures, enact administrative regulations and issue decisions and orders in accordance with the Constitution and statutes. The State Council Legislative Affairs Office is mainly responsible for the drafting of administrative regulations which are issued for the purpose of implementing laws.
Lawmaking at the local level
Of the four levels of local administration in China (province, region/prefecture, county/district, township), only the provincial level possesses real lawmaking power. The Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments allows congresses at the provincial, municipal, provincial capital and quite big city levels to enact their own regulations, called local regulations. Nevertheless, drafts of legislation must be approved by the provincial level congress before they can become law.

Keshap gives links to Gotas politics
The politics of division bothering the governing coalition made worse by the two key politicians associated with questionable donations from Perpetual Treasuries and its associate companies, the focus of political debate in the past three weeks, has been pushed back by the reports of the US Ambassador Atul Keshaps reported critical comments on the possibility of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being a candidate for, and possibly the next Executive President of Sri Lanka.
The story was first reported in the Tamil daily Kaalaikkathi (Morning Ray) on June 12, 2018, from a special correspondent reporting on what Ambassador Keshap had told former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, at a meeting on June 10 at the former presidents residence, which could have been Keshaps farewell meeting with MR. There was sufficient time for the US Embassy to comment on or contradict the report, which has not been done; and the story has gained wider publicity by being on the blog of journalist D.B.S. Jeyaraj, having very good contacts with the political and Tamil media, and has now hit the headlines in the local media.
The report in Jeyarajs blog states: According to details disclosed by the Jaffna daily the 90 minute meeting between Mahinda Rajapaksa and Atul Keshap had taken place on Sunday June 10th evening at the ex-presidents residence. The talks held cordially were on a number of relevant matters. Among these the most significant issue was about the possible presidential candidacy of ex-Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Kaalaikkathir quoting very reliable sources said that the US envoy had in clear, unambiguous and definite terms told Mahinda Rajapaksa directly that the western nations including the USA would not favourably regard Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being nominated as a Presidential candidate.
The newspaper went on to say that Atul Keshap had reportedly stated the international community was looking forward to a person with political maturity and experience who could interact effectively within the sphere of democratic politics to be the leader of the country. The US envoy had emphasised that crushing terrorism with an iron hand and governance in a political democracy were two different things. Ambassador Keshap had bluntly told Mahinda Rajapaksa that the US and West were not in favour of a person like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and would not welcome his contesting the presidency. (dbsjeyaraj.com  June 14, 2018)
The trend of news reports, journalist comments and analysis on Keshaps observations on a Gotabhaya candidacy or presidency in Sri Lanka is largely of strong criticism, considering it to be American interference in the politics of this country. This is not surprising knowing how former US Ambassadors have interfered in the politics in Sri Lanka, especially with records of antagonistic involvement and applying pressure on Sri Lanka during the countrys fight against LTTE terrorism. The US has also sought to send messages on the progress of democracy in this country, which certainly sought to favour right wing political parties and leaders, and give overall support to regional interest of the USA, as well as the political strategies of US leadership. This was very clear when Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State in the first Obama Administration, and how she obtained funds from pro-LTTE organizations in the US for her first presidential election campaign. Amb. Keshap has certainly walked into the muddy terrain of local politics, and will certainly receive much more of attacks on foreign interference in our politics.
This interference in the politics and the coming presidential election in this country has to be looked at in the context of the huge protests in the US about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which saw the election of Donald Trump.
Citizenship puzzle
Yet, apart from aspects of interference in our politics, there is also a difference to this Keshap thinking on a Gotabhaya presidency. One must not forget that Gotabhaya is also a US citizen, and has been so for many years. His brother Basil is also US citizen, and there is yet another brother of the Rajapaksa family resident in Texas for very long time. Whatever may be the US thinking on a Gotabhaya presidency here, it is an interesting quirk that a family which seeks to promote strong nationalism in this country, with clear emphasis on majoritarianism  both in race and religion  is also, so much a part of US citizenry. What Keshap has spoken of is the dislike of the US (and other western nations) to a US citizen - no doubt with economic and other ties in the US, as well as very close fraternal family ties there  wanting to be the next leader of this South Asian democracy.
At a time when the US is breaking its alliances with longtime allies in the G7, the European Union, and with immediate neighbours  Canada and Mexico  in the disconcerting drive of the Trump presidency, Atul Keshap may have got it wrong on how the US government would view Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. There are indications that some of the Viyath Maga thinking has to do with Trump policies, and Chinese politics, too. Atul Keshaps reported statement that the international community was looking forward to a person with political maturity and experience who could interact effectively within the sphere of democratic politics to be the leader of the country, emphasizing that crushing terrorism with an iron hand and governance in a political democracy were two different things; is certainly questionable with Donald Trumps new understandings with North Koreas Kim Jong-un, and Trump-line Americas and so-called commitments to democracy.
US Dual Citizenship
Another interesting aspect of the Keshap thinking on Gotabhaya was the recent media statement by Pivithuru Hela Urumayas Udaya Gammanpila, on how easy it would be for Gotabhaya do give up his dual citizenship in the US. Responding to what he called a Gotaphobia being spread by his critics, Gammanpila said the renunciation of US Dual Citizenship is so simple and so quick, taking just a couple of days, and would speedily remove from him the restrictions on contesting the presidency under the 19th Amendment.
But Amb. Keshap has reportedly told MR that US laws would not permit Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to renounce US citizenship at this juncture. He had stated that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa needed to clear himself of allegations against him over war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally. It is only after he is cleared fully that the US would let him renounce citizenship and be eligible to contest Parliamentary or Presidential elections. (dbsjeyaraj.com  June 14, 2018).
Sri Lankans are certainly unaware of all these charges said to be against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, and more information of such situations would certainly add to the rising political debate about his possible candidacy for the presidency. What we know is that our judiciary has accepted a petition from him and prevented his arrest on matters of Public Property - not war crimes or crimes against humanity - and the non-arrest gets prolonged due to recusing by learned judges. Keshap has certainly opened a whole new window, which will give strength to those who talk of Gotaphobia, and also to others who have serious concerns about a possible Gotabhaya candidacy for president by 2020 or even before, and his suitability for such position.
Family matters
The Keshap revelations, that remain unconfirmed, but not denied too, certainly brings a new veer to the debate on the future of the presidency, and must cause concern among those in the SLPP, led by Mahinda Rajapaksa who are thinking of strategies for the next presidency. It may weaken the forces with the Viyath Maga strategies for the next presidency, and also give some strength to those in the SLFP and the other parties of the Joint Opposition thinking of Chamal Rajapaksa as the candidate. This must also cause worries to those in the Sirisena-camp of the SLFP, thinking of Gotabhaya as a balancing force against the wider political strength of MR.
What the Keshap talk with Mahinda Rajapaksa has done, is to bring a new American twist into the politics of Sri Lanka. It has moved towards adding to differences within the SLFP on the emerging politics in the country, and adding to the continuing divisions within unity in the governing coalition. It could strengthen the voices of UNP campaigners who think Gotabhaya would be an easier candidate to defeat, but pays little attention to the overall popularity of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who remains the UNPs candidate.
It is a new configuration of fraternal ties that is making its way into the politics of Sri Lanka, throwing a spanner into the works of those thinking of the content of political changes needed after the overall failure of the Yahapalana strategies of 2015, the widening divisions between the UNP and SLFP, and the unquestioned strength of the SLPP, but without an understanding of the voter base nationwide.
How much more can American thinking manipulate politics in Sri Lanka, as it continues to face the crises of divisive politics made worse with perpetual links with the politics of the crooked

Knowledge reigns in future: Sarath Amunugama
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Minister addressing an assembly of students and teachers at the Green University recently said knowledge will be the most valuable asset in future.
The meeting was at the auditorium of the Green University, during an observation tour of the university by the Minister. Vice Chancellor Dr. E.A.Weerasinghe, NSBM Chairman P. Ranepura, Ministry Secretary Sandhya Wijebandara, Prof. Bharatha Dodankotuwa and others accompanied the Minister.
I never expected to hear today something I wrote when I was a university student. I thank you for giving me that opportunity. Though I have held many positions during my career, what gives me most satisfaction is my association with universities. The times I spent studying at Peradeniya University, Harvard and Sorbonne were tremendous experiences. I must say that today when I came to the Green University.l I got the same feeling.
He said the countrys greatest asset is its children. "After Independence, every government has tried to secure a good future for them. Sitting before us today is a most important group of those children. The people have made great sacrifices to bring you to this level," the Minister said.
"Free education, health services, and social insurance in Sri Lanka are not found in many other countries. When we look at the higher education scene in this country today, what we observe is that many bright children face an examination of a few hours and a part of them get into state universities while another part of equal ability get left behind. Our challenge is how to secure the future of this group. This university is an answer to such a challenge," the Minister said.
He said the people believe that the State must do everything. "When we were university students, we talked about minerals, the vegetation, the infrastructure and others. as the resources of a country.
"Today knowledge is considered the greatest resource. Therefore, knowledge will be the most important asset of the future. We rank high among the countries that have achieved the Millennium Goals, the Minister said.

leading buddhist forum against abolition of Executive Presidency
The Buddhasasana Karya Sadhaka Balakaya in a statement said that the Executive Presidency should not be abolished without repealing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
The organisation in a statement signed by Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera, Ven. Thrikunamale Ananda Thera and Ven. Agalakada Sirisumana Thera states that the abolition of the Exeucitve Presidency would be dangerous without repealing the 13th Amendment.
The statement said if the Provincial Ministers exercise their powers in a manner that was illegal or detrimental to the State, in such an instance, the President can intervene and give necessary orders to correct them.
If the Presidential system is abolished while maintaining the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the Central Government will not be able to intervene as before, the statement added.
The Buddhasasana Karyasadhaka Mandayala said that there should not be a division of the peoples executive powers between the Cabinet of Ministers and the Council of Ministers of the Provincial Council.
If the Council of Ministers of the Provinces is maintained under the 13th Amendment, it should be done subject to the powers of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers,the statement said.
The rights of the minorities living the North and the East will not be protected by only having the power to dissolve a provincial Council on a special occasion with the President.
We can imagine how some Provincial Councils would act when the Executive Presidency is abolished by looking at how some of the Provincial Councils are acting now.
The President should have full powers to control any untoward action of the Northern Provincial Council and its Chief Minister. Since the Cabinet Ministers cannot exercise powers on subjects mentioned in the Provincial Council List, the President should be able exercise those powers when a necessity arises.
It is with sadness that we note that the needs of separatists who want to establish a Federal State in Sri Lanka and the Western Powers influence certain decisions of the government. The current Constitutional drafting process is a good example for this. While we strongly oppose any move to dilute the Unitary Status or to introduce a Federal System, we request all political parties not to abolish the Executive Presidential system without amending the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

Mahanama and Muralitharan join Mahela to turn down consultants offer
Cricketing legends Mahela Jayewardene, Muthiah Muralitharan and Roshan Mahanama yesterday rejected a request by Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha and the National Selectors to serve as consultants to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
They rejected the request stating that they feel it was an insincere move. Sri Lanka Cricket writing to Minister Musthapha on Wednesday proposed to appoint cricketing legends Mahela Jayewardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Aravinda de Silva and Roshan Mahanama to serve in a committee on consultancy basis for the greater interest of the game of cricket in Sri Lanka.
The proposal was subsequent to a request by the national selectors. Suggested by the selectors, SLC also informed the Minister that it seeks the services of cricketing legend Muthiah Muralitharan for the coaching department on consultancy basis to advice spin bowlers on technical areas.
The SLC letter was undersigned by its Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva. Subsequent to the letter, Minister Musthapha requested the above mentioned former cricketers to be consultants to SLC.
In a strongly worded post in his Tweeter account, former Sri Lanka cricket captain Mahela Jayawardene on Thursday turned down the request also asking not to use them to buy time. With all due respect to the Selectors and the Sports Minister, I have spent one year in the cricket committee and 6 months in a special advisory committee and no recommendations were implemented. I dont have any trust in the system. If anyone wants to buy time please dont use us! Jayawardena tweeted.
Muralitharan endorsing Jayawardenes views also rejected the request stating, I am of the view that it is an insincere, cunning move, more to use us when the cricket administration is in such a deplorable state.
I appreciate the invitation which firstly reached me via the media and then officially confirmed by the CEO as per the conversation we had after which he emailed the letter of confirmationI standby the sentiments that Mahela has expressed not able to trust the system as per his own experience of attempting to resolve pressing issues which was never implemented, he said in a post in his official Face Book page.
It is sad that national cricketers are not consulted until it hits the rock bottom! Muralitharan said adding that he would not hesitate to give his time despite his own professional coaching engagements worldwide if he realises the Sri Lanka cricket administrations request was genuine and credible.
Past captain and former ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama writing to Minister Musthapha said that he believes that some of the burning issues that the SLC is currently faced with must be resolved prior to the formation of the proposed committee.
Absolute honesty, transparency and strict adherence to accepted norms and practices in all dealings connected with SLC are of paramount importance. Further, In the interest of the game that I so passionately love, a new Refreshing Plan of Action to resurrect Sri Lanka Cricket should receive the highest priority. I have a list of points that I have noted, some of which was discussed with you during our brief meeting a few days ago. Whilst appreciating your invitation, I am reluctantly compelled to inform you of my inability to accept your invitation unless these issues are properly addressed and resolved, he said.
I must emphasize in conclusion, that my stance on this matter must never be misconstrued as lack of concern on my part to assist Sri Lanka Cricket. I would do my very best to assist Sri Lanka Cricket at any time but I detest political interference, dishonesty and lack of transparency at any level and until someone makes a positive effort to eliminate them, I consider it prudent to stick to my principles and play the selective role I have chosen, he added.
Kumar Sangakkara and Aravinda de Silva have yet to explain their stances.

Nimal Cooray former Cambrian and Air Force all-round cricketer
The sixth death anniversary of Nimal Cooray former Cambrian, Sri Lanka Air Force and Adastrian all round cricketer, soccer player and cricket coach and Defence Services Cricket umpire fell on 28 May 2018. He died at the age of 69 years and had his entire education at Prince of Wales College Moratuwa. He later joined the then Royal Ceylon Air Force in November 1963. Though he was one class Junior to me at college I too happened to be a member of his Air Force 25th Batch of Recruits and a member of the cricket teams in time to time.
Whilst at school he played for the under 12, 14, 16 first eleven and captained the second eleven cricket team in 1961. He played in the Big Match in 1961 under Lister Perera in the absence of Roy Cooray and later three of his brothers Lakdasa, Srinath and Mahesh too played in the big matches, which is a record for the Cambrians. Later Yasendra de Silva, Sarath, Manjusri and Bandula too played in the big matches. Though I attended practices I was a reserve player in all these teams and was in the first eleven cricket squad for three years under W. G. Fernando, Roy Cooray and Hayasti Aponso as a reserve and never played College cricket.
After our Combat and Military Training at Diyatalawa we were drafted to Katunayake for our Trade Training in 1964. During this period Air Force had only one Division Two team (Donovan Andree Trophy) and two Daily News teams. The Division Two cricket team was captained by former Anandian Siri Charlie Amarasinghe and the two Daily News teams were led by former Commander Harry Gunatillake and past Thomian Aubrey Ebert. Nimal easily walked into the team led by Harry Gunathillake and I managed to play under Aubrey Ebert. He excelled well with the bat as well as the ball and was also a very fine close in fielder. After the conclusion of the tournament he was selected to play for the Inter Services Tournament where the Airmen won the trophy after a lapse of several years.
In the same year he was an automatic choice for the Division Two team under K. M. Nelson and I too happened to be a member of the same team when Air Force won the Division Two title comfortably winning nine out of ten matches in the 1965/66 season. Nimal played a major role for its success. Now five decades have elapsed and Air Force has not won a major trophy. The same year due to a controversy in the Sara Trophy a two day tournament was introduced for the Cecil Horan Trophy by the Board of Cricket for Ceylon and Air Force came up to the final and lost to formidable Colts Cricket Club led by evergreen Brian de Silva. This final game was confined to a limited over match of 50 overs and Nimal too played. This is the first ever tournament match played in the then Ceylon where the Air Force and Colts Cricket Club were involved.
Nimal was a middle order bat and a medium pace bowler and in the latter stages he opened batting. He toured India and Gan Islands with the Air Force teams and captained his unit on several occasions and played soccer at inter unit level. He was in the Defence Services Umpires Panel as well.
He represented Air Force from 1966 to 1980 in the Sara Trophy and his first captain was two times baby of the Nalanda cricket team Donald Perera. Later he was vice captain to Mohamed Faleel in the Sara Trophy.
He was appointed as captain of the Air Force division two team in 1980. After leaving the Air Force in 1985 he joined the Security Division of Commercial Bank in 2003 and later coached the college cricket academy for sometime on the invitation of the then Principal of Methodist High School Puwakaramba Hemachandra Perera and a past cricket stalwart of the same school Edwin Fernando. Both of us commenced cricket and coached them in the under 13, 15 and 17 free of charge for 12 years.
Nimal was a devout Anglican and he left his wife Doreen and only daughter on 26 May 2012.
May the turf lie lightly on my school mate, cricketing friend and Air Force colleague. There is a saying that Old Soldiers Never Die They Just Fade Away.

Police teams investigating into the shooting of Kataragama Kirivehera Chief Incumbent Ven Kobawaka Dhamminda Thera had searched around 20 locations where the main suspect is believed to have been hiding.
The Police spokesman said the suspect had been identified and he is expected to be arrested shortly.
Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera had complained to police about threats to his life earlier and as a result, the police had provided him security of two PCs and two CSD personnel.
However, one of the PCs had been on leave, while questions have arisen regarding the other PC on duty, as to why he had not fired at the gunmen, despite having been given a weapon.
The monks security personnel had failed to shoot at the suspects and currently an investigation as to why they had not fired back, is being conducted.
In such an instance, according to provisions of the Penal Code, security personnel had full authority to fire at suspects, but we have to investigate why they had not fired back at the assailants, the Police Spokesman said.
Comprehensive security measures are in place in the Kataragama sacred area including the Kirivehera following the shooting incident at the Kirivehera temple, which left Chief Incumbent of Kataragama Kiriwehera Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another Thera injured. Vehicles entering the Kataragama Devalaya and Kirivehera premises have been restricted and police personnel have been deployed.

90th birth anniversary falls today:
Remembering inimitable Belle Wirakoon
Belle Wirekoon departed this world a year ago and her 90th birthday falls on June 16, 2018. She was born in Kandy and blessed with five sisters and a brother. Belle had her education at Hillwood College, Kandy and Good Shepherd Convent, Colombo.
Many tributes were paid to Belle by sports writers and TT contemporaries applauding her unique achievements when she strode the stage like a colossus during her glittering career spanning three decades (1948 to 1978).
TT players and enthusiasts of varying vintage continue to be steeped in admiration and awe at Belle's incredible feats in annexing the National Womens title 13 times and filling the runner-up berth on 12 occasions.
In addition to her dominance among the ladies, Belle also won the Womens Doubles and Mixed Doubles titles partnering reputed players of her era. In the annals of table tennis in the country which commenced in the early 1940's Belle Wirekoon's unsurpassed record will stand as a perennial tribute to her stature vanquishing several younger contenders to win the race to the victory podium.
In a brief reminisce some of Belle's contemporaries were the Pestonjee sisters, Mrs. VP Siriwardene, Grace Somasunderam, Neela Singham, Indra and Bhsi Jilla, Frances Ratnayake, Nandini Daniel, Pesi Pestonjee, Charlie Daniel, Anto Fernandopulle, Paul Thambinayagam, Dick and Sam Schoorman, NM Lakdawala, Suresh Melvani, Dr.Buddy Reid, Annesley Gomez, Nimo Ramchand, Jothipala Samaraweera, NH Perera, Angelo Santiago, Deepak Naraindas and Firoz Nilam.
Belle won the womens title in 1951 and retained it until 1954 when she commenced plans to proceed to England in quest of learning more of the game.
Belle represented Sri Lanka at a host of competitions and championships overseas including the Asian Games (1964), Ganefo Games ('63/64) and the Asian Championships (1974) in Japan.
Belle was attached to the US Embassy for 20 years and continued her victory trail leading her team in the tournaments conducted by the Mercantile TT Association outclassing opposition with ease.
PERSONALITY PARADE -TT BELLE
This was the caption in the welcome extended to Belle by the English Table Tennis Association in their popular newsletter. The article referred to the 27 year old slender tall girl who resigned from a well paid job in the metropolitan city of Colombo and traversed 7000 miles to England solely motivated by her desire to improve her game under the expert guidance of Jack Carrington, the Director of Coaching to the English Table Tennis Association. The young aspirant had assiduously saved sufficient funds over 4 years to pay for her travel and arrived in England in September 1955. During her brief tenure in England Belle resided with her sister Yvonne and in her insatiable thirst for practice and competition participated in tournaments conducted in East of England, Sussex and Eastern suburban open tournaments losing after a hard fought duel to Welsh International Shirley Jones and Barbara Millbank. It is relevant to mention that on the eve of her departure to England, Belle Wirekoon was ranked 8th womens' player in the Indian sub continent and her dream was to rise to the rank of No. 1 player after her return.
In brief hindsight Belle Wirekoon never clamoured for public recognition and opted to lead a life of quietude in Ekala, Ja-Ela after holding center stage for 3 decades a feat which may never be equalled or surpassed.

The secrets to Germany's World Cup success
They stand on the brink of history, ready to add a record fifth star to the badge and become the first nation to retain the World Cup since Brazil in 1962.
It's business as usual for Germany.
Head coach Joachim Lw has guided Die Mannschaft to at least the semifinals in each of his last five major tournaments. The current team qualified from Group C with a perfect record of 10 wins from 10 and a goal difference of +39.
Few would bet against them once again in Russia.
After all, football's a simple game. As former England striker Gary Lineker once put it, 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end the Germans win.
But that hasn't always been the case.
Around the turn of the millennium, it was a footballing nation in crisis. An aging squad exited the Euro 2000 group stages in ignominy without a single win to their name.
"The Germans were always believing in power and mentality, but not quality in the teaching of their youth teams," former captain Lothar Matthus tells CNN Sport, speaking of the prevailing attitude at that time.
"This was maybe the reason that, after the 2000 European Championship, Germany went a new way -- a better way for the future."
A task force of the German Football Association's finest minds gathered with a view to revolutionizing the game from top to bottom.
No stone would be left unturned in the search for talent. The national team, as Bayer Leverkusen CEO Wolfgang Holzhuser put it, would henceforth be regarded as "the 19th and best team in the Bundesliga."
"It was very much the watershed moment," German football journalist Archie Rhind-Tutt tells CNN Sport. "We can see the fruits of that labor now."
DEPTH
Looking at the wealth of talent available to Lw in Russia, it's quite possible to pick at least four entirely distinct starting XIs capable of advancing to the latter stages of the tournament.
It is testament to such riches that neither Andr Schrrle nor Mario Gtze, the players that combined to win Germany the last World Cup in extra time, even made the preliminary squad this time around.
"We have in Germany a lot of good, young, talented players," former captain Bastian Schweinsteiger tells CNN Sport. "It's not easy for our head coach to choose the starting 11 or even the full squad."
That German football fans engage in fierce debate over who should be their third-choice goalkeeper typifies the present situation.
What they've done "is not rocket science," though, according to football journalist Rapha Honigstein.
"They've taken ideas from France; they've taken ideas from England; they've taken ideas from Holland; and they've just put lots of firepower, know-how and of course a very strong infrastructure behind that," Honigstein tells CNN Sport. "And the result is you're just pumping out talent."
YOUTH
Both Honigstein and Rhind-Tutt contrast the invaluable education German players receive with that of their English counterparts, pointing to the Premier League "bottleneck" that often prevents youngsters from getting first-team football.
Having talent is one thing; actually deploying it is quite another.
Former defender Christian Ziege, a World Cup runner-up in 2002, puts Germany's success down to the domestic game's reliance on youth.
"I played myself with the Germany youth team against England in the past and I think they have so many good players," says Ziege, who has since gone on to coach the likes of Marc-Andr ter Stegen, Matthias Ginter and Timo Werner while working with Germany's Under-18 and U19 teams.
"The only problem is they're not going to play in the Premier League because the top clubs are more or less only using players with experience that cost a lot of money.
"The good thing is when you can't spend too much money, you can put young players into the teams. They get that experience; they can play.
"We sent a team for the Confederations Cup without nearly all the main players and ended up winning that trophy as well."
The squad that Ziege speaks of boasted an average age of just 24 -- the youngest at the tournament -- but rallied to win the World Cup warmup in style.
Instilling a winning mentality at an early age can only be beneficial, according to Matthus, who led Germany to glory at Italia 1990.
"From these academies, the national team profits," says the former defensive midfielder, who remains the only player to appear in five different World Cups. "They are ready when they get the invitation.
When they get the chance to play, they will show the quality of men."
MENTALITY
Rival fans talk enviously of the so-called "German mentality," using the phrase as shorthand for ruthless efficiency in the will to win.
"You can see it not only in football, but in the cars," jokes Matthus. "We have the best cars around the world -- with BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, blah blah blah! We like to always do the best, and for this you have to work very hard.
"We are never satisfied. We always do the next step. And I think this is the German mentality."
But for Ziege, who amassed 72 caps between 1993 and 2004, "something has changed a little bit ... and that's the reason we have so much talent now in our football."
The new generation is cut from a different cloth, the former Bayern Munich defender suggests, with an increasingly cosmopolitan squad adopting a more cultural approach both on and off the field.
Is the "German mentality" a myth It depends who you ask and what you mean.
Both Schweinsteiger and Matthus, Germany captains who have lift the coveted trophy, put their triumphs down to intangible qualities within the camp.
"I would say it's to have a feeling for everyone -- to understand every single person, exactly how they are," says Schweinsteiger, when asked for the secret to Germany's success during his time in the side. "Their character, their personality, which things they like, which they don't like.
"You have to oversee everything, which costs a lot of energy. But if you have experience and you know how to handle it, it's also kind of fun."
It's an answer echoed by Matthus, who also -- perhaps surprisingly -- singles out the importance of fun in the long weeks away.
"First you need the quality of the players, the right system, but the team spirit is very important," the 1991 World Player of the Year explains.
"From the first day we began preparation, two weeks before the World Cup, we had a feeling that we were working with 23 players together, and this is the most important thing.

Sun shines over Korea
Sun shines over Korea dissipating dark clouds of war and Moon beams over especially the South as one of the worlds best designed modern cities- Seoul residents breathe a sigh of relief. Both mad man and the rocket man have been converted into peaceniks. The latters football diplomacy has borne fruit.
Metaphor apart, the summit between President Donald Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in Santosa Island, Singapore on June 12 has been a success.
When recalling the atmosphere of virtual belligerency and politics of brinkmanship that prevailed six to seven months ago the mere fact of their meeting is a measure of success. It signifies a shift from antagonism towards friendship and civilized discourse.
The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the summit said, President Trump and remains and Chairman Kim conducted a comprehensive, in-depth and sincere exchange of opinions related to the establishment of new US  DPRK relations and to building of a lasting and robust peace region in the Korean peninsula. President Trump promised to provide security guarantees to the DPRK and Chairman Kim reaffirmed his firm and necessary commitment to complete denuclearization of the peninsula.
A win-win situation
The two countries also resolved for the immediate repatriation of those already identified.
Obviously, this is a win-win situation for both sides. Not only did the DPRK get a security guarantee against regime change and confrontation but also the United States could assure itself that Pyongyang nuclear weapons would not fall on American soil.
As critics pointed out the general nature of the statement without any specific details what would be actually meant by denuclearization is a drawback which would lead to misinterpretations or different interpretations. However, a statement issued by the official Korean News Agency on June 13 said that leaders recognized that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and development of the Korean peninsula.
Incidentally, the two leaders in their joint statement also said committed to follow up negotiations led by US Secretary of State Pompeo and relevant high official of the DPRK at earliest possible date, to implement outcome of the summit. This seems to be a pragmatic approach for problems have to be discussed comprehensively and technicalities sorted out in detail with the participation of experts.
The two leaders have also invited each other to visit their countries and the invitations were accepted.
Apparently not everybody is happy. The Democrats and the military-industrial complex are angry that the United States has yielded too many concessions to a tyrannical regime. These groups who openly assisted Washingtons policy of buttressing dictatorial regimes of Pinochets Chile or the Banana Republics or the Coup d tat of General Suharto in Indonesia etc. now cry foul as their mercenary interests may get affected. They are especially worried that President Trump promised to stop US-South Korean joint military drills without complete and verifiable irreversible disarmament (CVID). North Korea had from the outset opposed CVID, taking a lesson from the fate of Colonel Khadafy. As noted earlier Trump has been pragmatic enough to accept it and preferred a step-by-step approach. Conservative sections in the US would like one-sided denuclearization of the DPRK without the US removing its nuclear arsenal and war apparatus from the Korean peninsula.
Family union of Koreans
President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea has more than one reason to be happy. He won the elections of a pledge to improve relations with the North. He has delivered more than he pledged for. Prospects of signing a peace treaty and thereby ending the state of war between the two Koreas are brighter. Ensuring family union of Koreans separated and living in the North and South is near at hand. Though not near, the peaceful unification of Korea is on the agenda and possibly it would take a different path than Germany.
Most world leaders have welcomed the outcome of the summit while some of them have been cautious too. Among those who welcomed are South Korea, United Kingdom, China, Russia, Singapore and the European Union. Malaysia has said that it would re-open its Embassy in Pyongyang. Israel has openly expressed its displeasure while the United Nations have appealed to all nations to give Kim patience and support.
Ensuring a peaceful atmosphere in the Korean peninsula would be a great contribution to a peaceful Asia-Pacific region which would benefit not only that region but also the world at large. China would also feel more relieved.
On the other hand, China will play a crucial role in the implementation of the summit outcome for it is the biggest trading partner of the DPRK and its security guarantor. Had it not being for the strong bonds between China and the DPRK and measured assistance from Russia it would have impossible for the DPRK to challenge and stand up to the Worlds only super power.
It is clear what caused the change of heart in Washington is the nuclear capability of the DPRK. In nuclear war superiority rests not so much in the strength of the nuclear arsenal but on the sequence of their use or who strikes first. Once the DPRK developed its nuclear weapons and missile technology the balance of power changed in the peninsula. In this sense Kims strategy seems to have worked. His next strategic target seems to be economic development and he has high hopes to transform the country to a developed status for it has immense and untapped resources.

Appeal to release Rajiv Gandhi killers :
Tamil Nadu plea rejected
Indian President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the Tamil Nadu governments request to release the seven prisoners convicted for the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991.
President Kovind conveyed to the government that the Centre doesnt concur with its view to release the prisoners. The President is bound by the advice of his Council of Ministers in such matters.
In the last four years, the State government has written twice to the Home Ministry to pardon the convicts and release them on humanitarian grounds.
The President has rejected the Tamil Nadu governments plea to free the prisoners on the advice of the Home Ministry. This has been conveyed to the State. The assassins of the former Prime Minister of India cannot walk free under any circumstances, a top official told The Hindu.
In February 14, following the Supreme Courts directions, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) sought details on eight grounds from the State to facilitate further its request to release the convicts. It asked the State to furnish details such as the physical and mental status of the convicts, their economic and social background and the previous cases registered against them. The convicts are V. Sriharan alias Murugan, A.G. Perarivalan, T. Suthendraraja alias Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, Ravichandran and Nalini.
On January 23, a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court gave three months to the Home Ministry to decide on Tamil Nadus proposal to remit the sentences of the life-term convicts. The Centre moved court against the States proposal, which dates back to February 19, 2014, where it said the State had decided to remit their sentences as they had already served more than 20 years in prison.
Under Section 435 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the State government has to consult the Centre before releasing prisoners who were tried by the CBI or under a central legislation.
On March 2, 2016, then T.N. Chief Secretary K. Gnanadesikan sent another communication to the MHA that it had received petitions from the convicts with requests to release them since they have spent more than 20 years in prison. The Government, after taking into consideration the petitions of the seven convicts, has decided to remit the sentences of life imprisonment as they have already served imprisonment for 24 years, Gnanadesikans letter said.

Terror attack on French nightclub thwarted
FRANCE: French Police have thwarted two terror attacks, including one at a swingers' club, sources close to the investigations said Thursday.
The prevented plots come weeks after a knifeman killed a man in Paris and as the country remains on high alert following a string of Jihadist assaults since 2015 that have claimed more than 240 lives.
One suspect, a 38-year-old radicalised convert to Islam, was arrested in the Indre region in the centre of the country.
An improvised explosive device was found at his home and the man admitted that he wanted to use it to target a swingers' club, the source told AFP.
The man, originally from the Loiret region, was charged and taken into custody on May 17 for associating with terrorist criminals and preparing an act of terrorism, a judicial source said.
Hours earlier police sources said two other men had been charged on suspicion of planning an attack in the name of the Islamic State group which may have targeted gay people.
Sources close to the probe said the men, described as friends aged 21 and 22, were arrested Saturday in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris.
Searches found two knives, a detonation system and IS propaganda material in their possession, a source said.
Their plan was still ill-defined at this stage, but there were elements to suggest they planned to attack homosexuals, one source added.
The two men, said to be unknown to security services, were charged on Tuesday by an anti-terrorism judge and detained.
Last month, Khamzat Azimov, a 20-year-old naturalised Frenchman of Chechen origin, killed one man and injured five others in the busy Opera district of the French capital on Saturday night before being shot dead by police. The Islamic State group claimed the attack.
A few days after, French authorities foiled an attack being planned by an Egyptian man, while in January a man was arrested in Gard in southern France over an alleged plot.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told parliament in March that a total of 51 planned attacks had been thwarted since January 2015, when gunman killed 12 people after storming the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. - AFP

Underworld thrown into disarray by STF
Operations conducted by the Police Organized Crimes Division and the STF resulting in the recent killing of Rumalsha Iresh Madushanka Nawagamuwa alias Baila has destabilised operations of underworld figures Makandure Madush and Angoda Lokka.
Madush is suspected to be in hiding in Dubai and Angoda Lokka is abroad, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Police Spokesman said it has been revealed that Iresh Madushankas death was a blow to Madush as he was the key figure operating Madushs underworld activities and managing his funds locally.
His death will affect the finances of Madush who had been depending on Iresh to send him funds collected from illegal drug operations in Sri Lanka. He had been operating his drug operation through the Easy Cash system.
Investigations had revealed that the bail money Rs.5 million required for the release of Rumalsha Iresh Madushanka Nawagamuwa had been sent by Makandure Madush as Iresh was his key disciple operating his drug and extortion ring.
Iresh was killed on June 9 in a shootout with the Police Special Task Force in the Wattegama area in Kandy.He had 18 cases pending against him. SP Gunasekara told the Daily News that the duo were involved in ransom and armed robberies and killings in the Ranala, Athurugiriya and Homagama areas.
Iresh Madushanka had been remanded over these cases and he appealed for bail and was granted by the Avissawella High Court on March 20.
Despite his bail conditions being that he had to appear before the Athurugiriya and Homagama Police every Saturday and Sunday respectively, he did not honour his bail conditions.
STF investigators had been receiving information regarding many of his underworld activities from another prominent underworld figure who is also a close friend of his. Police had discovered that Iresh had many concubines in various areas while his wife and four-year-old daughter lived in Imbulgoda. He had spend a major portion of his drug money to maintain these women, the police said.
A day before he was killed in the shootout with the STF, Iresh had thrown a party at his brothers home in Kandy and had got down his wife and child. Several prominent underworld figures had also attended.
They were planning several high profile robberies targeting the financial institutions in Kandy, it was revealed.
Investigations are being conducted under the instructions of the IGP Pujith Jayasundara and STF Commandant, Senior DIG M.R.Latiff and the Organised Crimes Division.

Uruguay break spell Salah watches from Egypt bench
YEKATERINBURG, Russia, Friday  Veteran coach Oscar Tabarez said Uruguay "broke the spell" after they left it late to defeat an Egypt side shorn of Mohamed Salah 1-0 in their World Cup opener on Friday.
Defender Jose Gimenez was the unlikely 89th-minute match winner for Tabarez's men, who also struck a post late on through Edinson Cavani.
Uruguay's deserved last-gasp victory leaves them and Russia in early control in Group A after the hosts' 5-0 mauling of Saudi Arabia in the tournament opener on Thursday.
But it also stops the rot for Uruguay in World Cup opening games -- the South Americans had not won their first match in the tournament since 1970.
A poor contest looked likely to end in stalemate but with Uruguay cranking up the pressure late on, Atletico Madrid's Gimenez rose to power a header into the top corner and break Egypt hearts.
Aside from Liverpool ace Salah failing to get off the bench with his shoulder injury, another major talking point was also off the pitch -- large portions of empty seats in one main stand at the Yekaterinburg Arena were an embarrassing sight for FIFA and local organisers.
That was of no concern to Tabarez, the 71-year-old known back in Uruguay simply as "Maestro".
"When the players came back from the (pre-game) warm-up normally we have a chat and we said to them, 'All of Uruguay wants the same as us -- to win this match, but you are the only ones who can make that happen.'
"This is football and in terms of history, we broke the spell.
"We either die or we are killed. We need to keep fighting to progress. This victory will help but we can't make too much of it," added Tabarez, whose side face the Saudis next.
Paris Saint-Germain striker Cavani had a couple of half-chances for Uruguay in the first half, the best made by himself when he juggled the ball and lashed it on the volley, but it was deflected over.
Attacking partner Luis Suarez -- in his first World Cup appearance since his biting ban of 2014 -- was largely quiet in an unremarkable first period, doing his best work when he drifted between the lines of Egypt's defence and midfield. One of the biggest cheers came after 30 minutes when the stadium screens showed Salah happily chatting away on the bench but that is where the birthday boy -- who turned 26 on Friday -- remained.
With Egypt coach Hector Cuper saying on the eve of the clash that Salah had recovered from the injury sustained three weeks ago in the Champions League final, Egyptians will be desperately hoping their talisman is back for the game with Russia on Tuesday, now a must-win.
Cuper said after the match that he expects Salah to feature against the hosts and, on this evidence, they badly need him.
"He did not play today because we wanted to avoid risk or danger but I think that he will be fine for the next match," said the coach.
"Yesterday we were quite certain that he would play. At the end of training he was examined in depth and there was some doubt if he fell or was hit by another player."
The north Africans, contesting their first World Cup since 1990, were for the main part fairly comfortable in defence and Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny was a constant presence at the base of Egypt's midfield.
Suarez, who had a frustrating afternoon, forced goalkeeper Mohamed Elshenawy into a decent stop straight after half-time, the Barcelona striker slamming his boot into an advertising board in anger.
He thumped the turf on 73 minutes when Elshenawy smothered at his feet, and seven minutes from the end the stopper was at it again, palming Cavani's drive over.
Cavani then rattled a post with a free-kick as Egypt held on with increasing desperation, before Gimenez's dramatic late intervention.

Veteran rugby player, 95, still scoring
There is a saying among athletes that although victory is the goal, determination is what gets you there.
Ninety-five-year-old Easton Roy -- thought to be the world's oldest amateur rugby player -- has mastered both.
A self confessed "rugby fanatic," he even cut his honeymoon short to play in a game.
But at least he scored a try.
It was only at the age of 21 that the former roofer was introduced to the sport by a friend whilst serving in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II.
"There was a Welshman there who said they were looking for rugby players," Roy told CNN Sport. "I told him I've never played it before but I would give it a go.
"I learned the rules, watched the game a few times, the only advice I was given was to just watch the ball, throw it, but don't get in front of it."
For 60 years, Roy trained with Stirling County Rugby Club before hanging up his boots at the age of 85 due to the ill health of his wife.
However, after she died, Roy started to attend weekly training sessions at the club, which helped him forge solid relationships with the team.
And to mark his 95th birthday in April, Roy ran out once again when his team were playing in a charity match.
Dubbed the "oldest winger in town," Roy attributes his athleticism to genes -- his father who was also a keen sportsman.
In his youth, the super fit grandfather of four used to pack a punch whilst boxing for the RAF, while he was also a keen judoka and won a Scottish championship at rowing in 1947. Though he won't be playing golf anytime soon.
"It was just that little ball, it got on my nerves quite a lot -- I just never had the patience for it!" Roy reveals.
His granddaughter Amy Bilsborough reminisces that Roy used to sneak off to play games without telling anyone, only finding out after seeing him in the local paper the following day. On its website Stirling County proudly records its track record "in producing a large number of age-group internationalists" such as Allister Hogg and Kenny Logan.
'THE ULTIMATE PRANKSTER'
Roy's playful nature is something his local club knows all too well.
The rugby club's photographer Bryan Robertson recalls many times where he has gone to shake Roy's hand, only to get an electric shock.
"He's the ultimate prankster -- with that mischievous smile of his its really telling of his fun character," Robertson told CNN Sport.
"He likes to have a laugh and joke around, he's never without a good story to tell."
Roy doesn't follow a secret diet, though he admits he eats "a bit too much."
"For breakfast, I eat a really big bowl of porridge, a few eggs and toast.
"I like eating vegetables too -- I grow my own in the back garden -- and I drink a lot water, but I do love a good beer!"
Roy goes to the gym every morning -- he even has one at home. He used to hose himself down with cold water in the garden as a recovery method, but now enjoys relaxing in a recently purchased hot tub.
KEEPING ACTIVE AS YOU AGE
Roy is in good company when it comes to maintaining an active mind and body during his senior years.
Mark Spencer was the oldest international rugby player when he represented Qatar in the Asian 5 Nations Competition in 2012 at 57 years old, according to the Guinness World Records. Elsewhere, at the age of 103, Parisian pianist Colette Maze has released her fourth studio album proving her hands still run smoothy across the keys.
Ernestine Shepherd has found health and happiness through weightlifting at the age of 81, while marathon runner Fauja Singh only retired from competitive racing days before his 102nd birthday, though the 107-year-old continues to run. "Running showed me the kindness and brought me back to life by making me forget all my traumas and sorrows, Singh told CNN's Human to Hero series in 2013.
As for Roy, he has no plans of retiring from the sport again.
"He always says he's retiring - but he never does," chuckles Robertson. "The next weekend he'll be back with his kit on training as normal!"  CNN

Waleboda Tamil School relocated at safer place
The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council (SPC) relocated the Waleboda Tamil School at a safe place of no landslide or natural disasters .
The Waleboda Tamil School of Balangoda has been under landslide threat for 10 years. The newly constructed school was commissioned by Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake recently.
Principal S. Sathyaraj said landslides affected the school for several occasions during the last 10 years. The school was close on rainy days since landslides. Line houses near the school were removed and relocated but no action was taken to relocate the school, the principal said.
Now the school was relocated on a two-acre land offered by the Balangoda Plantation Limited. The SPC has allocated Rs. 18 million to construct new buildings. More facilities will be provided in future, provincial sources said.

West Indies make steady progress
Sri Lankas seamers repeatedly beat the West Indies openers bats. They tested them with full deliveries and length balls, raising several lbw appeals. Eventually Kraigg Brathwaite got out, offering a feather edge to the wicketkeeper to give Kasun Rajitha his maiden Test wicket. But in the meantime, they had also scored runs - if a little slowly. By lunch on day two, West Indies were 65 for 1, only 188 runs behind Sri Lanka.
The visiting seamers will perhaps consider themselves a little unfortunate. Lahiru Kumara was menacing when he pitched just short of a length, having the ball rear up off the surface, almost as well as Shannon Gabriel had done on the first day. He had even jagged one into Brathwaite and struck him just about above the knee roll on the first ball of his second over, but because the on-field decision had beennot out, Sri Lankas review was unsuccessful - the ball projected only to clip the very top of middle stump. So disciplined had Sri Lankas quicks been, that the first boundary of West Indies innings, did not come until the 100th ball, bowled by Kumara.
Earlier in the session, Suranga Lakmal had also delivered a probing new-ball spell, but really, it was no surprise that it was Rajitha who made the breakthrough. Although on debut, he had the ball moving either way off the seam - the skill with which he piqued the national selectors interest in the first place. He seamed the ball past both openers outside edge on several occasions, before shortly before lunch, Brathwaite edged an away-seamer, which wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella pouched safely. Brathwaite reviewed, perhaps unaware that he had hit that ball, but replays suggested he had got a thin edge to the ball.
Spinner Akila Dananjaya was the most expensive of Sri Lankas bowlers, though still, he has only conceded runs at 2.83 in the innings. All up, West Indies have hit only three fours and a six in this innings, and of those, all but one boundary has come off Dananjaya. The spinner did find the occasional turn on this surface, however, suggesting he could yet become a difficult proposition as this pitch continues to wear.

Workshop on gender sensitivity for journalists
Of words, Visuals and Inclusivity, a trilingual guide on gender sensitivity and inclusivity, designed for working journalists, compiled by senior journalist Dilrukshi Handunetti was launched at the Lakshman Kadiragamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies on Wednesday.
As message multipliers, social influencers and opinion makers, it is important that journalists recognize the significance of their role in society. It is important that journalists avoid perpetuation of gender stereotypes and exclusion of persons with disability, marginalized communities and / or minorities, be they be sexual, ethno-religious or any others, Handunetti said.
She said: Every day we encounter countless examples of gender stereotypes which often do inadvertently get mainstreamed and perpetuated by the news media through poor language and image use, which contributes to continued discrimination.
As journalists, we need to understand the connection between the use of language and visuals and whether they inadvertently erase women, gay persons or those with disability by using exclusionist language or imaging that would invariably perpetuate inequalities.
She gave some tips on structuring language and visuals such as the use of neutral terms that favour neither sex, avoid using feminine suffixes, avoid words or phrases that make assumptions about gender, avoid words and phrases that make assumptions about how women think or look or how men and women behave, address men and women in similar style, describe a woman as her own self, avoid patronizing terms, use terms that can handle both sexes and replace gender specific words with gender neutral words.
The publication was supported by the USAID through the Strengthening Democratic Governance and Accountability Project (SDGAP) in Sri Lanka and Internews.
