Kingslake, Dialog and Progress joins to revolutionise App development in SL
A seminar themed 'Developing Agile Business Applications - Are You Ready' was conducted by Kingslake, Dialog and Progress recently before a large gathering of CEO's and CIO's from diverse industry segments at Waters Edge, Battaramulla.
Due to rapidly changing market conditions, business leaders face the challenge of implementing innovative strategies quickly to achieve success.
The seminar focused on modern application development to fulfill this need.
Speaking on today's agile applications S Dharmavasan, Chairman of Kingslake explained that consumers access services using a plethora of devices, with an 'I want it now!' mentality.
Striving to meet such targets, businesses need to adapt and evolve with the current environment by iterating their customer facing software applications on a daily basis.
As such, business leaders need to understand that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work.
To stay ahead of competition businesses need to develop high quality software by embracing agile application development.
As agile processes are highly collaborative, iterative and focused on rapid and repeatable delivery of software, the benefits of "going agile" far outweigh the costs.
Further elaborating on this Benjamin Wong, Channels Director APJ, Progress, spoke on how Progress enables businesses to rapidly develop and deliver applications that deliver customer value with its portfolio of technology solutions for application development and deployment, PaaS, Business Rules Management (BRMS), content management and digital experience and data connectivity and integration.
Kingslake's CTO Damian Fernando gave the audience an in-depth insight into building apps on many different agile development platforms.
SmartApps.lk, a cloud-based platform enables Rapid Application Development (RAD) and deployment of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications accessible from both mobile and web (www.smartapps.lk).
Venura Mendis, General Manager Products and Service Innovation - Dialog Axiata expressed his views on Dialog's role in the AppDev Ecosystem in Sri Lanka with Ideamart, the next generation of smart applications and how Dialog engages with the wider community to drive innovation.

Lanka Hospitals share transaction
Two high profile businessmen and a former senior state official are now in hot water as the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) has concluded initial investigations into a large-scale financial fraud alleged to have taken place at Lanka Hospitals.
"We have forwarded our findings to the Attorney General's Department.
Our future course of action will be based on the recommendations of the Attorney General.
The suspects will be arrested and prosecuted after instructions from the Attorney General's Department," an authoritative Police source told the Daily News yesterday.
The Police FCID received a complaint that a large-scale financial fraud had taken place when the shares of Lanka Hospital were sold to an Indian Company. Allegations of stock market manipulation were leveled against the two businessmen who had a strong presence in a wide range of businesses.
The investigation into the shares of Lanka Hospitals was based on a complaint lodged by Dr. Neomal Alexander Perera, a cancer specialist attached to the same institution.
The FCID also carried out several investigations into a number of irregularities that had taken place at the CSE between 2009 and 2014, including insider trading and market manipulation.
The Police unit recorded lengthy statements from several businessmen and senior government officials as part of the investigations.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, Police sources said on Friday that the FCID was to arrest Nalaka Godahewa, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under charges pertaining to financial irregularities.
Godahewa was the Chairman of the SEC during the period under question.
It was later learnt that Godahewa, on Saturday, informed the Police through his lawyers that he would appear before the FCID soon.
As part of the same investigation involving Godahewa, two individuals, namely Dhammika Perera and Ronnie Ibrahim were arrested under instructions from the Attorney General.
Perera served as the Deputy Director General of the SEC from September 2012.
Ibrahim, a businessman by profession, was affiliated with the Carlton Sports Club initiated by the sons of former President Rajapaksa.

Madisha Silva leads them to maiden triumph in Gulf Men's Open
Lanka Lions create history at Dubai Rugby Sevens
Lanka Lions created history at the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens Rugby tournament by winning the Gulf Men's Open title for the first time defeating Heartbeat Sports Tigers 33-21 in a pulsating final.
Skipper Madisha Silva began scripting their triumph with a superb blindside dash from a scrum on the halfway line. Lanka Lions top scorer Amin Jamail virtually sealed victory with a brilliant try inside two minutes by jinxing his way through.
"I knew the game would be decided in first two minutes itself. Our strategy was very simple. We knew they were a heavy side. Anyway, we were going to attack from the corners. We scored two quick tries. We knew that they (Tigers) were not able to come back from there though it (match) opened out after," said Lanka Lions coach Richard Murcott.
"I'm proud to be coaching this team. It was a long time coming after so many years," he said.
The Tigers rallied furiously forcing a litany of errors from the Lankan side who defended grimly but could not prevent their heavier opponents barging over to close the gap 7-14.
However, the Lankans went into the break with a 21-7 cushion after Dulanka Gunasekera pounced on a loose ball and raced across over 50 metres for a magnificent try.
Fijian forward Vito crashed over the line just 30 seconds after the turn around for an unconverted try while Gayashan Wijayasinghe carried the ball over after a perfect switch with Gunasekera who made the initial break to extend their lead 33-7.
The Tigers scored a corner flag try and helped themselves to another when Lanka Lions were down to six players in the final minute of the game for sin-bin offence.
However, the result seemed almost inevitable as Lankan side sealed a perfect campaign by claiming their first major trophy at the Dubai Sevens since winning the Khanjar Trophy in 2008.
"We made history in Dubai Sevens and for Lanka Lions," said Madisha Silva, a former Peterite Sevens captain, overwhelmed with emotion after leading his side to victory.
Having swept all before them in the pool stages, the Lions secured the place in the final by defeating Kuwait Scorpions 27-12 in the semifinals earlier in the day.
Fijian playmaker Tavite scored a brace before Jamail produced an explosive 70-metre run to give them a 17-0 lead the break.
Madisha darted across soon after the turn around to touch down in the corner while Vito added another to make it 27-0 before the Lions leaked two tries late in the game.
Former Sri Lanka Youth player Jamail was the star performer for the Lankan side scoring tries with his dazzling pace and catching the opposition flat footed with his stepping and dancing skills.
"I'm happy we created history. I am going to stop for the day. No more rugby for me," said former Sri Lanka great Roger Rodrigo, 51, who played for a record 27th time at the Dubai Rugby Sevens after turning out for the Lanka Lions Veterans who lost in the Gulf Vets Plate semifinal.
Tavite attributed teamwork for the success of Lanka Lions.
"Boys just put it together.No one did it on their own. Everyone helped each other out. They've been training really hard for the past two months," said the Fijian star.
Lanka Lions rugby chairman Azarath Deen said: "They trained as a team,as one unit.With the two Fijians, it really helped and Madisha's leadership made it excellent. That sealed it (title). We all knew we had opportunity to win the cup, that's why we went for it."
Former Lanka Lions captain Achala Silva said the players were united in their goal.
"Morale was so high they wanted to win the tournament.
They had the right attitude and they trained for six months," said Achala, 37, who has been representing Lanka Lions since 2000.
"The fact is the team has been disciplined. They play for each other. They play for the pride of the country," said Murcott.
The champion Lanka Lions squad comprised Madisha Silva (captain), Ameen Jamail (Vice Captain), Mohamed Rilwan, Dulanka Gunasekara, Akalanka Dabare, Anura Perera, Philip Asinghearachchige, Tuan Zalique Jayah, Vito Tuivione, Hilmy 'Bebo' Mohammed, Ranato Tavite, Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Kelaniyangoda and Asif Akram.
A Lankan rugby fan who flew down from Colombo for this tournament Ayub Muthaliph was elated.
"I'm very happy that Lanka Lions performed very well. I came all the way from Sri Lanka to see them. They did a marvellous job. I'm very happy for the Sri Lankan boys. I think they are playing better rugby than Sri Lanka Sevens team," he said.
Dubai-based former Sri Lanka cricketer Ajith Weerakkody felt some of the Lanka Lions players were as good as the national team.
"There are guys who deserve to play for Sri Lanka.At least they play for Lanka Lions. They are very united and play as a team. That is most important. They always have the talent but this time they really played," he said.
Lanka Lions were also boosted by the presence of Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union president Asanga Seneviratne at the Dubai Sevens.
"Personally I'm very proud because the former president of the SLRFU was also with us.Asanga has personally nurtured me along with Ana Saranapala. He is somebody who has been supportive of me and my talents. His talk to boys gave me a little boost that I needed," said Murcott.

## Title: In Love With Theater

In Love With Theater
One of Sri Lanka's great entertainers Indu Dharmasene uttered his most famous words when 'Aunty Netta' (played by Nimmi Harasgama) asked him 'Do you prefer to be called a dramatist' - his response: "I am just Indu." Those four words show his inimitable humor, simplicity and humility. Having written 63 plays, for Dharmasene, 59, talent is like a polished diamond.
Dharmasene showed great promise at a young age and all his teachers sensed his potential for greatness in theatre.
"I acted in nursery and school concerts when I was very young. The first play in which I acted in a main role was also written and directed by me when I was twelve years old. Yoland Abeyweera was my guru and I learnt acting techniques and stagecraft from her.
She encouraged me to write and direct plays and always supported me. She was a great lady. In fact she and the teachers in charge of our school Sinhala Literary Society encouraged me to write plays," said Dharmasene.
Indu can be inspired anywhere and in any way. His muse is everywhere - while watching T.V while seated in the company of others at the dinner table. "Society inspires me, I observe people around me. I keep my eyes and ears open all the time."
Dharmasene's pen has spawned some of the finest pieces of literature that Sri Lankan society has ever seen. Not for him is melancholy. He likes to elevate people into a 'feel good' mood.
"I actually think of myself as more of an entertainer than a writer. Theatre/drama is subjective. It is not possible to cater to everyone. The people who come for my plays come to relax and laugh. So I focus on entertaining the audience.
I prefer comedy. So I have not written any tragedies. Having said that, some of my plays have a serious theme even though it has a happy ending. The only tragedies I have directed are Shakespeare plays. The Tommiya series is a very popular comedy. And the cast and I have a lot of fun doing them."
It seems that the most talented playwrights tread the path of political satire, one of the most famous being the Greek playwright Aristophanes. Dharmasene is not new to the field of political satire. "I have done a couple of political satires. In 1997 I did 'A Real Change'. Then this year, 'Maru Palanaya'".
English playwright and actor Ray Cooney is one of Dharmasene's favorites. A seasoned campaigner, Indu knows the business inside out. His spectrum of talent certainly beguiles the mind.
"I have acted in all my plays as well as a few Musicals, a couple of Ray Cooney plays, some of E.C.B. & Lanerole plays. All in all, maybe about eighty plays. This is not taking into account the roles I have played in short plays staged at special events."
Dharmasene is a multi -tasker. He directed the musical 'Camelot' and acted the role of King Arthur and successfully pulled off one of the most difficult projects in his career. The fact that he was the very image of the knight in shining armor is testimony to the fact that Dharmasene has huge mental faculties.
"The musical 'Camelot' is my favorite. I really enjoyed playing the role of King Arthur."
An accomplished and experienced thespian Dharmasene is able to bring the best out of his cast. "As a Director I want my cast to be comfortable playing the role. So I don't insist on them coming out of their comfort zone. If the Director thinks I can do justice to the role, I have no problem playing any role."
Dharmasene feels that the whole theatre scenario needs to be upgraded and that affordable state of the art theatres will help more people to do productions and to further improve production values. "Theatre going public is rather small in Sri Lanka compared to the West. As a result a career in theatre is not considered lucrative. So there is talent in abundance but not many professionals."
The Tommiya Series shows Indu's greatest strength which is his humor, the prized weapon in his arsenal.
"The Tommiya series started as a skit which was performed at a coffee evening. Then the first in the series, 'Madai Ithin Dubai Giya' was well received and the characters became popular. I was asked to write more about them. Some of my friends say that the character 'Tommy' is my alter ego. I have a couple of plays as well as skits based on Mr. Gajasiri."
It seems that Dharmasene's ambitions are not limited to the stage as he is also thinking about doing a TV series. Those are things in the future but right now it is plays and more plays!
"Next production is going to be a Ray Cooney, a playwright who has had an impact on my work other than Shakespeare. I am also thinking of doing one of my very first plays next year. I feel that it would also be nice if more people would support local or original productions."
Someone once said: 'Do what you love doing best. Because if you do that you will succeed in life'. Indu has come a long way. His journey from the time when he was a twelve year old youngster to who he is now, is nothing short of astounding. He has fallen in love with theatre.
"I simply love theatre! I enjoy every aspect of it."

No indication California attackers 'part of organized group': White House
US: There is no indication that the shooters who killed 14 people in California are part of a larger terrorist group, the White House said Saturday, even as the Islamic State group claimed the pair were "soldiers" of its caliphate.
A team of top officials including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson told President Barack Obama "that they had as of yet uncovered no indication the killers were part of an organized group or formed part of a broader terrorist cell."
However the president's team, which also included other intelligence community leadership, "highlighted several pieces of information that point to the perpetrators being radicalized to violence to commit these heinous attacks."
Wednesday's rampage in San Bernardino, which also wounded 21 people, was carried out by Syed Farook, 28, and his 29-year-old wife Tashfeen Malik.
They were killed in a shootout with police hours after the attack.
The FBI said Saturday it was working in coordination with local authorities to pursue "any and all leads" in its investigation, the White House said.
The president was briefed on the latest details and directed his team to take all necessary steps to protect Americans, it added.
The FBI has already announced that it is treating the investigation into the attack as an act of terrorism.
In its English-language radio broadcast Saturday, IS stopped short of explicitly claiming the attack but referred to the assailants as soldiers of the Khilafah (caliphate) who were "killed in the path of Allah."
In the group's Arabic-language radio broadcast earlier in the day, however, they referred to the attackers simply as "supporters of the Islamic State."- AFP

One of the world's most iconic toy stores is shutting down
Toys R Us has a Ferris wheel in its flagship location.
Toys R Us is closing its iconic flagship store in New York City's Times Square at the end of this month.
The retailer is not renewing its lease on the 110,000-square-foot store, which features a giant indoor Ferris wheel, a life-size Barbie dollhouse, and a 20-foot Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur, Toys R Us spokeswoman Alyssa Peera told Business Insider.
The store will officially close on December 30.
"It is certainly bittersweet," Toys R Us CEO Dave Brandon told CNN Money, referring to the rush of shoppers in the store for the final Black Friday at the Times Square location.
Toys R Us also recently closed the iconic FAO Schwarz flagship store, citing rising rent costs.
The FAO Schwarz store, known for its giant toy piano, was a major tourist destination made famous by the 1988 movie "Big," starring Tom Hanks.
The closure left the 153-year-old brand without a physical store, though FAO Schwarz-branded products are still sold at Toys R us.
The Toys R Us flagship in Times Square opened in 2001.
A company spokeswoman told Business Insider that Toys R Us is searching for another space for a flagship store in Manhattan.
"We continue to explore alternative locations in the area," Peera said. "This process is ongoing." Yahoo

Police probe 'terrorist' London Tube stabbings
UK: A man was being held in custody Sunday after three people were stabbed at a London Underground train station in an attack police were treating as a "terrorist incident".
One eyewitness shouted "You're no Muslim" at the suspect as he was pinned down by police officers at the suburban Leytonstone station, amateur video footage showed, while a pool of blood was seen in the ticket hall.
Sky News reported that eyewitnesses had said the lone suspect spoke of Syria and had "apparently shouted 'this is for Syria'," though no witnesses were quoted.
Police could not confirm this when contacted by AFP and it is not evident from video footage circulating online.
The attack Saturday came at the end of a week in which the British parliament voted to extend air strikes on the Islamic State jihadist group (IS) from Iraq into Syria.
The stabbings also come less than a month after the November 13 jihadist rampage in Paris, claimed by IS, which killed 130 people. London police said one man sustained serious knife injuries in the east London attack, but they were not thought to be life-threatening, while two others sustained minor injuries.
Britain's Counter-Terrorism Command is investigating.
"We are treating this as a terrorist incident," CTC leader Commander Richard Walton said in a statement.
Amateur video showed a pool of blood and bloody footprints at the Tube station ticket gates. Shouts are heard as the suspect is seen remonstrating with people before swinging at one of them.
Some Tube-users continued on their way while others hurried from the scene.
Footage shows officers shouting "Drop the knife!" and firing Taser electric stun guns, one of which connects. "Who is this idiot" one onlooker said of the suspect, adding: "Yes! Stupid idiot," after the man is Tasered.
Officers shout "Put the knife down!" and "Drop it now!" at the stunned man, who did drop the short-bladed knife as he quivered on the ground.
On his front, the man was handcuffed behind his back while another officer pinned him down with his knee and passers-by were told to get back.
One man at the scene then shouted at the suspect: "You ain't no Muslim, bruv! You're no Muslim, bruv! You ain't no Muslim!"
Eyewitness Khayam told the BBC that when the suspect was taken to a police van, "I saw pedestrians shouting at him... one pedestrian tried to throw a bottle."
He said one victim was taken out on a vertical stretcher. - AFP

Queen Elizabeth Drives Her Jaguar Wherever She Pleases
It must be very good to be the Queen. You have an army at your disposal, wear a diamond crown, and can ignore the rules of the road on a whim. Queen Elizabeth proved that last one recently when she took her Jaguar onto the grass to pass a family in the park who was moving too slowly for her liking.
According to BestRide, the incident happened on the Long Walk at Windsor Great Park. This is a place where the public isn't permitted to drive. Only the park's rangers and the Queen can take a car into the park.
This is where she encountered Scarlett Vincent and Toby Core who were walking along enjoying the day with their son Tedddy. That's when they noticed an older woman trying to drive around them in her Jaguar X-Type Estate. The pair were surprised to find that the woman was their Queen.
They were understandably caught off guard and couldn't help pointing as she drove right past them on the grass. The Queen graced them with the royal wave and a smile as she continued on her way. It's good to be the Queen. Yahoo

Real life Scooby-Doo Great Dane is scared of his own shadow
Standing 3ft tall and weighing more than 13stone, Presley the Great Dane should have other dogs cowering in fear at his size.
But Presley is a real-life Scooby-Doo who hides timidly behind his owner Sian Barratt when smaller dogs approach him.
Following our story last week, he captured the hearts of fans across the world, with Sian even receiving messages from the US.
So we went along to meet Presley to see if he really is a scaredy cat, or rather, dog.
The problem becomes immediately clear when we arrive at Sian's detached house in Oldbury, West Mids.
Presley has not one but four mums - two doggy, two human - making him the baby of the family.
He lives in the specially converted garage with mum Echo (six) and Gran Daisy (eight) and is also mothered by Sian (47) and her daughter Levi (23).
Presley has his own comfort blanket that he carries around the house, and snuggles up next to Sian on the sofa at night.
Dog breeder Sian says: "We definitely baby him. I've had him since birth and as soon as he was born there was something about him - we knew we were going to keep him. Levi adores him, and he adores her." But it isn't just Levi who Presley loves - he follows Sian around the house like a little, or rather, big lapdog.
"He wants to be with me all the time," she says. "He's not allowed upstairs and if I go up he cries. It is like having a toddler."
Sian lets him out of his garage suite and he nervously pops his head around the living room door. Following reassurance from her, he trots in. I have seen smaller ponies.
But Presley is obviously a people dog - soon he is poking his big jowls in my face and wagging his tail at the attention.
"Be careful of his tail," warns Sian. "I once ended up with a black eye when he accidentally wagged it in my face."
We try to set off for a walk, but it is raining - and Presley is scared of the rain.
Sian tries to coax him out the front door, offering him a brolly. But it is no good, Presley isn't having any of it.
Even simple chores can be a problem. As he is glued to Sian's side most of the time she has to pick her moment even to empty the bins.
She explains: "He doesn't like bin liners." She gets one out and Presley darts out of the room.
He also isn't keen on having his claws clipped. As soon as the clippers appear, Presley gives her a look as if to say: "You aren't coming near me with those."
Let's see how he fares with TV's Mr Nasty, Simon Cowell. The X Factor supremo has reduced many contestants to tears, but this time Presley just wags his tail, perhaps sensing that Simon is a real animal lover. Sian explains: "It's not the big things that faze Presley - it is random things that scare him. The other night I lit some candles and he wouldn't go near them.
"I used to keep my exercise bike behind the living room door, but Presley wouldn't come in the room. When I take him out, people cross the road. But he is just a gentle giant."
Fed on a diet of raw chicken carcasses and tripe, he is pure muscle. A lean, mean, machine. Well, not so mean.
"He's a lover not a fighter," says Sian. "I was in the park with him and two West Highland terriers ran up. He ran off. When I take all three dogs out, Daisy and Echo protect him. His mum doesn't like other dogs coming up to him."
But Presley is no longer a baby. He turns three in January on the birthday of his namesake Elvis Presley.
And while he may have gained fans, there are others who have criticised his nature. Sian says: "I've had loads of wonderful messages, but some people have said I shouldn't have such a big dog if I can't train him, or I don't socialise him or he needs to see a behaviourist. "He doesn't need that at all. He isn't generally anxious, he is just a lovely natured dog with a few quirks."
Levi adds: "He just has a timid nature. The other night he was going to sleep on the sofa and I went to say good night and he nearly jumped out of his skin." Someone walks in front of Sian's house and Presley leaps forward barking - then thinks twice about such bravado and jumps back nervously.
This barking dog never bites.

Sandra Bullock Adopts 3-Year-Old Girl
The 51-year-old actress revealed in a cover story for People magazine on Wednesday that she adopted Laila (pronounced Lila). "When I look at Laila, there's no doubt in my mind that she was supposed to be here," Bullock told the magazine. "I can tell you absolutely, the exact right children came to me at the exact right time."
In 2010, Bullock adopted her 5-year-old son Louis and says that her son was a big part of why she wanted a second child. "Louis spearheaded this whole journey," she said. "I knew Laila was scared, and all I wanted was for her to know Louis and I weren't going anywhere."
Bullock's other leading man, Bryan Randall, also took part in her big reveal. The actress' boyfriend, who's a Los Angeles-based photographer, snapped the family photos for the publication.
"My family is blended and diverse, nutty, and loving and understanding," she gushed. "That's a family."
Reports that Bullock had adopted a second child began to surface a few months ago. In October, a source told ET that there had been sightings of the Oscar winner out and about with a toddler.
"Unbeknownst to me, a photographer had followed us and taken a photo of us in line," Bullock told People. "The next day, I learned that a photo of her was being shopped around for sale to every outlet around the world. I had promised and legally agreed to protect her from something like this, and here I was chasing down lawyers - having them, begging them to keep her safe."
"You feel it's very much like witness protection," Bullock added.
One thing's for certain, the actress loves being a mom. When ET caught up with Bullock at the Minions premiere in June, she stressed just how much she adores her little Louis. "I mean, like people go, 'Your adopted son,'" she told Kevin Frazier. "I go, 'Please don't say that. He is my son!' I would give my life for him."

South African blockathon - 72/2 off 72 overs
NEW DELHI, Sunday: South Africa fought on Sunday to try to save the fourth and final Test after Ajinkya Rahane scored his second century of the match to give India control on the second-last day.
Chasing a highly improbable target of 481, South Africa stonewalled the opposition with some defensive batting, scoring at just a run an over on a slow strip at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground in New Delhi.
At stumps on the fourth day, the Proteas were 72-2 off 72 overs with skipper Hashim Amla on 23 off 207 balls and AB de Villiers unbeaten on a 91-ball 11.
The top-ranked tourists, who have already lost the series 2-0, will need to bat out three full sessions on Monday to snatch a draw and salvage some pride.
A 300-plus target has been chased successfully just once in a Test match on Indian soil -- by the home team which made 387-4 to defeat England in Chennai in 2008.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the highest wicket-taker in the series with 28 scalps so far, took 2-29 but the other bowlers were denied any success.
Amla, who has had a miserable tour, resorted to dead-batting for most of his innings, managing his first run only after facing 46 balls.
The usually flamboyant de Villiers, who has the distinction of scoring the fastest ODI century, also curbed his natural attacking instincts.
- 'Time is the key' -"We did sit down to discuss the game plan. We decided blocking was the best way forward," said opener Temba Bavuma, who made 34 before losing his off-stump to Ashwin.
"It's not so much the runs, it's the time that's the key. It would be a tough task to bat out 90 overs tomorrow as the wicket is deteriorating.
"But we have the experience with batsmen like Amla and de Villiers out there in the middle."
In a low-scoring series where no batsman had previously managed to score a hundred, Rahane hit his second ton of the match to help the hosts declare their second innings on 267-5 half an hour before lunch.
He smashed three sixes and eight fours in his unbeaten 100-run knock and shared a 154-run partnership with captain Virat Kohli (88), the highest of the series. AFP

SriLankan Airlines to bring back 120 pilgrims
SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka have arranged a special flight to bring back a group of 120 pilgrims who were stranded in the Buddhist holy city of Bodh Gaya (Buddha Gaya) by the floods that have ravaged parts of India. The elderly pilgrims are being sheltered by the Prelate of the Buddhist Vihara in Gaya.
Bodh Gaya draws hundreds of thousands of Buddhist pilgrims each year, including large numbers from Sri Lanka. The pilgrims had been scheduled to travel by road to Chennai and fly to Colombo, but flooding shut down the Chennai airport, leaving them stranded in Bodh Gaya.
Captain Suren Ratwatte, CEO of SriLankan Airlines, said, "Once again, SriLankan Airlines is responding rapidly to an urgent appeal and fulfilling our duty as the national carrier. Initially we tried to reroute these passengers through Calcutta, but given the situation and the stress these senior citizens are under, we thought it best to operate a special flight direct to Gaya. In the coming days we will expedite the repatriation of other pilgrim groups who are in Southern India as well, using special flights if required. This is an unprecedented national emergency that we must respond to."
The Airbus A320 aircraft flown by budget carrier Mihin Lanka is scheduled to arrive in Bodh Gaya on the morning of Sunday, 6th December, and return to Colombo in the afternoon, with the flight expected to take 3 1/2 hours.
Keeping to its famed standards for hospitality, SriLankan has gone to the extent of arranging special vegetarian meals as the passengers are Buddhist pilgrims. Apart from a full complement of cabin crew, several officials from the airline's offices in Colombo would be on board to assist the pilgrims.
SriLankan's Flight Operations Department has arranged the necessary permits and overflying clearances rapidly given the nature of the situation.
High Commissioner Esala Weerakoon has coordinated matters regarding the pilgrims with the vihare in Gaya where the pilgrims found shelter, and authorities in Bodh Gaya.

SriLankan to review aircraft order
SriLankan Airlines is on track to set up an Airline Maintenance and Repair Centre (MRO) with an Asian based airline counterpart at the Mattala airport, said the airline new CEO, Suren Ratwatte.
He told Daily News Business that earlier negotiations with Lufthansa Techink a German company is no longer in progress since they have abandoned plans for Sri Lanka and set up a centre in Manila. Our talks with the Asian counterpart is progressing well, he said.
Ratwatte said that they see tremendous business opportunities ahead for a MRO and it would bring additional revenue to the airline.
Commenting on the re-fleeting of the airline, he said that it was a good move to retire aging aircraft.
However we must re look at the aircraft order. Since the order is for wide bodied aircraft that could carry more passengers. What SriLankan currently needs is narrow bodied aircraft, that could be easily filled with passengers.
He also justified the move to abandon the stop over flights to Mattala airport. I think that is a waste of money and it was a step taken in the right direction. We dont have an immediate plan to resume flights there, he said.
Commenting on the creation of Mihin Lanka he said that Sri Lanka could have done without it. However since it is now up and running we will relook at addressing the minus issues of the airline.
He also said that the partly closer of the Colombo airport for runway relay has also put additional financial pressure on them since they have to reschedule timings. Ratwatte who has being appointed to the Tourism Development Authority advisory board said that he is working closely with them.
A plan to operate flights to Maldives second international airport, Gan, was also disclosed.
It was pointed out that there were several high-end resorts that need better air connectivity and SriLankan could get in there from Colombo.
A former pilot with Emirates Ratwatte, when asked if Emirates is offered aviation fuel at concessionary rates when purchasing aviation fuel he said Emirates does have a bigger fleet and due to this their bargaining power is high.
However I must say that the price of aviation fuel in Colombo International Airport is very high but it is cheaper in Mattala because of concessions offered to attract airlines,Ratwatte added.

Thajudeen's family to go before NPC
Former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen's family will go before the National Police Commission (NPC) seeking action against Police officers who made 'false reports' dubbing the rugby player's death as an accident.
A source close to the Thajudeen family said their lawyers would meet NPC members this week to discuss the matter.
The family will lodge complaints against the former OIC of the Narahenpita Police station and several senior Police officers who handled investigations into Thajudeen's case, three years ago.
They would also seek action against a retired Senior DIG who had strong links with the top-notch members of the previous government, for allegedly manipulating the Police investigation.
A lawyer looking after the interests of the Thajudeen family told the Daily News yesterday that the Narahenpita Police had created false report to deliberately mislead the public on the cause of the rugby player's death. The JMO report on Thajudeen's death presented to court last week, concluded that Thajudeen was not in the vehicle when the alleged 'accident' took place. It says there is evidence to believe that an 'accident-scene' was set up and Thajudeen's body was put into the vehicle.
The fractures, according to the report, could only be seen in upper and lower parts of the bones. Therefore, the report concludes that such fractures cannot happen as a result of a fatal accident.
The medical experts who prepared the report have opined that such damages to bones can only be caused by an assault with a blunt weapon.
The report says the bone below Thajudeen's left knee was also broken as a result of an assault. It also referred to a blow to his head that left him unconscious during the attack. Medical experts also state that it is impossible to believe that the injuries to his neck and chest were caused during an accident, as the position of the steering wheel did not suggest anything of that nature.
Their report said it was possible to speculate that the injuries were caused during an attack. The report also refers to a bleeding injury below his neck.
According to the findings of the CID, Thajudeen's body was not in the front seat of the vehicle. It was recovered from the adjacent front seat of the partially burnt vehicle.

Theater Inside A Moving Bus
Mind Adventures, an experimental theatre company based in Colombo, has been known for breaking local drama convention, especially since the production Paraya. Towards the latter part of 2014, they collaborated with British theatre company Look Left Look Right to bring us more interactive in-your-face theatre - and this time they did it on a bus ride.
We were invited for a scratch of the actual show - it took place at the British Council on a Friday evening. We gathered upstairs just outside the library, waiting for the show to start.
A girl walked in among us, unnoticed, yelling on her phone about a bus that was late. In a few minutes she pulled out a megaphone and promptly directed us to follow her to our bus ride (which we hadn't a clue about at the time).That's the thing about Mind Adventures' promenade theatre style - you never know who among you is an actor and who isn't, because the line between the actors and the audience is blurred. And all the world literally becomes a stage.
We followed her to British Council's exit gate, where a young bus conductor (an actor) awaited us in front of a big red Ashok Leyland bus. He greeted us in comical fashion and asked us to get on board. Where was this going We excitedly boarded and I thought it was just for show and we wouldn't really move - but we did. We were seated and given little hand-fans, and tickets that said Route 110: a bus route that doesn't exist in Colombo.
The bus conductor was chatty and made us laugh, and later on in the performance (which took place entirely on the bus!) his role changed from conductor to waiter to market hawker, much like the shape-shifting sutradhar or jester of modern experimental Indian plays. The bus went round the neighborhood - and might have even gone further - I'm not sure, because of the rain and disorienting bus and traffic lights.
One by one, the characters of the play emerged. One from the seat in front of me, the other from the back seat, a few even stepped into the bus at bus-stops. The bus would hit the brakes every time they spoke, and started up again when they were done (the bus lights flickered as it did, an unintentional prompt for a scene change). The characters loved, they fretted, they laughed - and the bus was instantly transformed into a restaurant, or a market place, with just a change of music or a prop. The characters - who were just mothers, colleagues, lovers - were inches away from each of us, some of them spoke to us about their problems, and asked us questions. They were real.
There was no resolution at the end of the bus ride, neither did we know what would happen next (a lot like real life itself) - we all just got off the bus. I don't remember ever paying this much attention to a theatrical performance before - with the bus music, the traffic noise, the lights outside, and the fact that somebody in a moving bus was telling us a story, we couldn't help but strain to listen to every word.
Tracy Holsinger, one of the directors of this soon-to-be production, explained this style of theatre as an attempt to make people recognize that drama is reality, a sentiment shared by modern playwrights like Genet and Artaud. Instead of sitting in a cushy seat at Lionel Wendt, separated from the actors on a stage in front of you, this theatre pushes you into the script, or maybe pushes the script into your own life - and suddenly, the issues in the performance, become personal and more meaningful. Mind Adventures has also had a few recent productions - Act Before You Think and A Play In A Day this month, both again at the British Council, featuring unconventional stage rules, and close interaction between audience and actors. With productions like these that challenge the status quo of local theater, it's an exciting era for drama enthusiasts in Colombo, and for dramatists too, who can now choose to use new methods to deliver their message better, to a more alive, rapt audience.

Union Assurance launches CSR brand
A brand designed to raise awareness on the various health issues that are plaguing our nation has been launched as part of Union Assurance Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
The brand, entitled 'Union Manushyathwaya,' was launched on December 2 with the ultimate aim of creating healthy and happy communities around the country. The company achieves this objective by disseminating vital information to the public regarding how to protect themselves from diseases such as Thalassemia, Dengue, and Diabetes.
Accordingly, the company has arranged a series of diabetes camps to be conducted in Colombo, Jaffna, Vavunia, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Batticoloa, and Matara between December 7 to 14. An island-wide leaflet distribution campaign will also be conducted during this period to raise awareness regarding Thalassemia and Dengue.
"We have already received an enormous amount of support for our CSR initiatives from the communities we interact with. We intend to further expand our efforts under a unifying name and logo, which clearly expresses our intent and end goal," stated Director and Chief Executive Officer of Union Assurance, Dirk Pereira. Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni, Chief Medical Officer of Health, of the Public Health Department of the Colombo Municipal Council added, "with the expansion of society and its increasing complexity, we have been able to observe many diseases spreading more rapidly than ever before. However, with proper information many of these diseases can be prevented. We appreciate the efforts that Union Assurance has taken to bring this vital information to the public."
"The best way to avoid Thalassemia is to raise awareness. We have been receiving the support of Union Assurance to spread information and awareness about this disease for quite some time now. I believe that under the new banner of 'Union Manushyathwaya,, these efforts will expand and continue to make a positive impact on communities," Dr. Nilam, Child Specialist of the National Thalassemia Centre, contributed.
Union Assurance Life's expressed goal of creating healthier and secure communities is in line with their overall ethos of building partnerships with their customers that is based on the delivery of transparency, respectfulness, and convenience.

Unity Plaza computer dealers raided and pirated software seized
Computers dealers at Unity Plaza, Bambalapitiya were caught by Enforcement Officers from the Colombo Crimes Division ("CCD") for selling notebook computers (or PCs) installed with suspected pirated software to innocent and unsuspecting consumers.
The raids were carried out under the direction of DIG Colombo; Gamini Mathurata; Director CCD; ASP Nuwan Vedasingha and Chief Inspector of CCD; Mewan Silva with IP Ranasinghe, IP Deepal and IP S. I. Pieris and team executing the raids.
ASP Ruwan Gunasekera; Media Spokesmen for the Sri Lanka Police said "Raids of this nature are not a daily occurrence in our country but it does not in any way mean that enforcement officers are not vigilant against acts of software piracy in the PC retail market. In fact, this multiple raid at Unity Plaza should act as a reminder to everyone that they are constantly under watch. Computer dealers have a responsibility to their customers, many of who are ordinary consumers that are not IT-savvy.
These raids are not only necessary to protect the interest of unsuspecting consumers who would have ended up being cheated by these unscrupulous businesses with illegal content, but also to safeguard consumers from the looming risk of cyber-attacks and digital risk.
According to a study conducted by IDC-NUS in 2014, it was found that 61% of news PCs sold with pirated software come infected with malware. The malware included viruses, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, and unwanted Adware, which had pre-infected the new PCs before they could even access the Internet. There were other problems as well, such as misleading applications, corrupted executables, exploits, and system vulnerabilities.
"Consumers buying a new computer simply want their PCs to function in a safe manner. A PC with pirated software and possible malware puts families, children at risk.
For the computer dealers caught in this weekend's raids, this will definitely be a hard taught lesson as they and their companies will be charged under the Intellectual Property Rights Act No. 36 of 2003 which carries heavy fines and jail sentences if they are found guilty of any copyright infringements, in a court of law" added ASP Gunasekera.
The Media Spokesman reaffirmed the government's continued commitment to intellectual property rights protection and warned businesses against flouting the law. He furthered, "The copyright laws in Sri Lanka are very comprehensive, carrying both criminal as well as civil offenses. Any business found guilty of possessing, other than for private and domestic use, infringing copies of computer programs, the company and its director/s will be held liable.
The actions of computer dealers installing pirated software may also directly contribute to an increase in cyber security incidents in the country, as cyber criminals have become more sophisticated in their attempts to infiltrate computer systems; one method of inserting malware into computers is by planting them in pirated software. As part of the investigations, technical experts will also examine the computers seized for embedded malware and botnets".
Sudath Perera, leading counsel on intellectual property rights protection and legal Representative for many global brands said, "it is vital that the intellectual property rights of brand owners are protected to attract potential investors and international brands to invest in Sri Lanka, whilst consumer protection is of paramount importance today in the context of cyber security and online safety."
The Media Spokesman said, "We urge consumers to be vigilant against unethical computer dealers who offer a deal too good to be true. The risks to consumers and businesses are real, as it is no longer just about respecting creative rights of others anymore, it is also about your own privacy and safety. Say no to piracy and insist on a true computing experience that can only be delivered with genuine and updated software and safe online practices," he added.

## Title: Weight gain between pregnancies linked to stillbirths and infant deaths

Weight gain between pregnancies linked to stillbirths and infant deaths
Women who put on weight after their first pregnancy are more likely to have a stillborn second child or a baby who dies within the year than those whose weight remains stable, new research shows.
A study carried out in Sweden confirms that the increased risk of the baby's death in the womb or within its first year of life is real in women who put on even a modest amount of weight - about 6kg (13lb) - between pregnancies. It affects all women, not just those who are overweight or obese when they get pregnant for the first time.
"The public health implications are profound," said the study's co-author Prof Sven Cnattingius from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. "Around a fifth of women in our study gained enough weight between pregnancies to increase their risk of stillbirth by 30-50%, and their likelihood of giving birth to babies who die in infancy increased by 27-60%, if they had a healthy weight during their first pregnancy."
Because infant death and stillbirth are relatively rare, the increased risk does not equate to large numbers of deaths. In England and Wales, nearly five babies were stillborn for every 1,000 live births in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics, and infant mortality in the UK was 3.8 per 1,000 live births in 2014. Among women who have put on significant weight - a rise in their body mass index (BMI) of 4 points or about 11kg in an average-height Swedish woman - there would be about two more stillbirths and the same number of extra deaths per 1,000 births.
But experts say stillbirths and infant deaths are already unacceptably high and that it is important to look for ways to help women who become pregnant keep their weight down.
"The prevalence of overweight and obesity in pregnant women has reached epidemic levels," said Eduardo Villamor, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan school of public health in the US and co-author of the paper published by the Lancet medical journal.
"More than half of women in the USA and one in three women in Sweden are either overweight or obese at the start of their pregnancy. Our findings highlight the importance of educating women about maintaining a healthy weight during pregnancy and reducing excess weight before becoming pregnant as a way to improve infant survival."
The study was carried out using the Swedish medical birth register. The scientists had data on more than 450,000 women who gave birth to a first and second child between 1992 and 2012, including their BMI and details of any stillbirth or infant death.
The causes of such deaths included congenital abnormalities, birth asphyxia, infections and sudden infant death syndrome. The researchers were able to allow for other factors that make stillbirth or infant death more likely, such as smoking and the mother's age.
Women who lost weight between the first and second birth were at lower risk of having a stillbirth or infant death. The authors say that "prevention of weight gain and promotion of weight loss in overweight women might reduce stillbirth and infant mortality" in women having a second or subsequent child.
Why weight gain affects the baby is not completely clear, they say. Women who are overweight have more fat tissue, which can cause raised blood pressure, which is a risk to the baby in the womb. They are more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes - a form of the condition that is particular to pregnancy - which can increase the chances of heart defects in the baby, said Andrew Whitelaw, an emeritus professor of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol.
"Excessive fat tissue increases the risk of critical oxygen deprivation during labour and also increases inflammation, and that could trigger preterm birth which certainly increases mortality," he said. "Treatment programs to reduce weight gain between pregnancies have proved difficult in the past but are clearly needed."
He called for a larger study even than that carried out in Sweden, using data across the NHS to find out the causes.

Turnover & market capitalization
John Keells Holdings was the highest contributor to the week's turnover value, contributing LKR 1.84bn or 40.26% of total turnover value.
Lion Brewery followed suit, accounting for 13.85% of turnover (value of LKR 0.63bn) while Ceylon Tobacco contributed LKR 0.39bn to account for 8.45% of the week's turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 4.58bn (cf. last week's value of LKR 2.76bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.92bn (+32.57% W-o-W) compared to last week's average of LKR 0.69bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased 1.29% W-o-W (or LKR 38.34bn) to LKR 2927.21bn cf. LKR 2965.55bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the week's total turnover value, accounting for 41.58% (or LKR 1.90bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by John Keells Holdings which accounted for 96.84% of the sector's total turnover.
The Beverages, Food & Tobacco sector meanwhile accounted for 25.83% (or LKR 1.18bn) of the week's total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Lion Brewery, Ceylon Tobacco and Distilleries which accounted for 90.66% sector turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector was also amongst the top sectoral contributors, contributing 16.64% (or LKR 0.76bn) driven mainly by Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank, Peoples Leasing and Sampath Bank which accounted for 78.80% of sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume too, accounting for 34.62% (or 32.84mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.76bn.
The Diversified sector followed suit, adding 18.79% to total turnover volume as 17.82mn shares were exchanged.

Hunas Falls was the week's highest price loser, declining 16.71% W-o-W to close at LKR 58.30.
Udapussellawa Plantations closed at LKR 23.30, representing a W-o-W decline of 13.38%, while Hayleys Fibre (-12.84% W-o- W) and Autodrome (-12.56% W-o-W) also declined.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with daily average net inflows amounting to LKR 63.41mn relative to last week's average net outflows of LKR 52.84mn (+219.99% W-o-W).

In terms of volume, Asia Asset and People's Leasing led foreign purchases, while Anilana Hotels and Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
In terms of value, JKH and Asiri Hospital Holdings led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank and Anilana Hotels led foreign sales.
Point of view
Negative retail sentiment dominated markets for most of the week, pushing the benchmark ASPI to a 35-week low.
Margin calls and persistent selling pressure resulted in a 91.85 point decline W-o-W and Index losses were led mainly by Banking counters.
Average turnover value however, increased over the week supported mainly by HNI and Institutional investor transactions which contributed 50% to total market turnover.
Retail investors remained largely passive as the year-end holiday sentiment weighed in on activity levels.
Net foreign inflows meanwhile, resurfaced following last week's LKR 211.4mn net outflow as buying interest in JKH and Asiri Hospital Holdings boosted total foreign purchases to LKR 3.4bn (cf. LKR 1.13bn last week).
Net inflows for the week consequently amounted to LKR 317.0mn. Similar sluggish sentiment is likely to prevail next week ahead of the upcoming holidays but next week's US Fed meeting is also likely to provide some direction to the market.
November inflation increases to 3.1% Y-o-Y
November inflation data released on Monday indicated a 140 bps increase in consumer prices, bringing the Consumer Price Index to 184.7 points in November cf. 182.1 points in October.
The increase consequently represented a 3.1% Y-o-Y rate of inflation relative to 1.7% Y-o-Y in the previous month.
Prices increases were led mainly by a 5.2% Y-o-Y increase in prices in the Food category, translating to an inflation contribution of 2.5% by food commodities.
Annual average inflation consequently rose to 0.9% in November from 0.7% in October 2015. Average annual inflation levels throughout the year however have been on a downward trend, declining for 8 consecutive months until October when annual average price levels remained at 0.7%.
This month's 0.2% increase is the first increase in annual average inflation since February 2013.

Blooming rose inspired by Enid Blyton
She is an English rose growing in Sri Lankan soil. She is a rose that has blossomed. She is Muqaddasa Wahid, an exceptional 15-year-old author. Muqaddasa is a proud product of Buddhist Ladies' College.
The French translation of a book she wrote in English was launched recently by Alliance Francaise De Colombo. The book is named 'Le Role de Modele'.
"I congratulate young author Muqaddasa Wahid for the tremendous effort she has put into writing this book. Those of you who have had a chance to read the book will appreciate how much talent she has in expressing her ideas, views and dreams in her book," said Alliance Francaise De Colombo President Sheriff Abdul Rahuman.
A family who had been close associates of Wahid spoke about her. Leo Fonseka, a guest speaker, said he and his wife had watched over her for several years.
"She is doing great things at such a young age. She is precocious and more advanced than other children of her age. I think she will achieve miracles with her pen. We saw great talent and potential in her. From day one, it was clear to us that she would attain great heights," he said.
The essence of this book is her inner fight with the world around her. It is about the fight she is raging against evil when she writes about the eternal conflict between the good and bad. Muqaddasa shows a lot of analytical ability. "We are sure she will bring credit to her family and nation," said Fonseka.
Another guest speaker P. Venkatesan spoke of Wahid's maturity at tackling a variety of topics. "She is a gifted child with enormous talent. A child like this is rare. I have never come across a child who is so mature at this age. Her parents are blessed to have a child like this," Venkatesan said.
Finally, the child prodigy herself spoke. Wahid spoke of her idol, Enid Blyton whose works are the basis of Wahid's story.
"I am happy that I am here today to present the French Translation of my first book which was launched in 2012 at my school Buddhist Ladies College. The inspiration to write my book came from my Grade 5 class teacher and English teacher Nalini Samarasekere.
I am thankful to her for making me who I am," she said.
She added: "The book is about friendship and mystery.
Although Enid Blyton writes for children between 12 -14, I read her because I like her way of writing. My story is kind of based on her books. So it is a result of reading many Enid Blyton stories such as Famous Five and Secret Seven.
It is also about role models in society. I hope you all will enjoy reading the French version as much as I enjoyed writing the English version."

Bo steals the show
Michelle Obama unveils White House decorations - but family dog Bo is the main attraction!
It's not every day that children are invited to the White House to meet Michelle Obama and take in the lavish Christmas decorations. But on Wednesday the First Lady threw open the doors to her Washington home to invite military families for a first viewing.
Giant sized nutcrackers and teddy bears, 62 beautifully decorated trees, a chocolate gingerbread house modelled on the White House and some 70,000 ornaments to gawp at - these were all lost on the youngsters as soon as they spotted Bo.
The family pet, who the Obamas have had for a few years, was undoubtedly the main attraction. Led by First Lady Michelle, Bo bounced into the room, wagging his tail and jumping around on his front white paws.
"So anybody who is afraid of dogs, you tell me, okay" said Michelle. "But they're pretty nice. They're bigger than they look on TV."
The adorable Portuguese Water Dog was joined by his "little sister" Sunny, who the Obamas adopted as a second pet in 2013. It looked like none of the youngsters were scared of the animals as they rushed up to pet and play with them.
Michelle, who looked resplendent in a floral jacquard Michael Kors dress and metallic gold heels, showed off her maternal side as she chatted to the children and introduced them to Bo and Sunny.
"[They are getting] a tree with doggy treats and tennis ball ornaments," Michelle revealed, explaining the dogs' excitable nature. "And I think I've heard Bo and Sunny are pretty excited about that one."
The First Lady, who has two teenage daughters Sasha and Malia with her husband President Barack Obama, gave a speech in the East Room. She welcomed the military families and explained that this year's theme was "A Timeless Tradition". "Our decorations celebrate proud American traditions and our singular American spirit," said Michelle.
The families were taken on a tour of the White House, visiting the Blue Room, the Red Room and the State Dining Room among others. One of the 62 Christmas trees on display featured iPads where families could send holiday messages to US troops overseas. The First Lady welcomed the military families into the White House as part of the Joining Forces initiative - a nationwide campaign to support service members, veterans and their families in wellness, education and employment.

Cambio celebrates ten years in Sri Lanka
Cambio organized a celebration at Ramada Hotel, Colombo, in honor of the company's 10th anniversary in Sri Lanka recently.
Cambio Healthcare Systems is an e-Health company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company counts over 400 software professionals who develop Cambio COSMIC, comprehensive and easy-to-use software solutions for healthcare providers.
In late 2004, Cambio established a small dedicated team in Sri Lanka with Creative Solutions, one of the country's leading software development and outsourcing companies. The team initially counted five members, however, that number increased to over 80 in only five years.
Based on the success of their Sri Lankan team, Cambio established their own subsidiary in Sri Lanka in 2010. Today, Cambio SL counts well over 200 employees.
"Creative Solutions has brought numerous clients to Sri Lanka over the past couple of decades," said the Director of Creative Solutions, Sushena Ranatunga.
"By February 2016, we expect to see Cambio SL's office expand to 255 employees and I cannot express how proud we are to have contributed to the creation of such opportunities for Sri Lankan talent." According to Ranatunga and Jayawardena, the crucial factor behind Cambio SL's success is the expertise of Sri Lankan IT professionals that have joined Cambio over the past 10 years.
To reward some of their longest-serving staff members, Cambio Sri Lanka gifted the latest iPad models to 8 of their employees who celebrated 10 years with the company. Another 38 of their employees were also recognized for completing 5 years at Cambio SL this year.
Peter Cornelius, Head of R&D for Cambio Healthcare Systems AB, Sweden, flew to Sri Lanka exclusively to attend Cambio Sri Lanka's 10 year anniversary.
In his speech he reflected on the past 10 years of Cambio's operations in Sri Lanka and summarized the company's plan for the next few years.
"Looking ahead," continued Cornelius, "Cambio will work on developing new features to extend our software solutions. We are planning further expansions of our Swedish, Danish and UK offices, as well as our Sri Lankan operations."
Cornelius concluded that it is Cambio Sri Lanka team's loyalty and commitment that has made the company's success possible.

Central Province Women stickers have it easy
An effervescent display by Central Province women stickers helped them to trounce Western Province by the massive margin of seven goals to zero to win the women's hockey championship at the 41st National Sports Festival organized by the Ministry of Sports and played at the Sports Ministry Astro turf recently.
Winning the finals by such a huge margin that too against a top side like the Western Province with the best of basic amenities, including two astro turf facilities by a bunch comprising mostly village lasses is very creditable.
The team was captained by national player Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena fair complexioned and looks a foreigner who motivated the team to the maximum. They scored 31 goals in 3 matches while conceding none. In this respect though stocky but very supple and agile goal keeper Jeewanthi Keerthiratne was very outstanding as she kept a Hawk's eye on the opponents especially when within the semi circle. With her as the custodian, it looked the goal posts were non existent.
Her remarkable performance is that she conceded only one goal in the entire tournament which includes club level inter district in the run up to the National Sports Festival. No wonder she is rated as number one goal keeper in the country for the last seven years from the time she ousted Tharuni Perera from this position. If there was a Best Goal Keeper's award she would have grabbed it eyes closed.
This tournament saw the Central Province stickers coached by former national captain Wasana Ekanayake hardly having any opposition. In all the matches it was a one way traffic. They beat Eastern Province 14-0 and Northern Province 10-0 and the Western Province 10-0. What was most praiseworthy was the fact that they were attuned to meet all situations - whether it was a challenge of skills or the hit and stop game of the Northern Province or the aggressiveness of the Eastern Province Ladies.
The forward line had the belligerence and had national captains Chathurika Wijesuriya, Madhushani Jayanetti, Maneesha Dissanaike, skipper Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena, Yamuna Wijesuriya, Madura Dharmaratne, Aruni Jayasinghe, Susanthika Themiyadasa and who simply tore into the opponents defence which was seen in tatters. Madura Dharmaratne won the Best Players award.
In the defence line it was right back Geethani Abeyratne, Geethika Nandasena, Chathurika Premasiri, Dharshani Herath Arundika Gunawardena and Samadara Chathurika who put up a rock like fortress to stop the opponents. Geethani Abeyratne fed the forwards well with some neat passes. In addition to this there were two promising school girls from Sangamittha Girls College, Matale in Bhaghya Kodituwakku and Nawanjana Ekanayake.
The team played as a well drilled unit and when you take individually they were from the villages around Kandy where there is no hockey at all. They were mostly products of Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya and they are mostly turning out for Sri Lanka and coached by M A M Ashroff at District and club level. The squad: Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena, Jeewanthika Nandasena, Maneesha Dissanayake, Chathurika Wijesuriya, Yamuna Wijesuriya, Geethani Abeyratne, Dharshani Herath, Geethika Nandasena, Madura Dharmaratne, Madhushani Jayanetti, Aruni Jayasinghe, Susanthika Themiyadasa, Chathurika Premasiri, Anandie Rajapaksa, Arundika Gunawardena, Samadara Chathurika, Nawanjana Ekanayake, Bhaghya Kodituwakku.

Coconut Growers Association raises concerns on 2016 Budget
The Coconut Growers Association of Sri Lanka (CGASL) has raised concerns about 2016 Budget proposals which spelt out substantive reforms in the coconut industry.
In its reforms in Plantation Economy section 160 reads "Coconut Industry too is faced with the issue of lack of coconuts for value addition. The budget proposals for the first time proposed the import of coconuts to meet the shortfall of local produce for the coconut processing industry.
The Plant Protection Ordinance No: 165/2 of November 1981 prohibits the importation of Coconut Palm products and any imports even under quarantine control would be a violation of this Act.
Sri Lanka is now facing the adverse consequences of relaxation or the lapses of quarantine control with the advent of the Aceria Mite Infestation which commenced around 10 to 15 years ago, and has spread throughout the country retarding the production and size of coconut with the nut weight reduction of about 30% with a severe attack.
The CGASL will support all endeavors to provide more nuts for production by industrialists and support the government's endeavor to increase exports of processed & value added products.We can achieve this through collective effort from all the stakeholders of the Coconut Industry.
Despite the reservations, the Association noted some positive proposals in the 2016 Budget. The CGASL commend on tax holiday to be granted to companies that use drip irrigation methods, and endeavor to use high yielding seeds in Agriculture as a positive move, however these concessions should be offered to the entire spectrum of growers including coconut and not be limited to companies.
The 2016 Budget has proposed to lift the ceiling on ownership of land, this certainly would give an impetus to existing coconut grower to expand their investments in coconut plantation. In summery importation of coconuts to cater to an export market is not a solution as proposed in the 2016 Budget. The village grower is dependent on the price of a coconut to keep his home fires burning. The risk of coconut palm getting infected with virus and predators are very high and could destroy the entire industry. The Valuable Brand name "Sri Lanka Coconut Product" will be diluted. The benefit is only for a few industrialists. Is it worth at the cost of the millions of people who rely on the cheapest & healthiest source of fat in their daily meal

Cow-milking Arnie says time to save climate
US: Arnold Schwarzenegger recalled Saturday a childhood of milking cows in the rain and drawing water from a well as he called for the world to turn to clean energy and protect the world's environment from global warming.
The former California governor and action movie star harked back to his Austrian upbringing as he called for action in an address to international lawmakers in Paris, on the sidelines of a UN conference where negotiators are seeking a worldwide climate-saving accord.
"One of my chores was every morning at six o'clock to go to the farm nextdoor and to milk the cow and to bring home the milk. It did not matter what the weather was -- whether it was cold, it was hot, raining, thunder, shower, whatever," Schwarzenegger said.
"My brother and I walked 200 metres (220 yards) to the well to get our family's source of water for drinking and for bathing every day. We played in the fields, we swam in the streams and the lake -- the environment was absolutely everything to us," he added.
In his "idyllic" childhood, Schwarzenegger said he could never have imagined a world in which humanity would dump 40 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
"But I also could not have imagined that one day I would become governor of the great state of California, the eighth largest economy in the world and that I would have the power to do something about it."
He pressed decision-makers at every level to turn to smart, clean energy sources.
"This is the challenge of our time and this is the real world. This is not the movie world which is the other world that I come from. There are no visual effects here, no special effects, there is no script writing that we can change for a better ending -- nothing like that," he said.
Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger on Saturday laid a floral wreath at the Bataclan concert venue where 90 people were killed during the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris. "Paris, je t'aime (I love you) and I pray for you," reads the card on the wreath of orchids and roses, signed simply "Arnold".
The actor and former body builder is in Paris to lend star power to the UN climate conference underway in the French capital. Other Hollywood stars in Paris for the climate talks include Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Robert Redford. - AFP

Distracted dining
Many of us like to relax with a box set and a bag of crisps.
But eating while watching TV or browsing Facebook can cause people to overeat, leading to obesity, a new study has found.
And parents being distracted means they do not pay attention to their children at the dinner table, so they don't learn healthy habits such as stopping eating when full.
Researchers said so-called 'distracted dining' may be as dangerous to health as losing concentration on a motorway.
The US researchers videoed 60 families during mealtimes to test the effects of distraction.
Half the families were subjected to the sounds of loud vacuum cleaner in an adjacent room for 15 minutes while eating, while the other families ate without a distraction.
During the meal, the team measured the family members' Body Mass Index (BMI), food consumption, action, behaviour and communication.
The effects of distraction were more marked for parents than for children.
Parents ate more biscuits and drank more soft drinks than the quiet group but they also ate more vegetables.
However, the noise had a big effect on communication between parents and their children.
Dr Barbara Fiese, of the University of Illinois, said: 'Adults got up and down from the table a lot more and made fewer positive comments.
'They paid less attention to their children's concerns in conversation and we know that kind of conversation is associated with a healthier weight in children.'
She added distracted parents are probably not monitoring what their children are eating and not demonstrating a positive interest in their children.
This means that children are not set good examples such as stopping eating when they are no longer hungry.
She said: 'Being distracted during meals puts kids at added risk for obesity and increased consumption of unhealthy foods.
'In this study, we found that noisy and distracting environments affected parents' actions and we know that parents set the tone for the quality of family mealtimes.
'If you're getting up and down because you're distracted during a meal, you're probably not able to pay attention to the kids' emotions or to model good responses to your hunger cues - noticing when you're full and not continuing to eat.'
This is the first time that distracted eating has been tested on whole family groups.
Dr Fiese said: 'We haven't really thought about what it means if adults, who are supposed to be regulating what's happening, are distracted during family mealtimes.
'It doesn't portend well for the family's eating habits as a whole.'
She added: 'This study shows that it's not enough to encourage families to eat together regularly without identifying other factors that promote health.
Distractions and disruptions may be part of a family environment that is habitually chaotic and unstructured.
'We know that children raised in chaotic family environments are at increased risk for becoming overweight or obese.'
The research appears in the journal Couple and Family Psychology.

The JDA Perera Gallery is now host to a vibrant range of artistic expression, courtesy of one of Sri Lanka's biggest promoters of local art, the George Keyt Foundation. The annual exhibition was opened on December 1 at the gallery, with the Chairman of the Sapumal Foundation Rohan De Soysa attending as Chief Guest.
The exhibition which will be held until December 6, features an interesting and varied selection of art, from still-life, to conceptual, very fluid, abstract pieces and even a few sculptures.
Forty-eight artists were selected for the exhibition from all over the country. Chief Guest De Soysa, in an impassioned speech that opened the event, said: "The soul and psyche of the nation was indeed nourished by its artists and its poets."
The diversity of the exhibits is what makes it such a treat to browse through. You move from the subtle, familiar lines of Michael Anthonisz's portrait sketches, to the wild, colourful surrealism by Sathsara Ilangasinghe, a few paintings after. The artists featured are an interesting mix of styles - from charcoal to oil paints to mixed-media. There is something for everyone to appreciate.
Some of our personal favourites included: Sudath Abeysekera's 'Landscape with Gold Sky', a very emotive abstract series of paintings featuring harsh splatters and warm contrasts, Nirmala De Alwis's 'The Irony', a loud conceptual suggestion of an elephant's face, staring back unapologetically at the onlooker, Achala Gunawardana's 'A Landscape,' an abstract conceptualization of a landscape, exuding a sense of soothing calmness and quietness, Sathsara Ilangasinghe's 'Medusa', an unforgettable, surreal depiction of a little girl Medusa, with a head of wiggling pink snakes, her arms holding demurely a white cat, and Ruwan Upasena's 'Conventional Man' series, surreal and dream-like, with hints of man, nature and machine, in mixed-media of cool colours and sharp lines. Another work of art memorable for its message was 'Brotherhood Avenue' by Anura Srinath, featuring children of different religions playing together on the beach.
Sri Lankan Art 2015 is not just a showcase of talent, interesting to only artists and those who frequent galleries, but it is a collection of intriguing, well-elaborated stories told through the artist's paintbrush and sculpting tools.
Visitors at the exhibition also get a catalogue booklet, with artists' names and contact numbers in case you enjoy the work so much that you want to talk to the artist or purchase his or her art.

Early detection, best cure
The lung cancer is gradually gaining ground in Sri Lanka. Diagnosed late, and you will have a little chance of survival  probably two years at the maximum. Diagnose it early, and you will have a bigger chance of braving the cancer. In an interview with Health Watch, Consultant in Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy, Dr. Mahendra Perera (MBBS, MD, Dip. RT) elaborates on lung cancer, its causes and preventive measures. Dr. Perera is also the President of Sri Lanka College of Oncologists and Chairman of the Board of Study in Oncology and Radiotherapy in Sri Lanka, He is also a member of European Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the Principal Investigator of Clinical Trials, NCIM.
Q: What is lung cancer
Dr. Mahendra Perera
Q: What are the main symptoms of lung cancerA: Malignantgrowthin the lung tissue, mainly thebronchialepitheliumandthe alveoli. Lung cancer could be divided into two categories: primary lung cancer and secondary lung cancer. Primary lung cancer arises directly from the lung. Secondary lung cancer comes from another body organ and gets stored in the lung.
A: There are many symptoms:
1. Prolonged cough. 2. Coughing out blood, 3. Unusual shortness of breath 4. Voice changes 4. Chest pain. 5. Arm pain 6. Unexplained loss of weight 7. Continued fever. 8. Muscle wasting 9. Skin pigmentation. 10. Diabetes insipidus. 11. Bone pain 12. Head ache and fits 14. Loss ofappetite 15. Leg vein thrombosis.
Q: Who are at the risk of developing lung cancer
A: 1. Heavy smokers.
2. People exposed to pollution. 3. Workers in chemical and dye industry. 4. People exposed to asbestos. 5. Certain viruses. 6. People exposed to radiation. 7. People with genetic disorders.
Q: What are the treatments available in Sri Lanka
A: 1. Early cancers could be dealt with surgery. This involves resection of part of the lung or even may be removal of the whole lung.
2. Chemotherapy. 3. Lung cancer vaccines. 4. Radiotherapy.
Q: How we can prevent it
A: Lung cancer is not a preventable disease. There are many causative factors that we are not aware of yet. We can only reduce the risk of getting lung cancer by avoiding carcinogens such as smoke, dust and chemicals. It is extremely important to detect early by recognizing the above symptoms. Any person who has a long lasting cough that does not respond to treatment or anyperson with coughing out blood, loss of weight etc has to be investigated by a medical specialist.
Q: Can low quality fuel, air fresheners and incense sticks lead to lung cancer
A: There is no proven evidence.
Q: What is the survival rate
A: Lung cancer remains one of the most fatal cancers. Early detection is difficult most of the time and many cases are late at presentation. It can mimic many non cancerous conditions. Patients with primary lung cancer have a poor prognosis. Only 30 or 40 percent can survive even two years at least. Many symptoms surface late and the victim would succumb to it within a few months. A few would survive for maximum two and half years with treatment. Most lung cancers are treated with the hope of giving symptom-free survival. Secondary Lung cancers are treated in a different way. The main treatment depends on the area where the primary cancer was. Their survival depends on the primary cancer and the available treatment modality.

Fiji romp to Dubai Sevens title
DUBAI, SATURDAY: World champions Fiji won the Dubai Sevens for the second time in three years on Saturday with a 28-17 victory over England in the final.
Fiji scored all of their points in the first half after falling behind to an early Tom Bowen try.
Savenaca Rawaca, Jasa Veremalua, Jerry Tuwai, who had suffered a bout of food poisoning overnight and had been on a drip before Saturday's action, and Isake Katonibau grabbed Fiji's four converted tries for a 28-7 lead at the break.
England, the 2010 and 2013 champions, rallied with late second half tries through Phil Burgess and a second score for Bowen.
The series moves on to Cape Town next week with Fiji remaining the team to beat ahead of the sport's debut at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro next year.
For Fiji coach Ben Ryan, a former England boss, it was a fourth Dubai triumph in six years as he saw his side sweep through the tournament.
They defeated Australia 19-12 in their quarter-finals with tries from Kotanibau, captain Osea Kolinisau and Rawaca.
That was followed up by a 19-5 win against New Zealand in the semi-finals thanks to scores from Viliame Mata, Pio Tuwai and Veremalua.
"England are a tough side so we are happy to come through as winners," said Kolinisau, playing in his 43rd World Sevens event.
"It keeps us on a roll for the next round in South Africa."
South Africa won the Plate, France took the Bowl and the Shield went to Canada.
Ryan was delighted with his team efforts, hailing Fiji as the benchmark for sevens excellence. "We are ahead of the curve now compared to other teams and they will look at us now and try and work out how to negate that," he told the Gulf News. "But it's a tough assignment for them because as soon as they take their eye off what they are doing in order to nullify us then we are able to create this aura about us."
England made the final by seeing off Argentina 14-7 in the quarter-finals before getting the better of the United States 24-19 in the last-four. "We've got some young guys and ones coming back from injury so it's challenging as a coach. But ultimately that is a very good Fiji team, loads of experience, loads of world class players," said England coach Simon Amor.
In the third-place play-off, the improving United States defeated New Zealand for the second time in two days, 31-12 to follow their 14-12 win in the pool stages.
The US had also seen off defending Dubai champions South Africa 21-19 in the last eight.. AFP

Ford gears up for higher demand with customer care
A resurgence in demand for the Ford range of vehicle in Sri Lanka has prompted the local agent Future Automobiles to spruce up and tighten customer care, a letter the new CEO sent to existing Ford owners recently revealed.
The company recently enhanced its premises at Battaramulla welcoming customers in to an expansively designed showroom promising a delightful experience within -the highlight being the wide selection of vehicles on display.
Elaborating on recent changes initiated since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Chamath Tennekoon said recent upgrades signaled a new era of enhanced efficiency and service focusing on customer needs.
'Besides the improvements in infrastructure, we have assembled the best possible service team headed by a Chief Technical Officer cum Head of After Sales to enhance our service delivery standards.'
He added that 'the month of December will be unique in the fact that it is FORD's Big Deal month where we offer very special deals on vehicles. This year however, we have not limited The Big Deal to just Sales but extended it to After Sales as well with a 100% Free Service Campaign for our customers, coupled with sizeable discounts on spare parts. The month will culminate with the launch of the FORD Loyalty Card Program which allows our customers to cash-in their loyalty points to get discounts on spare parts or be eligible for gifts'.
'Purchasing a premium vehicle should be a premium experience, which is what the Ford Centre offers its valued patrons. We believe Ford owners now have support and service of a quality that compares favorably with other Ford dealerships worldwide, thus making certain that Sri Lanka maintains the same benchmark levels of performance and service', he declared.
Walking into the Ford showroom, the layout ensures a pleasant browsing experience minus any crowding, and is also conducive to those customers who wish to acquire in-depth information about any particular vehicle on display.
A designated area for customer seating, easily accessible reception and sales staff, prominently displayed specifications for each vehicle and the ability to comfortably explore the models are among the enhanced experiences the showroom offers.
In addition, for those who want to truly experience the Ford promise, test-drive vehicles for each model are parked in easy access areas, eliminating long waiting times involved in bringing the vehicle to the customer.
New recruitment, a part of restructuring, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff trained to offer customers assistance in all aspects of the purchase experience. From helping the customer choose a vehicle to providing answers to technical questions, the staff is well trained to make a visit to the Ford showrooms an experience par excellence.

Foreign investor may get 5,000 acres on lease in Sri Lanka: Ravi
The Sri Lankan government is willing to allow leasing of land to a foreign investor up to a maximum of 5,000 acres and relax the criteria in respect of projects which are "labour intensive with the focus on job creation," Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
In an exclusive interview with THE HINDU at his office on Friday, Karunanayake said any "investment-oriented" foreign investor could come to the country and do business without paying 100 per cent tax on leasing of land. "Earlier, the lease tax was very stiff."
Answering questions on the issue, the minister made it clear that foreign investors would not be able to buy lands. The only stipulation for the investors getting a 99-year-long lease would be that they should not try to "indulge in buying lands" and remain inactive in doing investments.
For the purpose of foreign investments, the government had identified many thrust areas, each having a potential of investment for $ two billion.
Asked whether foreigners would be allowed for projects proposed under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode in respect of the dairy sector and the construction of 100,000 houses in five years, Karunanayake replied in the affirmative and said the term "private" would mean a local or a foreign investor while the term "public" would refer only to the local.
On the plan for establishing an international financial centre in Colombo, he said the idea was to bring in a number of banks, "which have not been here," to have offshore activities.
He described as "doable" the deadline of April 1, 2016 for the establishment of the centre.
Referring to the move to liberalise tea import for value addition through blending, the minister dismissed the criticism that this would adversely affect the domestic tea industry as one coming from "people with vested interests." He argued that the opening up of the sector would make the industry "much bigger" than what it was as a close industry. "At present, we have lost markets all over," he observed.
To a question whether the government would carry out the merger of Mihin Lanka with SriLankan Airlines, as announced early this year, the minister said the government had later found "core competence" of the former.
Mihin Lanka would confine itself to domestic operations while the other would be a regional player with long-distance flight services. - The Hindu

Govt. awaiting positive response from Saudi Arabia
The government is awaiting for a positive response from Saudi Arabia in relation to the Sri Lankan woman who is to be stoned to death, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukoralasaid in Parliament today.
She said that the government has intervened in this matter to get a favorable response from the Saudi Arabia via the Foreign Ministry.She made these observations in parliament today in response to a question raised by UNP parliamentarian Budhika Pathirana. On an early occasion the Parliament was told the Foreign Ministry, its staff and the Embassy in Saudi Arabia were working hard to get the Sri Lankan woman free from the death sentence. Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget under financial heads of Women and Child Affairs Ministry said the offence which the woman concerned has to be confirmed by four eye witnesses who should be holy Muslim men according to the Sharia Law. "Only after such a confirmation, the execution can be carried out according to their law." Deputy Minister Ramanayake said. "Therefore it is questionable if there is sufficient evidence to suggest she had committed adultery as per the Sharia law." He also added that the government is discussing with USA to find a solution for this matter. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna parliamentarian Vijitha Herath joining the same debate said it was this social and economic system in the country that had put the women to such a fate. He added that it was this economic system that has forced the woman to go for domestic work in Middle East. He addedthat the economy of the country has to be developed to a level that would encourage those women go for Middle East to stay back in the country. UNP parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra speaking at the debate on the same financial head said the country should be ashamed of sending women abroad to work as domestic aides. She said sending women to Middle East should be banned. Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the punishment is a crime against women all over the world. He added that the Women and Child Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Ministry should intervene into this matter to bring about a positive result. City Planning and Water Supply Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle stated that in Sri Lanka there were no laws against adultery. She added that however if Sri Lanka failed to get this sentence lifted, the country would have to take a decision on sending our women to Saudi Arabia for employment.

How The Lion King: Became The Most Successful Stage Show Of All Time
The Lion King celebrates its 15th anniversary at London's Lyceum Theatre with a flurry of remarkable statistics swirling around it. This is the highest-grossing stage show in history, having already grossed some 3.8 billion globally - more than the previous record-holder Phantom of the Opera. Or, to place it in a broader context, more than the combined global revenues of the six most popular Harry Potter films.
But does The Lion King still speak to our times Has it retained its power and visual majesty over the years, or is it now more of an obligatory staging post for foreign tourists to London
At the weekend I took my seat feeling faintly unnerved by another statistic: since its opening at the Lyceum in 1999, 12 million people, no less, have done precisely the same thing.
I was keeping my expectations in check. Musicals do not always date well. I looked in on Phantom of the Opera a second time for professional reasons in 2004, when the ill-judged film version was released. It was 18 years after its original London opening, and a dispiriting evening; it felt clapped out and past its sell-by date.
I also wondered if anything could replicate the sheer sense of slack-jawed awe at seeing the astonishing opening of The Lion King for the first time. Set to percussive African rhythms, it features gigantic elephants tramping down the aisles, joining other animals on stage. These inventively designed creatures are propelled by actors: on stilts as giraffes, astride a bicycle device from which antelopes prance gracefully, holding long bendy poles with high-flying birds on their end.
The huge shimmering saffron sun rises over an unmistakably African plain, and Pride Rock, from where the lions survey their kingdom, rises like a corkscrew from beneath the stage. The scene has remarkable visceral power. It's rooted in the collective nature of the experience; all around you, everyone else is gaping and holding their breath too.
Well, 15 years on, it still works brilliantly - as does the ensemble opening of the second act: One by One is sung by the ensemble cast with extraordinary drumming, which catapults the audience once more out of their surroundings.
It's easy to overlook, what with all the trumpeting of huge grosses and audience figures, what a radical piece of theatre The Lion King is, and always was.
Credit for this goes to the prime mover of this stage version, director Julie Taymor, who came from avant-garde, ritual and experimental theatre, and had already used masks and puppetry in other productions. Taymor also helped design the costumes for the Lion King, and even wrote the lyrics for one of its songs, Endless Night. She has created a world that is fiercely non-literal, often to moving and wondrous effect. She makes no attempt to disguise the fact that these animals are moved and performed by humans. A drought on the African plain is conveyed by a circle of blue silk gradually vanishing by being pulled through a hole in the stage. When a lioness weeps, she pulls lengths of white ribbon from her eyes. Taymor evokes a waterfall using a huge sheet of billowing silk. A score of actors stride on stage, boxes on their head with long grass sprouting from them; this is Taymor's way of representing the African savannah. All of which seems a long way from the animated film and video of The Lion King, which proved immensely successful for Disney in the 1990s. They're agreeable entertainments, based on a hero-myth story redolent of Hamlet. As a young lion cub, Simba is hoodwinked by his malevolent uncle Scar into believing he was responsible for his father the king Mufasa's death. Simba flees before returning as an adult to reclaim his birthright from Scar, who has installed himself as king.
This is all fine as far as it goes, yet there's a cosiness and reassurance about the film that Taymor withholds; in the stage version there is simply more at stake, along with a recognition that life is fragile. She also gave far greater emphasis to the film's female characters. There's a tough-mindedness about her method of story-telling; it's surprising that Disney, to its great credit, approved such a radical reboot of the film.
But it works superbly. The performances in the London production are outstanding, starting with Brown Lindiwe Mkhize as the extraordinary shaman-mandrill, Rafiki, a glowering, wildly strange presence with a singing voice that can shake the Lyceum's foundations. Shaun Escoffery and George Asprey both excel as, respectively, a kind-but-stern Mufasa and a slightly camp, Bill Nighy-esque Scar.
There's an amusing piece of stagecraft when the darting boy Simba (Ezrae Maye) leaps offstage and is immediately replaced by his muscular adult self (Jonathan Andrew Hume).
A comic element is supplied by a double act, John Hassler as Timon the meerkat and Keith Bookman as Pumbaa, a flatulent warthog, both of whom befriend and advise the young Simba. Delightfully, Frame adopts the persona of a Jewish-American stand-up comic, sardonically commenting on the action.
Second only to Taymor's vision, meanwhile, is the music of South African composer Lebo M, which makes the crucial difference between The Lion King's film and stage versions. He has augmented the serviceable original pop songs of Elton John and Tim Rice, creating new ones and rooting them in a distinctly African tradition.
We suspend disbelief when confronted with this version of Africa, and a story of eternal truths that makes specific period irrelevant. Ingeniously, The Lion King is brought to life in a space that is impervious to trends and fashion.
It will not date easily; indeed, one can imagine it still packing out the Lyceum 15 years from now.
