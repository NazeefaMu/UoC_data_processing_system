After an avalanche of disaster
The combination of natures torrential downpours with their resultant floods and landslides with shocking levels of human unpreparedness has brought about the unprecedented level of disaster that remains an unshaken crisis, raising important issues of bad governance, maladministration and regretful politics that remain the new challenges before society.
Bangladesh faced Cyclone Mora that found land there, but the numbers killed were very small considering the size and nature of the attack by nature, whereas Sri Lanka is still trying to live down the reality of more than 200 lives lost and close to a hundred still missing, in what was not a cyclone or tsunami, but several days of heavy and continuous rain. What has stood out as the biggest calamity in this situation is the shocking level of disaster unpreparedness displayed by government and the administration, raising major questions about the very substance of government and administration; posing important questions about the very nature and substance of politics that this avalanche of disaster, raises issues about the future of both politics and governance.
The initial reports that showed the sheer unpreparedness of Disaster Management was particularly shocking the country that faced the huge tragedy of a tsunami not very far back, which in fact led to the establishment of the Disaster Management Authority in the country. The early reports about the absence of sufficient candles, matches, and bottled drinking water to give to the people in need, displayed the total absence of planning to meet a situation that the country had been pushed into.
It was a political tragi-comedy that took place n Parliament, when its last sittings were adjourned early in view of the advance and spread of bad weather, and the reminder by the Speaker to MPs to visit their electorates and assist in relief work. The very need for such a reminder, even casual, showed the increased distance between politicians and the people. The next part of the Act was the announcement that the Government had cancelled all vehicle imports for ministers this year, with the aim of using these funds for flood and disaster relief. It was only the previous week that Parliament took up the debate of a supplementary estimate of more than Rs. 360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate official residences of others. The disaster faced by the people had brought into sharp focus the reality of the huge and wasteful expenditure of public funds being regularly undertaken for vehicular transport for ministers, as well the huge costs of maintenance of their official residences. The issue of vehicle imports for MPs and Ministers, often of the luxury brands, has been a subject of public debate, or rather public protest for some time. But, the fact that a national disaster of floods and landslides, required such imports at least to be suspended, showed the very absurdity of the levels to which elected politicians are being elevated through the gross abuse of public funds for their comfort and convenience, and nothing to do with service to the people.
Reality of weather reports
Part of the problem faced by the people in this crisis situation certainly had to do with their being largely ignorant of the reality of the weather reports leading up to what became a huge national disaster. It certainly was the duty of those in charge of Disaster Management, however unprepared they may have been to meet with the subsequent and real crisis, to keep the public informed of the increasing bad weather they were to face, and prepare them for the dangers that lay ahead. This was another aspect of the colossal unpreparedness of the organisations and offices that carried this responsibility.
Media reports show that the Met Department did report that continuous rains for at least 12 hours were experienced by some areas starting from 6 pm Wednesday (24) to 6 am Thursday (25). It also reported that heavy rains, high winds, severe floods and landslides will affect the country in the coming days, especially in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-Western Provinces. Floods and landslide warnings have been issued across the countrys southwestern part while residents near the Kalu, Kelani, Nilwala and Gin rivers have been asked to be cautious of the rising water levels. Once this information was available it was the duty of those in charge of Disaster Management to convey this to the people, with the urgency that it demanded, and take the necessary follow up action to get the people moving to whatever necessary locations of safety. Unfortunately, this did not happen, with the speed necessary.
It is also regrettable that important sections of the media, especially TV and radio, failed in this major task of keeping the people properly warned of the approaching dangers, especially after the Met Dept did make its announcements. Key TV stations are today engaged in an almost competitive exercise to gather relief for the vast number of people in need. There could be some criticism of the nature of these relief campaign programmes, with more than a touch of publicity to the station or channels concerned. However, that can be set aside, and their work of relief gathering and supply is certainly commended. Yet, the failure of TV and radio channels to warn the people of the approaching dangers, and prepared them for the possibility of moving to safer locations at speed, or with the dawn of the next day, is regrettable. It was not done. Neither did these sections of the media do enough to activate organisations of civil society that could have been a good interlink with the disaster unprepared state institutions, to get them moving much earlier than they finally did. The interruption of regular programmes and pushing aside regular advertising to carry these urgent messages would certainly have helped very much, to even partly overcome the unpreparedness of these state institutions.
The path ahead
The talk of some politicians sounds as if they are in the mood for an avalanche of change. But that cannot be the reality. What is necessary is a proper understanding of the disaster that has taken place, and look at the ways and means of preventing such situations in the future, especially in the context of the reality of Climate Change that the world is faced with, and which will certainly have its various impacts on Sri Lanka in the months and years ahead.
The Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, who has returned from his conference in Mexico, sees the necessity for new legislation to face up to future crises, caused by nature and the weather. He says that people are not ready to move to places of safety when asked to do so for safety, and wants legal provision to compel them to do so. He also says there could be the need for laws to prevent cultivation on major hill slopes to prevent landslides. These are certainly two major issues, and the availability of legal provision to carry out these requirements cannot be opposed. However, with regard to cultivation on hill slopes, it is necessary to have a more scientific approach, which will be underlined by the law. It is good to recall that in Sri Lanka and many other countries' high, steep hill slopes have been cultivated in the past, through terraced agriculture.
However, it is also necessary to make a proper assessment of the role of politicians in people occupying lands that are unsuitable for cultivation and other livelihoods, in view of the threats of nature. It is no secret that a large number of unauthorized occupations of land, as well as the filling up of land meant for water retention, has often been done on the instructions or directions of politicians, usually in government, whatever the political party may be. Therefore, it is best to be aware of the need to have incorrupt governance and administration, if any of the proposed legislation is to have any impact in facing up to any crises in the future.
The torrent of disaster the country is moving away from, while calling for necessary legal and other official regulations to prevent such developments in the future, also calls for a much larger stress on the removal of politics and politicians from the major tasks of government that have to be carried out in conditions that are free of corruption, favouritism, trickery and false, as well as moving into areas of secular activity that gives the due importance to science. Our society has to be steadily moved away from beliefs in spirits and divinities that have no links with Buddhism, if we are to begin a major path ahead to development.

Anura Senanayake granted bail after one year
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested in connection with his alleged role in the cover up of evidence and conspiring to committing the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
Former DIG Senanayake was ordered to be released on a cash bail of one million rupees with three sureties of Rs.5 million each. The High Court further barred the suspect from leaving the country and ordered him to be appear before CID every Sunday of each month. He was severely warned not to interfere with the witnesses in the case.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the CID did not object to release the suspect on bail under strict bail conditions.
It was revealed that the former DIG had been arrested by the CID on May 23, 2016. The defence maintained that in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person should be detained for more than twelve months in custody. Through his revision application, the former DIG sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution had maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeens death as a fatal road accident.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the CID. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appeared on behalf of the suspect.

Argentine great Roberto de Vicenzo dies at 94
BUENOS AIRES, Friday: Argentine golfing great Roberto de Vicenzo died in Buenos Aires on Thursday at the age of 94, his son Eduardo said.
De Vicenzo started out as a caddie in 1932 but rose through the golfing ranks to win the 1967 British Open, beating the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.
He won 230 tournaments worldwide, including four PGA titles throughout his career and alongside Antonio Cerda helped Argentina win the inaugural World Cup of golf in 1953.
His outstanding senior career included a victory in the first US Senior Open, but he is also remembered for one of golf's great gaffes.
At the 1968 Masters, on his 45th birthday, de Vicenzo fired a final-round 65 and appeared headed for a playoff with Bob Goalby. But it was discovered he had inadvertently signed an incorrect scorecard -- for a 66 that didn't reflect one of his birdies -- and lost by one stroke.
This is a sad day, especially for golf in South America, where no player contributed more to the growth of the sport in that part of the world than Roberto de Vicenzo, US PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said.
Roberto was a tremendous champion who, as amazing as it may seem, won at least one tournament every year between 1942 and 1980 and was one of our sport's great ambassadors. When we were deciding what to name PGA TOUR Latinoamerica's Player of the Year Award, there was really no discussion. Calling it the Roberto de Vicenzo Award was our small way of honoring a man who did so many things in golf that its difficult to even attempt to mention.
Eduardo de Vicenzo said his father's health had deteriorated since he suffered a broken hip some months ago.
Nicklaus, hosting the Memorial tournament in Dublin, Ohio, this week, recalled his rival and friend fondly.
He was one of the really good guys, Nicklaus said. I just always enjoyed his company. He was a nice man, and you always miss nice guys.  AFP

Meanwhile, 12 Field Sri Lanka Engineer troops removing all soil, boulders and other impediments that had fallen on to the Athweltota-Harambakanda road in Digana at Agalawatta area, made the road motorable on Thursday, using heavy machinery of the Army.
Similarly, Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops with infantry and ground wings began clearing of drinking water wells in several inundated areas in Kalutara under the 582 Brigade Headquarters and the 583 Brigade in Ratnapura as water levels were fast receding and people began returning to their houses.
On Thursday, Security Forces - West Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe went to Agalawatta and Paragoda areas and distributed a large stock of dry rations and essentials among a section of affected civilians. Around the same time, Major General Ranasinghe, as the overall Commander in charge of rescue and relief operations, visited badly-hit Pahiyangala area which has been still predicted as a vulnerable area for sudden erosion of soil or mudslides in the aftermath of heavy rains. In addition, he supervised several places where the troops are conducting relief operations and managed to share a couple of thoughts with them.
Several Senior Officers were also associated with the visit to those places.

Bouhaddi earns Lyon women's Champions League
Cardiff, Thursday: Goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi scored the winning spot-kick as Lyon retained the women's Champions League against domestic rivals Paris Saint Germain in Cardiff on Thursday.
Moments after PSG's own shot stopper Katarzyna Kiedrzynek had scuffed her effort wide, Bouhaddi stepped up to seal a fourth Champions League triumph for Lyon.
After a goalless 120 minutes, the game went into a penalty shoot-out for the second year in a row and once again, Lyon held their nerve.
Kiedrzynek initially looked set to be the hero after making a stunning save to deny Eugenie Le Sommer, with some help from the bar.
But Bouhaddi kept out Grace Geyoro's effort and soon the shoot-out went into sudden death.
After 12 of 14 penalties had been successfully converted, Kiedrzynek faltered and PSG's hopes of a first continental triumph disappeared as they lost 7-6 on penalties.
It was the third time a Champions League final had been decided on penalties and Lyon have been involved in all three.
They beat Wolfsburg last year but suffered defeat to another German side Potsdam in 2010.
For Lyon, it also completed a second triple in a row to add to their 11th successive French title and sixth successive French Cup already secured last month, the latter also on penalties against PSG.
In a match of few clear chances, PSG were reduced to desperate defending at times but nonetheless had their chances on the counter.
Bouhaddi had made a fine first half save to deny Shirley Cruz while Marie-Laure Delie wasted a a glorious chance for PSG in the second period.
But Lyon had also come close through Amel Majri and Ada Hegerberg.
Despite a healthy contingent of 'Ultras' more used to following PSG's men's team amongst the 22,000 crowd in the Welsh capital, the Parisians could not make history and Lyon's domination of women's football, at home and on the continent, continued. AFP

Bryan Habana: Rugby stars surprise DNA discovery
As a professional athlete playing rugby at the highest level, Bryan Habana has to be keenly aware of his body and how it reacts. However, it was not until late in his record-breaking career that the South African speedster stumbled onto a shocking truth, when he agreed to have his DNA tested.
One of the most surprising things was that I found out -- after 32 years -- that I was lactose intolerant, he tells CNNs World Rugby show.
It was something I wasnt expecting and I was pretty flabbergasted about it. My wife has been complaining about wind since weve been married, and now I probably know the main reason! Milk played a key nutritional role for a young Habana, who was told he needed to bulk up if he was going to make it on the international stage.
Now I sort of understand why I might need to go to the toilet a bit more or why Im a little bit more gassier than a normal person when I drink milk, he says. It hasnt meant Ive stopped dairy, but Ive changed the way I consume it.
POWER OR ENDURANCE
Lactose intolerance is just one of the things Habana has discovered since starting a partnership with DNAFit, a company that uses algorithms to determine peoples genetic dispositions in regard to fitness and diet.
Habana, the Springboks all-time leading try scorer, was also surprised to find he has greater potential for increasing the endurance side of his training than past experience indicated.
From a mental point of view, I absolutely hate running long distances and maybe found my body got a lot more tired quicker doing them, says the winger, who has publicly released his DNA results. I was like, anything more than 100 meters is not my game training program. Maybe I couldve responded better in terms of mentally pushing myself a bit harder. My body wouldve benefited a little bit more from that. Along with power/endurance response -- which indicates what type of training intensity suits you best -- the DNAFit fitness test also provides guidelines for V02 max aerobic potential, post-exercise recovery, recovery nutrition and injury risk. Habana teamed up with the company last year, and aims to build a DNA database of 1,000 professional rugby players by 2019.
However, he believes the test results can be just as beneficial for non-athletes as those at the elite level. It was very exciting to be part of a pioneering process where were collecting as much data as possible, to be able to lay bases, to be able to find out more about the science, Habana says. Hopefully itll have a big impact in making a difference in the sport, whether it be 1% for those at the elite level or 50-60% for those who are starting out in their careers and wanting to get to know their bodies better. What wed like is for people to not only compare themselves to the likes of myself and hopefully a lot of other leading players in world rugby, but also to the normal person in the streets.
SO HOW DOES IT WORK
While other DNA testing services such as 23 And Me and AncestryDNA provide general health and genealogy traits, DNAFit focuses on diet and sports performance. Like the other tests, it requires a simple saliva swab, which you send back to the lab. Then you receive a detailed report breaking down the results and making recommendations.
Kits cost from 99-249 ($120-$310).
DNAFit says its Peak Performance Algorithm is based on validated genetic variant scoring methods. There are genome-wide association studies, the companys special projects manager Sebastian Corpe told CNN.
They look at elite performers in particular sports -- for example elite power athletes, elite sprinters -- and they look for gene variations that appear in them more than the average population.
Everything about who we are is the result of an interaction between how we were born and the things that we do. Genetics just shines a light on the static part of that equation, your DNA, so you can tailor your nutrition and training strategies to what will work for you.
WHICH SPORTS IS IT BEST SUITED TO
Corpe says DNAFit has a rugby training plan specific to players positions on the field -- front-five forwards, back-row forwards, inside backs and outside backs.
However, the company started out testing athletes such as sprinter Craig Pickering, and employs his fellow British Olympian Tom Lancashire among its consultants.
It has also worked with English Premier League clubs and football academies. Corpe says one peer-review study with youth players found that training according to your genetics led to almost three times the level of improvement compared to unguided training.
We want to roll out those sorts of improvements into as many sports as possible to drive research not just in sports science but also in exercise genomics, he says.
WHAT NEXT FOR RUGBY LEGEND HABANA
Its almost a decade since Habana won the World Cup with South Africa. Since then he has equaled the tournaments all-time leading try record, having matched Jonah Lomus mark of 15 at the 2015 tournament. Now aged 33, he admits he is reaching the twilight of his career -- though he has prolonged it for at least another season after signing a contract extension with French club Toulon, where he has played since 2013. He hopes the knowledge he has gained from DNA testing will help him manage his body, in an era where players are getting bigger, faster and stronger. Now I might be a little bit smarter in terms of how I train, in terms of my recovery process, Habana says. Im not going to change my whole training regime. Adding those elements that could help me train better and smarter could definitely help me over the next year or so of rugby that I have left.
Getting that knowledge is so more useful now in terms of how I manage my career going forward and making sure that I train smarter to be able to stay at that highest level for as long as possible. Habana, who is friends with DNAFits founder, South African entrepreneur Avi Lasarow, says he hopes the companys approach can help take rugby to another level.
Rugby has given me a huge amount over my career. In a small way, this is me helping to give something back, making a difference and pioneering a way where the next generation can be better, and the next generation after them can keep continually improving, he says.
Playing a 1-2% part in making the sport grow to levels that its never seen, Id really love to do that. Its exciting, its truly unique and I cant wait for it to start happening.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU LEARN FROM YOUR DNA
CNNs World Rugby show co-host Christina Macfarlane had her DNA tested, and compared her results with Habanas.
Both have the genetic ability to quickly recover between training sessions, meaning they can potentially do hard workouts within 24 hours of the previous one. They have a low/normal risk of soft-tissue injury -- based on genetic markers for resilience of ligaments, tendons and joints. However, Macfarlane had a greater response to power training -- a 60/40 split -- meaning she gets more benefit from heavier weights and high intensity levels than volume-based endurance exercise, though both should be included in any program.
On the diet side, Macfarlane has a medium-high sensitivity to carbohydrates, meaning she is more efficient at absorbing calories from such food sources. If weight management was a problem, this would be a key area to address. Her fat sensitivity is low, so this may be a better source of calories. Her antioxidant and omega-3 requirements are normal, but she needs to increase her vitamin D and calcium intake for bone health.
She is a fast metabolizer of alcohol, meaning it leaves the blood quicker, and can get an increased performance boost from a small caffeine intake prior to training -- but has a gene which means elevated consumption can deplete bone mineral density.  CNN

CID questions Gota : Over Keith Noyahr abduction
The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) questioned former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for over three hours over the abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr yesterday.
The former Defence Secretary was questioned whether he was aware of the abduction of the senior journalist as he was in charge of the security apparatus at the time of the incident.
The CID also questioned Rajapaksa over claims that he intervened in ensuring the release of Noyahr in the wee hours of May 23,2008.
CID sources said the former Defence Secretary will be summoned for another round of questioning soon. Noyahr who was Deputy Editor of The Nation was abducted
on May 22 , 2008 and mercilessly beaten by an unidentified group and held for over seven hours.
Noyahr wrote critical analyses of Sri Lankas security situation in his column Military Matters under the the pseudonym Senpathi then.
The CID arrested six Sri Lanka army personnel attached to the Army Intelligence Directorate, in connection with the assault on Noyahr. A Major of the Intelligence unit is also among the suspects.

Sudaththa Thera told a news conference that Muslim political factions were trying to label Gnanasara Thera as another Prabhakaran who was igniting racism and causing harm to the Muslim community.
According to them Gnanasara Thera is the worst criminal in the country and the one who is destroying the archaeological sites in the country, the one who has destroyed forest reservations and the one who bring drugs into the country, the Thera said. On the contrary, he said, Gnanasara Thera raised his voice against the destruction of the Sinhala Buddhist archaeological sites and the clearing of forest reserves in the country.
Speaking further Sudaththa Thera said several attempts had been made by several extremists groups to assassinate Gnanasara Thera and contracts had been offered to these groups. Obviously if the accusation of Thera is real, police should give serious attention provided of course BBS makes a complaint with relevant evidence. In this foremost Theravada Buddhist country, where president, prime minister and IGP are all Theravada Buddhists, there cannot be any chance for harassing and intimidating reverent Buddhist monk by Muslim political factions. Certainly it is a difficult thing to believe.
Attacks on Muslim religious centres
It is true that a warrant had been issued to arrest Gnanasara Thera. In this country warrants are issued and carried out by judiciary and police when necessity arises, hence it is faulty to say that there is no one in charge of issuing the warrant. Said warrant has been made after complaints not only by Muslims, but also from Sinhala and Tamils. Hence it is, totally unreasonable to believe that there is an attempt to abduct Gnanasara Thera and assassinate him.
It is good that Sudaththa Thera said the BBS was not responsible for the attacks on Muslim religious centres and that there should be credible inquiries regarding these attacks. We also condemn these attacks. Investigations should be made to arrest Muslims who attacked their mosques, he said.
Thera also wanted many leaders arrested; the list included Chief Minister Wigneswaran, NPC Sivajilingam, State Minister Vijaya Kala, Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and NUA leader Azath Salley. We can compare what is happening here with the democratic developments taking place in Myanmar. There is much to learn from what is happening there, while we could be an example for them to follow in the field of mass participation for democracy.
On May 23, 2017 Myanmars State Sanga Maha Nayaka (MHN) Committee - government appointed a group of monks responsible for regulating the countrys Buddhist clergy, inspired by the new government and announced a four-point order effectively banning the Organization for the Protection of Race and Religion, known as Ma Ba Tha.
The latter was established on June 27 2013 and has spent the past four years promoting its version of Buddhist nationalism. It successfully lobbied for four race and religion restrictions which became law in 2015, with that attacked Suu Kyi. The former President U Thein Sein supported the four proposals, so Ma Ba Tha threw its support behind him and condemned the NLD ahead of the 2015 general election. When the vote was drawing near, Ma Ba Tha stepped up its attacks on the NLD. But then the NLD won. Initial speculation suggested that Ma Ba Tha would disappear. Yangon Regional Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein said in July 2016 that the organisation was unnecessary. But it remained.
In Myanmar, before the democratic change, Right wing organisations attacked National League for Democracy party (NLD) and Aung San Suu Kyi, painting them as pro-Muslim and anti-Buddhist, while they conducted pro-Buddhist social campaigns.
Suu Kyi was condemned as a western stooge with alien habits and behaviour. Her defence of human rights was also considered to be due to cultural influence of the west. It is somewhat similar to the campaign of Mahinda who attacked Ranil as a product of western culture. They never expected Suu Kyi to win but their hopes were shattered. Inspite of a military controlled constitution a chance for democracy has emerged in Myanmar. People's organisations have started to function, while democratic Buddhist Sangha have come forward to counter sectarian racist organisations.
Buddhist organisations
Even before the order announced on May 23 the MHN has tried to make moves against Ma Ba Tha. On July 12, 2016 the MHN released a statement declaring that Ma Ba Tha was an organisation not in line with existing Sangha (Buddhist) organisation law and rules. But it failed to state whether MBT was legal and didnt clearly condemn it. We can compare this with our Yahapalana measures taken against Lankan racist Buddhist organisations; both are considered Theravada Buddhist countries. No need to import liberalism from the west; Theravada thinking include liberalism in general practice.
In Myanmar, despite its weak legal implications, the move still garnered considerable praise from Myanmar democrats, although some were more reserved in their assessment. However it is generally accepted that Ma Ba Tha has largely stopped its anti-Muslim activities and anti-democracy sermons. At the same time the organisations central leadership based in Yangon has taken steps to distance itself from the hate-mongering of its more provocative, controversial campaigners like U Wirathu and likeminded groups such as the Patriotic Myanmar Monks Union and the Myanmar National Network.
The MHN has attempted to take action against these other Buddhist nationalist groups before the democratic take over. They banned U Wirathu from preaching for one year. In defiance, he continued to tour the country, asking his deputies to give speeches on his behalf and playing pre-recorded speeches while he would sit with his mouth covered with two pieces of red and black tape (red referring to the NLD flag and black to Muslims).
Monks from the Patriotic Myanmar Monks Union and civilian Buddhists from the Myanmar National Network and the Patriotic Association continued to stir trouble. But most of those monks and people are now in prison, facing trial, or in hiding. So the MHN order on May 23 could be the final blow to Myanmars Buddhist nationalist movement. But the anti-Muslim, anti-democracy, anti-human rights and anti-inclusion discourses that Ma Ba Tha preached and propagated in the past four years will linger among their staunch supporters.
According to the constitution military has control over two ministries. Hence, another potential hurdle is that the military-controlled Ministry of Home Affairs may not fully implement the MHN order. The state will have difficulty in countering Ma Ba Thas four years of spreading intolerant ideology across Myanmar. One cannot be sure of whether the state, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture will quickly and effectively respond to Ma Ba Tha if it comes back in another form. Similar to Lankans, the people of Myanmar should intervene to release the constitution from dictatorial bonds, in particular the ties to the military. Also the constitution should protect the rights of minority nationalities.

Dozens dead after gunman torches Philippine casino
THE PHILIPPINES: A masked gunman set fire to a gaming room at a casino in the Philippine capital on Friday, igniting a toxic blaze that killed 36 people, authorities said, but they insisted it was not a terrorist attack.
The victims suffocated inside one of the main gambling venues of the upscale Resorts World Manila, while dozens of other people were injured in a panicked crush to escape, police said.
The gunman committed suicide inside a hotel room by burning himself about five hours after storming the casino with an M4 assault rifle and a bottle of petrol that he used to start the fire, police chief Ronald Dela Rosa said. Dela Rosa and other police chiefs insisted the assailant was not carrying out a terrorist attack, pointing out he did not shoot anyone, and said it appeared to be a bizarre robbery attempt by a deranged man.
This is not an act of terror. There is no element of violence, threat or intimidation that leads to terrorism, Dela Rosa told reporters. However 36 people died from inhaling smoke from a fire that spread quickly because of flammable carpet on the gaming room floors, according to Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde. The gunman initially disappeared into the chaos of smoke and running people, leading to a five-hour manhunt through the complex, which also includes a hotel and shops, according to Dela Rosa.
He said the assailant, who appeared to be a foreigner because he spoke English and looked caucasian, was found just before dawn in a hotel room having committed suicide. He lay down on the bed, covered himself with a thick blanket, apparently poured petrol on the blanket and burned himself, Dela Rosa said.
Before the gunman had been killed and police had confirmed any motive, there was an unconfirmed claim of responsibility from the Islamic State group. US President Donald Trump also branded it a terrorist attack. But Filipino officials were adamant it was not related to terrorism.
This particular situation in Manila is not related in any way to a terrorist attack, presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella told reporters. Dela Rosa said the man, acting alone, walked into one of the gaming rooms and fired the rifle at a large television screen, then poured gasoline onto a gambling table and set it alight. - AFP

EU allocates 300,000 for flood victims
The European Commission yesterday announced the allocation of 300,000 for emergency assistance to communities affected by floods and landslides in Sri Lanka, a statement issued by the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said.
Full statement: The European Commission is allocating 300,000 (LKR 51 million approx.) in humanitarian funding to Sri Lanka to bring emergency assistance to communities affected by the recent floods.
This contribution from the EU will allow our partners on the ground to provide relief to the most-impacted families. This is an expression of solidarity from the European people to the people of Sri Lanka, said European Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Commissioner Christos Stylianides.
The EU-funded assistance will focus on the most pressing needs of the affected families in the immediate aftermath of the floods, including access to clean water and sanitation facilities, the provision of essential household items, as well as emergency shelter. The EU funding is being made available via the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) through its Small Scale Response mechanism. Additionally, the Commissions Emergency Response Coordination Centre has activated its Copernicus mapping service upon request from the World Food Programme. The Copernicus maps will focus on the Southern and Western areas of Sri Lanka that have been affected by the rains.

Everyone should join hands to help disaster hit people: Mahanayake Theras
Everyone should join hands to rebuild the lives of the community affected by the recent national disaster, the Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas said in a statement issued yesterday.
Relief efforts should continue until the lives of the people affected by landslides and floods are re-established, they said.
The statement was issued by Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanne Maha Nikaya and Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Mahanayake Thera.
The statement added that the devastation caused by the floods and landslides which followed the heavy deluge was immense. A lot of lives were lost, several others gone missing and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced. We should resolve to continue relief efforts without disruption until people's lifestyles were re-established, the statement said.
The prelates said they would conduct Punyanumodana to invoke blessings on the government, electronic and print media institutions, state and business institutions, the public and the Maha Sangha engaged in providing assistance to the distressed people.
It would also be pertinent to apportion part of the funds earmarked for Poson festivals and decorations towards relief work, the Theras said.
At the conclusion of Poson pinkam, it would also be appropriate to share a thought about the people who lost their lives and transfer merit on them, they said.
The Prelates said they would invoke the blessings of the Trividha Ratna and the sacred Tooth Relic on the flood affected people to enable them restore their lives speedily.
They would transfer merit on those who lost their lives, they said.

Garrincha: Remains of deceased Brazilian football legend 'missing'
The remains of deceased Brazilian football legend Garrincha are missing, members of his family say.
The remains of the winger, who died in 1983 aged 49, may have been lost in an exhumation, relatives told O Globo.
Garrincha played 50 times for Brazil between 1955 and 1966, helping his nation to World Cup victory in 1958 and 1962, when he shared the golden boot.
His daughter Rosangela Santos said: "My father did not deserve this. It's very upsetting not knowing where he is."
She added: "The mayor has promised him a mausoleum but they need to find him first."
Garrincha's cousin Joao Rogoginsky told O Globo that when another member of the family died and was buried in the same place 10 years ago, Garrincha's bones were removed to be placed in a niche.
However, he said he did not attend the exhumation and "the family did not receive any documents".
An administrator of the cemetery in Mage reportedly said: "There's no certainty that he's buried. We have information that the body was exhumed but there is no document that proves this."
Local mayor Rafael Tubarao has proposed exhuming the grave again, with the family's permission, to conduct a DNA test on what remains there are.
Brazilian cemeteries are usually split into two sections - those with tombs where bodies are buried, and walls with drawer-like concrete niches where ashes or bones are stored.
There are two tombs with Garrincha's name on them, O Globo said. One is a plot where Garrincha was originally laid in 1983 alongside other members of his family. The second is marked with an obelisk and was built in 1985.
Garrincha, which means "little wren" in Brazilian Portuguese, was regarded by many as the greatest dribbler of all time.
But his career was blighted by drink problems and he died of of cirrhosis of the liver.

Global warming dissipates Western alliance
Disagreement over the Paris Climate Accord of 2015 has dissipated the alliance of Western powers. This week President Trump announced the decision of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Accord which pledged to reduce the global emission of Green House Gases (GHGs) to 20 C above the pre-industrial levels. The Accord has also set a limit 1.50C as its target to be achieved by 2020. One hundred and ninety seven countries signed the Accord and of them 147 have ratified it so far. Only Syria and Venezuela did not sign the Accord.
Reduction of global warming is a matter of life and death for the human species. If it becomes impossible to reduce global warming below 1.50 C, Greenland ice cap would melt, and so would the Himalayan ice. This would raise ocean levels and island nations would face the danger of being submerged in the ocean.
Nepals President Bidhya Devi Bhandari
An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working Group Assessment Report (WGAR5) outlined the following consequences of global warming:
* Risk of death, injury, ill-health, or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island developing states and other small islands, due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise.
* Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods for large urban populations due to inland flooding in some regions.
* Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and emergency services.
* Risk of mortality and morbidity during periods of extreme heat, particularly for vulnerable urban populations and those working outdoors in urban or rural areas.
* Risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings.
* Risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semi-arid regions.
* Risk of loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for coastal livelihoods, especially for fishing communities in the tropics and the Arctic.
* Risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for livelihoods.
Nepal's Parliament Speaker Onsari Gharti Magar
China (20.09 percent), the United States (17.89 percent), and the European Union (13.24 percent) are the regions with the highest levels of GHG emission. Russia emits 7.13 percent and all other countries 33 percent. Hence the withdrawal of the United States from the Accord will affect the Accord considerably and would make the realization of its objective more challenging.
President Trumps decision is in keeping with his America First agenda. It is no secret that the Republican Party has been receiving generous funds from the coal, oil and gas industries that were clamouring against the climate accord. For example the Federal Election Commission has found after investigations that the party received US $ 9 million from those industries during the election campaign. Recently 22 Republican Senators requested President Trump to withdraw from the Accord. It was reported in the media that these Senators received US $ 10 m as campaign funds from the US coal industry.
Though the withdrawal could benefit the workers in the US energy field temporarily, it would in the long run affect them too as renewable energy becomes cheaper and predominant in the future. That is why forward looking companies in the US energy sector too are against President Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord.
The European Union and China have criticized the American decision to withdraw from the Accord. They are also opposed to the proposal of President Trump to renegotiate the Accord to suit US concerns. Leaders of Germany, France and Italy have openly criticized the US decision while Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Nations have expressed dismay at it. Smaller European nations such as Denmark too have joined the critics. At the time this edition went to the Press a joint communique on defending the Accord was to be announced in Brussels at the EU-China Summit held from June 1-2.
By withdrawing from the Accord the United States would also lose its leading role in the Western alliance and globally too. In contrast, China has been faithful to its pledge in reducing GHG emissions and has even fulfilled its obligations. Both China and the EU are ready to accept a greater burden in view of the additional challenges to the Accord arising from the US withdrawal. At present China is the world leader in renewable energy generation and the EU has the lead technology in the sphere. Hence EU-China cooperation would be a significant positive factor in the realization of the objectives of the Accord, even without the US.
President Trumps America First policy is leading to its isolation in the world arena, especially its relations with Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has openly declared that Europe would have to take its fate into its own hands as it could not depend on the United States any more.
Women power in Nepal
It was Vladimir Illych Lenin, the founder of Soviet Russia who said that the emancipation of women is an index of the degree of democracy existing in a country. In this sense, despite the arrogant claims of politicians Sri Lanka seems to be even behind Nepal, our distant Himalayan neighbour.
Even though both patriarchy and caste discrimination are more pronounced than here in Sri Lanka, the newly reborn Nepal following a violent revolution that took place in the early years of the first decade of the new Century has again made significant advances in womens participation in elections and democratic governance. In Parliament both the Speaker and the President are women. The Chief Justice of Nepal is also a woman.
The new Constitution approved in 2016 after 8 years of deliberations has mandatory provisions for women representation. Though considered modest by external standards the current local government elections are proving that it has given a fresh boost to women power that even Sri Lanka with over 80 years of Universal suffrage could be put to shame.
According to the results of the first part of the election that was held on May 14th already 4 Mayors, 65 Vice-Mayors, 8 Village Council Chairpersons, 263 Vice-Chairpersons have been elected. Some more results are expected. According to non-confirmed reports four more women are likely to be elected as Vice-Mayors.

The Government again showcased its inability and lack of readiness to respond to a national disaster, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Speaking to the Daily News he said that past two years could be pointed out as the years with the most hazards reported in the country.
Alahapperuma said the country's leaders should find out the causes for this incident and should take the sole responsibility for this disaster.
He said the Government had been unable to provide relief to the victims of the previous disasters and that had seriously affected to the trust of the victims towards the Government.
MP further said the elderly population and children had been most prone to the recent floods and landslides.
Alahapperuma said that the Government was only capable of providing relief to the affected but had neglected to give attention to the disaster management aspects.

HRCs role needs to be respected: Satkunananthan
The Government needs to respect the role of the Human Rights Commission (HRC) and have a proper understanding of it, Human Rights Commissioner Ambika Satkunananthan said yesterday as she explained lack of effectiveness of the HRC in the current policy making and legal reform process.
For the Human Rights Commission to be successful in pushing for policy and legal reform, the government has to be responsive. The government has not shared draft legislation with us, there have been instances where we have made repeated requests and to date we have not received any of what we asked for,added the Commissioner.
She was addressing a forum at the launch of the National Partnership to End Violence Against Children by 2030.
HRC Chairman Dr.Deepika Udugama too had earlier voiced concerns over the same issue.
Satkunananthan also asked that the government take a more constructive approach to dealing with social issues and fulfilling its obligations in the international arena,
We have a culture of denial, we have a problem in denying we have a problem in domestic violence or child abuse; especially when we are in front of international fora. When we go before treaty bodies, when we go before periodic reviews, we need to take a more constructive approach and note that these recommendations are helpful for us to bring about change and not look at it as adversarial process,she said as she referred to Sri Lankas poor performance in the international human rights arena.
Despite such failures to act, the Women and Child Affairs Ministrys efforts at launching the National Partnership to work with government and Non-Governmental Organisations to end violence against children will look at the issues of; improving quality of the evidence on violence against children, physical and humiliating punishment, sexual and gender based violence, children in institutions, child marriage, online safety and emotional wellbeing and mental health of children.
Satkunananthan who touched on a recent study conducted by the HRC on children in 11 state institutions remarked that, Institutionalising of children was increasingly becoming a first option of care, rather than adopting other child friendly alternatives such as community integration or working closely with families to support these children.
In addition, socio-economic factors were also driving parents who cannot afford to childcare to institutionalize their children.
A total of 14,175 children at present live in 414 state institutions which mostly lack minimum facilities and standards to operate.
Satkunananthan recommended that; a period of time for institutionalisation should be mentioned, every district should have transit home to house children, institutions should have at least one permanent counsellor in their cadre, compulsory education at least up to age of 14 be provided, more juvenile courts are needed to fast track cases and minimize psychological damage to children who are already traumatized, establish a one-stop service which provides the child with all legal and other support so the child does not have to keep repeating the same story, proper information management system of childrens information and sharing of this information with different institutions that have to coordinate, mandatory training for staff, minimum standards for institutions.
Most importantly, the issue needs to be approached in a rights based perspective rather than that of charity, said Satkunananthan and as she added, The primary goal should be reunification with the families and strengthen family structures for both mothers and fathers.

India cricket tension mounts after resignation
NEW DELHI, Friday  Tension over the future of India's head coach Anil Kumble grew Friday after a top cricket administrator resigned slamming the Indian board for its handling of the controversy.
Amid a reported battle between team captain Virat Kohli and Kumble, a deadline for applications to become head coach passed this week without any announcement by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Top names like Virender Sehwag and Australia's Tom Moody have reportedly applied for the job which comes vacant when Kumble's one-year term expires after the Champions Trophy. Kumble is also in the running.
Ramachandra Guha, who quit a Supreme Court-appointed four-member committee overseeing the BCCI, backed Kumble to be given an extension.
Guha, in a letter written to the committee of administrators (COA) chairman Vinod Rai, criticised the BCCI as he gave reasons for quitting the post that he only took on January 30.
Guha confirmed to AFP the contents of the letter published by Indian website Scroll.in.
"The Indian team's record this past season has been excellent; and even if the players garner the bulk of the credit, surely the head coach and his support staff also get some," Guha wrote. AFP

## Title: INSIDE THE SECRET WORLD OF THE TENNIS LOCKER ROOM
## Supertitle:

INSIDE THE SECRET WORLD OF THE TENNIS LOCKER ROOM
Maria Sharapova once described the womens locker room as my least favorite place in the world.
Sharapova, of course, wont grace the clay courts of the French Open -- the second grand slam of the season -- this year after tournament organizers denied the Russian a wild card, but her blunt description gives an inkling of the tensions that arise within a space that is rarely talked about in any sport.
Yet what happens in the locker room, where access is restricted to players and coaches only and where the big stars vie for supremacy, is almost as important as what happens on court.
There is such a thing as locker room power, former British Davis Cup player Arvind Parmar told CNN Sport.
Players on a hot streak can build a reputation amongst their peers that theyre a man in form, said Parmar, who retired in 2006 after a decade on the mens tour and now works as a coach and broadcaster.
Take Rafael Nadal, the odds-on favorite to win an unprecedented 10th French Open title after a 17-1 run on the red clay this spring in Europe. The aura is back.
Right now he has a huge amount of locker room power in the fact that if you were drawn against him, he is already a break up in both sets, said Parmar.
Its pretty intimidating knowing youve got to play one of the top guys who are in form like Nadal at the moment. Psychologically, there is a huge advantage to have, he added.
RITUALS
Craig OShannessy was coaching at the French Open in 2013 when he was nearly run over in the locker room by a player sprinting past at full speed.
If I had been walking out half a second earlier we would have had an awful collision, and I was a little angry, said OShannessy, who is also the strategy expert for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the mens ATP World Tour.
I was wondering who this guy was. And I look back and it was Rafael Nadal.
The 31-year-old Spaniards pre-match routine includes a long series of rituals that include taking a freezing cold shower to invigorate himself before putting on his headphones while his trainer bandages his feet.
After putting grips on all six of rackets himself, Nadal will then wet his hair before putting on his bandana before using the cramped space of the locker room to do a series of short, violent bursts of exercise.
It is very intimidating, OShannessy said. If you are an opponent of his, and seeing this pre-match ritual of maximum intensity, a lot of times the matches can be won or lost right there.
As a coach, OShannessy would advise a player to go somewhere else where hes not. Go to another locker room. Dont let that have an impact on you, dont watch it.
FRIENDSHIPS
Perhaps the most gladiatorial of all individual sports besides boxing, tennis is unique in the way all players have to share the same facilities as their biggest rivals, even on finals day.
Given whats at stake, youd expect the locker room to be a place of heightened tension and anxiety where its hard to make friends.
Its tough for me to imagine being friendly and having a friendship with someone and then the next day going out on the court and trying to beat them, Sharapova explained in an interview with US broadcaster Larry King in 2013. I dont think thats fair.
Sharapovas reluctance to make friends may explain some of the criticism she has received from her fellow players when she returned from a 15-month doping ban last month. Although former world No. 3 Pam Shriver said she was one of the more social, talkative players, with lots of friends on tour, the American pointed out some of the great champions of the past also needed a bit of distance.
I can tell you that Steffi Graf and her locker room demeanor is not unlike what I think Maria Sharapovas is like, Shriver, an ESPN broadcaster who won 20 major doubles titles with Martina Navratilova between 1978 and 1997, told CNN Sport.
Which is to keep a very strong, isolated boundary and you are just in your own preparation, you are in your own world and you dont really need anybody to prepare other than your team.
Even Chris Evert for a while really felt like she needed to isolate in order to get the best out of herself, Shriver added.
Its not just the women who struggle with the boundaries of friendships in the locker room.
Top-ranked Andy Murray and second-ranked Novak Djokovic were firm friends when they played each other in the juniors but put their friendship on hold when they started to contend for titles on the mens tour.
PECKING ORDER
Although the French Open locker rooms are luxurious with comfortable couches and wooden lockers, nothing beats Wimbledon, where attendants draw players an ice bath to aid recovery or a warm bath to relax in one of its marble tubs and even serve tea and biscuits.
The bigger the star, the more privileges they get when it comes to locker room perks, according to Parmar.
The locker room attendants are the same people each year and once a player has a locker they then try and give those players that same locker each year, said Parmar.
To mark the retirement of 22-time major winner Graf, French Open organizers engraved her playing record on the door of her locker, No.19, and gave it to the German as a gift.
And to illustrate just how irreplaceable Graf is, the tournament locker room now has an 18b, but no No.19... Roland Garros said on its website.
Although the French Open has two locker rooms, one at the main Court Philippe Chatrier and one at the Court Suzanne Lenglen, its second showcourt, nowhere is the pecking order between the sports superstars and its journeymen more clear than at Wimbledon.
The All England Club has a separate locker room inside Centre Court for the top 16 seeds and what is called the North and South mens dressing rooms for the other players.
That main locker room was a lot smaller and lot more intimate, but you really got the sense it was a special club to be part of, said Parmar.
In 2001, the North and South locker room was being used by eventual champion Goran Ivanisevic, who had slumped so much in the rankings he needed a wildcard to enter the main draw.
As he advanced through the tournament, Ivanisevic was offered an upgrade to the top 16 locker room. He refused.
He didnt want to change the routine, Parmar said. Whenever he played, there was an amazing buzz up in our locker room. Everyone would be watching his matches and we almost thought he was one of us.
PRACTICAL JOKES
Although most players are creatures of habit and the locker room is a den of superstitions, there is also time for humor.
One of the biggest practical jokers on the mens tour was the now retired Frenchman Michael Llodra, who once hid naked in the locker of Ivan Ljubicic in Miami in the hope that some of the Croats good form would rub off on him.
These lockers in Miami arent that big, but he climbed in there and the guy opened his locker, and he was there, cramped, Parmar said. It was just comical.
Even with all the rivalries, youre one big family, because you do see each other week in, week out, Parmar said.

Media Minister requests everyones support without divisions
The governments policies are being implemented on three main pillars,democracy, reconciliation, and development, newly appointed Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The minister was addressing senior officials of the Mass Media Ministry, Government Information Department and other representatives from the affiliated institutions yesterday morning.
He requested the support of every media for the successful implementation of governments development drive despite the differences in race, religion and politics. Sri Lanka has one of the most active media industries in the region,he added.
Samaraweera said that they have already started the process of giving the executive powers to Parliament. The government always listens to the voice of every community and no country can go forward if it is divided. Although Sri Lanka was a country which could become developed after winning independence in 1948, not taking the right decisions at right time due to various divisions disturbed it. The Minister said that they are planning to establish an Education Authority and by establishing private universities the children of the country will get education while about 30 -40% will win scholarships too.
The Minister further said that many powerful countries in the world extend invitations to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as they maintain a friendly foreign policy with all countries and Sri Lanka should use this opportunity for the development of the country.

Minister Ranawaka says: new laws to regulate disaster mitigation
Many areas including the Judicial process needs to be strengthened to overcome natural disasters, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He also said that most of the canals and streams in Colombo that drain the rain water have been blocked by unauthorised constructions and the legal process giving orders to remove them takes a considerably long period. He added some of the cases get hearing dates to suit the calendars of the attorneys appearing for the litigants.
The cases are fixed at dates which are convenient to the attorneys, Minister Ranawaka said.
But the rains come not according to the calendars of the Attorneys,the Minister said. Minister Ranawaka was speaking at a press conference at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
He added that most of the unauthorised constructions have blocked
many cannals in Colombo. They have mostly been constructed during the last decade. The Minister added that people use various tricks and gimmicks to reclaim paddy fields or marshy lands to construct unauthorised buildings. The law applies to the rich and poor people in a different way. The rich people with their clout can get away with the law on most occasions while the poor segment of society has to abide by it. "I feel sorry about this situation as a Minister, Minister Ranawaka said.
I fear, if this situation continues without a change, the chances of socity becoming criminalised is very strong,the Minister said.
He also said that global warming too has an effect on Sri Lanka being affected by natural disasters. He however added that development programmes such as the Southern Expressway have been constructed without a proper environmental assessment which also has contributed to the flood situation.
Due to this reason, the time has come for us to think not twice but several times when we undertak large scale development programees like the construction of Expressways to the North and to Kandy, Minister Ranawaka said.
He also said that the government is planning to set up proper Safety Centres for the disaster affected people in the respective areas since the people have to stay somewhere or other when they are affected by natural disasters. He also said that there is also a move to set up a center to gather details and data to face such adverse weather conditions in future and issue warnings.
Minister Ranawaka said further further said that even the Meteorological Department has to enhance its technology to make accurate weather forecasts and not just general forecasts.
He also said that there is no point in criticizing the government at times of natural disasters.
All have to get together to restore the country without trying to gain petty political gains during such situations.
The Minister also added that if Nuwara Eliya had experienced such a heavy rainfall, the catastrophe would have been greater.

Ministry focus on changes to Muslim Marriage Act
The Women and Child Affairs Ministry in efforts to address violence against children, stressed the need to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) which provides legal legitimacy to child marriages.
A Country Discussion Paper titled, Preventing Violence Against Children in Sri Lanka, launched by the Women and Child Affairs Ministry yesterday acknowledged the need to address the issue. The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) is currently investigating on best ways address these gaps at the community level.
Minority politics and religious pressure however has stalled all reforms to the MMDA for the past 60 years.
International Committees always look at this issue and ask Sri Lanka to revisit it but it becomes an issue as it becomes political and a country which is willing to take many decisions which are not minority friendly, are extremely sensitive when it comes to touching family law. It is a classic irony, they do many things the minorities do not want in the country but when it comes to women and personal laws, it becomes an issue of political correctness. It is a consistent problem in reforming personal laws, Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children Board Member , Prof Savitri Goonesekere said.
Under the General Marriage Ordinance of Sri Lanka which applies to all citizens except Muslims in the country, 18 is the age of marriage while age of sexual consent is 16; below which termed statutory rape. Under the MMDA however there is no minimum age of marriage.
The Paper also highlighted that in 2009, 13.8 percent of women in Sri Lanka married by the age of 18, with 1.7 percent marrying before the age of 15. In 2011, a qualitative study showed that there had been an increase in child marriage numbers due to better reporting.
The Ministrys publication observed, Child marriage in Sri Lanka is largely driven by teenage sexuality and cultural concerns around unmarried girls being sexually active with marriage intended to legitimise sexual behaviour, including in the context of statutory rape, but, early marriage hinders girls education, economic security, autonomy, lowering their status within the family and community and increasing their domestic and care burdens. It also lead to emotional stress and trauma.
As it is only the MMDA which gives legal provisions for child marriages, Colombo University senior lecturer Dr Farzana Haniffa said activists have not been successful in persuading mainly male legislators to take forward reforms.
A committee appointed by the Justice Ministry in 2009 headed by Justice Saleem Marsoof to look into reforms is yet to release its report but Dr Haniffa noted that the report may come out soon with dissenting voices.
We have three groups of reformers, the Muslim Personal Law Reform and Action Group (MPLRAG), the JSM committee which has no consensus within and a group of concerned citizens and the Kandy Forum, she said.
She noted that while MPLRAG was pushing for reforms through a rights based perspective, it was making the community look bad, it is reminiscent in the way in which recent Anti-Muslim community has portrayed the community, she said.
There is push back from the community. In articulating the rights perspective, the criticism should not be done in a way that undervalues the commitment a large section of the community has to religious positions. It must be taken into account in the context that the Muslim community in the last 30 years has become a group that primarily identifies as a religious community, we cannot ignore that as part of the reality of reforms, Dr Haniffa said.

Nadal merciless, Muguruza sails through in Paris
PARIS June 2: Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal lost just one game in a ruthless display to reach the French Open last 16 on Friday, while Garbine Muguruza gained further momentum in the defence of her title.
Nadal demonstrated why he is once more considered the overwhelming favourite at Roland Garros with a brutal demolition of Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili.
The Spaniard romped to a 6-0, 6-1, 6-0 win, narrowly missing out on becoming just the sixth man in the Open era to record a triple bagel.
Perfection I don't know about that, said Nadal, who plans to celebrate his 31st birthday on Saturday by watching Real Madrid play Juventus in the Champions League final.
I think I played very well today. The most important thing is to be through and I played my best match in a while.
Tomorrow at 8.45 I'm going to be in front of the TV for sure supporting my team, hoping that Real Madrid will win another time. Nadal will meet compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut for a spot in the quarter-finals.
Reigning champion Novak Djokovic faces Argentina's Diego Schwartzman later, with the world number 41 through to the third round of a major for the first time.
Muguruza swept into round four of the women's draw with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Kazakh 27th seed Yulia Putintseva.
The Spaniard closed out victory with an ace in a match that featured 11 breaks of serve in 20 games played.
I think the more matches I play and the toughest victories I think gives you self-confidence, successful feeling out there, said Muguruza.
I think it's important with all the three matches that I played that are not easy at all. Muguruza plays either French 13th seed Kristina Mladenovic or American Shelby Rogers, who she beat in last year's quarter-finals, for a place in the last eight. AFP

National action plan to protect child rights
Over 9000 instances of violence against children have been reported to the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) in 2016.
The Women and Child Affairs Ministry launched the National Partnership to End Violence Against Children by 2030 yesterday.
The launch held at Water's Edge, Battaramulla saw the government agencies sign on together with UN agencies, international organizations, civil society, faith groups, private sector, media, children and other key stakeholders to protect children in the country from violence.
The government is very committed to result oriented action to end violence against children and through this platform the government will work in close collaboration with stakeholders to end violence, Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said.
She said the action plan involves dealing with issues in; improving quality of the evidence on violence against children, physical and humiliating punishment, sexual and gender based violence, children in institutions, child marriage, online safety and emotional wellbeing and mental health of children.
The common misconception is that violence occurs outside of a childs immediate circle of trust but evidence suggests that cruelty occurs from members of his or her inner circle,Bandara said .
The biggest hurdle in achieving the target however would be addressing the normalisation of violence as punishment in homes, schools and institutions, said the Minister.
The launch also highlighted studies on sexual and gender based violence which showed that 14 percent of adolescent girls and 13.8 percent of adolescent boys surveyed had experienced some form of sexual abuse while 27.2 percent of Sri Lankan men aged 18 to 49 reported having experienced some form of sexual abuse as a child.
Prof Piyanjali De Zoysa speaking on punishment said corporal punishment was different to physical abuse, Corporal punishment is the use of violence without leaving a mark on the body of the child while physical abuse leaves a mark. Excessive use of corporal punishment leads to physical abuse. But in Sri Lanka only physical abuse is an offense but corporal punishment is still legal, she said.
In a survey conducted by the NCPA, 70 percent of 12 year olds have experienced corporal punishment while teachers said they only used corporal punishment on 60 percent.
There is a circular issued by the Education Ministry advising teachers not to use corporal punishment but only 20 percent of teachers were even aware of the contents of the circular, Prof Zoysa said.
She stressed the need to ensure that legal provisions be introduced to include corporal punishment as an offense, a stance also concurred by the Minister.
Minister Bandara said the government was in the process of finalizing a draft National Policy on Child Protection and was preparing a new policy document on child care, child protection and child alternative care, to support necessary amendments to the Children (Judicial Protection) Bill, and had proposed to include a bill of rights in the Constitution with a special clause to include child rights and protection.

New subject on conflict transformation for higher education institutes
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), chaired by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, in partnership with University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced a new subject on Conflict Transformation and Reconciliation.

Preserving our heritage
UNESCOs World Heritage Sites comprise natural and man-made sites that are exceptionally important for the collective heritage of humanity. There are 1052 World Heritage Sites in 165 countries and territories. Among them are 814 cultural and 203 natural sites, with another 35 mixed sites.
Sri Lanka has an amazingly high number of World Heritage Sites  eight  for a country of its size. Italy, which has the highest number of World Heritage Sites (47) is five times bigger than Sri Lanka. The World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka (in no particular order) are: Sri Dalada Maligawa/Kandy, Dambulla Cave Temple, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Galle Fort, Sigiriya, Sinharaja Forest and Central Highlands. These are all very popular attractions among locals and foreigners alike.
There was speculation over the last few years that the Dambulla Cave Temple could lose its World Heritage Site listing and according to Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Galle Fort is also facing the same risk. The Golden Temple of Dambulla (Len Viharaya) was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1991 and, the old town of Galle and its fortifications were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1988. Their inclusion in the World Heritage Sites list has been a boon for tourism and losing that status would be severely damaging to Sri Lankas tourism prospects as well.
So far, only two sites have been delisted from the World Heritage List  the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany and the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman. Interestingly, both these are natural sites and no man made sites have been delisted. However, UNESCO says that 55 sites (37 cultural and 18 natural) sites worldwide are in danger. For the moment, this does not include the Galle Fort and the Dambulla Cave Temple, but UNESCO will be making an assessment soon.
The Minister said the UNESCO has recently warned that the above two sites would have to be removed from the World Heritage Site list considering their deteriorating condition. The Minister blamed the Department of Archeology for this state of affairs and we agree with him. Obviously, it has not taken adequate measures to conserve them during the recent past. The Minister revealed that the Government has taken urgent measures to improve their conditions and sought the help of international experts.
There is a precedent for the latter. When the Sigiriya frescoes were threatened by vandalism and decay in the late 1960s, the then Government obtained the services of internationally famous Italian artist and art restoration expert Dr. Luciano Maranzi on the advice of Sri Lankas foremost authority on archeology Dr. Senarath Paranavithana, who himself was regarded as a national treasure. They were assisted in this effort by Dr. Raja de Silva, a brilliant chemist. We hope that the Government would be able to obtain the services of a team of restoration and architectural experts both local and foreign to get the two iconic sites back in shape.
Minister Kariyawasam also pointed out another factor - the law has not been implemented by the previous government regarding the illegal settlements in heritage sites. Even in the East, the Department has failed to identify the archeological sites and mark their boundaries. We are glad to hear that the Government is now implementing the law and no illegal settlements are allowed in reservation or heritage areas.
In the light of this revelation, the Government must now review the other six heritage sites too for any sign of decay or damage. Obviously, the requirements for maintaining man-made and natural sites are different. Sinharaja and Highlands face the threat of illicit felling of trees and plants including medicinal plants. Any damage to these sites could also adversely affect the countrys biodiversity, because they host a large number of endemic flora and fauna species.
The archeological and environmental ministries must also draw up a list of other cultural and natural sites that deserve inclusion in the World Heritage List (The World Heritage Committee is meeting next month to decide on this years winners). Today, there is worldwide concern for Dambulla and Galle Fort thanks to the publicity generated by the UNESCO list. If further sites are approved, more interest will be generated in these sites worldwide. The authorities should also team up with Discovery Channel or National Geographic Channel to feature documentaries on the World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka.
It is also vital to train our officials on latest conservation and restoration techniques. They can learn new trends by participating in UNESCO training programmes such as the High-Level Training Course on World Heritage to be held in Beijing in September. UNESCO also recommends having separate museums for world heritage sites which will help educate the visitors and certain antiquities could literally have a far longer shelf life under climate controlled conditions. The Government alone cannot preserve our heritage sites for posterity. Visitors should also be aware of the need to protect these sites. For example, leaving trash at these sites should be a strict no-no. It is only through a collective effort that we can preserve these sites for the future.

Pride and prejudice as India, Pakistan clash
New Delhi, Friday: India have far more at stake in Sunday's Champions Trophy match against arch-rivals Pakistan than launching their title defence -- even if skipper Virat Kohli insists it is "just another game".
The cricket-mad neighbouring countries rarely square off and hundreds of millions of fans are expected to tune in and watch the teams fight for national pride at Edgbaston in Birmingham.
"Don't win the Champions Trophy, but just beat Pakistan and we will give you a grand welcome back home," Indian fan Aman Sood told AFP, summing up the high-stakes contest.
Their few encounters are frequently poisoned by the political rivalry of the day. For almost 18 years, wars prevented either side from visiting the other until the ice was broken in 1978, but even today matches are few and far between.
The two sides have not played a bilateral series since 2012-2013, and India have refused to consider the idea without an end to "cross border terrorism" -- code for militant incursions along the disputed Kashmir border.
The turbulent history places great pressure on Kohli in Sunday's clash. A victory is vital not just for diplomatic point-scoring but potentially securing a berth in the semi finals.
Kohli "is right in calling it just another game, because he does not want to put more pressure on him and the players", said former India opener Chetan Chauhan. "It's the rivalry between the two countries that gets people excited. It is something like England-Australia. Nobody wants to lose to the other," Chauhan, now sports minister in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state, told AFP.
"Every player wants to do his best against Pakistan and vice versa because that (performance) has value and is remembered for a long time. It is a highly charged match."
- 'It's not cricket, it's war' -
India have never lost a 50-over World Cup or Twenty20 showdown against Pakistan, and a win on Sunday would put them in good stead in a tough group also including Sri Lanka and South Africa.

Rain forces no result in Australia-New Zealand Champions Trophy game
BIRMINGHAM June 2:
Rain saw the Champions Trophy one-day international between Australia and New Zealand at Edgbaston on Friday end in a no result.
Australia, set a revised target of 235 to win in 33 overs, were 53 for three off nine overs when the last of several rain interruptions took the players off the field.
A minimum of 20 overs had to be bowled in Australias innings for a result to be possible but so severe was the final downpour that the umpires decided there was no possibility of getting to that mark within the scheduled playing hours.
Both teams received a point apiece for the no result from what was their opening match of the 2017 Champions Trophy, a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international teams.
The main beneficiaries were Group A rivals and tournament hosts England, who launched this years edition with an eight-wicket win over Bangladesh at the Oval on Thursday.
New Zealand, who saw their innings reduced to 46 overs after a rain break of nearly two hours, made 291 all out in 45 They lost their last seven wickets for 37 runs after captain Kane Williamsons excellent innings of exactly 100.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson made a brilliant century but then saw his side suffer a dramatic batting collapse against Australia in their Champions Trophy opener at Edgbaston on Friday.
In a match reduced by rain to 46 overs per side, the Blackcaps were on course for a score well above 300 while Williamson was at the crease during a well-judged innings of exactly 100.
But his run out sparked a slump that saw the Blackcaps dismissed for 291 after losing their last seven wickets for 37 runs in 35 balls.
Josh Hazlewood was the chief beneficiary as several batsmen carelessly holed out, with the fast bowler returning one-day international best figures of six for 52.
Hazlewood took three wickets in four balls to wrap up the innings with an over to spare.
The Blackcaps made a brisk start either side of a rain break after Williamson won the toss and, surprisingly, opted to bat in overcast conditions.
Luke Ronchi led the way with a dashing 65 that saw him launch Pat Cummins high over long-off for six.
Australia had opted against fielding all four of their out-and-out fast bowlers, with James Pattinson the man who missed out on Friday.
Cummins, however, had already proved expensive by the time rain stopped play with New Zealand 67 for one midway through the 10th over.
The players were off the field for nearly two hours and when they returned, Ronchi carried on in a 15th over, bowled by Cummins, that yielded 15 runs.
The third ball was crashed through the covers for four by Ronchi, who should have been out for 54 when the next delivery saw him miscue a pull only for Mitchell Starc to drop the catch at mid-on.
Ronchi celebrated by flat-batting a four before ending the over with a soaring straight six.
Cummins's first five wicketless overs had cost 52 runs.
John Hastings, however, restored some order for Australia when Ronchi found Glenn Maxwell at point to end a 43-ball innings featuring nine fours and three sixes.
New Zealand were now 117 for two in the 16th over after a stand of 77 in 60 balls between Ronchi and Williamson.
Williamson showed touch play could be effective too when he swept off-spinner Travis Head for a four between two legside fielders.
Alongside Ross Taylor, he put on 99 for the third wicket before his experienced team-mate fell for 46 when he holed out to mid-off against Hastings.
Williamson, however, hoisted Hastings for a legside six to go into the 90s before a flicked four and driven single off the same bowler saw him to a 96-ball century, his ninth at this level, with eight fours and three sixes.
His second fifty came off just 34 balls.
But he was then run out going for a sharp single by Moises Henriques's throw to Cummins. Hazlewood dismissed tailenders Adam Milne and Mitchell Santner as they went for big hits. Trent Boult survived the hat-trick but was then caught behind next ball. AFP

Royal enjoys light edge over Trinity
73rd Bradby Shield second leg at Royal Sports Complex:
Royal College will have a slight edge over Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in the second leg of the 73rd Bradby Shield rugby encounter at the Royal Sports Complex today. The junior game for the C. E. Simitharachchi trophy will be played prior to the first XV encounter.
The two teams look almost even but Royal has a slight edge due to having a five points lead winning the first leg (22-17) up in Pallekele, Kandy as well as they are playing front of their home crowd in Colombo. Nevertheless, Trinity too will make every effort to beat the Royalists in their own den. The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning the Bradby Shield in this much looked forward to encounter.
The outcome of the second leg would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball. Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and there is no exception this time too. If the Trinity forwards could secure the good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Royal will face a tough task.
Nevertheless, Royal has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul. When one talks about the success of Royal forwards, it goes back to that invincible side of Royal 2015 with their unsung hero (highest try scorer in the league that year) and rolling maul specialist number eight Supun Warnakulasooriya who scored four back to back tries in the second leg at the Royal Complex. Incidentally he is the present Royal rugby team manager.
Going down memory lane Royal had its best pack in 1988 when burly number eight Lasitha Gunaratne (Bonza), coached by late Dr. Fred Perera (one of the best schools rugby coaches who captained the Reid Avenue school in 1971), produced a champion unbeaten side that won the league and the R. Premadasa Trophy knockout by beating Isipathana (13-0). They also went on to win both their games against Hong Kong school side and a Combined Schools team in Hong Kong during their tour of the island nation. They lost only the Schools rugby 7s to Sudesh Abeysinghes Isipathana College.
Experienced fly half and playmaker Ovin Askey will captain Royal who will make every effort to humble the Lions in Colombo to retain the Bradby Shield for the third consecutive year. But all will depend on how their granite hard forwards will play today.
Royal has enjoyed a fabulous season this year having won all their matches against St. Josephs College Maradana (28-22) , St. Peters College Bambalapitiya (17-10), Dharmaraja College (18-15), D.S. Senanayake College ( 47-7), St. Anthony's Kandy (48-35), S. Thomas College (31-14), Zahira College (65-14), Wesley College (35-19), Trinity College (22-17) and losing only one match to Isipathana College (17-22) to crown themselves 2017 Singer league rugby champions.
In contrast, Trinity had their best team in recent times in the year 1987 as the Lions remained unbeaten under Tyrell Rajapakse coached by Alex Lazarus. The forte of Rajapakse's undisputed team was that they had a speedy back division led by playmaker cum one of the best fly halves the country has produced todate in Shah Doole (now domiciled is USA) that injected superpower to 1987 Trinity outfit.
Leading Trinity in the 2017 Bradby second leg will be number eight Nathan Yee. Trinity has a slightly good record this season placed third in the 2017 Singer league, though they too have failed to remain unbeaten. Trinity has seven wins to their credit winning against Wesley College (64-27) , Science College (52-7), Zahira College (34-26), S. Thomas College (29-14), Prince of Wales College (94-9), St. Josephs College (30-25). Isipathana College (15-10) with St. Peter's spoiling their unbeaten record after a closely fought out battle (13-15) and finally Royal beat them as well to secure the league crown 17-22.
The Bradby Shield encounter is considered the most prestigious match in schools rugby, even surpassing any of the tournament matches. It has a rich history which is second to none when it comes to the sport of rugby. The series is played in honour of former Royal principal, the late E.L. Bradby, since 1945. However the Royal-Trinity inter-school rugby series had begun way back in 1920, long before the Bradby Shield was introduced and turned out to be a two-leg affair.
The first ever inter-school rugby match between the two teams in 1920 was won by Trinity, crushing Royal 26 points to nil. The first leg of the inaugural Bradby Shield encounter in 1945 was won by Royal 3-0 but their joy was short lived as Trinity won the second leg 6-0 and with it became the first holders of the Bradby, awarded on aggregate of points after two matches in Colombo and Kandy.
Of the 72 encounters to date, Trinity takes the lead with 39 wins to Royals 31 and there were two ties in the series in 1992 (3-3) and (0-0) and in 2016 (22-17) and (13-18). Over the years, it has produced many top Sri Lanka players and traditions that could only be witnessed at the Bradby Shield encounter.
Whatever the outcome of the game may be, one guaranteed factor is that the thousands of rugby fans who will fill the Royal Complex grounds to capacity are assured of a game of fast open rugby.
Subramanium Sujamthakumar, the captain of Royals rugby team in 1980, skipper of CH and FC 1983 and former Sri Lanka scrum half now domiciled in USA, will be the chief guest at today's second leg. Todays big encounter at Royal complex will be refereed by Rohan Fernando.

Shortage of Dengue drug Dextran, alleges GMOA
The Government should take immediate measures to supply superior quality Dextran as soon as possible in order to treat dengue patients as there is a shortage of this essential drug, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Health Ministry has a stock of Dextran imported from India but consultant doctors had recommended not to prescribe this drug to patients because of its poor quality. They have recommended good quality Dextran imported from Thailand, Dr. de Zoysa said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the GMOA has received information on another order allegedly placed by the Health Ministry to import low quality Dextran from India again. This order should be immediately cancelled. The GMOA will be vigilant on this issue, he said. The GMOA will extend its fullest support to save the lives of dengue patients. The Health Ministry should take immediate action to control dengue because the disease can reach epidemic level in flood affected areas with receding waters. Other communicable diseases can also breakout in the flood affected areas. The GMOA has already conducted over 200 health camps in flood affected areas, Dr. de Zoysa added.

Some groups are trying to gain political mileage out of the emergency disaster situation in the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said.
Minister Athukorale pointed out, while the government and the private sector are on a mission to provide immediate relief to victims of the disaster, some groups are trying to take political advantage out of the situation.
In a disaster, people are victimised despite their differences. Therefore, it is the responsibility of a government to provide facilities to these people treating them as equals. While compensating the affected, we will take precautionary measures against impending disasters as well, Minister Athukorale said. She also pointed out, unlike the previous regime which paid only Rs.15,000 as compensation per victim, the present government is paying Rs.100,000 as compensation for death of each victim.

South Africa focus on bowling might
Sri Lanka sweat on Mathews fitness:
LONDON, Friday - In a tournament where the batsmen are expected to reign supreme, AB de Villiers has set his side a lofty target for Saturday's ICC Champions Trophy 2017 clash against Sri Lanka: bowl the opposition out. While everyone else is trying to work out how many runs is enough, or even if such a figure really exists in modern-day ODIs, de Villiers believes the best answer is to simply cut an innings off at its knees.
The South African captain's ambitions stem from their recent matches against Sri Lanka - in their last seven encounters, Sri Lanka were bowled out all but once, and on four of those occasions they were dismissed for under 200. Of course, the majority of those games were played in South Africa on pitches that offered something for the bowlers, while the last six ODI innings at The Oval have yielded an average score of 332 for five.
The fact that no total looks particularly safe at the ground leaves teams with a quandary when it comes to selection: do they stack the batting and prepare for a battle of the heavy artillery, or do they prioritise out-and-out bowlers who might take wickets at key times and limit the damage That question is particularly relevant for South Africa, who have no fewer than five all-rounders and do not have an obvious first-choice XI.
That is a difficult decision, especially for a game like tomorrow's, de Villiers said on Friday (June 2). We know that we have an opportunity and the ability to bowl the Sri Lankan side out. It's a matter of getting that combination right and getting the right players on the park to do so.
To me it's really important to get your top three to four bowlers in there. Not that the allrounders can't take wickets but I'll probably be leaning towards getting your best bowlers in to make sure we have our best chance to bowl them out and to get 10 wickets in the game.
That would suggest that Morne Morkel will take his place in the attack along with Kagiso Rabada, Wayne Parnell, Imran Tahir and either Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo or Dwaine Pretorius. As the quickest bowler and most threatening batsman, Morris would appear to be the obvious pick, but then balance in South Africa's side is not only cricket-related. They need to average six players of colour with two black Africans in their side, which will always give Phehlukwayo - a fast-emerging all-rounder in his own right - a bit of an edge.
While Morkel was still recovering from injury when Sri Lanka toured earlier this year, the other bowlers all rotated through the series. Every combination proved too much for Sri Lanka, but Upul Tharanga sees reasons why they might be up for the challenge this time around.
When we lost 5-0 to South Africa, we played on wickets that had grass, he said. But in England it's totally different. These wickets are flat. Even during warm-up games we scored 300-plus. We are confident that we can put a decent total on the board.
They are the number one team, true, but they will be under pressure as well to beat us. We have done really well in ICC events and raised our standards. The other fact that you should not forget is that all our leading players are back in the side. We know what we did wrong in South Africa. It's an opportunity to correct those mistakes.
RAIN POSTPONES MATHEWS FITNESS
Sri Lanka's balance will depend on Angelo Mathews's fitness. He was scheduled to take a fitness test at the end of training on Friday, but Sri Lanka's session was cut short when the rain swept into The Oval. His participation will now be decided on the morning of the match, and Tharanga confirmed that Mathews will play as a specialist batsman if he is able.
On Thursday, Bangladesh's decision to play an extra batsman at the expense of a specialist bowler hurt them when they were unable to halt a rampant English batting line-up. Like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will go into this game as underdogs and must find the best balance for the circumstances.
We will play seven batsman, said Tharanga. The wickets are too good and we need four specialist bowlers. Even if Angelo can't bowl, we have other bowlers who can chip in among the batsmen.

U18 rugby - 6 from Kandy
Sri Lanka under 18 sevens squad is in training for the Commonwealth Youth Games which will be held in Nassau in Bahamas from 19 to 23 of July featuring twelve countries. In this squad of 12 Kandy schools have provided six top players Mohamed Shabeer and Ishara Liyanage from St.Anthonys College, Naveen Rajaratnam, Warren Weerakoon and Vishwa Ranaraja from Trinity College and Dulanjala Piyatissa from Dharmaraja College.

Kandy hockey to get back to its former glory
Once again Kandys club hockey looks like going to be healthy and successful with most of the members of the newly elected Kandy District Hockey Association promising results. A herculean effort is being made to get back to the former glory days. They hope to commence with a seven a side tournament followed by the league and knockouts.
Cue sport pots off the table
Billiards and snooker have taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch the table lights and today the cue room has become a store room.
Lawn tennis needs a fillip
At one-time lawn tennis was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during DIG Bodi Liyanage's time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way. A big hand should go to former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer the late D.H. de Silva who was a live wire and produced some top players using the Garden Club courts. But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity without any back up, nor any attempt to revive it.
Asgiriya 102 years
The Trinity College ground at Asgiriya, which was an International stadium, is 102 years old this year. This sheer cliff face was gradually transformed into one of the loveliest cricket grounds. When the wicket was first laid in 1915 there was only one clay strip which was thereafter gradually extended over the years. The first ever cricket game at this ground was between Trinity and S.Thomas and the old pavilion still stands. The first centurion at Asgiriya was Antonian Jack Anderson. After Test status was granted for Sri Lanka in 1982, late Gamini Dissanayake who was the president of BCCL upgraded the ground to International status. All Test playing countries have played at this grounds until the new Test venue came up at Pallekelle.
Nalaka assistant coach
Former Kingswood College, Kandy Youth SC, CR and FC, Kandy S.C. and Sri Lanka ruggerite, who was excellent in kicking goals and to touch Nalaka Weerakkody is helping the Sri Lanka under 18 sevens team as assistant coach.

US warns Beijing on South China Sea islands

The US will not accept China's militarisation of man-made islands in the South China Sea, Defence Secretary James Mattis has warned.
Speaking at a security conference in Singapore, he said such moves undermined regional stability.
China's territorial claims in the resource-rich South China Sea are contested by several nations.
At the same time, Gen Mattis praised Beijing's efforts to restrain North Korea's missile and nuclear activity.
His comments came shortly after the UN Security Councilexpanded targeted sanctions against North Koreain response to a series of missile tests conducted this year.
The council voted unanimously to back the sanctions after weeks of negotiations between the US and China.
In his speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue forum, Gen Mattis said: "We oppose countries militarising artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims.
"We cannot and will not accept unilateral, coercive changes to the status quo."
President Donald Trump and other senior US officials have repeatedly stated that they would protect its interests in the South China Sea, a key shipping route.
During his nomination hearing earlier this year, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that the US was "going to have to send China a clear signal that first the island-building stops, and second your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed."
In response, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing would "remain firm to defend its rights in the region".
But in Singapore Gen Mattis also struck a positive note on US-China relations, saying that while competition between the two countries "is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable".
The biggest question amongst Asian delegates attending the forum has been how much of a role the US will continue to play in this increasingly tense region, the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Singapore reports.
She adds that Gen Mattis sought to reassure his peers that the US was not turning its back on Asia.
What is the South China Sea dispute
Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.
Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs and carrying out naval patrols in waters also claimed by these other nations.
Although the previous US administration of Barack Obama insisted it was neutral, it spoke out strongly against the island-building and sought to build ties with, and among, the South East Asian nations whose claims overlap those of China.
In July 2016, an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict.
The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences.

The West Indies Cricket Board, on Wednesday changed its name to Cricket West Indies, Johnny Grave, the new chief executive, announced. In addition, the team will now be called Windies.
"Cricket West Indies better reflects how the organisation operates, as there are many different stakeholders who we work in partnership with, under the unifying aim of improving cricket at all levels within the region," Grave said. "We plan to work even more closely with them over the next few years and consultation will begin immediately as we develop a new strategic plan for 2018-2023."
Dave Cameron, the president, said the new name appears more inclusive and appropriate.
"Whilst the Board of Directors has an important role, we feel that the new name is more inclusive and appropriate, as we want to recognise the valuable role that our players, territorial boards, staff, supporters, governments, coaches, match officials and volunteers, play in the organisation," he pointed out.

Writ petition fixed for support
Killing of 27 inmates at Welikada Prison:
The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for support for July 7 a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal Justice Rohini Walgama and Justice S. Thurairajah, the petitioner was directed to serve notices on the Attorney General within a week.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody when the alleged incidents took place had filed this writ petition citing Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, Inspector General of Police, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner said he was wishing to bring to the attention of the Court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the tragic incidents for obtaining relief.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm, the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that there was an argument between prison officials and the Army and STF contingent waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation. The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10. By that time, 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
The petitioner stated that although four years has lapsed since the killings of the prisoners, no action has been taken by the Police or the Attorney General to conduct an investigation and prosecute the offenders.
The petition was filed through senior counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera.
