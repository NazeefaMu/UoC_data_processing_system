Tourist arrivals  to reach 3.6 mn in 2020 - Fitch
Fitch expects Sri Lanka tourist arrivals to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% over the next four years (2016: 14%), driven primarily by the rapid increase in the inflow from Indian and Chinese markets. Fitch expects tourist arrivals to reach 3.6 million in 2020.
Aggregate tourist arrivals from India and China have trebled over the past five years, and accounted for more than 30% of the total tourist population in 2016. We expect governments destination-promotion campaigns, which are directed primarily at Asian markets to boost arrivals from Indian and Chinese regions, to outpace European traffic over the medium term.
Fitch does not expect a considerable rise in earnings per tourist over the medium term despite the widely anticipated growth in tourist arrivals. Sri Lankas earnings from tourism could be hampered by a number of factors such as limited exposure to lucrative niche markets such as meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions/events (known as MICE), and the rapidly growing influence of short-stay and low-spend tourists from emerging-Asian regions.
We expect daily tourist spend to record a CAGR of around 5% over the next four years, and to fall marginally short of the governments target of USD210 by 2020. Consequently, we believe Sri Lanka will continue to lag most of the developed tourism markets which generate over USD500 in daily earnings per tourist.
The limited array of exclusive niche tourism products which would entice high-spending up market tourists is also a driver. For example, MICE, remains significantly under-exploited, accounting for less than 1% of tourist arrivals in 2016.

Treasury Bond issue: Former CB Governor Cabraal gave top appointments  in banks to his relatives
It was revealed yesterday before the Treasury Bond Commission that former Governor of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal, while holding office, had several of his close relatives appointed to top posts in banks coming under the purview of the Central Bank.
This information transpired after a member of the Monetary Board Nihal Fonseka, who also happened to be a first cousin of Cabraal testified before the Commission and from whom expert opinions were sought with regard to several matters under the Commissions probe.
Accordingly, Cabraals first cousin, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and his brother-in-laws daughter were holding directorial positions in banks which came under the Central Banks supervision.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva cross examined the witness with regards to the conflict of interest that arose following the said appointments. De Silva s client, former Governor of the Central Bank Arjun Mahendran, was extensively questioned at the Commission with regard to the conflict of interest between him and his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius who owned a Primary Dealer company, when Mahendran was the Governor of the Central Bank. Mahendrans stance on the matter was that he did not discuss official matters with his son in law in his official capacity. Allegations were leveled against Mahendran that he gave insider information to his son-in-law.Counsel was in agreement with Fonsekas opinion that there was no conflict of interest with regards to these appointments.
RS: Mr. Fonseka you are closely related to Mr. Nivaard Cabraal
NF: Yes, he is my first cousin. His mother and my mother are sisters.
RS: Mr. Nivard Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank at the same time you were the CEO of the DFCC, which comes under the supervision of the Central Bank. And, the DFCC itself was a Primary Dealer.
NF: DFCC itself was not a primary Dealer. They dealt with government securities in the market.
RS: Was there anything wrong in your view for you to be (De silva PC rephrases the question) I am suggesting to you that there is nothing wrong that you were the CEO of the DFCC while your first cousin Nivard Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank. I would say there was nothing wrong at all.
NF: Nothing wrong.
RS: No conflict of interest at all
NF: In that kind of a relationship, no conflict of interest at all.
RS: Now Mr. Nivard Cabraal has also given evidence before the COPE that his brother-in-law Ravi Thambiah was a Director of the DFCC.
NF: Yes, he was.
RS: At this point of time, Mr. Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank.
NF: Yes.
RS: Ravi Thambiah is married to Cabraals sister as well. Now Mr. Thambiahs appointment must have gone through the Monetary Board. I am suggesting to you that there was nothing wrong with Mr. Thambiah being a appointed as a Director of the DFCC while Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank
NF: No. There is nothing wrong in it.
RS: I also agree that you are right. Then when Mr. Thambiah left, his daughter became a Director of the DFCC. And her appointment also was sent to the Central Bank for approval and Mr. Cabraal was the Governor. I am suggesting to you that there is nothing wrong with the appointment.
NF: In my view no.
RS: Even I agree with you. So there was no conflict of interest
NF: No.
RS: Mr. Cabraal has stated that his brother- in- law Mr. Sunil Wijesinghe was the Chairman of the NDB. The NDB comes under the Central Bank supervision. I suggest that Wijesinghe being the Chairman of the NDB is nothing wrong.
NF: No, I dont see anything wrong in there.
RS: Mr. Cabraal has also said that Ms. Dhara Wijethilake was a Director of the Sampath Bank.
NF: I am not aware of that. I will take it as correct.
RS: Dhara Wijethilake is the sister- in- law of Cabraal. Cabraal is married to Dhara Wijetilakes sister. So I suggest there is nothing wrong in being a Director of a bank coming under the supervision of the Central Bank where Cabraal was the Governor.
NF: No, nothing wrong.
RS: You were also the Chairman of the Acuity partners. Subsidiary of the Acuity Partners is a Primary Dealer. Being the Chairman of a Primary Dealer while Cabraal was the Governor, I would suggest there was nothing wrong regarding the arrangement.
NF: Well, he is my first cousin. But by that time, my close association with Cabraal was not there. We had sort of grown apart professionally. I also want to qualify my answer saying that I was a non-executive Chairman of Acuity Partners. I was not involved in their day to day activities.
RS: Yes, but you were its Chairman.
Meanwhile, De Silva then questioned Fonseka on another possible conflict of interest with regards to Monetary Board member Krishantha Perera. According to De Silva Krishantha Perera was the Chairman of the Ceylon Tea Broker, which is an associated member of the Capital Alliance. De Silva observed that Capital Alliance is a primary dealer. So, Krishantha Perera being the Chairman of Ceylon Tea Broker and being a member of the Monetary Board, I suggest to you that there is nothing wrong in it. De Silva PC asked. Fonseka said he is unable to give an opinion without knowing the dynamics of the two companies. However, he said assuming if such a relationship is there between the two companies, Fonseka observed that Krishantha Pereras position as a Chairman and being a member of the Monetary Board, is not a conflict of interest.
Previously at the Commission ,when a similar case was brought forward with regards to Mahendrans conflict of interest in comparation to Cabraals sister being a Director of the Perpetual Capital Holdings, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena observed that two wrongs in any way dont make a right.

Vincent van Gogh film is first-ever to be fully hand-painted
A new animated movie about Vincent van Gogh is on release. Loving Vincent tells the story of the Dutch painters life.
Each of the films 65,000 frames was hand-painted by professional artists, many chosen by Greek production company Studio Bauhaus.
Loving Vincent is the first fully hand-painted film, explained StudioBauhaus producer Konstantinos Vassilaros.
Twenty Greek oil painters took part in the production. We have a close relation with Animasyros [international animation festival], so to celebrate the films official release, weve re-created a large Van Gogh painting. And weve animated it, just like we did in the film.
The first stage for the directors was to shoot the film with real actors. And then the 65,000 frames had to be painted by the artists.
There were a lot of challenges, artist Alexandra Bari told Euronews.
A lot of work. We had very specific rules to keep in mind as we painted and we followed the directors guidelines in detail. There was a lot of pressure.
In the beginning we had to understand and study his painting style [Vincent van Gogh], and learn his technique and combine them into our work, artist Nikos Koniaris told Euronews. It was very very difficult to imitate such a great master.

Loving Vincent is releasing from October 20 at MC Colombo, Empire Arcade, Regal - Gampaha and other film theaters islandwide

A wise move
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to walk the gauntlet and put paid to the accusations and innuendos made by the Joint Opposition following mention of his name in the Special Presidential Commission proceedings in regard to the alleged Central Bank Bond scam. The Premier has volunteered to present himself before the Special Presidential Commission probing the Bond issue and offer clarifications into the areas where references were made to him during the ongoing proceedings.
The PM's office, issuing a statement, said that the Premier is ready, at anytime, should the commissioners require him to respond, in view of references made to him in the public proceedings. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is prepared to offer clarifications at any time to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond auctions in view of references made to him during proceedings, it stated.
If Prime Minister Wickremesinghe follows up on his intention and appears before the Commission it will be the first time that a serving Prime Minister of this country, will mount the witness stand and submit himself to the questions of the Counsel of the Commission. Not that the dock is something alien to the Premier. As Leader of the Opposition, he was summoned to give evidence before the Batalanda Commission and subjected to a virtual inquisition, in what turned out to be a media circus. It is better that the Premier silences his critics, once and for all, rather than allow his name to be bandied about freely in connection with the Bond affair, as the JO spokesmen appear to take pleasure in doing, at present.
Even his worst critics would concede that Premier Wickremesinghe is above reproach in matters of probity which has even earned for himself the sobriquet Mr. Clean'. Even Chandrika, amidst a bitter Presidential Election campaign, in 1999, made no bones about this fact. It is clear that the Joint Opposition is all out to besmirch this reputation of the Premier and is today making various allegations against him based on certain references in regard to him at the Bond commission. The fact that the Premier had offered to clarify matters before the Commission and submit himself to the searching questions of the State Counsel, itself, is a clear pointer that he is on solid ground as regards propriety. Hopefully, this will put paid to the vilification campaign launched by the stalwarts of the JO, who all have corruption cases against them pending in the courts and are clearly drawing a red herring to detract from this fact by the making baseless charges against the PM.
The statement from the PM's office also says that the government was committed to investigate the allegations made against it or its employees in line with the mandate received on January 8, 2015 to restore democracy and good governance. Senior members of the UNP were told that he (PM) should have an opportunity to respond, because, his name had been mentioned during the proceedings. This, no doubt, has been pounced on by the JO as a handle with which to use against the PM. By doing so, they clearly hope to position themselves as paragons of virtue. Now, with Premier Wickremesinghe volunteering to go before the Commission, it certainly is going cause a huge dent in the JO campaign, with the government poised to wrest the initiative.
Already three senior ministers were summoned before the Commission in an unprecedented development and now the Prime Minister, no less, is about to testify. Could one have imagined a similar development under Mahinda Rajapaksa On the contrary, daylight robbery became the norm and the high and mighty shielded from any probe. The very fact that a Presidential Commission is probing the government's own ministers, certainly, is an indication that the Sri Lanka has reached the status of a mature democracy. Every effort should be made to preserve this status and make even government leaders accountable for their acts.
The government, some may argue, had committed hara kiri by appointing such a commission where its own members are being probed. Hence, a similar commission should be appointed to investigate the financial scams of the Rajapaksa era as well, such as the Greek Bond affair and the stock market fiddling. Today the crooks in the Rajapaksa government are apparently rubbing their hands in obvious glee at the difficulty the government is placed in, of its own accord. Hence, the need to expose the deeds of the Rajapaksas. We say this because apart from a few court cases, that seem to get prolonged inexplicably, the crooks and plunderers are sitting pretty and cocking a snook at the government. The commission proceeding have also allowed pro- Rajapaksa media to go to town with the revelations, burying with it the mega scams under the Rajapaksa regime. Whatever happened to the FCID probes that were carried out with much publicity It appears that things have lost steam, while the government continues to score own goals by allowing itself to be investigated and invite the wrath of the general public, commendable though the development is.

The minority communities, especially Muslims, play a vital role in the new constitutional reforms for their rights. If the North and East are merged, the people in the East will suffer a lot, Hameed said. The recent Amendment made on the Act of Provincial Council Elections will mostly affect the Muslims in the East and other provinces.

Many drug dealers are now active in and around schools and universities of the Kurunegala District, targeting senior students and undergraduates.

Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan said the new prison would ease the congestion at countrys prisons.
The Minister was speaking at the opening ceremony of the prison on October 16 at Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota.
The new prison was set up in line with the international standards and Rs. 4,996 million was spent to construct the prison and it would accommodate 1,500 inmates.
The Tangalle Prison has facilities only for 180 inmates but it holds now 1200 inmates, the Minister said. The Minister said the foundation stone for the new prison was laid on May 16, 2014 and it was opened on October 16 this year. He said Welikada Prison inmates would be relocated at the new prison. The island had 35,000 prisoners at all the prisons and today, the number had decreased to 25,000, he said. The new prison comprises a gymnasium, swimming pool and a fully fledged playground, he said. The Minister said young people were spending their prison terms at all the prisons.
They lose their education and their expectations are shattered. Anger and hatred should be taken away from the minds of the people. Then things that lead to unruly acts will not occur. Any institution has disciplines for its proper function.
It was the bounden duty of the prison officials to look after the inmates so that they would be good citizens after they leave prisons, he said.

Indian fishermens poaching reduced due to Navy operations
As the 3rd round of ministerial-level bilateral talks between India and Sri Lanka concluded over the weekend, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah is confident that the Navy has put a stop to Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
In the last few months, arrests have dropped, said the Commander, speaking to the Daily News, yesterday.
His proof is the vastly decreased number of boats being apprehended by the Navy. Between July to August, the Navy apprehended 24 boats but from August to date, they have only caught eight.
The numbers are proof that we dont have Indian fishermen coming into our waters, said the Navy Commander.
He explained that in the last two months, since being appointed as the Commander of the Navy, he had changed the deployment pattern in the North, increasing their presence operations in the North by tenfold.
We have taken assets used in other areas and concentrated them on the border. The type of vessels used has also changed from Fast Attack Crafts (FACs) to Fast Gun Boats (FGBs), which are bigger and tougher platforms, actually designed for this type of tasks, said Vice Admiral Sinniah.
Our operations are transparent and visible right now, unlike being clandestine earlier. The latter method was wrong. You can be clandestine when fighting a war but it is not necessary afterwards. We are on the Sri Lankan International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). So when guarding the IMBL, you need to be seen. This is what has made the big difference in the Indian fishermen not coming into our waters, he added.
The Navy has also changed their concept from Arrest and Harass to Warn and Deter.
We are helping Indian fishermen maintain their position in Indian waters, so that they dont have to stray into Sri Lankan waters. When they do stray, we take them out and send them back to India, because these fishermen need help and because India is not capable of giving it to them, we are giving it to them, said the Navy Commander.
Bilateral talks between India and Sri Lanka have continued for many years with no visible outcome being reached due to the belief that the poachers cannot be stopped. However, Vice Admiral Sinniah dismissed such claims to assert that it could be stopped with the right level of commitment.
When people told us that we cannot fight the LTTE, and that it will go on forever, everyone believed it, he noted.
Since the change in naval tactics, Tamil Nadu fishermen have ventured into the shores of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, inciting protests from area fishermen. Vice Admiral Sinniah believed that this change was due to them being prevented from entering Lankan waters.
They have nowhere to go now. So they are trespassing into Andhra and Kerala. It is direct proof that our operation has been 100 percent successful, said the Navy Commander.

Seized Indian  fishing vessels  will not be released
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said Indian fishing vessels taken into custody for crossing the Sri Lankan maritime boarder and bottom trawling would not be released under the Bottom Trawling Act and the proposed Foreign Fishing Boat Amendment Act.
Amaraweera said he informed the representatives of Central Government of India at the Indo-Lanka ministerial level meeting on the fishermen issue held in New Delhi that such vessels would not be released on humanitarian grounds in future.
"The Draft bill on Foreign Fishing Boat (Amendment Act) was approved by the Cabinet and it will be presented in Parliament soon," he said
Minister Amaraweera said the Sri Lankan delegation he headed apprised India Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Radha Mohan Singh that Indian fishermen crossing the Sri Lankan maritime border and bottom trawling would be arrested and the practice would continue.
Our discussion also focused on the arrest of Indian fishermen crossing the Sri Lankan maritime boarder and bottom trawling.
We were able to convince them that these fishermen are arrested for bottom trawling in the Sri Lankan territorial waters, he said
He said the Indian delegation headed by Indian Minister Radha Mohan Singh informed him that the Indian Central Government has allocated Indian Rupees 15 billion to provide alternative livelihood to the fishermen involved in bottom trawling.
Amaraweera said the number of fishing vessels crossing the Sri Lanka water has reduced by 50 percent after adopting strict regulations by the Government.

Alleged plot to kill Maldives President: Police to record statement from Sri Lankan suspect

The Ministry of Justice through police has sought Colombo Chief Magistrate Courts permission to record a statement from a Sri Lankan in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the incumbent Maldives President Abdulla Yameen in 2015.
The Ministry of Justice had made a request from Colombo Chief Magistrate that the Colombo Crimes Division be permitted to record a statement from Yassari Danushka Perera regarding the incident.
The Ministry of Justice in Sri Lanka had decided to initiate a magisterial inquiry into the incident following a request by the government of Maldives in terms of Section 10 (1) of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act No.25 of 2002.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the counsel who appeared on behalf of Yassari Danushka Perera told court that his client was not present in court since he is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo.
President Abdulla Yameen narrowly escaped injury when a blast struck the boat he was using to return home from the airport on October 20, 2015.
The vice-president of the Maldives Ahmed Adeeb had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate the president.

Another batting debacle gives Pakistan 2-0 lead in series: Sri Lanka top of the flops
Monday: Sri Lanka batsmen undid the superb performance of their bowlers as they collapsed in a heap chasing a moderate target of 220 to hand to Pakistan a 32 runs win in the second ODI and a 2-0 lead in the five-match series at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Monday.
It was Sri Lankas ninth straight defeat in ODIs and at the moment they look a team shipwrecked in the middle of the sea with no land in sight.
Babar Azam celebrates his second back to back century in the second ODI against Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Skipper Upul Tharanga staged a late rally trying to pull things around for his team with a defiant century, but Sri Lanka had lost too many wickets at that stage to mount a challenge against the Pakistanis and they were bowled out for 187 in 48 overs.
Jeffrey Vandersay contributed an useful 22 off 55 balls helping his captain in a eighth wicket stand that realised 76 off 100 balls but once the partnership was broken it was all over for Sri Lanka.
Tharanga remained unbeaten on 112 scored off 144 balls (14 fours) to become the first Sri Lankan and the tenth batsman in ODIs to carry his bat throughout an innings.
The last time Tharanga made an ODI century 119 against South Africa at Cape Town in February Sri Lanka lost by 40 runs.
The Lankan bowlers especially Lahiru Gamage who took a career best 4 for 57 restricted the strong Pakistan batting line up to 219-9 despite another excellent century from the in-form Babar Azam on a slow pitch that batsmen found hard to get the ball off the square.
Sri Lanka needed to score at the rate of around four runs an over and what looked like an easy target soon became a much larger one when from a promising position of 70-2 they slumped dramatically to 93-7 to the leg-spin of Shadab Khan who picked up three wickets in that spell to break the back of the Lankan batting.
It was substandard batting by the Lankans who just dont seem to have a batsman of class in their line up to dictate terms to the opposition.
As in the first ODI only one batsman from the top six made a half-century and on this occasion it was captain Upul Tharanga who rode his luck to score a fine century.
Tharanga could have been dismissed three times during that knock at 13 (dropped by Shadab at extra cover and by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed), 20 (dropped by Babar at slip) and 29 (caught behind). It was a rather rickety innings but in the circumstances a vital one for his side.
Sri Lanka fast bowler Lahiru Gamage who took a career best 4 for 57 reacts after taking the wicket of Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman for 11.
So bad was their batting that they failed to capitalise on some poor catching by the Pakistanis who dropped four catches overall.
Suranga Lakmal and Gamage rattled the Pakistan top order with some superb bowling on the slow track after Pakistan won the toss and chose to bat first.
Gamage once again impressed in his opening spell capturing two wickets 32 in 7 overs  Fakhar Zaman (11) and Mohammad Hafeez (8) while Lakmal was also equal to the task picking up the wicket of out of form Ahmed Shehzad for 8.
Pakistan were guilty of not rotating the strike regularly  a malady that was affecting Sri Lanka during the Indian series  with 40 dot balls being played out in the first 60 balls of power play.
Perera continued the good work of the opening bowlers by making a double strike off successive overs to send back the dangerous Shoaib Malik (11) and Sarfraz Ahmed (8) to have half the Pakistan side out for 79 at the end of the 20th over.
Babar Azam once more proved to Sri Lankas stumbling block. Following a horrendous run in the Test series against Sri Lanka where he managed only 39 runs in four innings Babar has fought himself back to form in the one-dayers starring in Pakistans 83 runs win with a match-winning century in the first ODI at Dubai and yesterday followed it up with another defining century  101 off 133 balls (6 fours) that lifted Pakistan from a despairing 101-6 to 219-9 to give themselves with a fighting chance.
Babar anchored the innings but could not find a suitable partner until Shadab Khan arrived at the crease at the fall of the sixth wicket at 101. Shadab gave excellent support to Azam and was involved in a record seventh wicket stand that raised 109 off 136 balls. Shadab went onto remain unbeaten on 52 off 63 balls (1 four)  his maiden ODI fifty. Sri Lanka took three wickets in the final over with Gamage outstanding.
Both teams went into the match unchanged. The third ODI will take place at the same venue on October 18.

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant for the arrest of former Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management Ivan de Silva over a Rs.4.1 billion financial fraud alleged to have taken place in the Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project.

The warrant written in English and Sinhala was issued on the former Ministry Secretary since he is abroad (New Zealand).
The FCID stated that although the 2015 budget had allocated a sum of Rs.40 million for this project, a sum of Rs.2,902 million had been paid to a Chinese Company without governments consent. It is alleged that payments amounting to more than Rs. 4.1 billion have been made to a Chinese contractor for the Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project, but no work has been carried out.
Police investigations further revealed that money given to the Chinese company had been remitted to a Hongkong company belonging to Thirukumar Nadeshan.

Austrian Peoples Party leads in national vote: KURZ SET TO BECOME EUROPES YOUNGEST LEADER
AUSTRIA: Austrias 31-year-old Foreign Minister declared victory for his party Sunday in a national election that set him up to become Europes youngest leader and puts the country on course for a rightward turn. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz claimed the win as final results announced by the Interior Ministry showed his Peoples Party had a comfortable lead with almost all the ballots counted.
Noting that his center-right party had triumphed over the rival Social Democrats only twice since the end of World War II, Kurz called it a historic victory.
Today is not the day of triumph over others, but today is our chance for real change in this country, he told cheering supporters.
Still to be counted are more than 800,000 absentee ballots and ones cast by voters outside of their home districts. The outstanding votes are due to be tallied by mid-week.
However, the votes counted so far show that Austria, where moderate policies have been the norm for decades, will have a government with a harder line on migration and Muslims than one running the country now.
Both Kurzs party and the right-wing Freedom Party  Kurzs most likely government coalition partner  campaigned on the need for tougher immigration controls, quickly deporting asylum-seekers whose requests are denied and cracking down on radical Islam.
Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said the Peoples Party received 31.4 percent of the vote, a gain of more than 7 percentage points from the 2013 election. Kurz described that as the biggest jump in support in the partys history.
The Social Democratic Party of Austria, which now governs in coalition with Peoples Party, had 26.7 percent, while the Freedom Party had 27.4 percent.
The election returns suggest a harder line on immigration resonated with voters more strongly than Social Democratic calls for social equality. Social Democratic Chancellor Christian Kern acknowledged as much, saying Sundays results reflected a push to the right. The Social Democrats were also hurt by charges of dirty campaigning after Israeli political adviser Tal Silberstein, while under contract to the party, launched Facebook platforms crudely mocking Kurz and suggesting the young foreign minister was anti-Semitic.
Much of the Peoples Partys appeal has been credited to Kurz. Since taking the helm in the spring amid growing strains within the governing Social Democratic-Peoples Party coalition, he moved his center-right party further to the right.
Even though he is part of the present government, Kurz also presented himself as an engine of change for voters disenchanted with the political status quo.
The last time the Freedom Party was in government was 17 years ago. While no expects a repeat of the EU sanctions slapped on Austria because of the partys participation, critics of the Freedom Party in and outside Austria have expressed alarm at any government role for the euroskeptic party.
President Alexander Van der Bellen, who must swear in the new government, said he puts great value on pro-European government. He narrowly defeated a Freedom Party candidate in last years election for head of state.

Beauty in diversity
The Miss Tourism Sri Lanka pageant was inaugurated in 2016 with the goal of grooming ambassadors with beauty and brains to support the endevour of positioning Sri Lanka in the world map. Sabeetha Ruwanmali Wanniarachchi who was crowned as Miss Tourism Sri Lanka 2017 will be representing the country at the world pageant in January 2018. Sabeetha represents a clan of dynamic and passionate youth in the present context who possess an enormous capacity to excel in their chosen fields.
Being a Degree holder Sabeetha is presently reading for her MBA in business management. She can speak four languages and her passion is to combine beauty with brains. Gym workout is an essential part in her daily calendar. Being a student of Brian Kerkovans modeling academy, Sabeetha (58) occupies herself as a ramp model as well as a photographic, fitness and bridal model.
What was your inspiration to become a professional model
When people saw me some years back they used to ask me whether I am a model. Some commented that I have a toned body which is ideal for modeling. Those comments inspired me a lot.
At the inception I did only bridal modeling because of my education. Eventually I planned to get into fashion modeling. I learnt a lot from Brian Kerkoven and now I work as a Brian Kerkoven model.
Why did you want to try your luck at the Miss Tourism Sri Lanka 2017 contest
In my childhood I dreamt of being a beauty queen. When I got into modeling I got to know about beauty pageants. With my experience in modeling I wanted to work on my childhood dream to become a beauty queen in real life.
Of course, I did my homework first. I found Miss Tourism World Sri Lanka as a very innovative pageant and it is recognized throughout the world. Tourism and economy of a particular country is the main theme of this pageant.
You won the title of four Mini-pageants in MissTourism Sri Lanka 2017.
Yes. We had 14 mini pageants. I was lucky enough to win the titles Miss Personality, Miss Intelligent, Miss Best Cat Walk and Miss Talent to become the contestant who won most titles at the event.
How do you distinguish the differences between modeling and beauty pageants
Beauty pageants basically focus on contestants beauty, intelligence and the core theme. In beauty pageants contestants highlight the beauty of their own personalities and focus on marketing themselves to the world. In contrast modeling pageants mainly focus on how the models promote attires, jewelleries and accessories they wear rather than highlighting themselves.
Both need special skills, exposure and experience.
What do you personally think, attributes a contestant should have to promote her country at Miss Tourism World contest
She should have knowledge about her countrys tourism development, culture, its pros and cons as well as knowledge on her countrys diversity.
What is the USP (Unique selling point) that we should use as a country to Brand Sri Lanka andposition it well in the world map
Sri Lanka is famous for its nice beaches, mountains, waterfalls. But there has been no consistent message to position Sri Lanka well in the world map. According to the tourism industry consultants, Asias Most Authentic, Diverse and Compact Island should be the key selling point of Sri Lanka and I do agree with that.
We must market Sri Lanka tourism with the countrys diversity. Also we must associate attributes that attract the modern traveler. Most importantly, we should follow an integrated marketing strategy on Sri Lanka, which will help to attract high spenders and to increase the number of travelers from across the world.
What are the languages that you can speak and why are you passionate towards learning languages
I can speak five languages; Sinhala, Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam and English. I aspire to have fluency in more than seven languages.
Language is the key to communication. Learning languages is one of my hobbies as same as modeling. I just love both. Actually, why I am passionate to learn languages is, it will help me to communicate easily with people who are only familiar with their native languages. I am hungry for knowledge and knowing different languages will bestow me with more knowledge on people.
What support do you need from Sri Lankans on your endeavour to promote our country at the Miss Tourism world 2018 pageant
I am going to represent Sri Lanka as an ambassador hence I need exposure. I invite personnel in the tourism fraternity to invite me for their events where I can gain more exposure, experience and knowledge on world tourism. I really dont want hold this title without really working on it. Beauty pageants do have mini pageants. I request Sri Lankans to vote for me to win these mini pageants via my facebook page https://www.facebook.com/sabeethawanniarachchi/ Miss Sri Lanka Miss Tourism World 2017: Sabeetha Wanniarachchi Links for official Miss Tourism World are; Website: www.misstourismworld.com Facebook: www.facebook.com/MissTourismOfficialPage
Thirdly, would prefer companies working on CSR to invite me for their events as I love social service.
What are your future plans
I want to become a company director one day.
Since I am Miss Sri Lanka 2017, I look forward to add value to the Sri Lankan tourism industry as an ambassador and promote Sri Lanka. I aspire do something for the modeling industry in Sri Lanka too with my experience. Also I love to work on social activities.

Birth of the Dragon : Kung fu nostalgia
Bruce Lee has always been a fascinating figure in the field of martial arts. To pack all of Lee into a 90 minute movie is a challenge for any filmmaker. George Nolfi overcame this hurdle when he decided to focus on one legendary fight that may or may not have happened in Lees life. Birth of the Dragon deals with the story about the legendary showdown between Lee and his nemesis, the martial artist Wong Jack Man.
Set against the backdrop of 1960s San Francisco, Birth of the Dragon is a modern take on the classic movies that Lee was known for. It takes its inspiration from the epic and rotates on the controversial showdown between an up-and-coming Lee and kung fu master Wong.
Work of fiction
The movie is a work of fiction. However the movie does not immediately zero on Lee as it should in the opening chapter. Instead it pinpoints on Steve and his love interest Xiulan. This might disappoint Lees fans as a majority of them would have visited the cinema to see the iconic fighter on screen.
Too much of emphasis on self realization too is evident throughout Birth of the Dragon.
Philip Ng looks good as Bruce Lee. The early swagger and the transformation later are portrayed well. Xia Yu does well as the disgraced Shaolin monk. Both actors do well in acting and fighting. However that is mostly where all the plus points end in the project. Most of the scenes are dull. Even though the fight scenes are one of the films strongest elements they also seem a bit cheesy at times. They reek of being over choreographed too.
Sense of fairness
Lee was well known for his generosity and sense of fairness, but Nolfis movie invokes an arrogant yet gifted upstart who annoyed the Chinese masters with his insistence on teaching kung fu to Westerners and disrespecting its traditions.
The film is more about Man trying to tame Lee and how the latter learns things about himself. That knowledge changes Lee for good which is how the Dragon we see in films is born. For ardent Lee fans, this is not the biopic that they have been waiting for.

BOI enterprise Jiffy Products opens regional office at Mirigama EPZ
BOI Enterprise Jiffy Products S L (Pvt) Ltd recently ceremonially opened a new regional office at the Mirigama Export Processing Zone.
Jiffy Products S L (Pvt) Ltd is the Sri Lankan subsidiary of Jiffy International AS Kristiansand, Norway. Jiffy International AS is a transnational company which is engaged in manufacturing, sales & distribution of plant propagation substrate systems and related horticultural products globally.
Jiffy Products S L (Pvt) Ltd was incorporated in 2003 as a BOI project. The main attraction of Sri Lanka is the availability of coir fiber pith which is derived from coconut husks. This product has become increasingly popular all over the world as a medium to propagate and grow plants.
JPSL began its operations at the Mirigama Export Processing Zone as a BOI project and it has since then extended its operation to four locations of which two are in the Mirigama Export Processing Zone and the other two in Pannala and Kobeigane in the North Western Province.
Currently JPSL is the leading manufacturer of Plant Propagation Coco Products in Sri Lanka. This project is very significant because it is a Norwegian investment. While Norway is not a member of the EU, it is closely associated as a member of the European Economic Area. With growing interest of the European Union in Sri Lanka as a result of the return of the GSP + facility products, such as those manufactured by this enterprise would become more competitive and therefore more attractive to consumers.
This in turn can lead to an increase in investments by companies such as Jiffy into Sri Lanka.
The Chief Guest, Thorbjrn Gaustadsther, Ambassador to Norway in Sri Lanka and the Maldives addressed the audience and stated, I am pleased that Jiffy International AS has opened its regional office for Asia in Sri Lanka. As an established Norwegian company, the success that you see has been achieved due to the hard work, commitment and dedication of the management and the workforce of both, Jiffy Norway and Jiffy Sri Lanka. Jiffy directly and indirectly employ over 10,000 people in Sri Lanka. Since these investments are outside of Colombo, this business has changed peoples lives by creating jobs and bringing prosperity to communities in more remote areas. I take this opportunity to wish Jiffy success and continued prosperity and growth for the company and its people.
Today, Jiffy has the capacity to produce 17,000 MT of Coco substrate volume per annum and export their value added Jiffy-7C pellets, Grow Block, Grow Bags and many others products mainly to Europe, Canada, USA, Japan, India covering 40 different countries in all continents.
Currently the company has about 10,000 direct and indirect employment and pumps over Rs 1billion into the Sri Lankan economy in terms of raw material purchases, direct and indirect employment and to the service sector. A total of 90% of raw material requirement in production is sourced locally.
The Core strategy of Jiffy Sri Lanka is to add value to the raw material (Coir fiber pith and Husk Chips) rather than exporting this valuable resource as unprocessed bulk material.

Catalonia: Spain detains two separatists

A Spanish judge has jailed two key members of the Catalan independence movement.
Jordi Snchez and Jordi Cuixart, who lead prominent separatist groups, are being held without bail while they are under investigation for sedition.
The men were leading figures in the 1 October independence vote, which the Madrid government regards as illegal.
Their detention led to protests overnight, with more expected across Catalonia on Tuesday.
Snchez, who heads the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a pro-independence organisation, and Cuixart, leader of Omnium Cultural, appeared before the High Court in Madrid on Monday.
They are being investigated over a protest on 20 September in which a crowd blocked Civil Guard officers inside a building in Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital.
Following the referendum, Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence, but halted its implementation to allow negotiations.
He has called for talks to take place over the next two months.
However, the Spanish government has warned that Catalonia must revoke the declaration or face direct rule from Madrid.
Puigdemont has also angered Madrid by refusing to clarify whether or not he declared independence last week.
Puigdemont, who has been given until Thursday to clarify his position, hit out at the government on Twitter following news of Snchez and Cuixart's detention.
"Spain jails Catalonia's civil society leaders for organising peaceful demonstrations. Sadly, we have political prisoners again," he wrote.
In a video recorded before his court appearance and released on his Twitter account after his detention, Cuixart instructs separatists to "never lose hope because the people of Catalonia have earned their future".
Pro-independence supporters have called for further protests, demanding the men's release.
Just hours before the ruling, the High Court freed the head of Catalonia's police force, Josep Lluis Trapero.
His force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, is accused of failing to help Spain's Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters in Barcelona during the run-up to the referendum.
Prosecutors had called for him to be held in detention.

Court calls for progress report on killing of 27 inmates at Welikada Prison

The Court of Appeal today directed the Attorney General to file a report in Court regarding the progress of the CID investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012.
A writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners was today re-fixed for support on December 6.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the Attorney General informed court that CID had commenced a comprehensive investigation regarding the incident and achieved a remarkable progress.
 Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time of the alleged incidents took place had filed this writ petition citing Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, Inspector General of Police, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that he was wishing to bring to the attention of the Court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that here was an argument between prison officials and a contingent TID, STF waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation.
The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015

## Title: THE COURT, A LEARNING PLACE

THE COURT, A LEARNING PLACE
In my unending quench of searching for solutions to countrys ills, I thought to turn to my muse WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. All of a sudden, it came to my mind from nowhere very unexpectedly, my favourite play in his oeuvre, Alls well that ends well, my good professor of English Literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura Dr. A.J. Gunawardene once quipped us to dig out the priceless gems in it to serve the nation on a more academic vein. Therefore, I thought of paying a posthumous tribute to him by writing this article in one way and to throw some light on the status quo with regard to the judicial landscape in Sri Lanka in particular and in the world in general. On the other hand, how this great playwright has viewed the human behaviour on planet earth is veritably thought provoking that the whole world ought to harness his explanations to make a brand new world for the people to live in.
The present regime headed by President Maithripala Sirisena seems to be exploiting the great oeuvre by Shakespeare for the future well-being of our sacred land ransacked by fraudsters who say that if they would return to power once again they would revert to the same game, not all but some insane dunder heads.
True to my conscience, the court has been one of my fruitful places of learning since my formative years. My harmless madness to improve my English and knowledge about the world put me on a good stead.
Legal education
As an avid reader of English, I surveyed almost all the aspects of reading news and articles written by learned scholars related to legal education. It made me aware of most of the acts, laws, rules and regulations pertaining to ordinary living. The growing interest in this regard and my desire to appease my hunger made a magnetic effect on me to visit the nearby magistrate court to listen to the court proceedings.
Now I wonder many a time why I didnt become a lawyer rather than a teacher and a writer. Thus, the court became my favorite learning place and I was able to garner a vast wealth of knowledge and a welter of information with regard to litigation and the delivery of judgment. Once a judge told a thief, I hope you wont see my face here again. It is said that the thieves have a divinity for quick quips and he respectfully asked the judge, Oh, my lord, are you going on transfer or retirement.
This very incident enlightened my wits. By listening to much planed out arguments of the then lawyers, I learned many a legal term and improved my vocabulary. It is very poignant that I very recently witnessed that the standard of English of most of the lawyers is below the zero level. I hope that my opinion would be taken as solid rock truth but not contempt to the bench or bar. Once I asked from a leading lawyer at a magistrate court if he would not Take Silk. He promptly answered that he had no time on Poya day as his clients come to meet him. I couldnt help laughing, yet managed to control my emotions.
I have been sitting on the benches at the back of the court listening to court cases for many hours. My favourite cases were murders. My unquenchable thirst made me a member of the jury later in my life and I enjoyed by giving my judgements on critical and complicated cases that were caught in laws delays. To be brief on this count, the hours I spent at court houses rewarded me a lot to argue with police officers and escape punishment.
The recent scenario regarding fraudsters and politicians on the judicial landscape is of paramount importance. The heavy fines meted out to them at the public courts and a dozen of commissions could serve as deterrent if they take them in the right sense. The callous disregard to law and order of the country has dragged them into a treacherous bog of utter disgrace. Their political life is ruined.
Public officials
The million dollar question is that how they could appear before their voters again Seemingly guarding angels of democracy and public interest have turned the foes of the nation. The Swords of Damocles are hanging over them. Least said sooner mended. Yet, the legal eagles of JAGGERS CALIBRE are having a field day in the absence of such as our legal luminary Dr. Colvin. Ill-gotten money is in rotation, from the purse of the politicians to the shrewd legal eagle.
The court is a good training ground for public officials and the police officers who take the rules unto themselves and harass the innocent public. In the recent past, very many public servants learnt bitter lessons for the crimes they had done being arrogant to the general public. Long years of imprisonment away from their near and dear ones would open the eyes of the arrogant bureaucracy.
The officers who are the guardians of the long arm of law almost get their careers terminated for authoritative manner of carrying out of their entrusted duties. It is heard that, at present, from top to bottom of the bureaucratic hierarchy give a second thought before stamping their great seal below the signature. Thats enough for the people from GOOD GOVERNANCE.
The general public is greatly benefited by the court as a learning place. Their legal education takes place there. Some litigants who came out from a magistrate court told me that they had learnt a lot from their cases, but economically ruined due to exorbitant charges the lawyers maintain. In a sense that is also reasonable because the lawyers are not benefited by EPF or any gratuity. They also have to spend a lot to become a lawyer and should have the creativity to fabricate untruth. In my presence one lawyer, now dead and gone told a criminal to tell him the truth that he would fabricate the lie on his behalf to win the case. Even one visit to a court could give you dividends. But many a tube light is also in the profession.
Court proceedings
To those whose wish is to become a lawyer one day, the court is an ideal learning place. The arguments of the veteran lawyers could widen the horizon of the listeners, but the poor performance of some lawyers made me discouraged. Teachers can garner much knowledge from the court if they at least step into a court once in a way. The recent court case before the Indian judiciary with regard to a child marriage is thought provoking.
Editors and news reporters gather a lot of information regarding the legality of their careers and improve the power of expression through court proceedings. I myself was profusely benefited by a case heard at a magistrate court to write a short story titled JAILBIRD in this newspaper itself. The jailbird told the magistrate that it was the society that made him a criminal, and so he was innocent. For the enthusiastic language learner, the value of the court is immeasurable.
Even the judges and moreover even a retired chief justice, the court be a sacred learning place to reflect on his previous judgements to rejoice or lament as the case may be. Helping an accused is undone by using the great seal. Lawyers themselves could sharpen their teeth at the court in this learning process. The poets, the playwrights, writers and short story writers and also the cartoonists could gather authentic sources for writing.
To clinch over, the writer would like to bow down his head to the great playwright WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE for leaving behind this great utterance for us to see the world from a different angle.
The relevance of this great utterance is felt more at this juncture as the country is passing through a very crucial period of jurisdiction involving heavy weights in the sphere, veritably battle hardened with their wits.

Digital Disruption: IQ leads the charge in Sri Lanka
For the first time in Sri Lanka, Innovation Quotient (IQ) is bridging the gap between human insight, applied creativity and technical capability. And its bringing these solutions to top corporates, businesses and start-ups around the country.
Sri Lankas digital transformation is imminent and IQ is leading the charge as the only tech-creative-consultancy hybrid to offer design thinking and innovation focused on digital transformation to tackle complex business issues.
IQs portfolio covers digital transformation, tech solutions, rapid prototyping, digital marketing, campaign management, and also includes a media lab.
In 2013, Nadira Abdul Cader and Irfan Ahmed led a founding team consisting of tech and communications veterans such as Johan Latiff, Shafraz Faleel and Arshad Ahamed alongside marketers and innovators to venture into a space unchartered in Colombo. The IQ team has since grown to include a diverse set of 40+ creatives, tech specialists, strategists and managers, all coming under the umbrella of the Aberdeen Holdings Group in a short span of four years.
IQ has grown from a start-up making waves with its unusual business model to a budding organisation led by a unified vision, brave clients, growth hacking, lean methods and some luck, says Director, Nadira Abdul Cader. We havent been talking about the work we do because weve been so focused on doing it right. Our team prefers to let the work speak for itself and it does so loud and clear.
Business has certainly kept them busy - currently, the IQ team is working on three apps, two disruptive platforms, managing over 10 different social media communities that engage an audience of over 300,000 followers for leading brands, and consulting multiple clients on digital innovation projects.
They are also focused on getting the metrics right. IQ has formulated a Digital Readiness Index that uses the globally coveted Deloitte Digital Maturity Test, Aark Digital Maturity Assessment and Third Sector Digital Maturity Index as a base, mapping against the teams expertise on disrupting digital space to assess a participant organizations digital readiness in the Sri Lankan context.
Via a short 10 minute test available online (at www.IQ.lk), the participant company is assessed under five pillars - strategy and leadership, customer engagement, organization, talent and digital operations. A full report is generated at the end of the assessment.
IQ exists for one thing-bridging the gap between creativity, technology and strategy, says CEO Irfan Ahmed. Were moving into a world where you either disrupt, or you are disrupted. Just look at all the start-up unicorns making headlines. Theyve all disrupted their industries and the existing players have had to face rapidly changing market realities because of this. You can see the same happening in Sri Lanka, be it in taxi hailing or entertainment. Were leading Sri Lankas imminent digital transformation by helping our clients be digitally ready.
IQs team is diverse. An eclectic mix of engineers, animators, project managers, art directors, digital marketers, software developers, analysts and data scientists make up an ecosystem that thrives on disruptive solutions to everyday business challenges, with the focus on a digital future.
Its exciting, says Johann Latiff, Chief Design Officer. We work with brave brands that have accepted that digital transformation is inevitable. Because of that, theyre ahead of the curve already. Theyre making strides into markets that were previously inaccessible, and meeting consumer needs in creative ways. Adding that In a dynamic and constantly turbulent digital landscape, spearheading the digital transformation of Sri Lankan brands while doing what we love is what drives us and keeps us on our toes.

e-Voting imperative: Why democracies need to modernize their polls
With much of modern society already embracing technology, the great question is how elections have largely been left untouched by automation. This is not for lack of role models -- there are pioneers such as Belgium, Estonia and the Philippines, countries which have transitioned to automation and have since been reaping the benefits of fast, transparent, and credible elections. Yet a sizeable number of democracies have not yet taken their electoral process to the digital age, and are still to realize the tangible benefits that automation offers.
Manual polls involve a tedious process of writing each candidates name on a ballot which is a nightmare for voters who were expected to write as many as fifty (50) candidate names.
The hand counting and tallying of votes are known to take weeks and sometimes months to finish, and were prone to inaccuracies.
Since manual voting leaves many parts of the process to the discretion of poll workers, and since human intervention is inherent in the process, poll workers in the precincts are vulnerable to intimidation and violence.
Automation, however, changes everything. A precinct-based Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Machine, for instance, allows voters to cast their candidate options directly into the machine, eliminating uncertainty and human subjectivity in interpretation. Complex, multi-contest elections are easily handled on the screen, making voting easy and intuitive for the voter. After the polls close, the machines count the votes automatically with 100% accuracy, and transmits them to canvassing servers almost immediately.
E-Voting offers speed unheard of under the manual system, and observers are hailing such improvement as crucial to the quick dissipation of political tension, with many candidates already being proclaimed just hours after the polls close, and many others conceding thereafter.
Credibility, political stability
Generally, voters surveyed after an e-Voting exercise report being very satisfied with the process, and many of whom say that they are unwilling to go back to the old manual system.
It helps when the poll authorities institute steps to make the whole process more transparent. Most countries whove moved towards election automation have conducted a series of confidence-building measures, such as enabling lawmakers and the press to witness critical points in the preparations: source code reviews allowing stakeholders to review the machine instructions, and performance of a battery of tests and audits.
Another key factor for the increase in credibility and Voters Trust is the capability of the Election Technology to generate the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which are vote receipts generated by the machine upon the casting of the vote, and subsequently verified and deposited by the voter in a secure receptacle. This trail allows the performance of audits and re-counts, comparing the electronic count with a manual audit of the paper.
In the case of the Philippines, a random manual audit confirmed a 99.9% match between the electronic and the manual counts.
This level of transparency has had a positive effect on trust. A post-election survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) after three automated elections revealed that 88% of Filipinos want their future elections to be automated, 81% are satisfied with the automated polling and 74% expressed big trust in the results of the elections.
Clearly, automation imbues electoral processes with a degree of transparency not possible in manually-run polls making e-Voting much more credible.
Savings
Countries who have automated their elections have shown that a well-managed e-Voting system could be a financially sound investment for governments, generating significant savings over time.
The big story is how the voting machines are made to be used in multiple elections over the span of several decades, resulting in a long-term savings for the government.
It is never easy to break free from preconceived notions about anything, let alone myths about elections which might have already hardened in the mind. Yet elections being the bedrock of democracy, poll authorities would do well to open their minds about technologies that could improve the speed, accuracy, reliability, transparency, and credibility of their electoral exercises.

Ed Sheeran breaks arm in cycling accident

Pop star Ed Sheeran has broken his right arm, putting his upcoming tour dates in jeopardy.
"I've had a bit of a bicycle accident," wrote the star on hisInstagram page, posting a picture of his arm in a cast.
"I'm currently waiting on some medical advice, which may affect some of my upcoming shows. Please stay tuned for further news."
The 26-year-old was on a break from his world tour, but was due to resume with a gig in Taipei next week.
He has a further14 dates scheduled this year, including concerts in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, before kicking off the Australian leg of his tour in March 2018.
The tour is in support of his multimillion-selling third album Divide, which was released earlier this year.
Sheeran famously plays his concerts solo - using just a guitar and a loop pedal to layer up songs like Thinking Out Loud, Sing and Shape of You.
Losing the use of his right arm would make such a set-up impractical - but,speaking to BBC News earlier this year, Sheeran said he would never consider playing with a backing band.
"I don't feel like there's anything interesting or new about seeing a singer-songwriter with a band behind them," he said.
"I don't feel like if I suddenly got a band, everyone would go, 'Wow!'. I actually feel it'd take away from me."

First two years devoted  to stabilise economy: PM
The government has devoted its first two years in office to stabilise the economy. Sri Lanka which faced an unbearable debt burden is now repaying its loans with difficulty, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
We do not want to leave the debt burden to the younger generation. Eventhough we laid emphasis on relieving the debt burden, we did not forget the countrys backwoods, the Premier said. The Prime Minister made this observation addressing a meeting of the Baddegama UNP Central Organisation held near the Baddegama Sathipola premises on October 15.
The Prime Minister said the government did not wish to hark back on the good work done during the last few years. The fact remains that it had increased the salaries of government and private sector employees, reduced fuel prices, approved funds for village development and developed the schools network under the (Hondama Pasala Langama Pasala) Best school is the Nearest School programme.
The Prime Minister who recalled that his ancestors hailed from the Galle, Kalahe and Baddegama areas added that the government had launched development work to the tune of Rs.240 million in the Baddegama area.
The governments objective was to develop the Galle district on par with the Colombo District. Plans were underway to usher in rapid development in the Southern Province. The foremost endeavour was to revive and develop the Hambantota Port and the Mattala airport which remained white elephants. The Chinese Government had agreed to payback 1 billion dollars to Sri Lanka out of the money it spent on the Hambantota Port, provided that we agreed to develop the facility as a joint venture, the Prime Minister added.
Sri Lanka had agreed to invest Rs.30 billion as its share to offer a new beginning to the Port. China will bring in machinery worth 600 million US dollars to develop the port and we could witness a fully equipped and operational Hambantota Port by 2018 or 2019. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the Indian Civil Aviation Company was having discussions to operate the Mattala Airport in league with Sri Lanka. All this would enable the country to manage its debt burden.
The Prime Minister said identification of land was underway in Galle and Matara to set up Trade Zones.
Galle had good development prospects because it is situated between Galle and Hambantota Ports and two major airports. Employment opportunities would increase with the increase in private sector investments in the region, the Premier added.
The government also hoped to usher in development encompassing the Hiniduma, Deniyaya Rakwana, Kalawana and Agalawatte areas and develop tourism while protecting the Sinharaja tropical rain forest. Another development belt is underway from Kandy to Wellawaya. In Kalutara, 800 acres of land had been earmarked to launch a trade zone, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister who commended Parliamentarian Bandulal Bandarigoda for setting up a UNP Central organisation in Baddegama, within a short period, described him as a very active and efficient Parliamentarian. He had been working round the clock to develop the Baddegama area.
The Prime Minister said he hoped that the UNP would be able to win both the Yakkalamulla and Baddegama Pradesheeya Sabha elections after setting up branch unions in the two areas.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardena Gayantha Karunatilleke and Harin Fernando, Parliamentarian Bandulal Bandarigoda Southern Provincial Council member Sumanasiri Liyanage and Manjula Liyanage also spoke.
Parliamentarians Wijayapala Hettiarachchi, Chaminda Wijesiri, Hesha Vithanage Provincial Council, Members Jayantha Jayaweera and Sunil Senanayake were also present on the occasion.

First US airstrike targeting ISIS in Yemen kills dozens
US forces conducted airstrikes against two ISIS training camps in Yemen on Monday, killing dozens of ISIS fighters and "disrupting the organization's attempts to train new fighters," according to a statement released by the Pentagon.
A US defense official told CNN this is the first US strike specifically targeting ISIS in Yemen. 
Two camps, containing an estimated 50 fighters, were targeted. Gen. Joseph Votel approved the strike under existing counterterrorism authorities. 
The Pentagon said the ISIS camps -- located in Al Bayda Governorate, Yemen -- were used to "train militants to conduct terror attacks using AK-47s, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and endurance training.
" ISIS has used the ungoverned spaces of Yemen to plot, direct, instigate, resource and recruit for attacks against America and its allies around the world. For years, Yemen has been a hub for terrorist recruiting, training and transit," the statement said. 
The strike was done in cooperation with the government of Yemen, according to the Pentagon. 
"US forces are supporting ongoing counter terrorism operations in Yemen against ISIS and AQAP to degrade the groups' ability to coordinate external terror attacks and limit their ability to hold territory seized from the legitimate government of Yemen," the Pentagon statement said. 
Yemen has been wracked by warfare and has become a proxy battleground for Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
Yemen's minority Houthis, who are Shiite, rebelled against the Sunni-led government, backed by Saudi Arabia. 
That spurred the Saudi-led coalition to launch airstrikes in support of Yemen's government against rebel targets in Yemen In March of 2015. 
The United Nations has called the conflict a "humanitarian catastrophe." Government forces and the Saudi-led coalition also have fought against the al Qaeda branch in Yemen (AQAP) and ISIS, both of which are anti-government Sunni terror groups.

Five countries where people live the longest
In these countries, people live substantially longer than the worldwide average  and each place has its own secret source of vitality.
Explorers throughout history have searched for the legendary fountain of youth. And while the elusive fountain has yet to be found, certain places across the world have emerged as centres where people live substantially longer than the worldwide average (around 71 years), and each has its own secret source of vitality.
We talked to residents in some of the countries where people live the longest, as ranked by the 2017 World Happiness Report, to uncover the reasons why these places seem to nurture longevity.
Japan
Living to 83 on average, the Japanese have long had one of the highest life expectancies. Okinawa, often called the land of immortals, has been a global centre for longevity research, as these southern Japanese islands have more than 400 centenarians. Much credit for this has been given to the local diet, which includes plentiful tofu and sweet potato, and a small amount of fish. Active social circles among older residents and a strong community also contribute to lower levels of stress and a strong sense of belonging.
To reap these benefits, learning the language as an expat is critical, said Daniele Gatti, CEO of Velvet Media and long-time Japan resident. Japan has an amazing quality of life if you can get past the language hurdle to better understand the mentality  which is more different from Western culture than most visitors think, she added. Expats willing to move here should think seriously about putting a major time allocation into learning the language. Its key to integrating deeper in the local society and living a full and meaningful life.
Spain
The Mediterranean diet, rich in heart-healthy olive oil, vegetables and wine, has long contributed to Spains long-lived population (averaging 82.8). But Spain has another longevity secret up its sleeve: the siesta.
People think all the Spaniards are doing la siesta when the shops are closed between 2:00 and 5:00, but it is simply how the working shift is organised, said Miquel ngel Diez i Besora from Barcelona and Gray Line tour guide. If you have a continuous shift and just a half an hour break for lunch, then you eat a quick takeaway. On the contrary, if you are forced to stop for two or three hours, then you go home or go to a restaurant where you can sit down, eat two courses and dessert, and have time enough to digest well, its going to be healthier than a takeaway.
The density of Spanish cities also gets people moving more, since shops and restaurants all tend to be within walking distance of most peoples residences.
When I moved to Barcelona from Moscow, I noticed that people here favour walking or biking, even walking few blocks to take public transport instead of using their own vehicles, said Marina Manasyan, co-founder of Barcelona Eat Local Food Tours. You get your cells oxygenated and you reduce your carbon footprint.
Singapore
With broad access to the countrys state-of-the-art medical facilities and whats been called a miracle healthcare system, Singaporeans are living longer than ever at an average of 83.1 years old. The country has one of the lowest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world, and makes preventative care a focus of its healthcare.
The culture and accessible urban environment also contributes to a longer life. You will see a lot of people going to gyms or exercising in the public parks, which are plentiful, said Bino Chua, a current resident and travel blogger at I Wander. The country even recently opened its first therapeutic park, designed to reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing among aging adults.
Health-averse habits are also harder to maintain in Singapore. Expats should know that vices are a lot more expensive here, said Chau. Cigarettes and alcohol are heavily taxed and cost a lot more than in other countries.
Switzerland
Men fare better in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world, living to be 81 on average. As one of Europes wealthiest countries, access to high-quality healthcare, strong personal safety and sense of wellbeing contributes to the high rank  with some studies even pointing to the countrys high intake of cheese and dairy as a leading factor.
Though the country can be very career focused with many expats moving for work at one of the countrys many international headquarters, its central location makes it easy to balance frequent relaxing escapes. Its a career pinnacle, location-wise, said Gatti, who has also lived in Switzerland. Living here allows for wonderful weekend trips all over the continent and to spend time outdoors in the enchanting Alps. The private schools are also some of the best on the planet, she added, which makes it appealing to young families.
South Korea
South Korea is set to be the first country to hit a life expectancy of 90 years according to recent research, which credits a strong and growing economy, broad access to healthcare and lower blood pressure than Western countries for its upward trajectory.
The country also has a diet rich in fermented foods, which are said to lower cholesterol, boost immunity and inhibit cancer. As a whole, Korean food is high in fibre and nutrient-dense, Hoheb said.
Residents say a cultural focus on community and the associated traditions contributes to the everyday quality of life here. The Jimjilbang (public bathhouse) brings together people to recreate, to socialise and to help reduce stress, said Camille Hoheb, founder of Wellness Tourism Worldwide. In South Korea, theres also an overall sense of mindfulness that comes with the Buddhist mindset and an overall attitude toward a culture of cooperation versus individualism. www.bbc.com

Gampaha - the rising residential hub
While the region of Gampaha and its nearby constituencies were mentioned in various ancient chronicles, its well-recorded history began during the colonial era of Sri Lanka. Especially during the Dutch colonial period, the region acted as a collecting centre for cinnamon. Furthermore, with the introduction of the first rubber plant to the island which was planted at the Gampaha Botanical garden, the region received special recognition.
Previously being part of the Colombo district, Gampaha was classified as a district of its own only in 1978. Thereafter developments like the construction of the Moragoda Catholic Church in 1828 attracted many residents into the city.
According to the report An Island of Retail Opportunity by the investment management firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), Gampaha is one of the upcoming retail hotspots in the country.
Even though the city of Gampaha is the administrative capital of the region, the largest metropolis within the district, the city of Negombo, is also showing remarkable growth in its real estate sector thanks to its tourism value.
According to Lamudis own in-house data, the city is the third-most searched residential location, with Colombo and Kandy being the first and second, respectively.
The most common type of real estate searched in Gampaha as of 2017 are its houses and lands. In fact, census data has shown that there were more than 50,000 households in the Gampaha municipalityin 2012.
In the past, property prices within the city remained lower than standard price levels making it possible for property seekers to easily purchase and rent properties in Gampaha.
However, due to the economic growth in the country and well maintained infrastructure, the city tends to attract more investments compared to other suburbs. Gampaha at present witnesses the rise of many lucrative developments such as the Metro Kadawatha which encompasses a six-storied commercial complex and three apartment blocks, Sanasa Purahala with 117 shops and 68 condominium apartments, Ward City providing over 196 shops and over 12,000 square feet of office space, and Unity Shopping Complex predicted to have four stories of office space and 42 apartments in seven floors.
Additionally the city will also see the rise of infrastructural developments such as the Outer Circular Highway  OCH that passes through Colombo and Gampaha, Colombo - Kandy Highway that will further make Gampaha a lucrative place to live, invest and do business.
According to the Lamudi.lk, a luxury apartment for sale indicates an average price of Rs. 20 million to Rs. 30 million in the city of Gampaha. In comparison, the average sale price of luxury apartments in Colombo 03 is Rs. 100 million - Rs. 150 million. Due to factors such as well improved infrastructure, friendly environment with necessary amenities close to hand, buyers are driven towards purchasing apartments in Gampaha.
While a modern house with two to three bedrooms costs more than 30 million in Colombo, a similar type of propertycan be purchased at an average price of Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 million and mid-range house prices lie between Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 million in Gampaha.
Prices of land have escalated over time due to the impressive economic growth of the city. Most of these lands are purchased for residential purposes than commercial purposes as the city indicated the highest population growth and holds recognition to being one of the residential friendliest cities to live in. Thus, a property seeker is able to purchase a land at an average price of Rs 70 to Rs 100k per perch.

Generation X, Y and Z in our time
As each generation readies itself to play a dominant role in the global economy, much is written and conjectured about the changes it will bring to the workplace and the global market. Certainly, the last three, Gen X, Y and Z, to use their more popular labels, have each been studied and analysed to an unprecedented extent by academics, businesspeople and policymakers. Are the differences they demonstrate just the expected generational changes or is there something special about each, in terms of the changes they bring to the workplace, to how technology can be optimised and to how leaders can be most effective.
One of the most visible generations in history, Gen Y has forced a new look at everything from Maslows need hierarchy to how companies do business and the future of the workplace. Growing up with unprecedented access to technology, they have changed everything from whether cars are best bought or shared, to how long its okay to live with parents and what kind of behaviour is acceptable from employees and leaders.
GEN Z: Poised to enter the workplace soon, this generation was born into a tumultuous world, demonstrated to them in all its VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity) glory through a wide variety of screens. They fear for the future of the planet, value their education, worry about their future careers and want to make the world a better place. They are completely digitally native in the sense of being quite helpless in a non-digital world.
GEN X: Sandwiched between the baby boomers and the millennials, this generation has had two decades in the workplace. Quietly, they have taken up positions of power in multinational C- suites as well as in the ranks of successful entrepreneurs. They experienced childhoods without computers and witnessed the shift from analogue to digital Technology in their adulthoods. At work, they are taking over the mantle from the baby boomers and mentoring Gen Y. At home, they are caring for their boomer parents and also their millennial kids who refuse to leave home.
Todays organisational culture
The workplace today is an intriguing blend of multi-generational values, approaches to technology, leadership styles and workplace preferences. Through these three generations, we seek to understand how each group can best be motivated, managed, led and encouraged to lead, for optimal results with the public service in Sri Lanka. The public sector in Sri Lanka has shown fewer tendencies on motivating the employees and leading them with a vision collectively. At present with the recruitment of employees in the generation y, z the organisational culture of the public sector and private sector is reshaping. However, the question lies whether they have the loyalty towards the organisation and the commitment to work.
Flexible work schedules
Weve heard for over a decade that flexible work schedules and locations would become the norm. In 2003, the Guardian announced a coming revolution in working hours and virtual work was hailed a win-win for both employees and cost-conscious employers, but in truth, changes have come slowly and painfully. In recent years, some organisations are even reneging on flexible accommodation. Will the revolution ever materialise even in the private sector in Sri Lanka The output and outcome of Sri Lankan employees have reduced drastically. There is zero consideration for facilitating roles for employment such as transportation, occupational health and insurance and training for competency building. In addition, employees are squeezed with daily hiking cost of living.
Sri Lankan employees in the public sector and private sector face many difficulties when they reach for work, at the workplace and after working hours. Employee relaxation hours has reduced, rather an exploitation of labour takes place each and every organisation from bottom to top layers of management.
Bringing about a transformation
Real-time information and feedback is the norm, as is the management of virtual teams across increasingly globalised organisations. But are the expectations of how technology should shape the future of the workplace similar across generations How can the workplace be designed to integrate differing expectations for optimal recruitment, retention, development, and performance across levels and geographies in Sri Lanka As the nature of work and the workplace evolves, both leaders and employees need to be engaged in bringing about a transformation that is productive, healthy and inclusive in the private and public sector in Sri Lanka.
Technological innovations are reshaping just about everything in our world today and the workplace is no exception. Cloud-based collaboration tools, workplace messaging platforms, wearable technologies, virtual reality, and so on, have changed the meaning of going to work. The employees and their managers now expect more flexibility of time and venue.
Many of the public sector organisations have a very slow transformation into management information systems especially provincial councils and rest of the local bodies. There are many untapped issues with the public sector especially matters affected to local communities.
Having considered the generations gap its the responsibility of the management of all the organisations in Sri Lanka to lead the organisations with a vision which the employee could feel and committed to achieving.

Good Governance will exist until 2025: Navavi
Though many people daydream that the Good Governance will last only for either today or tomorrow, the Good Governance period is going to exist until 2025, said ACMC Deputy Leader and Member of Parliament M. H. M. Navavi.
He made this statement while addressing in the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a new public service centre on Thursday (12). The centre is to be built along the Puttalam-Mannar Road in the Puthukudiyiruppu Grama Niladhari division. The proposed building is to be built under the fund allocation of Rs. 2.2 million. Puthukudiyiruppu GN division Grama Niladhari M. N. M. Rasmi chaired the event and Parliamentarian Navavi was the chief guest.
UNP organizer for the Puttalam electorate M. N. M. Nasmi, Puttalam District Additional Secretary Wanninayaka, Puttalam Divisional Secretary Sampath Weerasekara, President of Puttalam district Jammiyathul Ulama Abdullah Mahmoodh Aalim, Puttalam Thillaiyadi Murugan Kovil Head Priest Venkada Sundararama Gurukkal and many other Grama Niladharis and public bodies participated in this event.
The Parliamentarian added, "Through the Good Governance, we are able to step towards development at a rapid pace."
We have submitted a project proposal to settle the drainage problem in Puttalam, at an expense of Rs. 290 million. Therefore, those who blame us that we just stay without serving the nation should wake up and see the developmental works that are conducted in Puttalam at present. We are awake for the betterment of society, he said.

High-roller fame in the attabola game!
In recent years young consumers have been inundated by a barrage of high- tech toys, computers, designer dolls, war games and robotics. Unfortunately, they never experienced the excitement of playing the centuries old ball game which is considered the first lesson in entrepreneurship combined with skill. Yes siree, it was all about winning, losing, socialising, developing hand-eye coordination and reasoning skills in determining the best shots.
Yes marbles belong to a bygone era of innocence, gentility and safety. Boys and girls nowadays have little interest in such a pastime. Ahhh, marbles or attabola as they are called in local jargon, how we loved them. Besides, it was a time when we were well armed in the battle against childhood boredom
We were mesmerised by them when we were little uns. There was something very comforting about rolling those cool, smooth, colourful glass orbs between your fingers. Even the tiniest lisping marbles buffs described it all too aptly when they simply stated: Marbellous.
Some of the faint-hearted among us had huge collections but would never play. That is because they were so attached to them that they would never risk losing one of their precious gee-gaws. The marble arena could be made ready in a matter of seconds. All the players had to do was to draw a square on a flat surface of earth and clear it of all impediments.
When the ground was smooth and ready the players would mark the shooting line about five feet away. Then a marble would be placed dead centre of the square and someone would stomp heavily on it and pivot on ones heel to make a hole. A lexicon of slang words for the new varieties of the shiny round spheres took hold of the tongues of the youth in what still remains a confusing language for the uninitiated.
In Sri Lanka the hole at the centre was known by every man-Jack of a marbles enthusiast as simply the Jill. The shooter would throw a clutch of shiny glass balls into the square. If he was skilled enough to land them all inside the square and if one popped into the Jill he was given a second chance to shoot. If any of them rolled out of the square an opponent placed it on the line and gave it a finger flick to whichever part of the arena he preferred. Very much like a throw-in during a soccer game when the ball is kicked out of play.
Depending on the position of your target ball you had to roll, toss, flick or give your shooter a backspin or screwball to make a clean hit. The last mentioned was termed an Iskuruppu by the local lads. The trick was to hit a single target. Because if the ball you hit caromed into another marble you forfeited your turn to shouts of Dhadey from your opposing mates.
In the local parlance of marbleology a clean hit was called an Adi. And for some obscure reason an ace player was termed a Carper. Their reputations always preceded them. And much like professional billiard players no one seemed game enough to include them in a game.
Playing for keepsies was called take-for-take in the Lankan marbles lingo. In grades 3 to 6 the greatest lessons we learned for the future would be derived from the attabola games. For us it was investment time, risk taking time and time for character discovery. And the currency was marbles.
Marbles of all kinds were traded, won or lost in a short period. And what an array of glittering orbs was on display. Cats eyes marbles, swirl marbles, solid blues, reds, whites, yellows, oranges, blacks, purples, and greens. They were mostly made from glass but there were the rarer and precious ones made from agate, onyx, marble and porcelain.
Looking back, I realise that marble shooting had a value that transcended the lofty status those smooth shiny globes of glass conferred upon their possessors. There are other games that require longer hours of practice to master, and many are far more competitive. But I am going to stick my neck out and claim that only marbles develop so many admirable and desirable traits in a youth.
With pockets bulging, we would hit the school quadrangle realising we only had 15 minutes to increase or decrease our stockpiles. We were mostly high-rollers in the attabola game. Entire fortunes were won or lost in such little time.
I was never all that good at the game. But now and again I would have one heck of a lucky streak. I remember one particular morning during the tea recess I was experiencing a phenomenal run of fortune. It appeared that I simply could not miss even while firing without real concentration.
I won so many marbles I thought of actually retiring as the champion carper of all time. But then I lost them all in the lunch interval. It appears really horrifying when I look back and imagine my being a degenerate gambler at age 10 or 11.
Today, these fairy bubbles, made ostensibly for children, seem to be bewitching balls when viewed by adults. Collecting old marbles is a pastime equally interesting to children or adults. High rolling games definitely had their therapeutic aspect. It was said about our playmate Isaac that when he handled marbles, he salivated.
For a moment there, differences evaporated. Cultures melded in the universality of a shared smile or a devilish dare. The kids didnt care about the big picture or this ages fetish with instant analysis. Why was it popular Who knew or who cared And, rules, what rules There was bragging to be done, trades to be made, shouts of glee, marbles on the loose and holes to fill. Call it the joy of being passionate high-rollers!
Among the most treasured of any players collection was a taw which was essentially the shooter marble. The prized shooter was usually heavier and fractionally larger than the normal target marbles. Then there were steelie shooters which were considered cool and valued possessions. They are essentially marble-sized steel ball-bearings which were much sought after by aficionados.
In the local lexicon this boss marble was called all kinds of names which carried shades of suggestiveness. Just imagine! They were conferred such appellations as the Tomba Taw or the Gunda.
An extremely fair-complexioned schoolmate carried his milky white agate taw wherever he went. It was dubbed the Kiri Tomba by his playmates particularly when he got down on his haunches like the rest. Everyone said his Kiri Tomba suited his personality and everything else about him to a T or rather a Taw.

Human-elephant conflict: Changes planned for fencing system
The Wildlife Conservation Department has recently changed the protective electrified fencing system which has been implemented for the last 60 years in Sri Lanka and is taking to new methodology.
Since human beings and wild elephants have had to live together in nearly 40 percent of the country's landscape, the human-elephant conflict has grown fast.
Around 70 percent of the country's wild elephant population are presently not in forests reserves, according to reports of the conservation research institute which provides consultative services to the Wildlife Conservation Ministry.
Accordingly, the new fencing system is being implemented in the Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Hambantota and Monaragala districts, where the human-elephant conflict has been on the rise.
The new difference is that the particular protective fence is not constructed to cover the forest reservation landscape in the interior. Instead, the fence is constructed around villages or a cluster of habitats.
The villagers and entrusted with the overall construction work, maintenance, preservation and the administration of the protective fences. The Government provides construction technology and all requirements for the completion of the fence.
Simultaneously, to coordinate the programme, a 'fence society' was formed. The fence society collects a monthly membership tax for the maintenance of the village-level protective fence, Dr. Pruthiviraj Fernando said.
This would ensure the safety of both human beings and wild elephants.

I had no intention  to insult judiciary:  Gnanasara Thera
I had no intention to insult the judiciary with remarks I made inside the Homagama Magistrates Court after the court hearing of the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda was over, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera told the Court of Appeal yesterday.
Gnanasara Thera made the remarks as a defence witness for the Contempt of Court case filed against him.
I had no intention to insult the judiciary or any other person in court. The emotional feelings aroused subsequent to an order to further remand the army intelligence officers led to address in open court, Gnanasara Thera said.
Gnanasara Thera accepted that he told inside the Homagama Magistrates Court that he would not accept White Mans Law (suddage neethiya).
The Court of Appeal hearing the contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court yesterday concluded recording evidence from the Thera.
When the matter came up for inquiry before the Court of Appeal, (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena fixed the trial for October 30. Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate, and Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris had given evidence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva for Gnanasara Thera.
On January 25, Ven. Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda was over. Later on, the Thera was arrested on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred the Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such complaints.
Through the Contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court.
He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence under Article 105 of the Constitution.

IMF to consider  Lankas request for third USD 1.5 b tranche
The IMF Board is expected to consider Sri Lankas request for completion of the third review of its USD 1.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in December of this year.
The IMF in a statement issued yesterday stated they had had constructive discussions with the authorities in Colombo and that they reached a staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the third review under an economic reform programme supported by the three year EFF arrangement.
The request however is subject to the Sri Lankan government passing the 2018 Budget in November in accordance with the EFF supported programme.
The EFF programme had asked that the government incorporate a new Inland Revenue Act and approve a Budget which would continue with fiscal consolidation supported by stronger revenues.
In addition, they have also asked that the, Central Bank stand ready to head off pressures on inflation and credit growth, while continuing to enhance exchange rate flexibility.
The IMF team which visited the country at the end of September commended the government on improving the countrys fiscal position and strengthening its international reserves but asked that more be done to reform State Owned Enterprises.
Upholding the reform momentum will be important for addressing fiscal and external imbalances and meeting the governments ambitious social and development objectives. Renewed effort toward bolstering competitiveness, improving social protection programmes, and boosting private sector development will be important for making growth more robust and inclusive, the team further stated at the end of their review.
The IMF thus far has released two tranches of USD 168 million each and the third tranche of USD 168 million was expected in April but was held back due to delays in passing the new Inland Revenue Act.

INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF FLORA AND FAUNA
As a direct result of Invasive Alien Species (IAS), the depletion of unique biodiversity has affected Sri Lanka in numerous ways. Invasive Alien Species of Flora and Fauna have already caused irreparable damage in the spheres of Agriculture, Fisheries Industry and Tourism Industry of Sri Lanka. This article explores the most common IASs in the country and their areas of impact. Action taken to control the issue however, remains woefully inadequate despite the numerous impacts it has caused to agriculture and natural ecosystems.
INTRODUCTION OF ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES:
The Water Hyacinth
One of the worst Invasive Alien Aquatic Plant Species found in Sri Lanka is the Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). It is a native plant species of South America having beautiful, large purple and violet flowers. It is a very popular ornamental plant for ponds. Water Hyacinth (Japan Jabara) however has been identified as one of the worst aquatic weeds in the world. It is now found in 50 countries on five continents. It is a fast growing plant with the population known to double in only 12 days.
It affects water ways, boat traffic, swimming and fishing. In addition this aquatic invasive plant prevents sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water column and submerged plants.
It is believed that the wife of the British Colonial Governor, Lady Blake had brought Water Hyacinth to Sri Lanka as an ornamental plant in 1901. She had obtained the assistance of the Peradeniya Botanical Garden in planting the seeds of Water Hyacinth. It was thereafter seen to spread fast across all the major water ways across Sri Lanka.
Kaha Karabu (Sphagneticola trilobata)
It has been identified as one of the Worlds 100 worst Invasive Alien Species introduced to Asia from the tropics of Central South America. It was introduced to Sri Lanka as a cover crop in 1980 to tea plantations from India. In Sri Lanka, this invasive plant is found spreading across the country even in paddy lands.
Lantana Camara (Gandapana):
According to a survey of the Environmental Scientist, Craig Walter IUCN Specialist Group, QueenslandAustralia, there are 650 varieties found over 60 countries across the world. It affects agriculture and natural ecosystems. This Invasive Alien Plant Species found all over Sri Lanka has the power to reduce the growth of plants nearby and reduce production. It had been grown since the 16th century in Europe for horticultural purposes. Lantana secretes toxic chemicals to the soil.
Giant Mimosa (Mimosa pigra)
Mimosa Pigra has been identified as one of the worst 100 species of plants in the world according to the Global Invasive Species Data Bank of the Invasive Specialist Group. Brazil is the native country of this Invasive Alien Species. It has spread throughout Sri Lanka especially on the banks of the Mahaweli River and absorbs the nutrients of the soil affecting other plant species.
Najas Marina (Katu Penda)
The emergence of Invasive Alien Species of aquatic plant known as Najas marina in the Madu River estuary has already caused great damage to the biodiversity of the Madu River in Balapitiya.
The former head of the Biodiversity Section of the Country Office of IUCN, Colombo Dr. Channa Bambaradeniya addressing the media briefing revealed the gravity of the damage caused by Najas marina to the Ramsar Wetland of Bundala - the impacts have been immense and irreparable. All stakeholders living on the resources of Madu River have been affected by this invasive aquatic plant. In 1998, the Wetland Site Report of Madu River at Balapitiya was completed by the Central Environmental Authority and together with the research findings of IUCN on Madu River, it was revealed that the Madu River Wetland comprised of 10 major wetland vegetation types and out of a total number of 303 species - 19 species were identified as endemic and eight species were known to be threatened.
The latest threat to the river is the construction of over 10 ornamental fish tanks full of alien fish species in the middle of the Madu River for the purpose of providing people with a Fish Massage. Environmentalists both foreign and local were shocked to see alien fish tanks in the Madu River violating the rules and regulations of the Ramsar Wetland Convention.
When these Alien Fish Species escape to the river during heavy floods, the endemic fish, shrimp and crabs species are likely to end up prey to these alien fish. Environmental Authorities have so far not taken any action to remove these Alien Fish Tanks.
Katu Andara (Prosopis Juliiflora)
This is a native plant of Central and South America and it has been introduced to Africa, Asia and Australia. In 1880, this invasive species had been introduced to Sri Lanka as a plant which would provide shade and to prevent erosion.
Bundala National Park; a Ramsar Wetland and Wilpattu National Park in the country had been invaded by Katu Andara and Katu Pathok (Opuntia dillenii). The fruits of Opuntia dillenii or Katu Pathok are eaten by monkeys while feral buffaloes and cattle feed on the leaves of Prosopis juliiflora (Katu Andara ) and thus disperse the seeds of the plant through the dung.
Dr. Bambaradeniya, an expert on the Invasive Alien Species of Flora and Fauna of Sri Lanka once said that there were 38 species of invasive alien plants and 20 species of alien animals in Sri Lanka.

IRD to increase  tax files  to 2.2 mn  in two years
Athula Ranaweera, a member of the Tax Committee of the CA Sri Lanka said that many of the existing tax laws under the old IR Act has undergone special modification so that both corporate and SME businesses and the general tax payer will effectively benefit from it.
The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is hoping to increase the number of tax files to 2.2 million within the next two years.
Meanwhile of the yearly target of Rs. 625 billion, Rs 451 billion has been collected so far. Last year the tax collection amounted to only Rs. 348 billion, said Nadun Guruge, IRDs Deputy Commissioner General.
Guruge also said that the department had received a sum of Rs 108 billion from major corporate and non- corporate taxes while the target was Rs 190 billion for this year.
Even the yearly VAT collection had fallen short as only Rs. 203 billion was collected as opposed to the target of Rs. 232 billion for this year. (VP)

Let us reminisce and forget the recent debacles
To the good fortune of crickets buffer fraternity is that it has so much to reminisce. Decades of polishing these anecdotes have given them a lustre that more recent debacles have somewhat corroded.
We even do not have to go for decades but a few, just think of the Nineties, how joyous it must have been for the crowds to be inspired by the authority of Arjuna Ranatunga or the wondrous aggression of Aravinda de Silva and the magician himself. Muttiah Muralitharan notwithstanding the fielding wizardry of Roshan Mahanama, and the resilience of Asanka Gurusinha and Hashan Tillakaratne.
My own vivid memory of cricket by contrast is of Abid Ali the Indian military medium pacer destroying the English middle order at Manchester in 1971. It could so easily have been Barry Richards or Clive Lloyd or Dennis Lillee, or even Geoffrey Boycott who persuaded cricket fans that cricket was the game of games. In 1971, India was still famous for their distinctive famous four spin wizards, Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapali Prasanna, Bhagwant Chandrasekhar and Venkataraghavan. Jim Laker had already said that they would be a threat to England, while Abid Ali and Eknath Solkar (I had the good fortune to play against him as a schoolboy international), the lowly medium pacers who came on at the beginning to take the shine off the ball were purely to make up the numbers. In 1971 England had the burly fast bowler, John Snow who could have come out of a mine, had there has been many mines in Sussex. Peter Lever another of the England fast bowlers who were never quite as good as hoped they were going to be. The legendary figure of J.S.E. Price, whose run up started somewhere in the stands, was also a selectorial favourite.
In comparison, Solkar and Abid Ali looked totally harmless. Short of stature they had about them the distinct air of cannon fodder. The commentators were polite, but even an unusually trusting prepubescent like me got the distinct impression that any batsmen would be able see them off as long as they did bring his bat out with him. And yet, over the years Solkar came to dismiss Geoffrey Boycott so many times that some bold observers were even heard to whisper the word bunny in connection with the great batsman.
And on the morning of 5th August 1971, Abid Ali disposed Jameson (on his debut), Edrich, Fletcher and DOliveira to leave England on 41 for 4, I was flabbergasted to see this scenario unfolding in front of my very own eyes. Abid Ali military looking and of that, pace to match, went through the English top order like a walk in the park.
To put the icing on the cake another English batsman bit the dust 41 for 5. But in 1971 this English team under Ray Illingworth had played 25 successive tests without defeat. Since losing to Australia in 1968 (the year I went to England) eventually drawing the series, they had drawn 0-0 in Pakistan, beaten both New Zealand and West Indies at home, regained the Ashes 2-0 in Australia, won 1-0 in New Zealand and beating the emerging Pakistans 1-0 at home; this was the most successful run in cricket history. Then Abid Ali came along and reduced this all conquering side to 41 for 4.I was so proud of my brown brother.
However the bull dog spirit of the English was there and rising from the ashes so to say, came back to score 386. Illingworth himself led from the front scoring 107 and Peter Lever batting at no. 9, remained unbeaten on 88. India scored 212, Brain Luckhurst scored a century in the second innings and Abid Ali did not take another wicket in the rest of the series. They had got the hang of Ali.
Had it not bucketed down on the fifth day, England might have won.There unbeaten run remained intact, albeit not for long, as Chandrasekhar got to them in the final test at the Oval. The injuries to Sri Lanka players and their attitude and not their innate ability, has been the major causes for our slide in cricket.
Rotating the players judiciously, now that we have a large pool and India are doing it with success, it has been like musical chairs since of late. Like the Aussie players they are fitness addicts. And I can see that here in Melbourne, they play a lot of ball games when they are young at school, which tunes most of their muscles in the body. Most of them play footy too, which can give the body a good toning up. We should not hack players till they become plagued with injuries or get jaded due to fatigue. Dilshan Munaweera has been knocking on the door and came good at last, whats up with Dhananjaya de Silva, he should not been shown the door after one poor performance, he is a class act.
Mental tuning is another must, as I mentioned earlier a psychoanalyst is a must since our squad is young, by and large. Niroshan Dickwella clearly does not know how to plan out a long innings and the opposition knows that well and his wicket is always gift wrapped to say the least, the many captains were trapped In the jigsaw puzzle fighting for their places to advice the talented youngster Kusal Mendis who is unguided thus far and his focus has gone haywire.
It is good to have horses for courses and in the T20 arena we can still be good as any others. Unfortunately, now the team spirit has evaporated, and the captaincy of Upul Tharanga! If he can captain like the way, he plays those sublime cover drives!

Life in the law
The man in the dock was ex-president Charles Taylor of Liberia, whom he had once described as Africas Hitler. Was history going to be made on this day in 2012 The last head of state to have been convicted by an international criminal tribunal was Grand Admiral Donitz, who had succeeded Hitler as Fuhrer and faced the judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946.
Sir Desmond de Silva QC, now aged 77, was ready to wage war against a rising trend of Hitlerism, but not with conventional weapons. This particular case study and some more intriguing episodes from his law life are memoirified in his autobiography Madam Where Are Your Mangoes The well known battle to bring former Liberian president and warlord Charles Taylor to justice in The Hague remains to be the first conviction of a former head of state for war crimes since 1946 during the Nuremberg trials.
In his career of over 50 years, Sir Desmond has contributed to numerous legally momentous areas such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, espionage, treason, drugs, terrorism, human rights, white-collar fraud and sports. He has been a much sought-after personality by celebrities such as Harry Redknapp, John Terry, Ron Atkinson, Hans Segers, Lawrence Dallaglio, Graham Rix, Lee Bowyer and Jamie Osborne.
Madam Where Are Your Mangoes was launched at the Vijitha Yapa bookshop at the Crescat Boulevard recently. The book is now available at any Vijitha Yapa Bookshop.
In a career of over 50 years at the Criminal bar of England and Wales, with hundreds of cases to choose from, I have drawn on very few to write about. Those I have chosen, in the main, either have a relevance to my life, or sometimes even my near, or enjoy some rare quality that does, perhaps, give them an interest outside that of the normal diet of a criminal barrister, Sir Desmond notes.
The strange title of the book refers to a particular incident that happened while the Queens Counsel sought accommodation in a Sierra Leone hotel with a colleague. Blissfully uninformed that the hotel is really a brothel, the QC and the colleague booked a room. One of the ladies on duty approached the QC and inquired if he would like to have mangoes. A while later Sir Desmond was interrupted by the sounds in the corridor. He opened his door to see his colleague dangling around with a lady on duty with a scream: But madam, where are your mangoes
Desmond de Silva was honoured with knighthood during the Tony Blair administration while Prime Minister David Cameron made him a privy councillor.
This book is intended as a record of interesting times through which I have lived and practised law in England and in numerous jurisdictions outside the UK. It has been a journey measured in memories, friendships, political duplicity and a wealth of varied experiences. I do not propose, as some do, to take a scalpel to myself in order to dissect why I have turned out as I have. I do, however, sometimes take such an instrument to others, but sparingly, I hope. This is meant to be a light-hearted, episodic memoir of certain events as opposed to a comprehensive autobiography, Sir Desmond recalls.
He calls his story as something of an odyssey; from a colonial childhood in Ceylon where the imprint of Empire was still visible, to life in post-war Britain under Attlees Labour government.
It is sometimes said that a person is moulded by a particular decade. In all species, individuals grow within groups and these social groupings imprint their values on their offspring. If this is true, then I was perhaps influenced most by the first ten years of my life: the 1940s. Looking back, that period was my comfort zone. However, the professional life I have led since my call to the Bar has dragged me away from this arena of comfort and placed me squarely in the modern world.
Sir Desmond has a reason to author a book of this calibre. His primary target is his daughter, Victoria, who (like most others in the modern world) will have an insight into his early life both in Ceylon as well as England.
England was, however, where I spent most of my professional life and it was from England that I sallied out to other places when the finger of fate beckoned. As I only kept a diary sporadically, the account is a series of recollections and anecdotes: a gossipy personal memoir confined to a career in the law.
George E de Silva of Ceylon War Council fame is the grandfather of Sir Desmond de Silva. Interestingly Lord Louis Mountbatten was Uncle Dickie for him. A few decades later he married Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, the great-niece of Lord Mountbatten.
Where a country has changed its name an author must choose which name to use. I have decided to use the name that applied at the time of the events about which I am writing. I hope I will be forgiven for referring to the land of my birth as Ceylon  as it was then popularly and geographically known  when I refer to events prior to 1972, after which it became the Republic of Sri Lanka. So names such as the Ceylon National Congress, which my grandfather was president of and which played such an important in the Ceylon Independence movement, will remain; as will the Battle of Ceylon in 1942 and the Ceylon War Council, which came into existence during World War II.
Sir Desmonds details may not narrate the whole story. But those shards of memory, written in a crisp language, let us view and review the good old Ceylon through the periscope of Sir Desmonds colonial childhood.
My grandmother Agnes Nell was a strong-willed woman and an early motor enthusiast. The first car was imported into Ceylon in May 1905 by Edward, the playboy son of the philanthropist Sir Charles de Soysa. When driven from the docks, thousands lined the streets to view the marvel of the automobile. By 1906 Agnes was driving a Belgian five-horsepower chain-driven Belgian Minervette that made a terrible puffing sound that attracted the unwelcome attention of local dogs who clearly mistook the vehicle for some form of mechanical beast. Rumour has it that these motoring pioneers discharged pistols to scare off canine interest.
Kandy, in the central highlands of Sri Lanka where I was born, has been described as one of the most entrancing cities of East Asia. It is also the crossroads of many faiths: the meeting place of those who worship Buddha, Vishnu, Mohammed and Christ. The Temple of the Tooth still houses the eyetooth of the Buddha, the most sacred of Buddhist relics. A drumming, which can still be heard today, wafted up from the temple, across the Kandy lake and up the hillside to my parents home. In my early ears at the Bar in London, I was instructed to defend at the Old Bailey the son of the former keeper of Buddhas tooth, who faced charges of living off immoral earnings in Mayfair; the story ended happily with his triumphant acquittal at the hands of a London Jury.
Madam Where are Your Mangoes is a fascinating story of Desmond de Silvas life in the law, from the arrest of Charles Taylor for war crimes in Sierra Leone, to defending household names such as John Terry, via murder, celebrity and spy trials. Born in Ceylon during World War II, de Silva went on to become one of the most distinguished and high-profile jury advocates of his generation. This memoir provides an authoritative account of some of his most remarkable cases, covering over half a century of practice in the courts of England, the Commonwealth and as Chief Prosecutor of an international criminal court that in 2012 brought to justice the first Head of State since the Nuremberg trials in 1946. The reminiscences are complemented by a series of stories relating to his most colourful cases by the Evening Standards veteran court correspondent Paul Cheston.

Mass media on watch
The mass media has become an essential element in our life just like food and clothing. With the advancement of technology, media has now taken over a significant role in strengthening the society. In fact, this very same media could be considered a mirror of the society.
Why is the Media Important It gets your message across to a wider audience. The media has the capacity to trade and market the products as well as the prejudice.
Though it is claimed to be governed by righteousness and equity, the media is now overcome with greed, self- aggrandisement and poisoned virtues.
It is common knowledge that the media is in charge of information, education, entertainment, advertising and correlation of parts of society. The society is influenced by media in so many ways. It is the media for the masses that helps them get information about myriads of things.
It helps people form opinions and make judgements regarding various issues. It is the media which keeps the people updated and informed about what is happening around them and the world.
The teenagers and children wish to follow the people, who get recognised in the media and follow them to get noticed.
Sometimes, they focus on the negative aspects of the media. A considerable portion of the population has succumbed to a life of crime!
The media affects the peoples perspective. Too much intervention of media in everything is a matter of concern. The media can be considered watchdog of political democracy. Through the ages, the emphasis of media on news has camouflaged.
No doubt, media has played a significant role in making the world a global village and to reduce the communication gaps among the people living in the far areas. But unfortunately, media these days have become a commercialised sector. Their ultimate goal is bagging the rating points.
I fervently hope that the media identifies its responsibility and work sincerely and honestly. Then it will serve as a great force in building the nation.

Measures to empower low-income families in Matara underway
Measures have been taken to economically empower low-income families in the Matara district.
According to Director Conrad Ranawake of the Institute of Community Strengths in Matara, these projects have already been initiated at the Divisional Secretariat Division level in the district.
They are underway in the Matara, Weligama, Devinuwara and Dickwella DS divisions at the moment. Over 25 Grama Niladhari areas from each of these four divisions totaling 100, have been targeted to be economically empowered through these programmes.
One thousand low-income women, 2,750 women engaged in entrepreneurial development activities and 300 school leavers totaling 4,050 are anticipated to be economically empowered by them.
They would also be directed to income-generating avenues, skills development, vocational training and career guidance programs.
Those who successfully complete them would be provided with job opportunities in both public and private sectors. Necessary facilities would also be made available for them to be engaged in self-employment avenues, Ranawake said.
Resources available in the Matara district are utilized in this regard.
They would also be combined with women's entrepreneurial development activities currently commenced by the institute. Measures have been taken to provide them with loan facilities to start small and medium-scale self-employment projects as well.
The Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara, has also taken steps to direct women who are qualified for higher education and also school leavers, to vocational and technical training colleges. The economic empowerment of low-income women and their families would be the prime objective of these endeavours, he said.

Monk denied possession of temple
Galle Additional Magistrate Asanga Hettiarachchi repudiated a Buddhist monks possession to a temple based on a decree issued by the Supreme Sangha Sabha of Sri Lanka Ramagna Maha Nikaya by which the priesthood of the respective Bhikku had been nullified .
The Additional Magistrate pronounced the above renunciation of possession following the trial of a case filed by a Buddhist monk claiming the possession of Vijayarama Temple in Labuduwa, Galle as a personal issue under Action 66 of Primary Code Procedure.
A monk named Ven. Pasgoda Upashantha had submitted a petition to the Court claiming the possession of Labuduwa Vijayarama Vihara .

Sunil, as respondents.
The respondents raising initial objections against the petitioners claim told the Court that the respective temple belonged to the Sri Lanka Ramagna Maha Nikaya and the supplicant had taken a deceitful move to get the possession of the temple.
The respondent further pointed out that as per a Sanghadhikarana judgment dated June 16, 2017 pronounced by the Sangha Sabha of Sri Lanka Ramagna Nikaya, the petitioner monk had been affirmed as a layman in saffron robe and his Samanera Bikku Certificate had also been annulled.
The respondents further stated that the above Sangadhikarana judgment had been issued by the Judicial Registrar of the Sri Lanka Ramagna Maha Nikaya Ven. Prof. Aththangane Rathanapala Nayaka Thera.
The defendants further disclosed in the Court that the petitioner was a married layman in robes and a father of one child. He was also a person who had been sentenced to a suspended jail term.
The respondents produced in Court all testimonials pertaining to his marriage and jail term. On consideration of preliminary objections of the respondents, the Additional Magistrate rejected the petition at the outset stating that the respondents could strongly prove their objections with written verifications.

'National assets should not be sold to foreign companies'
Addressing a meeting convened by the Joint Opposition at the Tangalle Town Hall auditorium last morning, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said, It is our duty to protect our land and national assets from being sold or given on 99-year leases to foreign companies and safeguard them for our future generations.
The Portuguese who came to this country in 1515 only requested for a land area which could be cordoned off by a cows skin. What did they do They shred the cows skin and enclosed the Colombo Fort with it. Afterwards, the Portuguese and Dutch invaded our country and later on, the English. It was only after 433 years that we were able to gain our freedom again. Under the agreements signed by the present government, it will be only in 2116 that we can even discuss the future of the Hambantota port and Mattala airport, he added.
Members of Parliament Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawana, Johnston Fernando and a few others addressed the meeting which was attended by approximately a thousand supporters of the Joint Opposition including members of provincial councils and former members of local government institutions.
Later, the participants protested opposite the Tangalle bus stand for almost an hour without incident before dispersing.

The Pussycat Dolls plotting reunion
The Pussycat Dolls are reportedly planning a reunion - nearly a decade after they split.
The girl group, fronted by Nicole Scherzinger, initially appeared to have called time on their career in 2009 on good terms. However, in 2012, Carmit Bachar alleged that Nicole's determination to dominate her bandmates was the reason for tension in the band.
Now it seems that the girls are prepared to put their differences behind them, with Nicole, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Kimberly Wyatt and Melody Thornton all said to be on board for another shot at the top.
"Talk of the girls getting back together has been rife for a few years now and they have finally found a time which works for them all," a source told Britain's The Sun newspaper. "The girls feel the time is right to let bygones be bygones and put any differences they had behind them and celebrate the great songs they made."
According to the publication, it is as yet unclear whether or not Carmit will be involved in the reunion. The insider also said that the girls who have agreed to give things another shot are still finalising details, and are "still deciding whether it will involve a full tour or just a handful of performances". It seems that they could also be releasing new material as well.
"They are excited to be getting out there together again," the source added. "As well as their old tunes, they are hoping to treat fans with new music, too. When they parted ways in 2009 it was only intended to be a hiatus, so it feels like the right thing to do.

Relationships are the foundation of Supply Chain Network
Business-to-business(B2Bor, in some countries,BtoB) refers to a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another.
This typically occurs when a business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a food manufacturer purchasing salt) a business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances) a business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g. aretailerbuying the end product from the food manufacturer).
B2B is often contrasted againstbusiness-to-consumer(B2C). In B2B commerce it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power, and even when they don't, each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by economic implications ofinformation asymmetry.
So, what happened Online exchanges are based on the notion that procurement can be made significantly easier, more efficient, and less expensive. A buyer would simply place an order online, let the various suppliers submit their prices, and wait for the lowest bid to come in. What folks forgot in the B2B craze, however, is that, while price is an important factor in purchasing materials for production, qualities other than price matter too in fact, they dont just matter, they often matter more.
The consultancy Accenture most of companies corporate buyers and found that the thought that a strong brand and reliable customer service both were more important than low prices when it came to making purchases online.
The near-fatal flaw in online B2B exchanges was that planners and prognosticators ignored the importance of relationships up and down the supply chain. Purchasers dont just look for the best price. They seek out suppliers that can offer the total package top-quality products, reliable delivery, a high level of customer service, and the ability to customize orders to meet specific needs.
They look for the total cost of ownership for the goods and services theyre buying, not just the purchase price of the product. Indeed, the most successful B2B relationships are those in which two companies develop a deep understanding of each others processes and procedures. In this way, they can expand the relationship even to the point of including collaboration in R&D or product design.
This partnership allows the two parties to focus on their strengths and to increase overall efficiencies. Under these circumstances, value is derived from suppliers that can provide the total package. In the past two decades, buyers and sellers have worked hard to develop such relationships with each other. Over time, many of these relationships have blossomed into fullblown strategic partnerships, where the buyers and sellers collaborate on a wide range of activities, such as information systems, capital investments, and product design. It has become clear that relationships matter in the traditional supply chain and are likely to be one of the defining factors of the evolving demand network.
The relationship imperative: The need for flexibility
Flexibility the ability to respond quickly to changing needs in a dynamic competitive environment is critical for firms that want to succeed in the demand network. Production cycles are getting shorter as consumers demand greater variety in products and services all the time. In order to meet this demand, firms all along the supply chain are looking for flexibility from suppliers. They need to be able to adapt production processes quickly and refine the features of a product based on consumer feedback (sometimes in the middle of a run). Often they require customized service to accommodate complex and unique needs. For example, in the high-tech manufacturing sector, products like routers and switches are being designed on the fly, with product specifications being continuously updated and modified to improve performance. New technologies are making this type of flexibility possible, but even more important are the relationships between the manufacturers and the buyers. These two entities must be fully committed to sharing information and working cooperatively to make such radical improvements in the production process.
External relationships proliferate: Outsourcing
A major transformation in the supply chain took place around 1970, when large multinational corporations began moving activities previously performed in-house to outside companies. The rigid vertical structure of early. Mass-production manufacturers, like Ford, that once owned their entire supply chain from parts to assembly to distribution, began to break down. Instead of making parts themselves, such companies began to rely on outside suppliers that could produce certain components faster, cheaper, or better. Many of these suppliers were located in low-cost regions in other countries, particularly Southeast Asia and, to some extent, Latin America. Outsourcing activity accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s as the supplier firms themselves achieved scale and became increasingly competitive with the large firms that would soon become their customers. Large networks of supplier firms emerged, each of which supplied multiple firms. Reductions in transportation costs and information costs enabled these networks of suppliers to become efficient on a global scale. As a result, the supply chain became global and involved many different players to produce a single product. Corporations outsourced an increasing percentage of steps along the supply chain as firms experienced the benefits of efficiency and flexibility that outsourcing provided.
Taking it to the limit: Total outsourcing
In the 1990s, outsourcing not only grew in intensity, but it also began to spread in scope creating the infrastructure upon which the demand network is now evolving. Firms began outsourcing large parts of the manufacturing process to outside vendors. Some firms went as far as outsourcing all their manufacturing operations. The consumer electronics industry is particularly well suited for total outsourcing. Contract manufacturers in this industry, such as Solectron, Orders for its products go to one of its fulfillment partners, such as Modus Media Incorporated, which handle inventory. Brand-name consumer products companies that espouse this model, such as Ericsson, Phillips, and Sony, are becoming vastly different entities. The core of their business is now centered on innovation and marketing rather than production and assembly. As the consumer electronics industry seems particularly well suited to pushing the outsourcing model to its extreme, it is also acting as a model that other industries will soon follow. A look at the diversity of the companys customer base suggests that industries other than consumer electronics are actively outsourcing their manufacturing as well.
Three tiers of relationships
Not all relationships are likely to be as extreme as in the total outsourcing model. In fact, a spectrum of relationships is emerging based on the strength and nature of the points of connection in the network. The information with supply chain experts identified three tiers of relationships between buyers and suppliers, each with different degrees of true partnership:
 Commodity relationships, which involve sellers that provide the lowest-cost goods to meet a buyers needs; these relationships can be fairly anonymous, and there is little to no real partnership or information sharing.
 Basic relationships, in which some information is shared between the parties to ensure cost-effective outcomes, but full partnerships are neither expected nor desired.
 Strategic partnerships, which imply a long term relationship with the suppliers that are most important to the buyers operation, in which buyers and sellers work cooperatively and share information extensively to achieve shared goals.
Tier 1: Commodity relationships
While we are focusing on the importance of relationships in the supply chain, it is important to note that not all transactions conducted must involve complex interactions. Some inputs are simple exchanges of commodities, such as raw materials and common maintenance items, or basic services like cargo transport, in which the most important factor is price. Who the supplier is matters far less than the cost of the product and perhaps the delivery schedule. B2B exchanges and auctions can play a role here. When price and a reasonable delivery time are what matter most, a B2B exchange can facilitate fairly anonymous and efficient transactions that save the buyer time and money. Of course, these exchanges may also help some companies find suppliers with whom they want to build deeper relationships after the initial transaction. Online exchanges can bring formerly unknown suppliers into the buyers world, increasing the pool of potential partners.
Tier 2: Basic relationships
In the past 20 years, buyers and suppliers formed partnerships to leverage supply chain efficiencies. Using technologies like EDI and ERP systems, companies began to share information, such as inventory, production, and forecasts, with key suppliers. Today, a large company might have such relationships with several dozen, or even hundreds or thousands, of suppliers.
Technologies and partnership like these bring significant improvements in efficiency to the supply chain. Wal-Mart, for example, has been a leader in redefining the retail supply chain for the better part of the last decade. Through direct contact with consumers and innovative technology strategies, Wal-Mart has been able to amass the largest database of customer information in the world. Driven by the goal of serving its customers better and supporting its everyday low-price concept, sharing information with suppliers is at the core of Wal-Marts supply chain strategy. In fact, Wal-Marts proprietary network, Retail Link, is several steps ahead of other supply chain management efforts in integrating the companys EDI networks with an extranet used by its buyers and more than 10,000 suppliers. Indeed, the system links about 90% of Wal-Marts global suppliers in sourcing and other collaborative business processes. This information technologydriven strategy enables Wal-Mart to gather and disseminate information about sales and inventory levels, at the lowest level of detail, online and in real time.
Tier 3: Strategic partnerships
In general today, flexible supply chains, much less true demand networks, are hardly the norm. With increasing consumer demand for products that meet their needs as closely as possible, manufacturers are turning to true strategic partnerships to help build flexibility into their supply chains. Strategic partnerships are the top tier of relationships. Companies that have adopted the idea that collaboration sometimes even with competitors can make the supply chain more efficient and drive costs down are developing strategic partnerships with other companies. Yet the partnership also demonstrates how even the largest companies are rethinking their supply chains and shifting their focus to collaboration to remain competitive. Similarly, Dell Computer has created deep relationships with its 25 most important component suppliers and has used these relationships to establish itself as a nimble, low-cost leader in the personal computer industry. Dell has set up a private Internet site for these suppliers, which gives them real-time updates of Dells inventories as well as incoming customer orders. Dell also sends a purchasing forecast to its top suppliers each week, indicating how many hard drives, processors, and monitors it plans to purchase in the coming weeks. This information allows suppliers to ramp up production in anticipation of coming demand. These suppliers in turn provide Dell with regular updates of their anticipated costs and prices for the components. Dell can then forecast its costs for producing computers in the future, enabling it to set prices accordingly and to maintain its margins. In the future, Dell aims to deepen these relationships with suppliers even further by moving beyond collaborative forecasting to collaborative design, using the Internet to enable Dell engineers to design components in conjunction with engineers working for its most trusted suppliers. The success of these high-level relationships depends on trust and a seamless flow of information. As information systems among suppliers become more integrated, building and reinforcing trust between partners is crucial. For instance, we have already described how Wal-Mart has developed basic partnerships with its suppliers, but recently it has taken Retail Link a step further. In the last year, Wal-Mart has created a special private link into its system for only its most strategic partners and most critical transactions, thereby providing a secure forum for the exchange of high-value information among this elite group. In this way, relationships between business entities differ only marginally from business consumer relationships. Building one-to-one relationships through the exchange of information remains the most important opportunity for strengthening and deepening both business and customer relationships.
One-to-one relationships in the demand network
One vital component of the emerging consumer-centric marketplace is the ability for companies, through the use of new technologies, to establish one-to-one learning relationships with consumers. These one-to-one customer relationships are the result of a companys ability to track each contact with a customer, learn from that customers feedback, and tailor product, service, or communication based on that feedback. A companys ability to respond to individual customer needs depends on its ability to mobilize its network of suppliers and partners in response to this information about what the customer wants. And so it goes for every player participating in the evolving demand network, each of whom has a customer to serve: retailers serve consumers, manufacturers serve retailers, contract manufacturers serve product manufacturers, component suppliers serve manufacturers, raw materials suppliers serve component suppliers, and the warehousing and transportation players serve virtually everyone. As the function and quality of these relationships continue to grow in importance, managing them effectively and deepening them to maximize their value will be an important element of success. While the basic strategies of identifying, differentiating, interacting, and customizing apply, there are special strategies for managing customer relations in a B2B environment. In One-to-One B2B, PRG outlines the seven critical areas where B2B strategies differ from B2C strategies. Three of them are especially salient in this discussion of the growing network of relationships among corporate firms: developing relationships within relationships, selling by developing accounts rather than simply adding customers, and focusing on just a few large customers.
Relationships within relationships
The most obvious difference between selling to an individual and selling to a business is that the consumer is a single decision-making unit, while the business has many decision makers. Because many people will have purchasing discretion in a business, the B2B organization must not only develop and grow its relationship with the business customer as an overall organization, it must also develop relationships with divisions, departments, groups, and individuals within the organization. Thus, supplier companies are implementing tools to empower individuals within the organization to interact directly with them. For example, Web-based applications for procurement, such as those used by Office Depot and FedEx, enable business customers to empower purchasing decisions to be made directly by the individual or group that needs the product or service. Account Development Selling Because of the complex nature of business customers, a B2B company that focuses on developing a relationship with its best customers is likely to be more successful. There are advantages in developing deeper account relationships with fewer customers as opposed to focusing on increasing the number of new customers acquired. When they are in the buyers seat, companies are looking for suppliers that can help them achieve their goals. Suppliers that are focused on account development rather than market penetration will employ customer-centric and loyalty-dependent strategies and will be able to help their customers achieve their goals and be successful themselves at the same time. For example, airline companies have devoted significant resources to providing a higher level of service to business travelers from the creation of in-flight business-class services offering more comfortable seating and better amenities to reward programs that provide significant loyalty incentives to the frequent business traveler. This focus on deepening these relationships with high-value business customers has in turn prompted the air-services demand network to respond in kind. For example, in an effort to provide business travelers optionsfor remaining connected traveling, Boeing is equipping its 747s with high-speed data networks, while Global, a satellite-based global-roaming Internet service provider, will allow in-flight passengers to access their e-mail accounts and surf the Web at higher speeds. These options enable commercial long distance air carriers, to provide an even higher level of service to their most valuable customers.
Just a few large customers
While a B2C company is likely to have thousands or millions of customers and can rely on generalized statistics about groups of customers to make decisions and then act to serve them, a B2B company usually has a much smaller customer pool and should not act on generalized conclusions about its customers. By developing at least basic partnerships with most customers and strategic partnerships with their best customers, suppliers can tailor their actions for each customer.
A company will be measured by the strength of its relationships
I n the evolving demand network, the need to serve the customer in concert with multiple partners and suppliers necessitates a foundation of strong relationships. In this new world, a companys value will be tied closely to the extent and quality of its external relationships. To be successful, companies should keep the following insights in mind:
 Create flexibility through a network of relationships. Over the past 30 years, companies have outsourced an increasing percentage of corporate functions to outside suppliers of goods and services. In turn, they have realized the benefits of increased flexibility and cost efficiency. In the future, a companys ability to be agile in a constantly changing marketplace will depend on the quality and diversity of its relationship network.
 Maintain a spectrum of relationships. In order to meet varied and complex needs, companies must increasingly rely on external relationships to respond to dynamic customer demands effectively. However, there is not one type of relationship that will enable companies to meet all these needs. Companies must develop competencies in maintaining a spectrum of relationships, from those that require the least investment to those that require significant commitments from partner companies.
 Develop metrics to measure relationship value. In the demand network, new metrics for measuring business success will emerge to evaluate a company not only on its revenues and profitability but also on its flexibility, external networks, and execution speed. In order to gauge performance, a company must be able to measure its effectiveness in building its external network, as well as the value of key B2B relationships.

Removal of minimum room rate  will boost competitiveness - Fitch
Hotels to face price competition from informal sector
Fitch Ratings expects Sri Lankas hotels sector to face price competition from the growing informal sector and alternative accommodation models.
Fitch says that EBITDA margins (measures the extent to which cash operating expenses use up revenue) could also be squeezed by the expanding marketing budgets of hotel operators.
The margins of listed hotel operators considered in our analysis have softened by around 100bp over the last two years, to 28%, as most operators hold back on passing cost escalations to customers due to the prevalence of low cost competition.
We expect this trend to continue over the medium term, and cause margins to compress by 200bp300bp over the next two to three years.
Demand for rooms of listed hotel operators has been sufficient to drive an increase in average room rate (ARR) to USD87 from USD70 between 2014 and 2016, while occupancy stabilised at around 75% during the same period. Fitch believes that the 11,645 rooms that the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) expects to come online by end-2018, will support medium-term demand. However, a likely glut in residential apartments and informal accommodation establishments will keep formal-sector occupancy pressured.
The median credit metrics for listed hotel operators have remained largely stable over the last four years  with gross leverage (gross debt/EBITDA) averaging 2.2x in the last reported financial year end.
Fitch expects this ratio to increase with the respective renovation pipelines of industry operators, but to stabilise at between 3.0x to 3.5x over the medium term. We also expect the large established operators to remain free cash flow (FCF) positive over the next two years as most will already have concluded their renovation cycles.
Cinammon Lakeside
The Two large listed hotel companies, John Keells Hotels and Asian Hotels & Properties, which are both part of John Keells Holdings PLC, benefit from much lower net leverage than other listed peers.
Star-graded accommodation in the capital, Colombo, costs 10%-15% more than regional competition, owing partly to the regulatory price floor but also to relatively high costs of construction, energy and imports. Fitch believes this will lead some tourists to choose cheaper destinations or lodging options.
Fitch considers the shortage of skilled human resources a key issue, given the surge in the number of hospitality establishments driving up demand for a trained workforce. Employment in the industry recorded a CAGR of 9.8% over the last 10 years against a 17.1% growth in tourist arrivals.
We expect the hotel schools run by some leading hospitality brands, and a growing number of hotel-management courses offered by private-sector education providers, to mitigate this risk.
We believe that the available registered room capacity as of end-2016 plus the 11,645 rooms that will be added by end-2018 will be adequate to meet room demand over the medium term.
However the likely increase in luxury and semi-luxury residential apartments and other unregistered accommodation establishments will put pressure on the formal sectors EBITDA margins.
Fitch believes that Sri Lankan city hotels could lose their attractiveness because of their relatively higher room rates owing to steep cost structures. The higher accommodation costs especially star-graded facilities are due mainly to the prevalence of minimum room rate regulation, higher cost of construction and energy tariffs.
The average per night price of a room in five-star graded establishments in Colombo exceeds USD180 (with taxes), compared with similar accommodation units in Bangkok (USD175), Kuala Lumpur (USD165), Chennai (USD130) and Mumbai (USD168).

SL Purchasing Managers Index increases
The September Manufacturing Sector PMI (59.0) saw an increase of 4.6 index points compared to August 2017 indicating an expansion.
This expansion was mainly driven by the increase in the Employment sub-index which recovered from the contraction observed in the previous month with the recruitment of new employees. The production and new orders sub-indices expanded at higher rates in September.
The Stock of purchases sub-index increased at a slower rate due to the excess stocks level observed in the previous month. Suppliers Delivery Time lengthened, albeit at a slower rate compared to previous month.
Overall, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold signaling an overall expansion in September 2017. Moreover, the Expectation for activities remains positive for the next three months.
Meanwhile the Services Sector PMI recorded 57.0 index points in September from 60.1 index points in August 2017. This indicates that the Services sector continued to expand in September 2017 at a slower rate compared to August 2017. Employment and Expectations for Activity sub-indices increased marginally in September compared to August 2017.
Business Activity sub-index declined significantly but remained above the threshold. New Businesses also decelerated while Backlogs of Work declined in September compared to August 2017. The Accommodation, Food and Beverage sector reported a decline in Business Activity due to weather related developments. With the removal of taxes on data usage, Telecommunication sector expects an improvement in Business Activity. Prices Charged increased at a slower rate in September compared to August 2017.
Expectations on Labour Cost sub-index increased marginally in September 2017 due to seasonal year end benefits such as bonuses and festival advances.

Spirit behind the song
What would the music industry do without great composers Their talent and abilities make a film a masterpiece. No great movie is complete without music.
What would the Blockbuster film Titanic be without Celine Dion singing My Heart Will Go On And behind that song is Composer James Horner. It was a song that broke so many hearts! What would Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Phantom of the Opera be without the great Andrew Lloyd Webber A composer/musical director is indispensable to a film. Today Melodies features one of our greats  the inimitable Dharshana Dissanayake composer and musical director of Samanala Sandhawaniya.
These days Dissanayake is doing what life has gifted him with  composing film music and tele drama music. His talent is really massive having put out nearly 1500 songs. He has done about 50 singles and four albums of his own. Truly the man has some talent!
Sri Lankan audiences may remember Samanala Sandhawaniya that really made an impact on movie goers. This simple but extremely meaningful movie really struck a chord with film goers. It was a movie that was made all the more wonderful with the acting of Yashoda Wimaladharma, Uddika Premarathna under the direction of Jayantha Chandrasiri. The romance was so beautifully portrayed and brought out because of the superlative ability of Dharshana Dissanayake
The movie had a really great impact on my career. It brought me great fortune. It was a great opportunity for me for many reasons. I got to meet some extraordinary characters and it was such a privilege for me to work with them. It was a collaboration that really made this movie a masterpiece. Composing music for such a film is a milestone for me in my profession, said Dissanayake
The talent of making music is indeed mysterious. Some people have it and some people dont. Music is a powerful medium of communication. An art that is coveted by so many but some are gifted and blessed with it. The fact that Dissanayake entered the music industry is a blessing to us all. We are fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience his brilliance. A hard worker, Dissanayake feels that he was born with this ability.
I believe I entered the music industry because of my inborn talent and my willingness. I must also mention that my biggest inspiration in life is my father, said Dissanayake.
Music has given his life so much meaning. It has enriched us. Dissanayake is gifted aesthetically and it is more than his bread and butter. It is his universe. It is his purpose. And this is what he wants to share with us by doing such films. Samanala Sandhawaniya was made all the more sweeter, with the music of Rooney (Gagana Sarannata Giya), Amarasiri Peiris (Iki Gasa Hadana) and Shammika Amani (Mage Sihina Madure). But the wind beneath their wings was the experienced composer Dharshana Dissanayake.
Music is not only my career but it is my soul as well. It is my spirit. It is why I have been honored with five state music awards for the Best Music Composer and Director, said Dissanayake.
It is natural that having achieved so much in life he would want to give something back to the industry that made him who he is. No doubt by masterpieces like Samanala Sandhawaniya he is rendering a great service to not only the industry, but to his country. Among his achievements are Five State Awards, Four Cinema Awards and Four Tele Drama Awards.
Dissanayake feels that nothing can take the place of hard work. You may have talent but if you do not work hard then it is wasted. If you have ambitions and goals you need to work towards them. You need commitment and you need to persevere. You can be surrounded by so many gifted people, but it comes down to you ultimately.
My message to anyone who wants to enter the industry or for someone who wants to succeed in life is to be thorough with whatever field you are in. You need to work hard with dedication. Dont stick to one subject. Be well rounded. Expose yourself to a variety of experiences. Knowledge is vital so gather knowledge. Gain knowledge in other fields as well, said Dissanayake.
Music gives meaning to this mans life. It is his calling. His journey. Dissanayake is also deeply philosophical. Music is his passion and he deeply contemplates on life. It is almost meditative. Music is so meaningful to all of us, because it unites all of us. It is what we have in common. It speaks to our hearts.
Music is a wonderful art which can express different feelings of human beings, that cannot be expressed through a language. It can conquer all racial, religious and caste divides. Ones color does not matter when it comes to music. It conquers galaxies and the whole universe. It is faster than the speed of light. And it cannot be measured. That is why it is a global language, explained Dissanayake

Stay inside; theres nothing outside..!
As more rapes, lynchings and murders take place and India, becomes more unsafe, one wonders whether there is a larger conspiracy as this humorous thought entered my head. Though sometimes it isnt always humour is it
Terrible! Terrible! shouted a senior official of the government, We cant implement any projects without people complaining! The bullet trainis in a controversy because commuters want to first make the existing railways safe!We cant build metros in the cities, because people say buildings are shaking!
And sir, said his junior, In Mumbai, they dont want the metro to run under a Fire temple because it will upset the magnetic waves! Another line has activists fighting against trees being cut!
Trees, people, temples! All are conspiring against us and at this rate we will not have anything ready by 2019!
Is that an auspicious year sir asked his junior.
Thats election year dammit, and if we cant show bullet trains, roads and metros, we are doomed!
Maybe we should think different sir! said his junior.
How different sighed the senior government official, People want to travel, we have nothing to offer them! Not even river transport!
Let them stay at home sir! said his junior.
Stay at home asked his senior, You want the whole country to stay at home
Yes sir, if they stay at home they will not want new means of going from place to place!
But why should they stay at home dammit
Because its unsafe outside! exclaimed his junior with a smile, It is so unsafe, people will be afraid to come out!
So what you are saying, saidhis senior slowly, Is to create such tension outside that people wont venture out and wont realize weve not made any progress
His junior nodded brightly, We encourage murders, rapes, stone throwing and all sorts of violence outside. We make it unsafe for women, have gangs strip them for love jihaad, kill journalists, and sir soon doors will be locked and boarded with everybody safe and immobile inside!
The senior officialnodded smugly, You know something, thats exactly the situation in the country now, theres anger, rage, communal tension and fear! Give me the phone please!
The junior officer handed the phone to his senior obediently, then heard him telling all departments to stop work. And to win the elections, continued the junior, We could have hourlytalks by the PM to keep people glued to new promises, which anyway they will never venture out to see if implemented or not!
His senior shook his head in wonder, patted his junior on the shoulder and decided to transfer the young fellow to a remote area, before the junior had aspirations of taking over his job..! [emailprotected]
