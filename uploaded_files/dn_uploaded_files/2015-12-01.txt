American Music Awards 2015 winners
The 2015 American Music Awards held on Sunday night at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Wearing a bejewelled, tribal printed bodysuit she pulled off some incredible moves to some of the year's greatest hits, including Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk", Drake's "Hotline Bling" and Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda". She encouraged her feverish fans to "find their voice".
One Direction, who performed "Perfect", won favorite duo or group - pop/rock.
Though 1D earned loud applause the night was about girl power.
To present the award for Best New Artist to country singer Sam Hunt, Jlo flashed her beige bra in a black sheer lace outfit and cinched her waist with silver belt.
Lopez and Diddy dated from 1991 to 2001; she was with the 46-year-old rapper and businessman when he was arrested on weapons violations charges outside the Times Square Club in NY in 1999. She also impressively sang in nearly a cappella form.
The singer's comeback album, "Purpose", is likely to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart - though it's in a close race with One Direction's "Made In the A.M". She is the leading nominee with six including song and collaboration of the year for "Bad Blood" with Kendrick Lamar, favorite female artist - pop/rock, favorite album - pop/rock for "1989" and favorite artist - adult contemporary.
Bieber's performance wasn't the only well-received one: Celine Dion paid tribute to the victims of the recent Paris attacks by singing Edith Piaf's "Hymne  L'Amour" in French as some audience members cried.
If there's anything people look forward to at award shows - aside from the much-hyped superstar performances and actual awards - it's what the stars are wearing.

Angelina Jolie Pitt: 'I'm on fire inside'
Angelina Jolie Pitt is poised and self-aware, yet she pulls a face when I ask whether her kids think she's cool. There are, famously, six of them (aged between seven and 14). "They think I'm weird," she says eventually. But then she shrugs: well, alright, they might. "Maddox [who is 14] talks to me sometimes about writing as if he doesn't think I'm terrible at it... And Vivienne is just happy I'm a tiger in a panda movie. But, ah, she's just the little one - she's all sweet."
She ponders again. "I mean, there are moments when I can be cool, but they like to mess with me. They like to make fun of me. I'm just..." She breaks off. "Little Mommy."
On the sofa in front of me is the consummate professional, sat perfectly upright, in all-black (well, alright, leather trousers and a slip vest), a woman who had serenely but firmly shaken my hand. And yes, here were are, conducting a meticulously planned chat, no time for faffing about. But if we had all day (and we really don't; she keeps a tight schedule) I would wager that Angelina Jolie Pitt would talk nonstop about her kids.
Some have described this actor, 20 years in the business, as a cunning manipulator of her own image. This newspaper once wrote: "The Hollywood star never plays ball with the press, so her detractors claim, unless she is completely in charge of the rules... She seems eternally torn between wanting to blow smoke in the face of her own public and a stronger urge to reveal herself. The tattooed Tennessee Williams quote on her body that reads: 'A prayer for the wild at heart kept in cages' is the ultimate attempt at control."
I look at the tattoos - the Williams quote on her left arm, soon to be masked by a cardigan she will shrug around herself in the autumn chill. And later on I will witness a moment when her eyes threaten genuine, unwished-for tears. Yes, she's an actor... but when this moment comes she looks a little horrified at herself. Keeping those tears in - now that requires some control.
Because the woman I meet, I can see, has just come out the other side of a turbulent stretch of time: two terrible years of having to make agonising decisions about her health, and undergoing life-affecting surgery. In 2013, after being told that she had a 89% chance of developing breast cancer (due to her carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 gene) she underwent a double mastectomy. Then in March this year, after experiencing a cancer scare - and having already been told she had a 50% chance of developing ovarian cancer (the disease that claimed her mother's life at 56) - she went ahead with surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes.
This is a woman who, at the age of 39, orchestrated a situation that meant she could no longer biologically have children, because she felt she had no option other than to save herself. Who has forced, as explained in an article she wrote for the New York Times, early menopause. Today, when I ask, she says the physical symptoms have shown themselves "a little. But also your emotions adjust a bit. I feel matured in a way that I'm happy about. I'm at this other stage in my life - and it's not a bad thing at all."
There is a feeling that Angelina has moved into a new chapter. That these days, family - living real life - is at the heart of everything she does, thinks and believes. But she will correct this: "Maybe it's because the women in my side of the family tend to get sick and pass away relatively young [her grandmother and aunt on her maternal side also died of cancer], but I've never been somebody who put work before life."

Bravo!
The French students of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda were invited by the prestigious Mayo College, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India to participate in their annual French Language Competition.
Various countries competed in the contest and Lyceum International School, Nugegoda was the only school to be invited from Sri Lanka, having satisfied the criteria for the standard of French and the overall standing of the school. Thus five selected students participated in the 'Concours de Francais' which was held recently, in the historic 80 acre campus of Mayo Collage.
The team consisted of Ayesha Hettige, who competed in the category of French Reading and won first place in her category, Nishrin Rieza for poetry recital, Mandira Dissanayake, solo song, Sansindu Abeysuriaya

Budget 2016 at a glance...
SC Securities, a fully owned subsidiary of Sampath Bank has done a study on the impact of the 2016 budget and they have weighed the advantages and disadvantages.
SC Securities express that the proposals from a point of view of the Colombo Stock Exchange to favour them.
Following are some of the selected budget proposals and the impacts from it to some of the segments.
Developments in favour of CSE
Share Transaction levy of 0.3% was removed. As a result, this will attract foreign investors interests into the Sri Lankan Equity Market.
Foreigners are allowed to bring in cash to any bank account without the name of a SIA. This relaxed currency regulation will increase the flow of funds to the economy.
Exporters were encouraged to bring in the funds generated and kept outside the country to Sri Lanka.
Foreign holding limit of Government Securities will be reduced from 12.5% to 10.0% - This will divert the interest of foreigners towards the equity market.
Lanka Hospitals, Hilton  Colombo, Hyatt Residencies, Waters Edge , Grand Oriental Hotel, Ceylinco Hospitals and Mobitel will be listed on CSE  This will increase the market capitalization of CSE, which will be favourable to the Sri Lankan Equity Market.
Promoting senior citizen deposits
We see the initiative taken to reduce the qualifying age from the present 60 years to 55 years and expanding the earlier deposits cap of LKR1mn to LKR1.5mn at an interest rate of 15.0% to increase cost of funding and to exert pressure on NIMs on banks. We expect this to reduce the earnings prospects in the industry,
Pawning Value As a % of Total
Seylan Bank PLC8.7bn4.90% Sampath Bank PLC15.4bn4.20% HNB PLC17.1bn3.60% PABC PLC1.3bn1.60% UBC PLC447.5mn1.00% DFCC PLC1.4bn0.90% NTB PLC558mn0.60%
Commercial Bank PLC1.953bn0.40%
NDB PLC224.8mn0.10% SME Sector emphasis
Currently, the banking sector overlooks the SME sector due to its inherent credit risk associated due to lack of asset base to provide asset backed lending. However, governments initiative to implement credit guarantee schemes from 2016 onwards with an allocation of Rs 500 mn to selected financial institutions to recover 75.0% of the principal amount in case of default and obtaining US$ 100mn from ADB to support lending to SMEs will increase the focus of banks and financial institutions towards SMEs.
Therefore, we see this as a positive development towards the SMEs which represent 80.0% of the registered businesses.
We see prospects for counters such as Sanasa Development Bank, Bimputh, and Commercial Credit who are currently focused on to this sector.
Proposed mergers
*HDFC + State Mortgage and Investment Bank = National Housing Bank *Lankaputhra + Regional Development bank = Lanka Enterprise Bank *Savings Bank + NSB = NSB *Divineguma Bank + NSB = NSB
We believe this consolidation largely comprising of state owned banks will be more streamlined and will be appositive development towards the financial sector of Sri Lanka. However, this will create competition for the listed counters going forward.
Others developments
Employees receive salaries through bank accounts. This will increase the deposit base of banks which we see as a positive development.
Bank draft chargers to be reduced from Rs 250 to Rs 150. This will limit the fee and commission income prospects of banks.
Removal of Stamp duty on credit card for local purchases. We expect this to promote the credit card usage in the economy and to facilitate the expansion of fee and commission based income.
Return on cheques to be considered a serious offence  This will promote timely depositing of cash and maintaning cash balances in current accounts. As a result, this will promote CASA ratio of banks further to result in increase NIMs.
Measures to promote banking accounts for children will further strengthen the NIMs of banks with the ability to increase the low cost deposit mobilization.
Allowing local companies to borrow from international Banks  We see this to impact corporate banking activities of the banks with increased competition setting in from International banks being allowed to fund directly to local companies.
Removal of WHT of 2.5% - We expect this development to promote a savings culture in the economy. As a result, this will increase the deposit mobilization of banks overall. Further, this will increase low cost funding such as savings and will reduce the need of the banks to borrow further.
To impose the cap on interest rates offered by finance companies  This will enable to regulate the finance companies. However, this will have an impact on the potential for earnings growth and we see an impact on all listed finance companies.
Restriction on lending to unsuspecting borrowers - We see this as a positive development which will enable the overall finance industry NPLs to reduce with increased pressure on borrowing conditions.
Investors allowed to bring in money to any bank account  This development will certainly benefit the banks to increase deposit mobilization.
Proposal to maintain a dedicated bank account for each company for government related payments. We believe this will also increase the deposit mobilization and increase the CASA ratios.
Initiative to set up an EXIM bank - We perceive this as a negative development towards listed banking and finance counters in the CSE, as this will set in more competition and reduce earnings prospects.
Initiatives taken to reduce cost of living by bring won prices of essentials and further easing the cost of living for people and increasing PAYE to higher cap of LKR2.4mn, will increase saving levels in the economy. Therefore, we expect increased deposit mobilization of banks and finance companies. Also, on the other hand, personal loans demanded in the economy will also reduce.
Initiative taken to remove import taxes on gold and further issuing 50 import licenses will promote gold as an investment commodity in the economy from a domestic level. We believe this will have an impact on the level of savings in the economy and resulting impact in the deposit mobilization of banks.
Proposed to develop International Finance Center in Colombo with a 30,000 sq ft area. We believe this will increase the free flow of funding and expansion of the financial system in the economy which will in return, the growth prospects of the banking and finance sector.
Allowing the foreigners to borrow 40.0% of their investments in condominiums from banks in local currency  This will positively affect the local banking and finance industry.
Taxation
The applicable corporate tax has been increased from 28.0% to 30.0% for the banking and financing sector.
The NBT has been expanded from the current 2.0% to 4.0%. This will inevitably, reduce earnings potential in terms of transaction volumes for the banks and finance companies.
We expect this to reduce the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Insurance
The new requirement of the insurance companies to issue medical insurance covers up to the age of 75 will increase the claims ratio, and will have a downward pressure on the thin profits currently enjoyed by the insurance industry as a whole.
Proposed initiative to provide health insurance schemes by EPF will reduce the demand made for life insurance policies. We perceive this also as a negative for the listed counters.
The applicable corporate tax has been increased from 28.0% to 30.0% for the insurance sector.
We expect this to reduce the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Beverage, Food and Tobacco Sector
We believe reduced prices of essentials and initiatives taken to reduce FMCG products for the benefit of consumers from the 2016 budget to positively impact BFT counters, with increased demand setting in and resulting volume driven performance.
Proposals that affect FMCG companies positively
*To reduce the Special Commodity Levy (SCL) of potatoes by Rs 25/- per kilogram. Accordingly, it is expected to provide a price ranging from Rs 75/- to 85/- for a kilogram of potatoes for the consumers
*To reduce the SCL for big onions by Rs 25/- and to provide consumers with a price ranging from Rs 85/- to 95/- per a kilogram of big onions.
*To reduce the price of a 400 gram packet of locally manufactured milk powder to Rs 295/- and in order to cover the loss incurred by the local milk powder manufacturer, the Government will provide a subsidy of Rs 30/-
*To reduce price of infant milk powder by Rs 100/- per kilo.
*To reduce the price of a canned fish tin of 425 grams to Rs 125/-. Accordingly, to provide a subsidy of Rs 15/- for a canned fish tin of 425 grams.
*To limit the maximum retail price of Sprats to Rs 410/- per kilogram.
*To implement a maximum retail price of Rs 169/- per kilo of dhal
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 1,100/- for a kilo of Katta
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 425/- for a dried fish kilo of Salaya
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 169/- for a kilo of chick pea
We expect these developments to promote increase consumption and also promote the per capita purchasing power to result in increased volumes.
Granting depreciation on machinery and reduction of taxes associated with machinery used in the dairy industry  This will be beneficial for counters mainly into the dairy industries NEST, Lanka Milk Foods, Lucky Lanka Milk, and Renuka Foods.
SCL imposed on fish imported will most likely positively contribute towards the business development of canned fish manufacturers such as Renuka Foods and Tess Agro.
Taxation -FMCG
The applicable corporate tax has been decreased from 28.0% to 15.0% for the FMCG sector counters such as CCS, CARG, RICH, COCO, NEST, Keells Foods Products, Bairaha Farms, Convenience Foods etc. We expect this to increase the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Liquor and Tobacco
*Reduction of corporate tax from 40.0% to 30.0%
*Introduction of Surtax at a rate of 25.0% on the income tax liability
*Beedi manufacturing License fee will be increased from LKR1,500/- to LKR5,000/-
*Increasing the manufacturing license fee of Distilleries to LKR150mn
*Excise duty of LKR250mn per month
*Custom duties to be revised and tax on imported foreign liquor imported to be increased
We gather that these developments will have an adverse effect on the bottom line expansion of DIST, CTC, LION and BREW.
Retail and trading
VAT imposed on wholesale and retail trade has been proposed to be removed. We believe that counters which has exposure to retrial and trading such as CARG, JKH, and RICH will benefit going forward, with increased volumes.
Apparels
Revised import taxes on garment, shoes and accessories with the view of developing Sri Lanka as a shopping destination.
We believe high end retail counters such as ODEL, SHL to benefit. However, income tax has been increased to 30.0% from 28.0%.
Manufacturing
It was proposed to ban all used consumer capital goods such as TVs, washing machines etc. from 1ST January 2016. This will increase the demand for consumer goods. Also it was proposed to reduce PAL Tax on consumer electronics. Additionally these industry tax rates applicable for manufacturers of these goods were reduced to 15.0% from 28.0%, while companies that are involved in trading of these goods will face an increase in taxes from 28.0% to 30.0%.
We believe this development to go favorable for Regnis and Singer Industries.
Tile and ceramic
* Tile, clay and sanitary wear removed from the BOI negative list
* Reduced taxes for importation
We believe counters that are directly into tile and sanitary manufacturing such as Lanka Tiles, Lanka Walltiles, Royal Ceramics would face price based competition from cheap imports particularly from China.
Therefore, we see limited profit prospects for this sector in the forthcoming period.
Chicken
*To promote local industries of Chicken
*To increased investments to promote local industry
*Export markets  utmost assistance promised
*Maximum retail prices were increased to LKR400 and LKR480 (without skin)
We believe this development would go in favour for counters such as Bairaha, and counters that are operating in the upper tiers of the value chain such as three acre farms and Ceylon Grain elevators and CIC.
Motors Proposals
*To introduce a simple unit rate of excise duty for the vehicles on the basis of cubic centimeters. Duties on the percentage basis on certain vehicles will also be revised.
*A fee on valuation certificates obtainable for finance facilities will be charged: - Three wheeler/Motor Cycle - LKR5,000. All other vehicles - LKR25,000/- with effect from January 1, 2016.
*Unregistered vehicles to be registered before 31/03/2016: Such vehicles could be registered by paying the following fee to RMV: - Cars/ Vans - Rs.01 Mn - Other vehicles - Rs.0.75 Mn
*A fee will be imposed in lieu of Motor Vehicle Importers Registration fee with effect from January 1, 2016 - Motor Cycle/three wheelers- Rs.2,000/- Motor Cars - Rs.15,000/-
*Emission Levy  The levy is payable at the point of renewal of annual license on every motor vehicle which is over 03 years at the rate of Rs 5,000/- per year
*To reduce Excise duty to 2.5% for the vehicles which are run entirely on Solar, Hydrogen or Helium.
These developments will result in contracting the vehicle importation and registration market which expanded quite aggressively during the 1st 11 months of 2015.
Therefore, we believe counters such as DIMO, UML, Sathosa Motors, Colonial Motors to have a contraction in profits reported in the forthcoming period.
Hotels sector
Proposals
*Tourism Development Levy will be removed.
*Plans to promote Bentota, Colombo Fort, Mirissa and Galle as tourist destinations  Rs 500mn allocation
*Promotion of the medical tourism  legislation for this industry
*Exhibition centers to be established
*Need for registration of all hotels in the Tourist Development Board to be registered in order to obtain a star category (60% hotels not registered)
*LKR100 million would be allocated as a start to train workers through a public private partnership.
*New tax structure to make a shopping paradise on several items that will have lower import duties
We believe in the short to medium term, none of the proposed initiatives will have a direct impact on the listed counters that are into hospitality and tourism.
Plantations Sector - Proposals
*To promote all regional plantation
companies to get listed on CSE
*To promote recultivation
*A restructuring committee to look after the plantation companies  a special report will be issued
*Profits and income from the cultivation of tea or rubber by any plantation company, of which the Government shareholding is in existence, will be exempted for a period of 2 years commencing from April 1, 2016.
Tea
*Not enough value addition
*Blending and value adding behind Dubai
*Positioning SL as a Tea blending country
*A new committee appointed to increase the value addition
*To rebrand Ceylon Tea  compulsory
*Cultivation companies to get 2 year
tax holidays
*Coco, tea, rubber (research sectors  LKR200mn for 2 years)
*Two year tax exemption for Tea and Rubber growers to incentivise
Rubber
*Technology subsidies are looked at
*LKR100mn will be allocated for development of the industry
Coconut
*LKR250mn allocation Other crops
*Arecanut  promotion of commercial cultivation
*Arecanut collection centers
*Value added Erica nuts to be developed for exports
*Planting corporation support
The proposed developments are more towards survival of the industry than for an expansion Therefore, we do not foresee any contribution to the plantation companies listed.
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Sector - Proposals
* Custom Duty will be revised on Agriculture machinery and equipment
*A reduction of 50% of the tax payable on the profits from the locally developed seeds and planting materials for a period of 5 years.
*A reduction of 50% of the tax payable on the profits from agriculture by a company using drip irrigation method, greenhouse technology and high yielding seeds for a period of 5 years.
*The triple deduction for Research and Development expenses will be allowed only if a technology advancement and yield development is proved
We believe this will have a favorable impact on CIC in the medium term, with fertilizer and seed business.
Lubricants and bitumen- Proposals
*Liberalize the lubricant market and liberalize the bitumen segment in Sri Lanka
*Plans to remove lubricants from BOI negative list
*To promote new production
*Reduce the tax rate by 50.0% - for 1 year capital nature to bring investments into the lubricants sector
Proposal to liberalize lubricants can be seen as favourable from consumers point of view when the motor vehicle market has expanded quite rapidly in the recent past. However, this will trigger price competition to the 2 large players mainly Chevron and LIOC. This will have a direct impact on the bottom line in the forthcoming period, with reduced profits.
Liberalizing the bitumen industry will increase the current no. of players largely limited to two. This will have a direct impact on growth and profit prospects of LIOC.
Power and Energy Sector
Proposals -Bunkering
*Increased participation of the private sector encouraged for deep sea bunkering
*Hambantota land to be allocated for ship building an repairing activities
We identify this to have direct impact on LIOC as bunkering was seen as a main sector that generated revenue and profits to the company in the recent past.
Power
*Power and energy developed in line with the Megapolis concept in cities
*Eco friendly power generation
*More emphasis on solar power generation and other renewables
*Expenditure for solar power by houses  qualified payment for tax purposes
*Investments into generation activities will be allowed without any restrictions
*Letters of Intent issued by the CEB for Non-Conventional Renewable Energy projects (NCRE) that has already been issued but unutilized for more than 1 year as at 31. December, 2015 will cease to be operational.
Price of a 12.5kg of LPG gas cylinder by LKR150, with immediate effect  We expect this to have a negative bearing on LGL by exerting pressure on their gross profit margins.
Telecommunications Sector - Proposals
Telecommunication Levies
* International Telecommunication Operators Levy (ITOL) on incoming calls will be increased US$ Cents 9 to US$ Cents 12.
* Environmental Fee will be charged per tower at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per annum.
* Cess levied at 2% for international transit traffic will be exempted
* Exemptions for NBT will be removed
We believe these proposed initiatives will have a negative impact on the 2 large players namely Dialog and SLT, with increased costs going forward.
Construction Sector- Proposals
* One section of the central expressway allocated to local contractors.
* Housing sector to be made self sufficient
* Megapolis concept to be implemented
* Foreign contractors should work with local partners to increase experience and knowledge
* Deep sea sand to be accessed with machinery which are imported on a duty free basis
* To allocate Rs.1,000 million in 2016 as seed capital of the proposed public private partnership, Infrastructure Development Authority (IDA) to expand the Central Expressway to connect Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitvu and Jaffna
* It is also proposed to provide guarantees to the IDA , should the company be engaged in raising debt finance domestically or internationally.
* Constructing a new access road from the Kelani Bridge to the Colombo Fort improving access to Fort. - to allocate a sum of Rs.4,000 million to be utilized within a period of 2 years.
* To construct an elevated road from Cotta Road to Kaduwela on BOT basis. - to commit a sum of Rs.10,000 million
* To allocate Rs. 15,000 million for the expansion of the road network which includes the expansion of the Ruwanpura Expressway, extension of Marine drive up to Panadura, extension of the Pamankada - Ratmalana Road, new bridge construction over the Kelani River, reconstruction of 25 bridges and 3 flyovers.
These increased infrastructure development projects proposed will be beneficial for the 2 large construction counters namely Access Engineering and MTD Walkers. Therefore, we believe these 2 counters will have the project pipelines filled going forward with the increased emphasis on infrastructure development
Land and Property Sector
Land (Restriction on Alienation) Act
* Restriction on transfer will be removed for certain identified investments
* Tax on leasing of lands will be removed
*Allowing the foreigners to borrow 40.0% of their investments in condominiums from banks in local currency
*Mansion tax will be removed from condominiums.
These relaxing of rules with regard to land and property, will increase the prospects for property sector counters particularly to OSEA, which is currently attractive in this sector.

'Efficient, uninterrupted electricity supply govt's aim'
The government's intention is to provide an efficient, uninterrupted and quality electricity supply to the consumers. The four percent Nation Building Tax levied by the Budget will never be passed on to the consumers, Power and Renewable Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister was addressing ministry staff when Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera assumed duties at his new office on November 30.
Siyambalapitiya said eventhough he and Deputy Minister Perera belonged to two different political parties they were following the same path with great mutual understanding as service to the people was their main objective and concern.
This united stand would ensure great progress to the ministry in the future.
Siyambalapitiya said their concern was to provide electricity supplies to two percent of the population which had been denied the facility. They would also work hard to provide job satisfaction to the 20,000 workforce attached to the ministry and institutions under its purview.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said it was a happy occasion as his ministry has received a new auditorium and a refurbished office.
Emphasising the need for leaders and members of all parties in the national unity government to shed party differences and affiliations and work in unity if they were to continue for the full term of five years. Perera said he and his minister had been able to subscribe to this view and work together to give effective leadership to find solutions to problems affecting the power sector by identifying and classifying them into short term and long term problems.
He said some people below the poverty line were suffering today due to lack of electricity. They would be provided an advance of Rs. 40,000 each to obtain electricity to their homes under a simple formula provided that the grama sevaka certified their residence even if they did not have ownership to their houses.

[If I were 21]
Epic dream
At 21, I would be hopefully working with the great Film Directors of that time and learning and studying their methods and also working in various departments of the Film Studio Complex with the intention of returning to Sri Lanka and building my own studio. I would still be enthusiastically involved in the learning curve with the hope of creating my own movies. My dream since I was 16, was to create my own movies

Well one thing can be said of Chandran Rutnam - if he was 21 today he would live life as fully as he did when he was 21, years ago. He has had a great time in life and if he was 21 today, well life would still be adventurous and exciting as it was when he was 21, years ago. He wouldn't have missed a minute of it!
Asking Chandran, if he was 21 today would he do things differently than when he was 21, years ago, to which he answered - 'I wanted to go to Hollywood and I went and had a great time', and I don't believe for one minute that he is fibbing!
Rutnam is larger than life and seriously could we imagine Chandran Rutnam any other way He has always been outspoken, charismatic and dynamic!
"I was 21 today I wouldn't have done it any differently than when I was 21, years ago. And a definite yes! I would still be interested in films if I was 21 today, but the difference is that I would have made my own films much earlier. With the new technology in the film industry I would have accomplished more, much sooner and entered my other two passions much earlier: Women and Aviation," said Rutnam.
Well I must say that Chandran's handsome face and confidence would draw the interest and attention of the fairer sex even if he was 21 a century from now.
I asked him what kind of dreams and ambitions he would have if he was 21 today and he answered:
"Having my own film studio, having my own airline and having my own harem. I would have only accelerated my advancement in my three passions and done things much sooner. Thank God, I have the same drive, abundance of energy and the same desires, even now."
Have my own harem! My goodness that is a bold answer. But Chandran Rutnam is a bold man with an inimitable sense of humor.
"At 21, I would be hopefully working with the great Film Directors of that time and learning and studying their methods and also working in various departments of the Film Studio Complex with the intention of returning to Sri Lanka and building my own studio.
"I would still be enthusiastically involved in the learning curve with the hope of creating my own movies. My dream since I was 16, was to create my own movies."

Five ways work will change in the future
As part of our report on how work is changing, we take a peek into a world where your boss is tracking you, your neighbour is a robot, and its cool to be old employment, but not as we know it.
1. Workplace structures
Forget the rigid corporate ladder  now the corporate lattice allows free-flowing ideas and career paths
Browse the business section of any bookshop and youll find dozens of titles promising to share the secret to climbing the corporate ladder. But the day is not far off when such books will seem as quaint and outmoded as a housekeeping manual from the 1950s.
One of the key workplace trends of the 21st century has been the collapse of the corporate ladder, whereby loyal employees climbed towards the higher echelons of management one promotion at a time. Cathy Benko, vice-chairman of Deloitte in San Francisco and co-author of The Corporate Lattice, says that the ladder model dates back to the industrial revolution, when successful businesses were built on economies of scale, standardisation and a strict hierarchy. But we dont live in an industrial age, we live in a digital age.
And if you look at all the shifts taking place, one [of the biggest] is the composition of the workforce, which is far more diverse in every way, she says.
This new diversity, combined with technological advances, has fed demand for a more collaborative and flexible working environment. Benko estimates that companies have flattened out by about 25% over the past 25 years, losing several layers of management in favour of a more grid-like structure, where ideas flow along horizontal, vertical and diagonal paths.
2. Artificial intelligence

The robots are coming and if the forecasts are correct, they could sound the death knell for millions of jobs
In recent years, automation has become increasingly prevalent. We think nothing of paying for groceries at a scanner or transferring money on a screen without going into a bank. Weve grown accustomed to the idea of self-driving cars and computers that can talk to us.
As marvellous as these innovations may seem, they can also be destructive, rendering entire professions obsolete even as they boost productivity and convenience. And now, if widespread predictions are correct, automation in the workplace is set to increase at an unprecedented rate.
Theres going to be a huge change, comparable to the industrial revolution, says Jerry Kaplan, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who teaches a class in artificial intelligence at Stanford. Robots and intelligent computer systems, he says, are going to have a far more dramatic impact on the workplace than the internet has.
By absorbing the routine aspects of our jobs, optimists argue, machines are freeing us up for more creative activities
Kaplan isnt alone in this belief. A 2013 study by the Oxford Martin School estimated that 47% of jobs in the US could be susceptible to computerisation over the next two decades. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that, by 2025, robots could jeopardise between 40m and 75m jobs worldwide.
There have been two major developments over the past 10 years, says Kaplan. The first relates to advances in machine learning  the ability to organise large volumes of data so you can get actionable intelligence.
The second is the availability of data of all kinds, coming from smartphones and other low-cost sensors out there in the environment. When you add those two things up  the availability of the data along with the ability to interpret it  it enables a whole lot of things that you couldnt do before.
3. The human cloud

Websites that match employers with freelancers are growing fast  and so is the potential for lower wages and inequality
In the past decade cloud computing has radically altered the way we work, but its the growth of the human cloud  a vast global pool of freelancers who are available to work on demand from remote locations on a mind-boggling array of digital tasks  which is really set to shake up the world of work.
The past five years have seen a proliferation of online platforms that match employers (known in cloud-speak as requesters) with freelancers (often referred to as taskers), inviting them to bid for each task. Two of the biggest sites are Amazons Mechanical Turk, which lays claim to 500,000 turkers from 190 countries at any given time, and Upwork, which estimates that it has 10 million freelancers from 180 countries on its database.
They compete for approximately 3m tasks or projects each year, which can range from tagging photos to writing code. The market is evolving so quickly that its hard to pin down exactly how many people are using these sites worldwide, but management consultants McKinsey estimate that by 2025 some 540 million workers will have used one of these platforms to find work.
The benefits for companies using these sites are obvious: instant access to a pool of cheap, willing talent, without having to go through lengthy recruitment processes. And no need to pay overheads and holiday or sick pay. For the taskers the benefits are less clear cut. Champions of the crowdsourcing model claim that its a powerful force for the redistribution of wealth, bringing a fresh stream of income and flexible work into emerging economies such as India and the Philippines (two of the biggest markets for these platforms). But herein lies the problem, as far as critics are concerned. By inviting people to bid for work, sites such as Upwork inevitably trigger a race to the bottom, with workers in Mumbai or Manila able to undercut their peers in Geneva or London thanks to their lower living costs.
4. Workplace monitoring

Bosses apparently worry about the health of their staff and are asking them to wear trackers. Nothing sinister about that...
It is becoming easier than ever for employers to keep an eye on their staff. With emerging technologies, companies can monitor where employees are and what theyre up to but also how theyre feeling  whether theyre stressed, tired or not getting enough exercise outside work.
Some workplace tracking technologies are already widely used. Low-cost GPS systems are used to record the progress of delivery drivers. Earpieces relay orders to warehouse employees and can also track their performance and downtime. At Amazon, workers are encouraged to report on each others performance via an online feedback tool.
Monitoring more intimate details about personal health and wellbeing is less commonplace, though thats expected to change with the spread of wearable technology.
Last year, sales of devices such as the Fitbit and Jawbone, which track exercise, food intake, sleep patterns and other health-related information, totalled 26.4m; that number is expected to rise to 72.1m by the end of this year. According to the technology research company Gartner, around 10,000 companies worldwide offered their staff fitness trackers in 2014 and the firm predicts that next year most companies with more than 500 employees will offer them.
5. The end of retirement
Forget quitting at 65  everyone is going to have to stay on for longer, but we should exploit older peoples experience
As people live longer  life expectancy at birth has increased globally by six years since 1990, according to the World Health Organisation  they are expected to work longer. This pressure comes from governments, which struggle to afford pensions for a longer-living population, and also from individuals themselves, who find it harder to make their retirement savings stretch as the average life expectancy, which is currently above 81 in the UK, rises.
These trends have led to speculation that we are approaching the end of retirement or at least entering a period in which older workers will stop working gradually rather than abruptly upon reaching retirement age, which currently stands at 65 for men and 62 for women in the UK but will rise to 67 for both by 2028.
For many older workers, however, remaining in employment beyond 65 is an unsettling prospect. A certain type of older worker with sought-after skills can manage transitions from one job to another easily enough, says Matt Flynn, the director of the Centre for Research into the Older Workforce at Newcastle University Business School. For them, a cliff-edge approach to retirement is probably going to be a thing of the past.
Britains GDP could increase by 12% by 2037 if the number of people over 65 in work continued to rise
But, he adds, for a lot of people, not only those in low-skill, physically demanding jobs, but also those who dont have that much experience making job transitions, they are going to feel a real sense of loss in job security and economic security if that cliff-edge approach is taken away. Even if its on a more phased retirement basis, having to work longer than you planned can be quite scary.
Even for workers some way shy of retirement age, holding on to your job isnt always easy. According to one UK survey, redundancy rates by age group in 2011 rose steeply from 5% for under-30s, to 26% for the 45-49 age group, to 37% for those over 50. Even though legislation such as the Equality Act in the UK aims to prevent employers from discriminating on the basis of age, the odds are often stacked against older people applying for jobs.
Sometimes, when an employer has a choice between two candidates, one with up-to-date skills and another with experience and a qualification from 40 years ago, there might be some logic for a risk-averse employer to choose the first candidate, says Flynn.
But it might also be because employers assume that younger people are more adaptable, cheaper, more tech-savvy and are going to stay with the organisation longer. The Guardian

FR filed by Rosy re-fixed for support
The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for support a Fundamental Rights petition filed by former State Minister of Child Affairs Rosy Senanayake who sought an order directing the Elections Commissioner to carry out a recount of the preferences secured by members of the UNP who contested the 2015 General Election from Colombo District.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Chandra Ekanayake, Sisira de Abrew and Anil Goonaratne, the Court was informed that the petitioner's counsel was not present in Court and the respondents are yet to receive notices. Accordingly, the petition was re-fixed for support on February 23.
In this petition, the petitioner Bernadine Rose Senanayake had cited the Election Commissioner, Colombo District Returning Officer, Attorney General and all UNP candidates who contested election from Colombo District as respondent.
The petitioner stated that she was nominated as a candidate by the UNP to contest the Parliamentary General Election 2015 under the UNP symbol from the Colombo District.
She stated that subsequent to the release of the final result sheet, it was brought to the attention of the petitioner by a number of counting agents that in respect of certain polling divisions the votes secured by some candidates had been arbitrarily, illegally and unlawfully altered by the election officials present at the computer room when entering same into the computer.
She stated that the enhancement of the number of preferences secured by curtained candidates and the reduction in the preferences secured by the petitioner as aforesaid caused a distortion of the total preferences secured by the petitioner resulting in an incorrect determination of the preference votes secured by the petitioner. She further stated that this deprived the petitioner a seat in parliament from the Colombo District although the petitioner was in truth in fact qualified to be elected as a member of parliament.
In her petition, Mrs. Senanayake also sought as order to recount the preference votes secured by her and Hirunika Premachandra and Mano Ganeshan.

Gammanpila to vote against budget
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya will vote against the budget in Parliament, party General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at the party office at Pitakotte, Gammanpila said certain members of the common opposition were still undecided whether to vote in favour of the budget or oppose it.
He said these members would take a firm decision on the matter in the coming week. Gammanpila said they did not obtain the signature of the former President to the no-confidence motion against the Finance Minister for strategic reasons.
There are two other ministers in the UNP who are more suitable to be proposed to the post of Finance Minister, he said.
Gammanpila said his firm stand was that Members of Parliament and public servants should be entitled to duty free vehicles.
Today it had been proved that the budget was a mere document without any foundation. The University Teachers Association was keeping mum about the problems which had cropped up in the country.
The whole country was eagerly awaiting the Associations response to these problems, he said.
Wimal Weerawansa, Prasanna Ranatunga and several other MPs were unable to sign the no-confidence motion due to other pre occupations. Some were on visits abroad, Gammanpila said.
Ministers like Dr, Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Kabir Hashim have a good knowledge in economics. A person who had a good knowledge in economics would not vote in favour of the budget, he said.
Gammanpila said a large number of UPFA parliamentarians including Chamal Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa already signed the no-confidence motion against the finance minister.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya publicity secretary Thushara Dissanayake said a powerful minister in the government had already started to harass their General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila.
He alleged that two officers of the Special Presidential Investigation Unit left for Australia at 1.10 a.m. to meet a person called Brad Saddin in search of some information to implicate Gammanpila.

Hello - it's all about Adele
Adele was on a long break from her last album 21. Now four years gone by she is all ready to set the world on fire with her long-awaited album '25'. The first song from this album 'Hello' just sky rocketed overnight beating the listenership of Taylor Swift's Bad Blood video.
This song sent waves around the world and people were all hash-tagging the song and giving their views (which were all positive). Even the biggest A-list Hollywood crowds were all about sharing it on Twitter and all other social media.
For someone who just got out of a bad relationship, this song is your power booster song. It's heartbreaking but it still allows you to get out of bed and start belching out this song. It didn't take long for the social media to start making memes out of this song or for musicians to do their versions of it. Hello just went viral.
So what is 'Hello' about Well we let the lady herself explain it to us.
"That's reaching out to who I used to be when I was younger. And I'm curious to know if our 7-year-old selves, if they met us when we were adults, and we were like, 'Well this is what we ended up doing,' if we'd be satisfied. I love what I do, and I feel really, really lucky, but maybe our 7-year-old selves wouldn't. Maybe they'd be, 'That sounds boring. I want to be a nurse.'
"It's a hello to myself, hello to all my friends, hello to my ex-boyfriend, hello to who I'm going to be in 10 years, hello to my kid in 10 years, hello to my boyfriend in 10 years - to my fans, to everyone.
"That line, 'It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry' - that's my favorite lyric I've ever written."
Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on May 5, 1988. She graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006. She was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
Adele released her second studio album, 21, in early 2011. The album was well received critically and surpassed the success of her debut, earning the singer numerous awards in 2012, including a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year, and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is the fourth best-selling album in the UK of all time. In the US it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified Diamond. The album has sold 30 million copies worldwide.[9]
The success of 21 earned Adele numerous mentions in the Guinness Book of World Records. She is the first woman in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist, and the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. 21 is the longest running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts. In 2011 and 2012, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year. In 2012, Adele was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world. In 2013, she received an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for her song "Skyfall", which she wrote and composed for the James Bond film of the same name.
Adele's third studio album, 25, was released in November 2015. The lead single, "Hello", debuted at number-one in the UK and US, and became the first song to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release in the latter.

India offers more military aid to Sri Lanka

India on Monday offered to provide technical assistance to the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) for upgrading its military requirements.
This was conveyed by Gen. Dalbir Singh, Chief of the Indian Army, during a meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Lt. Gen. Crishanthe De Silva, according to a release hosted on the website of the SLA.
Asked about the offer, the SLAs spokesperson said this could be in the areas of human resources development and hardware, declining to provide further details.
Gen. Singh, who is here at the invitation of Lt. Gen. Silva, highlighted the importance of modernising the SLA to suit international standards.
New areas of training
The SLA chief wanted the Indian Army to explore possibilities of new areas of training. The visiting Chief assured him of his support to continue training programmes. Gen. Singh was given a comprehensive briefing on the SLA by Maj. Gen. B.A. Perera, Director General-General Staff.
On his arrival on Sunday, the Indian Army Chief paid floral tributes at a memorial, set up in Battaramulla near here, for soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), which fought against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during 1987-1990.
Gen. Singh, who was part of the IPKF as a company commander during the Operation Pawan, which was launched to recapture Jaffna, is likely to go to the capital of the Northern Province on Tuesday and visit another IPKF memorial in Palaly.

Kate Middleton and little prince George enjoy a day at the museum
It's the kind of moment that melts your heart. And this one as a royal doozy! Kate Middleton leaned down to son Prince George in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington on October 22, giving her little tyke his first lesson in dinosaurs. The future king of England looked dapper as ever, rocking a crisp collared shirt paired with a navy blue sweater and perfectly quaffed hair.
Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge donned Audrey Hepburn inspired capris pants, the perfect outfit for their casual date. Middleton's attire is quite different from her red carpet look at the James Bond Spectre premiere. The Duchess was surprisingly braless for the event, sporting a risqu low-back gown!
But Kate kept a low-profile while wandering the Natural History Museum, as onlookers say they barely noticed the Duchess and her two-year-old son. She was holding George's hand, showing him around and talking to one of the people who worked there," museum-goer Rimi Rahman said.
The museum later confirmed the visit, stating: "We were very happy to welcome Natural History Museum Patron HRH the Duchess of Cambridge for a private visit last Thursday." - Radar Online

Lace is ace
Once reserved only for lingerie trim, the delicate lace is staging a luxe comeback, rising back up the fashion food chain and showing up on everything from sleek day dresses to frilly weekend tops. Having prevailed through the ages, from refined Victorian looks to racier versions, historically, the fabric was a sign of wealth and elegance and the must-have fashion among renaissance patricians. Today, the delicate material has become a more everyday indulgence and it's now a regular part of women's wardrobes.
"The fabric has had many makeovers since its genesis. It was used to decorate everything from dresses to door knobs and from lingerie, bridal wear to cocktail outfits. However, right now the lace is ruling the runway in its throwback to the 70s and the 90s fashion," shares fashion guru Nachiket Barve. Creative director of Vertical Divani, Sanya Dhir agrees and adds, "The best part of this revival is that both designers and the high street appear to have realised that it doesn't have to be - a) Victorian-like and b) supremely OTT and girlie. The French may have invented the notion but designers have embraced their individual freedom of expression for fall by doing whatever they want with the fabric to bring out exquisite results: featherweight see-through shifts, elaborately crafted sheaths, fluid T-shirts and more. For resort, it's turning up in sophisticated, racy styles from semi-sheer or peekaboo tops to abbreviated skirts and dresses."
Playful colours counter the naughtiness of the lace, creating a sexy attitude that's anything but stodgy. "Forget bridal white and think of sugary pastels and eye-popping neons. For maximum impact, team a bright colour with a neutral and finish the look with a clashing manicure and fluoro accessories," reveals fashion designer Nandita Thirani and adds, "While laces always look great in black and white, this season it's trending in all kinds of hues and patterns. Big bold patterns or intricately detailed ones paired with bright shades of red, yellows, blues and pinks are perfect to make a style statement. Think Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, not the Queen Mother. You also have to be careful here - lace can get cheap-looking quickly. Choose high-quality material and pair vibrant hues with shoes from the same colour family or metallic. Wear your hair loose to keep the overall look easy-going and fun."
You can also texturally mash-up the fabric and bring on your combination-game. Nachiket suggests, "Lace looks best in an elegant grown up format.. guipure lace with heavy duchesse satin or with a silk crepe looks elegant. The 90s can be revived with combining it with leather, denim or even gingham and tartan by paying homage to all that's grunge." About another variation, designer Swatee Singh adds, "If you want something that's a little more contemporary, then, try metallic lace, a type of lace that's made from metal or metallic threads such as gold, silver, or copper. The designs can be worked on a textile ground or the lace can completely be made from metallic threads." Well, now we know that it suits all women but can men ever embrace the feminine fabric "Yes," exclaims designer Paresh Lamba. "Designers have been constantly innovating and experimenting with the fabric, its texture and colour. Lace-inspired sherwanis and coats are a big trend this wedding season that I'll suggest men to try it out."

Ladanai: faith in God and dream of Rev. Neville Coonghe and 30 years on
Thirty years of dedicated service by a gentle missionary has brought Ladani to the threshold of the dawn of a new year, a new decade and the dawn of the years to come.
Given to reason Ladani is required to ponder and itself the question - which way forward or should Ladani be obstinate and be in the disposition of his baser instincts to the easier passage of complacency and vaunt achievements.
The main Ladani Home in the
Diocese of Chilaw

It must be remembered that the first Ladani home founded in 1985, was established with meager resources and amidst many a challenging circumstance of that time.
It was a 'challenge of burden rather a burdening challenge', no ordinary man would have taken up - in those difficult times.
As succinctly put in the foreword, 'it is out of prophetic vision that someone would embark on work of this nature', the tribute and accolades go to Fr. Neville, for embarking on a project of this nature and magnitude and continuing to see it work for 30 long years, facing the trials and tribulation single handedly along the way.
In the process, seven Ladani Homes provide shelter, child-nutrition health-care, educational scholarship, education for all children and awareness programme for pre-school teachers and animated by a leadership of a Rev. Sister to run the Homes.
All these responsibilities upon Rev. Neville's shoulders are run smoothly because of his dedication not only to children but first to God.
It is a gigantic task he handles and believes that God is always there to provide him strength.
Fr. Neville's Ladani took upon itself the duty to protect, care and nurture these lost children and provide a decent future and admirably, he has done so.
The first Ladani Home was inaugurated on November 15, 1985. Ladani also acquiesces in the values embodied in the Universal Rights of Children as well as in other Charters pertinent to children.
Within this framework, Fr. Neville's dream has materialised. Ladani's footprints in the sands of time seems well embedded, and leaves him humble. It is with great contentment and humility that he reminisces in the work of the last 30 years. It was definitely a task that he embarked on, for the only reason that he believed in, that is this work was animated with Divine providence.
It was not simply the work to provide the necessities- shelter, clothing etc to the children who accosted Ladani. It was a work beyond the teachings. It was a manifestation of work Divine, it sometimes called on him to temper the hardest of hearts and the dreadful of men, it was like transforming the deserts into verdant fields.
He saw in his work, not only his God as commonly seen - as the most compassionate, but also beyond the interpretations written by scholars. He saw his God, as a Father beyond all these, he saw God animate himself in his work, and his work was an oblation.
Today, Ladani is an extended service of work to the children. It is sustained by well wishers of whom most are local donors from the middle income earning families, who have stood by us, in our endeavour; equally worthy of mention are foreign donors who have augmented the support to us in a considerable manner.
He holds with deep gratitude their contribution to this cause. Currently Ladani runs seven homes in number, and they are spread out in the island. Ladani incurs a large sum as expenditure on a daily basis for the benefit of its children. He believe this is possible only because of the transparency and commitment.
As for the orphans, he see them in anguish and despair. He see them as children, not only without love and care. He also see in them the lack of social values. Living with these children and inculcating in them the humane values have not been an easy task. At times his staff at Ladani, and his experienced failures in their system - to achieve their objectives, nevertheless they have striven to accomplish their mission - undeterred. In this 30th year, when He look back, he has the pleasure to say that Ladani has surmounted these impediments and seen great success by greater tolerance, confidence, wisdom and the steadfast belief in the Almighty, without which he will not be where we are today.
To this, he must also attribute that he had the good fortune to strengthen the operations at Ladani, by persuading the staff to espouse the value of mutual trust, confidence and unity. He take this opportunity to say that he can rely on his staff and they in turn have the assurance in his leadership. He has and pay deep gratitude to his staff and the management team of Ladani for their continued and able support.
At all times children are made to be mindful that every cent and item that is received as a contribution to Ladani is the produce of great sweat and toil of mind and body of donors. The privilege the children enjoy in our homes is considered 'Manna' from the Heaven, which has thus paved the way for Ladani and its children to endure this long and meaningful journey.
Man by nature has many a shortcoming, however normal it may be, it is yet odd; it is incumbent on any management to look for the pitfalls to avoid a calamity of events. It is with this responsibility that he harness the resources at Ladani to work at its optimum. He is happy he has had the blessings, and also the cooperation of every member of Ladani's administration in the last three decades to make what Ladani is today.
This is the beautiful story of LADANI and its founder, Rev.Fr. Don Neville Coonghe, a God-sent angel to children.

Let shutterbugs grab eyeballs!
It was a day when the shutterbugs arose. It was a day when the shutterbugs were celebrated. The ceremonial inauguration and presentation of awards of the PSSL 60th International Competition and exhibition of Photography was recently held by the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka attended by all the king's men!
"This keenly contested international competition of photography is one of the longest running events in the world. Our society was formed a long time ago with 60 enthusiasts. It was formed in 1906. Now the society has a website and a Facebook page with 23,000 members. The society, for most of its history, has a studio and one dark room. The first exhibition was held in 1907 with 150 frames hung. We have survived and progressed over the years. We are gathered here to celebrate the opening of the 60th International Competition of Photography," said Chairman of the Exhibition Organizing Committee, Romesh de Silva.
There were 180 photos hanging in the gallery. All the pictures in the gallery were those of the winners. They are called 'accepted photographs'. They have earned the highest number of points. And amongst them were medal winners. Most are international with only nine Sri Lankans winning medals. There were 42 countries in the competition and out of them people from 38 countries were selected/ accepted as winners. There were 178 international contestants who submitted and 179 Sri Lankans who submitted. There were 357 contestants. About 3000 images were submitted. As a rule, one contestant can submit a maximum of 12 photos.
"I have been in the Royal College Photographic Club, I was at one time a proud owner of a Kodak. Then my father brought me a Polaroid. My elder brother Shan had an eight millimeter movie camera and also a projector. These were the best technology in the 1960's. Now it has all changed with the technology. Today there is the mobile telephone which has made a photographer out of everyone. And then there is the iPad which everyone uses and which consumes most of the time today, when you go for functions. The whole game has changed. I wonder what new technological innovations will be possible in the next 10 or 15 years. It is a market for innovation. It also gives us more opportunities. This auditorium is named after one of our greatest photographers - Lionel Wendt," said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who graced the occasion as Chief Guest.
The Prime Minister went on to say that the government is keen on the development of photography and the development of talent which has been neglected in the last decade or two. "To make it short and sweet we will see how we can help all of you photographers gathered here. In time to come we will see more Sri Lankan photographers gaining world acceptance," he concluded.

Man who kept his excrement in bags all over rented apartment is jailed
A man who defecated in bags and urinated in bottles, all of which he kept in his rented, luxury apartment has been handed a one year jail sentence.
36-year-old former Apple employee, Robert Kummer, pooed in bags and boxes all over the property during a three-month period.
Kummer's depraved dirty protest caused 15,000 worth of damage to the apartment, but only paid 800 in compensation.
The revolting techie had smeared the walls, floors and ceilings with his poo and had urinated in bottles all over the apartment.
Kummer was jailed for one year yesterday on the count that between June 1 2013 and September 24 2013 at an apartment at The Quay House, Fitton Street East, Cork, he intentionally or recklessly caused criminal damage to the property.
He had failed to appear in court on a previous occasion and a bench warrant had to be issued for his arrest last week.
Residents of neighbouring apartments were complaining about the smell from Kummer's apartment.
Garda Lorraine O'Donovan went to the apartment at Fitton Street on September 24 2013 as a result of a call and she met the landlord there.
As Garda O'Donovan discussed this with the landlord, the accused man happened to be approaching and she spoke with him. Initially, he claimed he had been away in America and had only recently returned. -Sunday World

Megacities and urbanization in South Asia
This essay is prepared on behalf of the General Research Committee (GRC) of Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science (SLAAS) based on an Address delivered on October 15 organized by National Academy of Sciences Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Economic Association and the Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka. Part I was published on November 30.
K. Locana Gunaratna Architect/Urban Planner
Theories from Spatial Economics: Growth Centre Models
Again, it is not possible to discuss these theories in detail here except to say that some are more relevant to development work in the TWCs than others. The intrusion of Economic Growth Theory took place immediately following World War II, intended to help rebuild war ravaged Europe. With this effort underway, the theory was adopted and applied to the TWCs beginning around 1951. It influenced spatial planning through several growth centre models which became popular. These models proposed that capital investment for economic growth of a lagging region, should be made in large concentrations at a few pre-selected geographic points. The assumption was that development would then result and spread from these points.
Unfavourable scholarly reactions based on strong evidence against the Growth Centre models of the 1950s began to appear in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consequently, an important Indian research project (Roy, Patil, 1977: 6) rejected the concept as being irrelevant to rural and regional development in India, favouring instead what was called the service centre concept.
Theory of duality
A school of thought traceable to Boake (1953) saw a TWC's economy as being a duality consisting of: a backward, tradition-bound agriculture sector on the one hand where capitalism is not indigenous and therefore retarded; and, on the other hand, a small, urban industrial sector, where capitalism has been imported full-blown from the West. A fundamental belief behind this theory is that urbanization is essentially a beneficent process; and, that migration to cities is almost the only available process of emancipation from poverty and ignorance for rural folk in the TWCs. The roots of this belief are in the cultural alienation of Western scholars and Westernized urban elites from indigenous rural populations. This theory should not be considered with favour today.
Another set of theories from Spatial Economics which are considered in a much better light today have a lineage beginning with the work of Von Thunen (1823), which is seen now as the origin of a scientifically rigorous German school of thought.
A few other scholars have studied the relationship between the rank and size of towns within any country, where rank refers to hierarchical order and the size of towns is determined by the numbers of residents. These studies have a lineage starting from the work published by Jefferson in1936 and have originated in and been developed within the US. They suggest two very distinct patterns where rank and size are closely correlated in a very regular and predictable manner. In the other pattern the largest city predominates very substantially in size over the next in rank. The latter pattern is said to display primacy and the first ranking urban place is called a primate city.
The usefulness of these studies is two-fold: it focused more light on the existence of the pattern of primacy within many TWCs; and, it suggested a causal relationship between primacy and the economic conditions residual from a history of colonial subjugation.
A Latin American scholar, Frank (1969)also sought to establish a causal link between colonialism and the condition of underdevelopment. He explained the process by which the urban configurations of most TWCs became highly skewed structures. The skewing process he attributed to the military and economic agencies of the respective colonial periods of those countries. His views are well recognized today. A UN publication states: many developing countries are characterized by a so-called dendritic market system, which is the legacy of a colonial past and/or of persisting international dependency relations... (UN/ESCAP, 1979:58)
There are now many Western scholars ( starting with Johnson in 1970who have understood: that a national urban system with a skewed dendritic market structure left behind as a colonial legacy in a TWC, has little utility for national development; that market forces alone cannot be expected to alter a skewed national urban system; and, that some intervention at the national policy level is needed to free the TWC from this particular colonially derived structural constraint.
Small and mid-sized towns
A well-founded approach originated in South Asia with a Seminar in Kathmandu (1978) bearing a strong spatial content has since begun to gain much support. Thereafter two subsequent papers appeared.
In the first, the author (Rondinelli,1986) states: that colonial economic policies reinforced by post-colonial economic growth strategies of the 1950s and 1960s were major causes of the rapid growth of a few primate cities to extraordinary size in most Asian countries; that the emphasis was on developing urban industry over rural development;that the distributional effects and the spatial implications of investment allocation were largely ignored; that although the effort was to modernize the metropolitan economy, rural regions were neglected and left poor and underdeveloped; and also, that in countries with dominant primate cities, few secondary mid-sized cities could grow large enough and have sufficiently diversified economies to attract rural migrants, stimulate agricultural economies and promote regional development.
The second paper also justifies the development of small and intermediate urban places. The authors (Hardoy and Satterthwaite, 1988) have based their recommendations on reviews of over 100 empirical studies across the TWCs and a large number of national programs for small and intermediate towns. According to them, spatial programs "...can be a crucial component in attaining social and economic objectives such as increasing thepopulations reached by basic services; increasing and diversifying agricultural production; and increasing the influence of citizens living in sub-national and sub-regional political and administration units...
A UN publication (ESCAP, 1979: 87) provides some valuable observations and general conclusions for the Asia Pacific regional context. It proceeds to state: that urban-rural inequality is a major problem in the region; that the disparities in respect of services, income earning opportunities and wage rates have caused concern; that many governments in the region should pay more attention to rural development to achieve a more balanced growth spatially and between rural and urban areas and a more equitable distribution of the benefits of national development and economic growth.
Even assuming a committed approach to rural development, out-migration from rural areas for non-farm occupations may be expected to continue, though on a reduced scale. Rather than have rural migrants target the larger cities, the more manageable and preferred scenario would be where they move to the small and mid-sized towns. Then, movements to the large cities would be confined to migrants from mid-sized towns. This pattern of internal migration is sometimes referred to as decentralized urbanization (Sharma, 2003. 10.6, 410). It has to be noted that urban-based services in small and mid-sized towns not only require built infrastructure but also people with special skills are resident. As such skills are not readily available, a proactive planned urban settlement programme to provide these skills in S&M towns is a clear need. (Gunaratna, 2000).
Conclusions
Inter-urban configurations especially in many of the smaller TWCs were formed in response to the needs of their respective colonial economies. They are seen today as being peculiar in two ways: the predominance of a single Primate City over all other urban places; and, the highly skewed pattern of their respective inter-urban configurations. In these respects, Sri Lanka is typical of such TWCs. Post-colonial development efforts even if effective in generating high economic growth, but are made within the framework of such colonially derived spatial structures, will benefit mainly the urban elites based in the respective Primate Cities. They will surely accentuate income inequalities across the respective countries.
Readjusting a distorted inter-urban spatial structure towards current development needs involves mainly the creation of small and mid-sized towns in carefully selected locations relevant to post-colonial development strategies. If the old inter-urban spatial structures are not re-adjusted to respond to the new development thrusts and those efforts are focused only on the respective Primate Cities, rural-urban migration will be exacerbated. Thus, already prevalent income disparities across these countries will be accentuated and the formation and consolidation of slums and shanties will inevitably result.
They will become an increasing part of the built environment of Primate Cities. Such happenings are clearly evident in most TWCs. Continued growth in this manner with mounting adverse environmental consequences can then give rise to diseconomies of scale resulting even in the flight of investments needed to drive further growth.
In the past seven decades, we in Sri Lanka have had three comprehensive plans prepared for the Colombo region. The Gal Oya project took precedence over the first. The Mahaweli project over-shadowed and pre-empted investment in the second. General Elections and a change of government intervened in the case of the third. Thus all three planning efforts were each superseded, one by one, with the passage of time.
A new plan for the Colombo region especially with political will behind it, as appears to be the case today, is most welcome. However, it has to be recognized that all megacities in the Third World have very high rural-urban migrations. They are consequently infested with massive, unhygienic slums and shanties giving rise to unmanageable social and environmental problems.
An important conclusion to be drawn is that the impact upon TWCs of the on-going globalization and popularization of scientific developments and technological innovations particularly in ICT needs to be recognized. These are surely altering the prevalent spatial landscapes of industrialization in the West. Thus, it must be expected that the spatial landscapes of most TWCs and certainly those of the South Asian countries will need to be very different from those that emerged with 19th Century industrialization and urbanization in the West.
There may be better chances of success with urbanization in Sri Lanka because we have so far been insulated to a great extent from the adverse consequences of high rural-urban migration. For this, we must thank the wisdom of our political leadership of the 1930s. The impetus they gave to irrigation and re-settlement of the dry zone, domestic food production, and, rural development through free education and preventive health care.
Despite this initial advantage, a megacity in Sri Lanka created by high rural-urban migration could still suffer the same fate unless special precautions are taken. The precautions are that planning and implementation work should to be based on best practices backed by scientific knowledge. This work should carefully avoid irrelevant concepts and theories found to be faulty. It must also be done within the ambit of an environmentally predicated national spatial policy. The latter is something that most TWCs do not have. Finally for ultimate success, it is necessary that we ourselves should deliberate, define and decide upon the national policy framework that should govern all aspects of this very special development effort.

Budget 2016 allocation for education
MP Bandula accuses Govt. of manipulation
Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said that the figures with regard to the government's allocation towards education have been manipulated to show that above 6 per cent was allocated for the education sector through Budget 2016.
He said that recurrent expenditure of Education and Health Ministries worth Rs. 137 billion have been shown as capital expenditure in a fraudulent manner.
Speaking at press conference at the at Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo 8, Gunawardena said the members of Common Opposition have already informed about the manipulation of figures with regard to allocation to the education and health sectors.
Gunawardena added that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has attempted to mislead the public by showing that Rs. 12,100 million are to be spent for the education sector during the course of the 2016 financial year as capital expendure. "This government promised to allocated 6 per cent of the GDP towards higher education which can never become a reality," he stressed.
He said the Government members and the ministers were boasting that the government made an unprecedented allocations towards the education sector. "What the government is saying about the allocation towards the higher education sector is a blatant lie," he said.

Need for an effective legislature staff
Parliament includes a group of representatives (196 elected, 29 nominated -National list) who have been given a mandate by the citizens to perform certain basic functions. They are representation, lawmaking and the oversight functions. They are also expected to voice and articulate the worries and opinions of the public inside Parliament, debate policies and pose questions to the Ministers.
The President and the Cabinet of Ministers form the Executive. The parliamentarians are tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the activities of the executive while checking the quality of governance. Parliament is responsible to ensure accountability and openness of the government through oversight activities in order to curb corruption and effect good practices. The Parliament also has the power of the purse and the mandate to scrutinize the utilization of public finances and ensure financial accountability.
Parliamentary committees provide better freedom for in-depth analysis for MPs to perform their core functions efficiently. The composition of the Committees will roughly be based according to the proportion reflected in the House. In Committees, the need for consensus building and the requirement for being non-partisan have always been stressed to be more effective and efficient in their decision making. In order for the Committees to be effective, the support staff need to be well-equipped with several core competencies, including excellent writing skills, knowledge in timely and up-to-date manner with regard to current affairs, accurate and well researched information and most importantly the energy, enthusiasm and the desire to perform well. It is also desirable to open the Committee meetings for the general public too.
Committee staff
Parliamentarians of the calibre of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, A C S Hameed, Ronnie de Mel, Lakshman Jayakody and many more demanded high performance with efficiency from the Secretariat. In order to keep pace with their own objectives, the Committee staff had to improve their capacity and effectiveness in abundance. MPs did not wish to suffer owing to the incompetence of the staff. They refused to tolerate incompetence. They always inspired the staff to do more and more.
They never excused lapses. They created an environment in which we too became effective and efficient performers. They did not permit us to be left behind. Furthermore, we did not leave any room at all for the work to suffer. They expected the staff to be excellent performers. In fact, I am grateful because we became efficient since they guided us always with love and affection too.
In terms of the Standing Orders of Parliament of Sri Lanka (SO 121), the composition of the Committee of Selection is usually announced at the commencement (next meeting day after the first sitting) of the session itself. Unfortunately, this process very often takes a couple of months at present. It will be interesting to find out how (we did that) speedily the nominations were done in 1980s in one day immediately after the ceremonial opening. It must be also placed on record the then Leader of the House and the Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa telephoned the Committee Secretariat from USA (having gone to attend the UN sessions) whether we had taken necessary steps to make the announcement, the nominations of members to various Committees.
This was how the pressure was brought by the then parliamentarians on the staff then. This announcement paved the way for the MPs to get down to business immediately in all these committees. And it was considered as important as well for the purpose of considering the number, function and the constitution (including quorum) of numerous Committees such as Parliamentary Business, House, Public Petitions, Standing Orders, High Posts, Consultative, and the Legislative Standing Committees in order to report speedily their opinions thereon to Parliament.
COPE reports
It is imperative even at present to do it expeditiously without lame excuses. This would ensure parliamentary accountability through the committees if we need to take the country forward. According to SOO, Consultative Committees have been tasked with certain specific functions. Nevertheless, they often take up individual matters pertaining to electorates. Professor Rajiva Wijesinha had said: "The real business of Parliament is done in Committees, where the ideas of others are taken into consideration and consensus sought. But, as we see from what happens in most committees, these are seen simply as places to satisfy local needs."
We must remember our parliament is presently being described as a rubber stamp Parliament. The supremacy by the Executive President, severely self-conscious debates, poor representation of the concerns of the citizens had been considered as vital drawback in the system. It is sad the Executive did not extend the support necessary for the Committees to function effectively. DEW Gunasekera and Wijayadasa Rajapaksha submitted several COPE reports to the Parliament and highlighted issues of corruption, mismanagement, fraud etc. In addition, Janaka Bandara in his capacity as the then Chairman of the Committee on Public Petitions, (PPC), being a beginner, submitted an excellent Report to Parliament, which was considered to be a great job done by him. It was later found that he had resigned. I have no doubt he resigned purely because his hands were not strengthened to take the PPC forward.
I did not see any of the reports submitted by numerous committees taken up for debate and decisions taken by the Parliament in order to introduce remedial measures. It may be necessary to lay down certain guidelines as to what needs to be done after a report is submitted by various committees. It is sad these committees do not have any mechanism for follow up action on their reports. However, Committees have broad powers to send for persons, papers, records etc. in order to perform their duties.
It is heartening the practice that had been there to appoint a government member to chair oversight committees has been discontinued by the present government. It is also encouraging Sunil Handunneththi has been appointed as Chairman of COPE, which is a praiseworthy act.
The Prime Minister who is well aware of the numerous inadequacies has taken great pains to streamline the Committee system which had failed in Sri Lankan Parliament totally. The PM should however remember that SOO too have given necessary strength to run the Committees efficiently and effectively. I do not think the systems backed by rules could develop the Committees and produce the desired results. Let me be forthright that a majority of our Ministers, Deputy Ministers and other parliamentarians do not take Committees seriously at present.
Attendance in Committees has been a perennial problem. The practice to pay an incentive payment for attending committees - attendance allowance, was introduced in order to improve attendance. Nothing has worked so far! Nevertheless, it is very important that there should be a highly dedicated and a fully committed staff too, with good, capable leadership to manage the Sectoral Committee Secretariat, if the present government is keen to achieve its goals and establish good governance and rule of law.
The prolonged civil war marred the pace of economic development which caused insurmountable sufferings for the people in the country. This no doubt is because the formal institutional structure and the political system had failed in checking the unrestrained power and authority of the executive. Parliamentarians also failed miserably to call the government to account using its mechanisms available in the parliamentary system.
Political parties
I have no doubt the PM is making a valiant effort to create good understanding and political space between all political parties with a view to take the country forward in order to achieve sustainable growth and economic development. This is certainly a prerequisite for paving the way to ethnic harmony and strengthen peace benefits to a devastated nation as well.
Our country being a multi-ethnic nation, it requires a political set up which could encourage consensus politics and poly-ethnic co-existence through a more vibrant Parliament. It is fortunate that the free press at present strengthened by a vibrant civil society too demands accountability of politicians and public servants unlike in the past. The Committee system should therefore be further strengthened in order to ensure parliamentary control and help achieving the noble goals of democratic governance of a people friendly government.
A strong Parliament is a pre-requisite to a strong committee system and vice-versa. A strong committee system could always hold a government to account - because numerous committees are the most precious internal instruments of any legislature.
According to the Standing Orders, our Parliament, apart from the Committee of the whole House, has four broad categories of Committees: (1) Select Committees (2) Consultative Committees (3) Standing Committees (4) Committees for Special purposes. And according to the Prime Minister, Sectoral Committees will play a bigger role after abolishing the Consultative Committees in future.
We must never forget that in terms of our SOO, we need to summon Consultative Committees every month and this has never happened very often. The relevant SO has been openly been flouted. If so, how do we ensure running the Sectoral Committees well (unless closely monitored) to achieve the intended goals
It may also be worthwhile, at this juncture, to explore the need to set up a Committee on Assurances next. The functions of an Assurances Committee will be to scrutinize the assurances, promises, undertakings etc. given by Ministers from time to time and to report to Parliament on the extent to which such assurances etc. have been implemented and to see whether such implementation has taken place within the minimum time necessary for the purpose. This is the need of the hour.

New Commonwealth chief pledges group will get gutsy
MALTA: Critics brand the Commonwealth ineffectual, but its incoming chief believes the 53-country organisation can use its strength to achieve miracles -- such as eradicating domestic violence. Dominica-born lawyer Patricia Scotland, who was appointed the Commonwealth's first female Secretary-General on Friday, told AFP she would harness the international family's "huge convening power".
Among her top priorities: "Action to combat any form of abuse against women". "One in three women in our world suffer from domestic violence. It's the greatest cause of morbidity between women and girls," she said, adding that there was "a lot of work to do".
"Forced marriage, female genital mutilation, child abduction... these issues affect all of us," said the 60-year-old, who will take over the reins from Indian diplomat Kamalesh Sharma in April 2016. Not everyone is convinced the Commonwealth, which includes vastly different countries accounting for around a third of the world's population, is ready to tackle such issues. - AFP

'No curtailment of relief to the people'
The government will not curtail any relief given to the public and the national unity government is the only government which can fulfill the people's needs, Mass Media and Information Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said in Parliament yesterday.
He made these comments participating in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the seventh allotted day.
Minister Karunathilaka said Budget 2016 was presented in a new form which is completely different from the blue, red and green traditional budget styles.
"It is also a special budget as it was the first budget presented jointly by the two main political parties of the country," he said.
The minister also pointed out that if there was no democratic revolution on January 8, things would not have changed in the country.
"I represented the Southern Province and was elected to Parliament with the highest preferential votes than the Rajapaksas in the South," he said.
Karunathilaka also said that during the budget debate, the opposition used to talk about the prices of essential food items such as big onions, dhal, sugar etc.
"The government has not given any room for it this time by reducing the prices of 11 essential consumer items. The opposition has only got two points to criticise about - the eco test and price hike on imported vehicles," he said.
Budget 2016 has allocated Rs. 21,000 million to develop 14,000 villages. The government has given Rs. 10,000 to public servants as pledged and also reduced fuel and gas prices. This government has created an investment friendly atmosphere in the country, the minister said.
He also noted that there was media freedom today and there was a new political culture in the country with the Maithri-Ranil combination.

'No mobile phone No savings account,' Metro Bank tells pensioner
In the latest case of banking red tape it has emerged a valid mobile number is required to open a savings account at Metro Bank.
Online banking has been enthusiastically embraced by millions of people, but some still prefer the old-fashioned approach of visiting a branch.
It was partly to appeal to this group that Metro Bank opened its doors in 2010, describing itself as "Britain's first new high street bank in over 100 years".
But it seems that the bank still expects its customers to have adopted modern technology.
When Mike Mace, 66, from Cheltenham, tried to take out one of the bank's savings accounts he was told he could not do so without a mobile phone number.
Mr Mace wanted to put some of his savings into Metro's three-year bond, which paid a top rate of 2.7pc. He applied for the account online, but, although he has a mobile phone, he did not want to put his number on the application form. Metro Bank would not process the application without it, so Mr Mace entered a dummy number, 0700000000.
He emailed Metro Bank to explain what he had done. He also suggested that the mobile number field be made optional because not everyone has a mobile phone.
The account was opened and Mr Mace's money was banked. But when he went to access the account online he was blocked. It then transpired that he had been sent a security code to the made-up mobile number he had submitted with his application.
Without this code Metro Bank said Mr Mace could not log in. They told him that to be a customer he needed to have a valid address, email and mobile number for "security reasons".
Mr Mace spent the next two weeks speaking to various members of staff, working his way up the hierarchy. Eventually Metro Bank relented and he was able to log in to the account. For the time spent trying to resolve the issue he was given 75 in compensation.
"I have a mobile, but I do not like giving the number to companies because they just end up bombarding people with marketing calls," he said.
"As it would appear that a valid mobile number is crucial to their business practices, I have suggested that they make this known on the application form together with the statement 'if you do not have a mobile phone, we do not want you as a customer, so abort your application now'."
"In the first telephone discussion, I was advised to visit either the Milton Keynes or Aylesbury branch and provide a genuine mobile number. Making a 100-mile round trip for their inadequacies is unacceptable."
A spokesman for the bank confirmed that additional wording had been added to the online application form after Mr Mace's experience.
The spokesman said a mobile phone number was needed to "authenticate the customer".
"Our online application form clearly states that it is mandatory to provide a mobile phone number and we have added additional wording which explains that if customers do not have a mobile phone number they will need to visit one of our stores [branches] to continue the application process," she said.
"We pride ourselves on offering the best in service and convenience to our customers, and are sorry if on this occasion the customer was dissatisfied with their experience."
According to Savings Champion, the rate monitoring website, most banks and building societies are happy to send security codes by post.
Susan Hannums, a spokesman, said: "For those with access to a mobile phone the security feature seems fairly straightforward to use but of course, for those who don't, this can be frustrating." - Daily Telegraph

Paris climate summit opens with 'life at stake'
FRANCE: World leaders opened a historic summit in the French capital on Monday with "the hope of all of humanity" laid on their shoulders as they sought a deal to avert a climate catastrophe.
The heads of more than 150 nations kicked off 12 days of talks in search of an elusive pact that would indirectly restructure the world economy, weaning it off fossil fuels that stoke global warming.
They met at a conference centre in Le Bourget on the northern outskirts of Paris under heavy security following terror attacks in the city which appeared to have galvanised commitment for a climate breakthrough.
It was the largest single-day gathering of heads of state or government in history, the United Nations said.
"Never have the stakes of an international meeting been so high because it concerns the future of the planet, the future of life," French President Francois Hollande said in an opening speech.
"The hope of all of humanity rests on all of your shoulders."
Scientists warn that, unless action to curb greenhouse gases is taken soon, mankind will endure ever-worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas, threatening millions with hunger, disease and migration and low-lying island nations with oblivion.
US President Barack Obama, who flew to Paris on the eve of the conference to pay homage to the victims of the November 13 Paris attacks, said time was pressing.
"I believe in the words of Martin Luther King Junior that there is such a thing as being too late," he told fellow leaders.
"When it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us."
The US leader said many poorer nations that had contributed little to climate change would be the first to feel its effects.
But he stressed that there was no contradiction between strong economic growth and protection of the environment.
World leaders repeatedly vowed to forge an ambitious deal in honour of the 130 people killed in the attacks in Paris, claimed by the Islamic State group.
The leaders began their talks with a minute of silence to remember the victims.
Obama's first act after touching down in Paris early on Monday was to visit the scene of the worst carnage of the terror attacks at the Bataclan concert venue. He then met with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the summit started, with his focus turned to deepening co-operation between the world's two biggest emitters of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.
"As the two largest carbon emitters, we have both determined that it is our responsibility to take action," Obama said as he sat alongside Xi. The United Nations has hosted annual conferences to tackle the vexed global warming issue since 1995, but all previous efforts have foundered, primarily due to deep divisions between rich and poor nations. Many poor nations insist rich countries bear the most responsibility for tackling the problem because they have burnt the most fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution on their way to prosperity.
"Justice demands that, with what little carbon we can still safely burn, developing countries are allowed to grow," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in a column published in the Financial Times on Monday before the summit opened.
"The lifestyles of a few must not crowd out opportunities for the many still on the first steps of the development ladder."
But the United States and other developed nations insist more must be done by China, India and other emerging countries, which are voraciously burning coal -- the most carbon-emitting of the main fossil energies -- to power their fast-growing economies. - AFP

The country is returning to normalcy from the bankrupt situation prevailed prior to the Presidential Election, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala told in Parliament yesterday.
She made this observation joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the seventh allotted day.

Pension to incorporate Rs. 10,000 grant - Eran Wickramaratne
The allowance of Rs. 10,000 granted to public servants will be considered when their pension is computed, said Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne.
He said all issues created within 10 years cannot be solved by one budget.
He made these observations joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals in Parliament yesterday.
The government has not deprived the vehicle permit of entitled public servants. They are provided money instead of the permit, Wickramaratne said.
He said public servants sell their permit without the knowledge of the value of it. The government will provide them money instead of the permit due to this, he said. The Deputy Minister said a foundation will be laid within the next five years for a plan of 20 years by the government.
The government has brought about good governance and rule of justice. The budget has proposals to develop agriculture and protect the environment, Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said.
He said although fertilizer subsidy was provided by the previous government, farmers living standards have not improved.
"Our paddy cultivation is for behind that of Vietnam. The tea industry in far behind that of Kenya. The President and Prime Minister are taking measures to develop agriculture," he said.
"The government has proposals to protect low income earners. That is why prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and essential commodities were reduced."
He said the government thinks much about the youth. The budget allocated two fold money on education.
Public servants' income would not be taxed up to Rs. 200,000. Bank savings upto Rs. 30 million at an interest rate of 8 percent would not be taxed. The government is taking measures to grant land right to people. About 300 people in Moratuwa will get deeds, Wickramaratne said.
Projects started under Deyata Kirula progressing
Mass Media and Information Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said development projects commenced under the Deyata Kirula Development Project in the Matara district has not been stalled after January 2015.
The minister said funds had not been allocated for development projects of Veherahena Raja Maha Viharaya, Devinuwara Raja Maha Viharaya and Vevurukannala sacred area initiated by the previous government. He said only the commemorative plaques at the commencement of the projects had been set up at the three sites in 2012 at a cost of Rs 69,635 each. The minister made these observations in response to a question raised by opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma. The minister said the Vavurukannala sacred area project commenced under the Sacred Area Fund.
Govt misleads people through budget - Keheliya
The government misleads the people through the the budget, UPFA Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella told in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation while joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the seventh allotted day.
Rambukwella said from the budget, the government proposed to increase the tax collection by 24 percent compared to the 2015 statistics. It is also a 50 percent growth compared to 2014. Total tax value in 2014 was Rs.1050 billion. It is expected to increase the amount by Rs. 534 billion in 2016. He said the Rajapaksa government obtained loans to develop the country. Measures had been taken to reduce the debt burden.
But the present government obtains loans from local and international banks. Loans worth Rs. 453 billion have been taken by the government during this year, he said.
Rambukwella said there is a deformed political atmosphere in the country.
Budget has increased essential commodities' prices - Nihal Galappatti
The budget has increased the prices of essential commodities although government members say otherwise, said JVP Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti yesterday.
He said the prices of dhal and sprats at Sathosa are Rs. 130 and Rs. 380 but the budget has increased their prices to Rs. 169 and to Rs. 416.
He made these observations in Parliament joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the seventh allotted day. MP Galappatti said the budget has allocated only Rs. 3,000 million to reduce prices. But it is expected to collect more money than that amount by way of tax, he said.
The government is attempting to sell the resources of the country like the previous government, Galappatti said. Plans are being made to sell government institutions. The government will merge EPF and ETP and give its money to rich people by way of loans. The government can earn money if it intends to get back misused funds by the previous government, he said.
Rs 207,000 million had been spent to develop ports, airports and expressways. It is too much, Galappatti said.
More questions to be included in Order Paper
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday said that more questions by Parliamentarians for oral answers will be included in the Order Paper following discussions with the Speaker.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament when opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena raising a point of order said that only two questions are included in the Order Paper.
There are many questions raised by MPs but they are not included in the Order Paper, Gunawardena said. This is a deprivation of the rights of the MPs, he said.
The Deputy Speaker said his request was justifiable. He said there were only a few questions included in the Order Paper at the outset. The number of questions by MPs was increasing with the passage of time. He came to know that there was an issue in translating questions into other two languages, he said.
The Deputy Speaker said he would discuss the matter with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and solve the issue.
Minister Navin Dissanayake said the situation was a procedural error and not the suppression of rights of the Parliamentarians.
Govt should lead people to success - Harsha
The government should encourage people to achieve success in their lives through self-efficacy. Skills development of the people is the responsibility of the government. The main mechanism of the country's development is working people, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the seventh allotted day.
No body presented their own vision and controversial criticisms during the debate, the deputy minister said.
The UNP wanted to form a national government to make a long term social economic policy framework as was mentioned by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
The government has a clear vision. Sustainable development should be achieved by balancing social integrity and economic freedom of the country, he said. "We should maintain low inflation. We can reduce the inflation rate only through the financial management. The government needs to be updated on market information. There should be a mechanism to collect information," the deputy minister said
He said sustainable development of the country depends on the productivity of country's workforce. Not only state workers but also private sector employees contribute a lot to the development of the country, he said.

Prince Harry to honour Nelson Mandela's legacy
SOUTH AFRICA: Harry knows the country well from private and official visits and has personally been involved in shaping the programme that will also feature him learning about organisations helping vulnerable children.
Highlights of the trip include a visit to Kruger National Park, one of Africa's largest game reserves, where the prince will highlight anti-poaching efforts, while in Johannesburg he will meet Mandela's widow Graca Machel and visit a centre dedicated to the former world leader.
A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: "Prince Harry was keen to focus on a number of key themes where he has been actively working for some time, and where he feels he can make a difference. "First of all, he was keen to understand some of the issues facing the hardest to reach young people in South Africa today and the positive ways they are being supported to overcome this. "He also wanted to support his brother's work in drawing attention to the ongoing critical conservation crisis, and the efforts being made on the ground by the highly skilled rangers.
"In addition he asked to highlight the recent history of South Africa.
His visit will come shortly before the second anniversary of President Mandela's passing on December 5, 2013, and provides an opportunity once again to reflect on the legacy of this great man and how it is inspiring South Africa's younger generations to take the country forward." - AFP

To make way for Kelani Valley expansion
Railway squatters to get houses
About 1,600 unauthorised settlers will be given houses in railway lands to facilitate Kelani Valley railway line development, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister made this observation following an inspection tour along the Kelani Valley railway line on November 29.
The minister said the development of the Kelani Valley railway line is an urgent need but its development is hampered due to unauthorised settlements on either side of the rail track.
"Therefore as a solution to this problem we have decided to identify 1,600 families living on either side along the track and relocate them in 1,600 houses built on four different plots of railway land without resorting to forcible eviction of the unauthorised settlers," de Silva said. The Railway officials who accompanied the minister said plans have already been finalised for the relocation exercise. The minister said the 2016 Budget has allocated Rs. 1,500 million to develop the Kelani Valley Railway.
That allocation would be used to develop and raise the platforms of 11 main railway stations and 10 sub stations to suit the trains deployed along the line.
Since this work had to be accomplished without any delay the Railway Department should obtain private sector support for the job by calling tenders if it did not possess the facilities and human resources needed for the job. He also said emphasis should also be given to build a dual track by eradicating bends to facilitate greater speed.
He said at present trains on this track proceeded at a speed of 15 to 40 kmph and three hours to complete a 60 km journey from Colombo Fort to Avissawella. Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera and GMR Vijaya Amaratunga were also present.

Red Riding Hood: Lacks bite
Borrowing a plot from a well loved fairy tale and giving it a novel and dark twist was once a technique which almost became a trend in Hollywood movies. So it is no wonder that Catherine Hardwicke took Tim Burton's route. Burton tasted success via his smash hit 'Alice in Wonderland'. Thus Hardwicke decided to try her luck a second by bringing the 'Red Riding Hood' tale to life.
Dealing with her frowned-upon love for woodcutter Peter, Valerie also has to contend with a wolf stalking her medieval village home. As the tension rises and Gary Oldman arrives to whip up a literal witch-hunt around the village, the story gains speed. Friends turn on friends; family members begin to suspect each other.
Meantime Valerie comes face to face with the wolf and is shocked that she is able to communicate with it. This makes her suspicious of who the wolf is. Is it her true love or is it her creepy grandmother Soon she is branded as a witch, This turn of events leads to more misty and thrilling scenes in the snow deep in the woods.
Medieval landscape
Hardwicke should be commended for her effort in setting the story in a fantastical medieval landscape where traditions hold strong. A sharp and somber visual style is the film's strongest asset. Hardwicke makes hay of that iconic red cape and believably building a medieval-ish straw-and-wood village haunted every full moon by a vicious werewolf.
With her keen visual eye and flair for the dramatic, she's conjured up a compelling world for Amanda Seyfried's headstrong Valerie to inhabit.
Valerie and her family
Seyfried, with her enormous eyes and fairy-tale pale skin, fits into Valerie's role with ease. Unlike her performances in some of her previous films Seyfried is bewitching. In one instance she is innocent and timid while during the next scene she is impish, flirty and strong. Seyfried transits into these emotions without a hitch in a convincing manner.
Love triangle
One of the minus points in the movie is the love triangle between Valerie, Shiloh Fernandez's workman and Max Irons' wealthier, more 'suitable' Henry. Once the scenes unfold it is clear that there is not much of a competition for Valerie's affections.
David Johnson's script somehow wrings no tension or dramatic stakes out of the many life-or-death situations. Hardwicke offers so much misdirection about who the werewolf might be that it's impossible to play along with the mystery.
The guessing game of werewolf is more fun than the actual creature itself, which really should have stayed in the shadows after such a long, dramatic build-up. Brief flashes of the creature attacking are effective, but later extended shots show a purely pixel-powered lycanthrope.
The legacy of 'Twilight' is impossible to miss in 'Red Riding Hood'. You get the same old drama between a damsel and a supernatural creature.
Add the fairytale element with a touch of the vampire element in the 'Twilight' series and that pretty much sums up what 'Red Riding Hood' is all about.

Youthful rebound on the kiddy-go-round!
A child's world is often the envy of unimaginative adults, although I'm willing to wager my nappies that they won't be too quick to admit it. I, for one, have found kids a decidedly ingenious passport to places where my solitary presence would have been perceived as preposterous.
Believe me, in my quest to relax I have been driven into some very embarrassing indiscretions. But no matter: if asinine adventures are to bring a bit of zap into my uneventful life, I am stoically prepared to pay the price. Hopping aboard a transport of delight, such as a push-and-leap merry-go-round on your own would make one of my mature years look like a retarded anthropoid. I may even discover I am even as the character in the old doggerel: 'See the happy moron He doesn't give a damn. I wish I were a moron: My God, I think I am!'
But if having fun and giving into a chance to unwind seem to be my predestined condition, what the hell! I wouldn't really mind being classified a moron.
I once had the temerity to take along a three-year-old on a sight-seeing tour of Bangkok's red-light district. Stupid move Guess again, buddy. The advantages in such a ploy outweigh the loopholes by more than a boxful of G-strings. For one, hordes of skimpily clad bar girls left their doorways to tousle my little companion's hair and pat his cheeks.
So, nonchalantly, I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of my slacks while my young partner's cheeks glowed at the attention they were getting amid a host of equally glowing but noseless other cheeks revealed deliciously to my delight.
In Hong Kong, I used to saunter over sometimes to a children's amusement park with a couple of kids for company, or rather as the cover for me to indulge in my child-like fantasies.
For me, the park was charged with excitement. I love the myriad coloured lights that give cheer and enliven the place. Besides, there's no telling what might happen.
On one occasion, I noticed an obese male waddling along with a girl on either arm. I did all I could to keep my three-year-old female companion from calling him "Georgie Porgy". However, the girls obviously didn't spurn the guy, who seemed so engaged making so much whoopee that he fortunately didn't hear the taunt.
I had decided not to take her anywhere near the bumper cars. That is after a recent incident where a four-year-old maniac named Joy I had taken along had the other participant kids swerving out of his way. Some of them lost their nerve completely and hightailed it out of the circuit with our kamikaze brat hot on their heels.
But this time around it was not long before my little spitfire led me to the most addictive game of skill known to every man with a penchant for throwing, meaning the Tin Can Alley stall.
The objective of the game is to knock down the tower of stacked tin cans off the shelf with six tennis balls. The trick is to hit the bottom tins, ballasted with sand, that form the base of the pyramid.
I knocked all ten tins down like ninepins! It seemed all too easy and in the next round I did it with a ball to spare. The attendants closed the stall after my throwing arm had won two adorable cuddly toys for my companion!
Gallons of ice cream and soft drinks later, I find the family cherub involved in a vigorous argument with the attendant at the shooting gallery who maintains she is too small to handle a gun. "Shoot him!" she orders me in the strident tones of a Calamity Jane defending her honour. Despite my attempts to play peace broker she snaps at him, "Bugger off!"
A while later I am sitting in the ferris wheel and pretending to enjoy every moment of it, while all the time feeling like an astral idiot canned in a cosmic convertible.
Being spun around in dizzying circles is bad enough even for seasoned astronauts - that's what they are paid for anyway. But hung upside down every now and again, with a nipper's squeals of delight turning rapidly into screeching demands to "wee wee, calls for superior ingenuity.
I am grateful for small mercies. Inexorably, the wheel ground to a halt and I cajoled my charge to "hold on".
I duly thanked Heaven for little girls, and The Maker for their amazingly retentive bladders as we located the "Ladies" in the nick of time. I managed to convince the little fury that I simply could not go in with her as I helped her out of her extremely sophisticated 'undies.'
"Okay, but promise not to move," she ordered before leaving me holding on to her diminutive lace underwear. The wait seemed interminably long as I stood around those feminine preserves expecting every moment to be accused of being a voyeur.
I hurriedly pocketed the frilly unmentionable at the sight of an old lady who attends the same church as I do, approaching. "Waiting for your wife" she asked politely. I said she hadn't come, but old ladies being old ladies don't usually give you a chance to elaborate.
"It's terribly hot," she said. "So it is," I answered truthfully fishing for my handkerchief and ending up wiping my brow with the frilly lace panty. I have never seen a fossilized female move as fast as that old dame did.
Life can be so unfair, particularly with geriatric gadabouts and their trigger-happy judgemental dispositions. . Her withering and contemptuous look indicated that I had been tried and convicted in the whisper of an instant.
Home again with a sleeping child smiling seraphically in my arms, I am confronted by my wife who says: "See, you must have tired the little angel out. I can't imagine how she can wake up for church tomorrow."
I am willing to wager that Someone up there has a great sense of humour. I shall try forever to retain mine in this crazy world.
But you do understand, don't you, why I don't go to church any more
