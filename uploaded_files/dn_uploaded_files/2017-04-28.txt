MR shedding crocodile tears on behalf of working people
Galle district UNP MP Wijayapala Hettiarachchi said today that MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who brought in the Workers' Charter in 1994 did not implement it even after he got two-third majority and ruled for ten years.
He is now trying to hold the May Day rally for working class by shedding crocodile tears, the UNP MP alleged. The former President has no rights whatsoever to represent the working class and speak on behalf of them, he added.
Addressing the media at a briefing in Sirikotha, he said previous government had shot at and killed fisherman Anthony during a protest demanding fuel concession in Chilaw in 2012. It was our government that granted the biggest reduction in the fuel prices, he said.
Private sector worker Roshan Chanaka was killed during the protest a Free Trade Zone in Katunayake for demanding higher wages and pension scheme. But, when we came to power, we increased salaries of the public servants by Ra.10,000 and private sector workers salary by Rs.2,500.
Today, they are trying to coerce innocent working people to come to Galle Face green. They did not even think that we would even give them the Galle Face green for their May Day rally. Now, because they know that they cannot fill the Galle Face green, they are saying various things.
The UNP has always held Sri Lankas biggest May Day rally every May 1, he further said. We have already planned to hold an unprecedented May Day rally on Monday. We will show peoples power gathered around the UNP during the May Day rally on Monday. During the previous regime, we could not even express our views. Today that is no longer the case and everybodys rights have been protected, he further said.

Police can prosecute against liquor offences
Under Excise Ordinance a policeman too is an excise officer:
Galle Chief Magistrate A.Nishantha Peiris asserted that the Police are legally empowered to initiate legal proceedings before a Magistrates Court in connection with liquor related matters. The Magistrate made the affirmation yesterday, when he delivered an order regarding objections challenging the legal empowerment of the police to prosecute offenders of liquor related violations.
The defense lawyers raised the above objections. With regard to a number of cases reported from different Police stations within the Galle Police Division several persons were prosecuted by Galle Police at the Galle Magistrates Court for transporting arrack and beer without valid permits. In the prosecution the accused pleaded guilty and the Magistrate fined the offenders. Subsequently as the prosecution asked court to confiscate the nine vehicles used for the unlawful liquor transportation the defense lawyers who looked after the interests of the vehicle owners who were a third party to the case objected saying the police had no legal authority to initiate legal actions against the suspects in a liquor related case under the statute 52 (1) A of Excise Ordinance.

Removal of SLFP senior electoral organisers harms party
Removal of SLFP senior leaders like Janaka Bandara Tennakoon from electoral organiser posts has caused great harm to the party, former Galewela Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman M.P.R. Jayatilleke said.
He said Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon's resignation from his provincial minister post to condemn the removal of Janaka Bandara Tennakoon should be considered a great decision taken by a son on behalf of his father, .
Jayatilleke said people who voted for 'Swan' at the last presidential election detested the present government today. He said he would rally round these people and take them in 65 buses to participate in the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) May Day rally at the Galle Face Green.

Abans launches ultimate Selfie experience with LG K10
Taking solo or group selfies tends to be a highly cumbersome experience. This is because the process of taking a selfie usually involves spending time on finding the perfect camera angle, straining to activate the camera shutter, and then, wading through multiple blurry photos to select that perfect shot.
Abans recently launched LG K10, a part of the LG K Series lineup, was equipped with a wide angle selfie camera, I was highly intrigued and decided to check out this new smartphone.
Projecting itself as the epitome of cutting-edge design and innovation, the LG K10 focuses on reinventing how we capture special moments, while offering up incredibly high performance.
Redefining the Selfie Experience: Unlike other smartphones that simply facilitate our selfie experience, the LG K10 aims to redefine it with the unique 1200 Wide Angle Selfie Camera.
When testing out this camera, I noted how much easier it was to take a selfie shot. The wide angle allowed me to take a crisp, clear group shot that included both family and friends without using a selfie stick or cropping anyone out.
The Gesture Shot and Interval Shot was especially cool as it prevented the shaky, blurry shots that often occur while capturing selfies. So, all I had to do was just close my hand to start the 3-second timer, and it immediately took a clear, perfect selfie.
Fit, Finish and Display:The LG K10 imparts an overall premium feel with its curved elemental design that is sleeker and slimmer as compared to other smartphones in the market.
Therefore, in marked contrast to other smartphone brands, the LG K10 offers you exemplary features that provide exceptional selfie shots without compromising on performance.
Hence, does this smartphone raise the standard for capturing selfies in Sri Lanka The answer would be yes.
So, if you are yearning for a smartphone that lets you capture breath-taking selfie shots, the LG K10 is the perfect choice for you.

Around 2,000 kidney patients die annually Many patients from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa:
About 20,000 Sri Lankans are hospitalised annually due to kidney diseases. Around 2,000 of them die, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne expressed these views during a recent ceremony in Colombo.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the number of patients who suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) is around 38,000. Around 4,000 CKDU patients were reported from the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts during the past four years.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said research on CKDU commenced in 2008. A Presidential Task Force on the issue was set up in 2014.
Malnutrition and Anaemia are two common health issues among kidney patients. The lives of kidney patients can be uplifted through proper nutrition, he said.
Plans are being made to recruit 300 nutritionists to the Health Ministry. The country needs more nutritionists to look after the health of kidney patients and the food habits of the patients who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Dr. Senaratne said.

Australia funded AUS $ 15 m initiative to boost SL tourism
The Skills for Growth programme undertaken by Australia and the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry will identify skills gaps and provide training that contribute to Sri Lankas tourism sector, said Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson.
He was addressing the launch of the Australia Sri Lanka Alumni (ASLA) network in Colombo, hosted by the Australian High Commission on Wednesday.
The initiative is intended to delve into the tourism industry perspectives and identify as to where the skills gaps lie, and embark on a series of training activities to ensure that those gaps are filled. It aims to provide livelihood opportunities for people to contribute in the tourism sector, High Commissioner Hutchesson said.The programmes is a development partnership running for four years under Australian funds of AUS $ 15 million. It will have a geographic focus, mainly in the three districts of the Eastern Province and the North Central Province, the High Commissioner added.
He said the tourism value chain in Sri Lanka is underdeveloped. There is a lot of untapped potential particularly from the private sector. Small scale entrepreneurs have a significant role to play in this growth industry, he added.
Tourism Australia is a major part of Australias brand and appeal. Australia is working with Sri Lankas private sector and the government to provide consultancy on Sri Lankas tourism strategy and vision by drawing on Australias example.
Guest speaker Tourism Australia Deputy Chair Andrew Fairley said his first suggestion for a vibrate tourism sector is to ensure that there isnt fragmentation in the sector for the best possible outcome. He said coordination and communication is key among the various linked institutions and departments. Fairley added that the research component cannot be underestimated, and that safety and security is the number one priority of travelers.
Secretary to the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training and marine biologist, whale expert and NatGeo Young Explorer Dr Asha de Vos also spoke.
The newly launched Australia Sri Lanka Alumni (ASLA) network will expand the scope of Australia-Sri Lanka bilateral education relationship.
The network will bring together Sri Lankans who have studied in Australia, to stay connected with Australia and to network with the thousands of other alumni who are achieving much in Sri Lanka after returning.

Birds Jungle Paradise
Guidebook writer Juliet Coombe found Jetwing Kurulubedda an amazing retreat from the busy world of stress and noise. Here you can relax spend your evenings on bird watching walks or just watch the sun set or rise over the river before having a swim in the Kurulubedda pool overlooking the idyllic paddy field.
A handsome prince
If it is harvesting time the team encourage their guests to have a go as it is fun and so they can truly understand how challenging growing and harvesting rice really is. Whether one is sitting in the tree house fine dinning area or trying garden fresh kirayala fruits from the trees with a touch of lime one of Prabhaths delicious welcome drinks, or learning how to make a fishing line so you can have a go at this ancient river tradition one can do nothing more here than truly kick back and relax. If you are not a jungle Jane and do not believe kissing a frog will turn one of natures creatures into a handsome prince then this is probably not the hotel experience for you.
However if breath-taking properties immersed in nature is your thing then this is magic on a full moon night fanned by the paddy field, which produces the hotels delicious red rice. A place that delivers the true orchestra of nature with its colorful dragon fly flitting across the water lily pond, insect singing from the eaves, continual haunting bird song and monkeys calling for us to join in the fun of the jungle setting as they swing from tree to tree. The conductor of these amazing daily experiences is none other than Prabhath Head Butler of KB (Jetwing Kurulubedda), who is often mistaken as a general manager due to his incredible service levels and ability to day after day deliver unforgettable trips with his team that want people to return often to this very special place. In fact the day we stayed on the 7th they had reached number 7 in Galle on Trip Advisor , which is not easy when there are several hundred other places to stay in the area. I am sure by the time we next go it will be number one!
Realizing my passion for both adventure and knowledge he set up a boat safari with local eco expert of twenty years Krishan at 6am. This was to be an unforgettable eco river boat experience as not only did we see loads of birds at sunrise, which is when they are the most active but also learnt first hand about the true village life and culture of the area. This trip can be done again in the evening at 4pm with Krishan or his father or grandfather to enjoy the sunset and even a chance to see the local one-meter rare river crocodiles. In fact they have been working with the Lighthouse Hotel since it was built so service is everything to this river family that live with nature and therefore make wonderful teachers of it.
In addition to being the best guided river trip due to Krishan studying bird life in Colombo and growing up with his family along the banks of the river it was also the most memorable with all the amazing things he would do or explain. For example hearing it was my birthday he turned the national flower, the blue water lily into the most stunning necklace by cleverly snapping the stem in sections and making a loop around it the result was the best gift I have ever been given. They also showed me many secrets like the wild hibiscus, which is mountain yellow in the morning and by evening it has turned into a fiery red colour. I learn how the incredible iconic Sri Lankan masks are made from the Balsa wood trees in the area, due to being soft wood when cut it acts like clay so you can carve it and then dry it out in the sun before painting it with natural forest dyes the following day.
A Hobbit look
On the trip you can see ten different types of lizards and a chameleon that changed its colour as it moved through the undergrowth, and even a catfish living near the hotel in the evening if you are lucky. My favorite birds were the little black cormorants that followed the boat diving and catching small fish that wiggled in their mouths as they followed behind us enjoying how the swirl of the boat made catching fish all the more easy.
If you stay long enough Prabhath the wizard of Jetwing Kurulubedda will reveal many more fascinating secrets about his hometown Galle, with special trips to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Galle Fort, or organise more fun jungle river experiences like catching your own fish and cooking it. He loves the garden as much as his team who try to serve as many home grown things as possible. In fact keeping it natural is their motto, so that even the welcome drink is from the home garden trees. I had no idea that this area has 17 different varieties of mangroves and between serving you the most delicious meals either in the tree house or by the aquamarine pool Prabhath will be telling you other unforgettable stories.
Over the couple of days I stayed being indulged in my every whim and fancy I learn that there are sixty types of birds to be found here, hence the name of Jetwing Kurulubedda, which means birds jungle paradise, of which 20 are migrant birds, and best seen in January and February. Splashes of colour from purple lotus at the entrance and floating on the village style pond reminds one of a Monet painting it is so picture perfect and idyllic in this jungle setting. A short ten minute trip from the old city of Galle Fort and fifteen minute boat ride complimentary to Jetwing Lighthouse, where you can enjoy many facilities from Bridgette Jones style gym to get you looking your best and a SPA, where indulgence is their philosophy, which they more than live up to. For something more personal KB has an on site masseurs table which allows for relaxing room treatments.
Sitting under a Kaduru fruit tree used to make ornaments by the main pool enjoying sumptuous fish lunch in one of four special jungle options for fine dinning. Each spot is special ranging from your own personal lounge balcony platform in the trees for a tete a tete tea honeymoon couple dinner, where you can combine a three-course romantic meal with a spot of bird watching. For special occasions like anniversaries and birthdays you can enjoy dinner in the 2 metre teak tree house overlooking the river with hand made furniture made from the gnarled roots of old trees giving it a Hobbit look, lit by coconut shells and kerosene lamps, which you can access along the wooden teak planked pathway to the boat docking yard.
Most people choose the main dinning area set on a platoon made from natural fibres called Ilk. Besides the laughter of passing village children on their singer bikes, one or two boats on the Kepu river sounds are mostly buzz of insects or the song of the king fisher.
Mostly honeymoon couples enjoy two plunge pool villas as they are totally surrounded by jungle and much more private set away from the main quad of four villa suite rooms. The types of people that love this private location are the younger generation that love privacy and indulging in nature. Being artistic Prabhath will decorate your room for special occasions with flowers and even pull birthday cakes out of a hat despite no pre-warnings. So go on enjoy some jungle luxury and book a few nights through www.jetwinghotels.com and Prabhath and his amazing team will take care of the rest.

CB violated EPF Act to fulfill needs of previous govt
The Employment Provident Fund Act has been violated by the Central Bank to fulfill the fiscal needs of the previous government in 2008.
This was revealed at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, yesterday. It was also highlighted that the EPF has been wrongfully used by the Central Bank for the same need.
It was also suggested that the EPF Act may have contradicted the Monetary Law Act when fulfilling the government fiscal requirement. It was pointed out that according to the EPF Act, a government cannot use the EPF funds to fulfill its fiscal requirements. However, in 2008 and the following years, it was revealed at the Commission that the Central Bank has used the EPF to fulfill the same for which the EPFs Act gives no provisions for.
The legal counsel Harsha Fernando, representing Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri revealed these while producing to the Commission, a special report submitted by the Auditor General on the request of the Finance Minister which inspects into the Treasury Bond issuances taken place from 2008 to 2016.
The evidence was lead by legal counsel Harsha Fernando through the former CBSL Deputy Governor Dr. W. A. Wijewardena whose term of office fell until 2009. He was the then Deputy Governor who had the Public Debt Department and the EPF under his purview.
The special report of the Auditor General had not been produced until then to the Commission by the Attorney Generals panel to assist the Commission on its proceedings.
While questioning, Dr. Wijewardena, Fernando suggested that there have been instances where deep discounts have been given to insignificant amounts of money worth bonds. Fernando drew the attention of the Commission to the finding that the insignificance of the amount in one instance is Rs 6.6 million. Dr. Gunawardena said it may have been the government requirement for that day.
Why did a bond be issued for such an insignificant amount as Rs. 6.6 million, Fernando questioned. He suggested that Dr. Wijewardena has issued these bonds as a favour done to somebody than fulfilling the government requirements. Dr. Wijewardena denied the allegation.
Fernando also pointed out the same bonds were given discounts reaching up to 15 percent, 33 percent and more in over several instances.
Fernando also suggested that in these years, when issuing bonds using the direct placement methods, the same bonds have been given under different rates to primary dealer and captive sources, especially to the EPF.
Fernando also suggested that since the Public Debt Department does not have a proper guidance to rely on when deciding interest rates to issue direct placements, serious discrepancies may occur.
Expressing his client DG P. Samarasiris stance, Fernando suggested that for good governance on the part of the Public Debt Department and the CBSL, it is better to have an auction-based system which paves way to less complications and discrepancies such as the direct placement method.
Former DG Dr. Wijewardena refused to comment on the suggestions due to lack of access to information regarding the questioned matters. Dr. Wijewardena also stated that he did not abuse his power as the DG within his term of office as the Deputy Governor of the CBSL. He further said that he believes a hybrid system when issuing Treasury Bonds is more appropriate while emphasizing the importance of having direct placement method as a controlling mechanism to control the interest rates in the Treasury Bond market.

CCI unveils Construction Industry Trade, Business Directory
The Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI) having recognized the lacuna created due to the lack of a well compiled dedicated trade directory for the construction sector, commenced publishing this Construction Industry Trade and Business Directory in 2006.
The CCI was established in 2001, as the apex representative organization of all the stakeholders of the local construction industry. Now it is the Fifth publication of this directory and the earlier publications were released in 2006, 2008, 2013 and 2015 respectively. It is also a Technical Reference Document for Industry Professionals and will be invaluable for the potential Investors and multi-lateral and bi-lateral donor agencies. As the umbrella organization covering all the diverse Business Professional and Sectors within the Industry, the CCI considers it incumbent upon itself to promote the expansion of services offered by its Member Institutions and other Establishments.
As a service to the construction industry apart from this Trade Director, CCI is publishing a monthly construction bulletin along with the Daily News paper on the last Thursday of every month discussing the current issues in broad terms. By now this bulletin, which is the only regular publication concerning construction sector, has received wide acceptance and many are treating it as a reference document. This news bulletin is also uploaded onto the website of CCI http://www.ccisrilanka.org where it will be kept for a duration of 24 months.
The fifth publication of the directory, intended to be used during the years 2017 and 2018, is more comprehensive than earlier issues and comes with many new features. This latest Publication includes more than 300 business establishments engaged in the construction industry a considerable increase over the previous issue. The directory will be uploaded on to the dedicated website of http://www.cosntructiondirectory.lk/ and the web site of CI, ttp://www.ccisrilanka.org, as a web directory with an advanced search facility. With this new feature, apart from being the only trade directory specially targeting the construction sector, it will also be the only web based directory in Sri Lanka. Another, novel feature introduced is the facility to replace the presentation of advertisements on a monthly basis in the Web Directory. Also, the Web Directory is open to new advertisers to insert their advertisements. This web Directory will be available on-line until the release of next publication of the Trade Directory in January 2019. For easier location of the company officers, the Directory has included the QR codes of companies, who have such codes.
For the Ease of use by managers of construction work sites to locate reliable suppliers a mobile application is also introduced to enable the use of smart phones to browse the web directory.
The Directory will be issued free among all the contractors registered with Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) in grades CS1, CS2 and C1  C6, Government Ministries and institutions, Commercial Banks, Foreign Diplomatic Missions in Sri Lanka, our Diplomatic Missions abroad and Business Chambers Overseas.
This directory will be of immense use to all the stakeholders of the construction industry including consultants, constructors, statutory agencies, materials manufacturers and supplies, home builders and other professionals.

"China fear stalls India - Sri Lanka deal"
India is in no hurry to complete the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with Sri Lanka. Officially, India has said it would proceed at a pace comfortable for Colombo". But there are other, bigger reasons for India to guard its flanks while negotiating a second generation free-trade agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka.
China has evinced interest in an FTA with Sri Lanka as well. This has given India pause, as it wants to see the details of that deal. This could include, according to sources, Chinese companies setting up manufacturing bases in Hambantota and Monaragala areas of Sri Lanka and using the IndiaLanka FTA to push Chinese goods into India. We have to be careful," said a sources familiar with developments.
The ETCA has also run into trouble in Sri Lanka with some opposition building up against it. India's non-tariff barriers, bureaucratic delays etc have not endeared it to Lankan business.
Chinese companies are apparently being given 15,000 hectares in Hambantota, a fact former Foreign Minister G L Peiris told TOI in an interview, was nothing short of a bad deal. If the deal had been done the way former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had intended, Peiris said, Hambantota would have been a sustainable entity. There was no agreement to hand over 15,000 hectares to a Chinese company .The agreement as structured at the time did not involve the wholesale leasing of the port, but only a terminal of the port, Peiris said.
Answering questions on the huge debt that Rajapaksa left behind, Peiris said, Loans taken by this government is far in excess of what Rajapaksa had taken. There was something to show then. Today there is nothing. The government has admitted that the money to be paid by China for the port ($1.4 billion) is not to be used for retiring this debt. So the government argument of doing this (giving the land) to pay off the debt doesn't stand."
Instead, India will focus more on infrastructure development in Sri Lanka. New Delhi is working on projects in roads, railways, ports etc. In this, Japan may prove to be a valuable ally for both India and Sri Lanka. Japan will work with India on the Trincomalee port, while Singapore is expected to help develop Trincomalee city.
Peiris said the payment scheme as set out by the Sirisena government is unsustainable. In the proposed agreement, the Chinese company will not pay any money for the next 15 years. At the end of 15 years, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority will get money from the Chinese company only if a dividend is declared," he said. The Economic Times

Citizens' Mail
MAY DAY IS FOR WORKERS AND NOT FOR POLITICIANS
Arrangements are being made to celebrate MAY DAY on a very grand scale. These celebrations comprise festivities, colourful pageants and processions. Unfortunately, we have forgotten the true meaning of International Labour Day or the May Day. May Day is connected to the interests of workers. This we have forgotten.
The first May Day demonstration was in Chicago in 1886. 80, 000 workers went on strike. Police tried to disperse the participants of the rally. Violence erupted when a bomb was thrown by someone. Violence erupted. Eight workers were killed.
Demonstrations began all around the world to mark the Chicago incident. May first was accepted for an annual demonstration worldwide.
In Sri Lanka May Day has become politicized. It has become a political event. Politicians are using the MAY DAY to show their power and strength. The MAY DAY RALLY having the largest crowd is assumed to be the most popular political party.
May Day celebrations in Sri Lanka is not directly connected to the interests of the working class. May Day rallies are organised by political parties. These rallies are attended by party followers. Very few actual workers attend these rallies.
The workers in Sri Lanka do not know the meaning of MAY DAY celebrations. We have to think about the following when talking about MAY DAY:
May Day rallies should be arranged by workers and trade unions.
Doctors and nurses have trade unions. They also can arrange MAY DAY rallies.
Politicians are not workers. It is a joke for the politicians to organise MAY DAY rallies.
Alcohol is served in MAY DAY rallies to attract people.
Participants of MAY DAY rallies are given food and money by politicians.
Politicians are hiring buses to bring people to the rallies from out stations.
Mainly politicians are making speeches at MAY DAY rallies. Only very few workers are allowed to speak at MAY DAY rallies. Red is the accepted color for flags and decorations related to MAY DAY celebrations. But in Sri Lanka MAY DAY celebration colours are green, blue, etc.
Very little is done by media to educate the workers on the true meaning of MAY DAY.
When we read the MAY DAY messages of our leaders, they have very little things related to rights of workers. MAY DAY messages is full of national and political issues.
In Sri Lanka the salaries of workers are very low. They are provided very few benefits compared to executives. This has to be corrected. In many government offices, only the low grade officers have to sign the attendance register. This has to be corrected. Only the high grade officers are provided training in many places. This has to be corrected.
MEDICAL SCHEMES AND INSURANCE POLICIES are provided only in very few places.
Government can start a PENSION SCHEME covering all private sector employees. Labour Department should look into this.
POLITICIANS are paid a very high pension after five years of service. Some privileged employees are paid EPF, ETF and a very good pension. Some privileged employees and politicians are given tax free vehicle permits. Sometimes this is worth several millions of rupees. Public bus service is very poor. Workers pay for a seat and go as standing passengers. Government should look into this.
Some Senior Managers in Sri Lanka treat the workers like their domestic employees. They are very rude. They shout at employees in the presence of other employees. They insult the junior employees.
There is corruption among very senior executives. Workers suffer due to this.
In many private sector organisations, the owners do not allow workers to form trade unions. Workers rights are not given. Labour Department is well aware of this situation. They do not do anything to correct this situation.
If a worker tries to form a trade union, he is immediately sacked. There are firms of lawyers helping companies to prevent workers forming trade unions. This is not a secret. In private sector organisations, the inquiry and investigation procedure is one sided. Inquiries are done in a very unfair manner. Innocent workers are sacked very often. Labour Department should look into this.
Go to some of the factories and see. Workers are working under very unhygienic conditions. Safety equipment are not provided.
Rest rooms and proper toilet facilities are not provided. No wash rooms.
There are no welfare facilities. Some factories and working places are very dirty.
There are no rest rooms. There are no proper cupboards for workers to keep their clothes and valuables.
Some employers do not allow workers to use mobile phones. They are unable to contact their parents and husbands. Uniforms are not provided. There are no proper canteens.
Company owners are making millions and millions of profits. They go all over the world for vacations. But the workers are very poorly paid.
Salaries of workers are not paid in time. Salary details are not provided.
Many workers are not provided EPF, ETF and Gratuity. LABOR DEPARTMENT does not check.
There are so many unfair things happening related to rights of workers. We have mentioned here a few of them. Politicians should look into these problems of workers. Just organizing POLITICAL RALLIES on the MAY DAY is of no use.

Cop killer Matara Roshan shot dead in shootout with police
The wanted criminal and alleged cop killer Jayalath Kandambige Chaminda was shot dead in a shootout with the police yesterday morning.
Two police officers were injured in the shootout that took place in Meegahajura, Hambantota, police said.
They were admitted to Hambantota District Hospital, police said.
Police seized a 9mm Browning type pistol, a foreign made live hand grenade and six pistol bullets from the suspect after the shooting.
The suspect, J.K. Chaminda was an army deserter. He was attached to Army Special Forces. Chaminda had operated under several aliases - Matara Roshan and Bicycle Baby.
The suspect allegedly shot dead a senior inspector attached to the Maspotha Kurunegala Police Station on November 15, 2016. The victim was Senior Inspector (SI) Dissanayake, who was killed at a Kurunegala Police precinct, police said.
Pitabaddara Police had arrested the suspect on February 9, 2008 along with a revolver and a foreign made live hand grenade. Walasmulla Police had arrested him in connection with an armed robbery.
He was wanted by police in connection with a number of robberies, homicides and various other criminal acts, which he was believed to have committed with Dewamuni Rohana Harold De Silva alias Gona Kovile Roha, another deserter of the Army Special Forces, who was arrested by the police, said Police Media Unit.
The suspect, Dewamuni, was arrested in connection with the murder of Senior Inspector Dissanayake of Maspotha Kurunegala Police Station while Chaminda had got away after the crime, police said.
Police were able to establish where Chaminda was hiding as a result of a three-month long investigation carried out by police upon the instructions of Inspector General of Police (IGP), Pujitha Jayasundara, police said.
IGP Jayasundara had appointed a team from Anti Vice Squad of Walana Police and a Special Police team from Colombo to work on the case. They were searching the suspect using every clue they have found.

Corrective actions put economy into  stabilisation
Unfavourable weather conditions,sluggish globaleconomic recovery cause economy to grow at a slower rate
The Sri Lankan economy has showed early signs of stabilisation in 2016 in response to corrective actions adopted by the government and the Central Bank.
The Central Bank Economic Review released on Wednesday said unfavourable weather conditions and sluggish global economic recovery caused the economy to grow at a slower rate of 4.4 per cent in 2016 in real terms, in comparison to 4.8 per cent in the previous year, although a steady acceleration in quarterly growth was observed from the second quarter of the year amidst tightened fiscal and monetary policies.
Increased investment expenditure, especially in the construction sector, drove economic growth during the year, while consumption expenditure slowed in response to the policy environment in place.
The financial sector, in the meantime, continued to expand during the year whilst exhibiting resilience amidst challenging market conditions both globally and domestically.
Meanwhile, fiscal operations registered a notable improvement in both revenue and expenditure fronts, resulting in the containment of the overall budget deficit at the envisaged level of 5.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
In spite of these achievements, central government debt as a percentage of GDP increased, illustrating the narrowing fiscal manoeuvrability within the overall macroeconomic policy framework and highlighting the necessity of continued efforts to sustain the fiscal consolidation process.
In 2016, the Sri Lankan economy grew by 4.4 per cent in real terms, amidst numerous global and domestic challenges.1 Unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year adversely impacted economic activity, primarily in the Agriculture sector.
Services related activities, which constitute 56.5 per cent of real GDP, grew by 4.2 per cent in 2016, on a year-on-year basis, supported by the expansion in financial services, insurance, telecommunications, as well as transportation, and wholesale and retail trade.
Industry related activities, which account for 26.8 per cent of real GDP, recorded a notable growth of 6.7 per cent, year-on-year, driven by the subsectors of construction, and mining and quarrying.
National savings also improved in 2016 as a result of the expansion in net current transfers from the rest of the world while net primary income from the rest of the world declined. Consequently, national savings as a percentage of nominal GDP improved to 28.9 per cent in 2016 compared to 26.0 per cent in 2015.
Sri Lankas external sector performance remained subdued in 2016, with foreign exchange outflows exceeding the moderate inflows during the year.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas gross reserve asset position declined to US dollars 6.0 billion, as at end 2016, equivalent to 3.7 months of imports of goods and 3.1 months of imports of goods and services.
The decline in gross official reserves was primarily due to foreign currency debt service
payments, settlement of international foreign currency swap arrangements, repayments under the IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) facility and the supply of liquidity to the domestic foreign exchange market, particularly in the first half of the year.

C.W.W. Kannangara statue to be constructed at Presidential Secretariat
Great people such as late Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara would not have entered politics in future due to the destructive media culture practised by various social media in Sri Lanka today, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was doubtful if any other country used social media in a destructive way to sling mud and level baseless allegations against politicians like in Sri Lanka. He added that only those who could tolerate and resist such a political culture would join politics.
He made this comment yesterday at a press conference held at the Information Department on the construction of a statue of the 'Father of Free Education' late Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara at the Presidential Secretariat to mark his 70th death anniversary.
He said late C.W.W. Kannagara set up 54 Central Colleges in the country paving the way for the children of the ordinary people to climb up the social latter through free education.
"Today some politicians and groups make allegations that there is a threat to free education," Minister Amaraweera said. "But the truth is that there is no such threat to free education but the facilities given to free education is increasing gradually."
Minister Amaraweera thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for taking measures to set up a statue of the late C.W.W. Kannangara at the Presidential Secretariat and allocating Rs. 5 million for the purpose.
He said that this government's new mechanism to provide school uniforms has proved a success and saved a considerable amount of money.
He also said government's attention was drawn to introducing job oriented education. He added that due to the existing education, the graduates passing out of the universities are not suitable for some positions.
He also added that there are many opportunities in institutions such as the Meteorological Department, NARA etc with no qualified persons.
Asian Development Bank adviser M.C. Mathupala who was a past student of Central College also spoke.

Dinesh alleges Colombo Municipal Commissioner corrupt
The Colombo Municipal Commissioner has allegedly been involving in a fraud running to millions of rupees using garbage, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena charged in Parliament today.
The MP, joining in the adjournment debate on Meethotamulla disaster, accused that the rule by the Colombo Municipal Commissioner is highly corrupted.
He thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a special commission to investigate the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. Thirty two people had died and some more are still missing. The Colombo Municipal Commissioner should take the responsibility for this tragedy. Warning after warning had been given to stop dumping garbage at Meethotamulla, but it had been continuing repeatedly ignoring the warnings he stated.
The MP also criticized the Government for not holding the Local Government Elections, pointing out that the situation could have been managed better had the CMC and other LG bodies were functioning properly.
He pointed out the Commissioner alone could not handle the situation without the support of Council members.
MP Gunawardena also questioned the role played by the disaster management authorities during the Meethotamulla tragedy. Our disaster management arm is very slow to react. We need a disaster management flying squad that is alert round the clock and can be immediately deployed to any part of the country, he proposed.
The Colombo Municipal Commissioner said fears of a collapse had been there for over a week. Had the disaster management authorities been sleeping he questioned.
The MP also said the housing projects from which the victims in Meethotamulla were given houses were started during the previous Governments time. Had those not initiated the Government would have been utterly helpless he added.

Disciplining the unruly the Fonseka way
Cabinet caused a stir this week with the President allegedly suggesting that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka take on a bigger role in coordinating situations in times of emergency. The specifics of this new role however, have created much confusion as various parties have interpreted this to mean different things.
Cabinet Co-spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the weekly Cabinet briefing on Wednesday said this would be similar to the role of an overall commander of the tri-forces or that of an Army Commander. Since then however, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka speaking to BBC Sandeshaya has denied such a claim and said he was not asked to take on any role to head the security forces or asked to be an Army Commander. Field Marshal Fonseka explained that he was simply asked to head a centre which would coordinate with all government agencies including the security forces, to help deal with normalizing essential services during times of emergency.
I will not have anything to do with Defence. That is the responsibility of the President, he said and added,
What the President proposed was that I should head a new organization to counter attempts made by certain groups to destabilize the countrys progress and administration. This will support the existing institutions.
The Daily News in the meantime, also spoke to members of the other main political parties to find out what they thought of such a proposal:
(Chairman of the JHU, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana said the JHU had not taken a stance on the proposal as yet while TNA Leader and Leader of the Opposition, R. Sampanthan was not available for comment).
General Secretary of the UPFA-Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic resources, Mahinda Amaraweera
That was just a proposal. And that too, he was simply asked to help make a team to come up with a plan over what the government should do when there are strikes and such where key institutions are affected. No position was offered to him. It was not a Cabinet decision. For example, when we had the CPC strike, people were affected badly. Thus, he was asked to help the government deal with such a situation to restore essential services in the country.
He was not offered a role to head the tri-forces and not given any post to stop strikes. As a minister, he currently does not have much work, so this will be an ideal task for him and he will be reporting to Cabinet all plans and decisions. Also this is only to deal with essential services such as water supply, CEB, CPC, etc.
We currently have no system to decide on what to do in situations of emergencies and that is what Sarath Fonseka was asked to help with.
We are not trying to intimidate anyone. This matter will be clarified soon. There was no Cabinet paper or decision submitted or discussed.
Navin Dissanayake-UNP MP and Minister of Plantation industries
The President told him to take on a position but it was not as the Army Commander; that was not envisaged. It was a position where he can coordinate security situations and give updates to the Prime Minister and President on intelligence and also have better public relations campaigns with trade unions, etc.
It is a good proposal by the President and we know that he (Sarath Fonseka) is very capable of delivering results. It will enhance the current administrative structures of the government. There seems to be a lack of coordination and leadership among these institutions, especially when it comes to trade union action with political objectives that seek to break the machinery of the government. In a normal situation, where there is decency and decorum in the country, people dont try to break or undermine a government just for a political purpose; that is why we have elections. Here we see a clear political objective to disrupt civilian life of the people. For example, having strikes every day and disrupting community life and traffic. This will look at the overall good of the people. Even for emergencies such as Meethotamulla and natural disasters, it is good to have one central point and focus in leadership.
There is no question of militarization here. we object to that and no one wants a militarized state. We have freed the democratic space, the President and Prime Minister are not interested in that. The President is the Defence Minister, and he is not afraid of anyone. I would look at it more like a National Security Minister role, which is good overall.
Vijitha Herath -JVP MP
(The JVP supported the candidacy of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for President during the 2010 Presidential Election)
The problem is not with the individual, the principle of it is wrong. By appointing him as the overall Commander of the tri-forces and to give him power to control them; they are trying to control peoples protests and agitations. This is the failure of the government as they cannot solve the issues of the people. The garbage issue was not solved, so they go dump garbage everywhere and when people protest against that, they are attacked and tear gassed.
Now they are trying to sell our national assets such as the oil tanks, Hambantota port, etc. When people protest against those and get onto the streets, they want to establish a separate military unit to control that and appoint a military head to run it.
If discipline is the problem, the government should first discipline itself; when ministers themselves are not disciplined, how can they expect the people to do any better
This is simply a step towards militarization of the country and a military government. If the government simply addressed the issues of the people, people will not protest.
Convener of Trade union Alliance of the CPC-Janaka Rajakaruna
Why do we strike Why do we protest under the harsh sun It is not because we like to suffer such inconveniences. Instead of looking to answer the questions behind our strikes, they are trying to bring in the Field Marshall to solve the problems. It is the duty of the government to discuss problems but they are now trying to bulldoze the issues. This shows that the government has truly fallen and as a last resort is taking to violence to sort things out.
We are actually happy that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has been put in charge. He is known as a national hero and patriot and we too are trying to fight to save our national resources. I am sure he will find more things in common with us.
Also if the government thinks they can run essential services during a strike by using the army, they should also know that such measures cannot last long. We, as a trade union are ready to face any future scenario.
Lanka Viduli Sevaka Sangamaya, General Secretary-Ranjan Jayalal
This is clearly a measure to suppress and intimidate the workers' movement. We will fight it every step of the way. It is also disappointing that such measures are announced when we are about to celebrate May Day.
The government should be ashamed of this move. If the government is looking for discipline, they should know that there will be discipline when the workers are given their rights. When there are no rights, problems will automatically crop up and we will have no discipline. Our union has always fought for and won the rights of the workers within the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). At present we are fighting to rectify the salary anomalies. We are a strong union. This role for Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has only been discussed but despite that, the unions are getting together to discuss this latest development. We will form coalitions without any conditions to fight this.

## Title: Economy: Attitudes, Platitudes and Myths

Economy: Attitudes, Platitudes and Myths
It is no secret that Sri Lanka lacks coherent national policies in most socio-economic fields. In fact the present government was formed as a coalition or a consensus government to formulate among others national policies in education, culture, economy etc. The need for such policies and the disadvantage of their absence are felt in many spheres. For example, the SAITM issue has raised several fundamental issues pertaining to a national policy on education.
More significant is the lack of a policy on national economic development. There is no economic strategy and often contrary policies are followed by different ministries in the government. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for formulating a national economic development strategy. A lively public debate on economic issues is the need of the hour. However, there are several attitudes, platitudes and myths regarding various economic aspects that should be cleared or sorted out.
For example, there is no agreement on what type of economy that suits the country at this juncture. Of course, there is agreement among the ruling parties that the model to be followed is the neo-liberal one. That is despite the rhetoric against it in public. All governments since 1977 have tried to embrace this model. Whatever failures in that respect were due largely on account of public resistance. Exigencies of retaining or gaining power through the ballot, which necessitated the maintenance of a state sector in the economy was another factor.
Efficiency, matter of management
However, it is now acknowledged even by many bourgeois economists of repute that the neo-liberal model has failed. Symbolically our politicians have been marketing the Singapore model, which is patently neo-liberal as the goal of our economic development. What should be remembered is apart from the outdated nature of that model, no two countries could have identical paths of development be it neo-liberal or socialist or anything else. Unlike Singapore which is a maritime city state Sri Lanka has much more diverse economic activities and traditions, a different labour force etc.
The neo-liberal model is based on the self-regulating nature of the market and is also known as market fundamentalism. However, there are no pure self-regulating markets and they need government intervention or regulation to function at their optimum best.
Associated with it is also the theory that the state should shun business and should hand over all business and industrial activity to the private sector. While developing countries are prescribed as small government, developed countries continue to run or maintain large industrial or business enterprises and services. Even in the United States the state sector was strengthened at the height of the economic and monetary crisis of 2008.
Another fallacy propagated by the adherents of neo-liberalism is the relative efficiency of the private sector vis--vis the state sector. However, efficiency is a matter of management and is not an attribute of any particular sector. One could find efficient and inefficient ventures in all sectors. For example we have quite efficient state hospitals as compared with some private ones. The private omnibus services also provide an example of inefficiency and mismanagement. Nor is corruption a prerogative of the State sector alone. The collapse of some of the private financial agencies provides an example. Even globally the fall of Lehman Brothers is well-known.
In the context of a developing country a mixed economy is considered the best option. It means the co-existence of different sectors in the economy. Principally they are State, private and co-operative alongside certain others specific to particular countries. Contrary to widely held beliefs even socialist countries had and have mixed economies in their transition period. The ratio among various spheres is to be decided by the concrete situation at each particular period in each country.
There is also an aversion to national planning as seen from the low priority given to it for the last decade or so. Lack of national planning gives rise to anomalies among various sectors of the economy and hinders holistic development. In its opposition to the central planning conducted bureaucratically top-down some of our economists have thrown the baby also with the bath waters.
Export-oriented development strategy
In economics as well as in many other fields an objective analysis of the concrete situation taking to account all external and internal factors is mandatory. Hence, it would be obvious that Sri Lanka with its small internal market must have an export-oriented development strategy. Yet lack of sufficient savings and investments compels it to seek foreign investments. Complete opposition to foreign investments is a suicidal policy. This does not exclude the necessity to be selective in seeking foreign investment. What is necessary first of all are productive investments rather than those required for consumption expenses.
Finally, it must be stated that the ultimate success of any economic strategy would depend on how far it could raise the technological level of production and labor productivity in the country. Another factor that is almost neglected ad relegated to the background is the need for developing the cooperative sector in the economy. It is particularly important for improving the SME sector.
A land reform to empower the peasantry and scientific methods of cultivation suited to the nature of our agricultural lands is also an imperative need. We have to go beyond Vap magul ceremonies and crowning Govi Rajas.

EPF governing structure suspicious - Dr. W. A. Wijewardena
He further said the EPF has funds worth Rs. 1.5 Trillion and that there were many people eyeing the money.
This large fraud management demands daily meetings of the Investment Committee, he said.
All decisions regarding the EPF are made by the Investment Committee, he added.
Explaining the governance structure of the EPF, Dr. Wijewardena said responsibilities lie completely on the Monetary Board of the Central Bank.
He further said according to the EPF Act, it had no provisions to make losses.
He said it may have been so because the inflation rate was zero when the APF Act was prepared in 1958.
Dr. Wijewardena pointed out to the Commission that certain decisions taken in the secondary bond market seemed probe worthy.
He said, in his personal opinion, the Presidential Commission has a legitimate right to investigate into the operations and the management of the EPF as well.
Asked as to what he proposes as an appropriate modality to calculate the long term loss incurred by the questioned Treasury bond issuance in 2015, Dr. Wijewardena said if it was possible to get a financial expert in securities and dealing, the long term losses could be properly calculated.Dr. Wijewardena was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
Senior State Counsel Shaidaa Barrie was leading evidence for the day.
Meanwhile the relationship between former Governor Arjun Mahendran and his son-in-law as Chairman of Perpetual Treasuries Holdings Company is a serious conflict of interest, said Dr. W. A. Wijewardena yesterday at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
He said it was an inappropriate occurrence.
Had former Governor Mahendran disclosed his conflict of interest and disassociate himself from the activities regarding government securities, none of these scandals would have taken place, Dr. Wijewardena further said.
Questioned as to whether he knew about the former Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraals disclosure regarding the conflict of interest when it comes to his sisters position in the HDFC Bank and the Perpetual Treasuries Holdings, Dr. Wijewardena said he did not know if such a disclosure had taken place.
He further said that there had been instances where former Governors such as A.S. Jayawardena and Sunil Jayasinghe had disclosed their conflicts of interests and disassociated themselves from the related financial activities.
If such a disclosure or disassociation had not being done, any decision taken by the person in that matter could be interpreted by the market dealers to be partial, Dr. Wijewardena added.
Meanwhile, former Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena yesterday, demanded that the Monetary Law Act should be amended in order to make transparent selections to the Monetary Board and the position of the Governor.
Dr. Wijewardena expressed his dissatisfaction stating that the whole Treasury bond scandal started because of the lethargic attitude of the Monetary Board members.
He also said the damage done to the Central Bank by the Treasury bond issue, is irreparable.
Dr. Wijewardena also said during his term in office, he had to deal with the Monetary Board members who did not know the basic terms used in financial operations. We should not blame them.
They should have been provided with a technical staff to support them, he said.
Dr. Wijewardena also said the members who would be appointed to the Monetary Board needs to be versatile and be knowledgeable in the multiple sectors of the market.
He also said the Monetary Board members should have the stature to say No when the rest of the world says Yes, lest a need arises to fight corruption or bad decision making.

Fitch Ratings has assigned DSI Samson Group,a National LongTerm Rating of BBB+(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
DSGs rating reflects leading positions in the domestic rubber tyre and footwear markets, which are supported by its wellknown brand, and an unmatched distribution network of 313 retail and wholesale points and six franchisees.
DSGs market share also benefits from high tariffs on imports of tyres and footwear. These strengths are counterbalanced by increasing competition from imported footwear products and the weak local currency, which raises the costs of imported raw materials.
DSG is the market leader in the bicycle, motorcycle and three wheeler tyres industry in Sri Lanka, with a 45% export market exposure as of financial year end March 31,2016 (FY16). Furthermore, the company also holds the leading market position in the footwear segment despite competition from imported products.

Flowers in true colours
Sometimes, the most beautiful things are those you cant see with the naked eye. ake flowers, for instance. As beautiful as they are in normal lighting conditions, their true colors come out when you see them under ultraviolet light.
For the past three years, artist Craig Burrows has been shining a light on how flowers look under UV light, a style known as ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence photography. Burrows combs his neighborhood in the Los Angeles-area, looking for flowers and then puts them in a room that is as dark as he can possibly get. When he shines an ultraviolet light on the petals, these flowers will come to life.
Doing UVIVF photography is actually something that got me into gardening, since I wanted to grow certain flowers to photograph, Burrows told The Huffington Post by email.
Burrows said things like dust can have a major impedance on his photos, so he started growing his own. I have concerns that bought flowers would be more problematically covered in man-made glowing dust particles, he said.
Burrows is constantly surprised by his flower photographs: Some plants just arent as UV photogenic as others.
I recently photographed some bottlebrush, which I expected to be quite spectacular, Burrows said. Instead, the leaves glowed brightly and the flower part lacked brightness but had some very interesting color differentiation based on the anatomy.
The most consistently colorful flowers are sunflowers, or flowers closely related to them, Burrows has discovered. They have pollen which glows especially brightly, he said.

Fonseka appointment a blow to democracy: JVP
The proposal to set up a special force under Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka is an attempt to quell public protests and promote military rule, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was speaking at the adjournment debate in Parliament today. 
He questioned how President Maithripala Sirisena, who came to power on the pledge of abolishing the Executive Presidency and reviving democracy, could come up with such an idea.
The Government is going to set up a special force to suppress public protests and thereby to subvert the true issues of the people. When the people are lining up against the move to sell the countrys assets, the Government is trying to control the public protests. The Government is trying to cover up its inability by suppression. This is a dangerous situation. The President and the Cabinet should take the responsibility of this move. People are not ready to go back to a military rule. They do not want another Gotabhaya Rajapaksa he noted.
The fall of this Government would not be far, if the Government continues to suppress the peoples democratic rights, he added.

Fonseka not asked to suppress Trade Unions: Amaraweera
Support is sought from Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to formulate a mechanism on how to provide essential services without any interruption when trade unions go on strike without prior notice.Other than that it was not an attempt to suppress those unions, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He also said that several media institutions as well as trade unions had pointed out there was an attempt to suppress trade unions and trade union action.
He added that there has not been a cabinet paper presented before the Cabinet in this regard.
The Minister made this observation yesterday responding to a journalist who asked if Minister Fonseka was to be handed over the control of the trade unions, at a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium.
Minister Amaraweera said that the matter of trade union action staged without prior knowledge was discussed at length at the Cabinet and President Maithripala Sirisena inquired from Minister Fonseka if he would help to formulate a mechanism whereby essential services will be provided without interruption during such situations to which the latter agreed.
As a Minister Sarath Fonseka would share his expertise, Minister Amaraweera said Fonseka is a person of high calibre as he was the Commander that led the forces to defeat terrorism so that we have to make use of him. He will work as a minister and I assure you that there will be no suppression of trade unions and their trade union activities.
He said for example that if an engineer keeps away from duty, another will be directed to take his place . Sometimes it could be an engineer in the Forces, Minister Amaraweera said.

An environmental activist and an environmental organisation yesterday, filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court challenging the gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena in the capacity of Environment Minister over the garbage issue in the country.
The Environment Minister had issued a gazette notification bearing No.2015/53 dated April 20 under the Public Security Ordinance declaring that all services, work or labour or any description whatsoever necessary or required to be done in connection with any undertaking performed or maintained by any Local Authority or for and on behalf of any such Local Authority for the clearance, collection, transportation, temporary storage, processing, separation, treatment, disposal and sale of street refuse, house refuse or other similar matter.

Guidelines
With airline passenger, Dr David Dao, being dragged out of an aircraft and severely beaten up by the crew of United, an American airline, the World Fliers Association realizing that the safety of passengers is at stake has issued a set of guidelines that they hope will help see others do not get the same unfortunate treatment the poor doctor was subjected to.
Guideline One: While shopping in duty free, before entering the aircraft, pick up a small gift for the crew. Find out how many crew there are and include the captain and co-pilot too. Present the gifts as you enter. Do not smile as you give these gifts, as it is important you show yourself, a serious passenger.
Guideline Two: Do not carry any hand baggage onto the aircraft. Baggage of any kind irritates the crew, and immediately puts them in a bad mood, even before takeoff.
Guideline Three: When the food trolley goes by, politely decline to ask for anything, as that extra effort to serve you could cause them to get unnecessarily unnerved. Hunger pangs while flying, are still better than being thrown off a flying aircraft.
Guideline Three: Do not stare at the pretty airhostesses while they are explaining safety precautions, as they are highly tense at this juncture, instead on behalf of fellow passengers insist they do not need to go through it, and that you and all the passengers would rather die than put them through this unnecessary hassle.
Guideline Four: Do not use the aircraft bathrooms. It is not just about using the bathrooms, it is the inconvenience the poor crew face while you walk down the aisle, accidentally brushing past them, unnecessarily having them make eye contact with you, and then not giving them the opportunity of using same rest room, whenever they need a smoke, which could be any time in the flight. If you have to go, do so before the flight, otherwise use yoga or meditation to control bladder and bowels. Our next issue will give you some excellent exercises that you can practice doing at home, before any flight.
Guideline Five: Smile! Yes, your smile could be the key towards successfully reaching your destination: Smile when the aircraft goes through turbulence, smile if she drops hot tea on you while serving your neighbor, smile when they announce that non-vegetarian food is over, smile when the crew make jokes about your hair or size. That smile could just be your ticket to safety.
We ask each flier to study these guidelines, but we are also enclosing a detailed brochure with details of ships that have started plying to the same places you fly to.
These ocean liners may be slower, but you can rest assured you will not be manhandled, will reach your destination in one piece, and your peace of mind will be looked after, not just that of airline and crew..!

HelpAge Vesak cards for free cataract surgeries
The name of HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) comes to the minds of people, especially who send HelpAge Vesak Greeting cards to their loved ones during Vesak seasons.
Like in previous years, this year also HelpAge has printed 50,000 new designs of greeting cards to coincide with the forthcoming Vesak festival. The proceeds from card sales will be utilized to perform free cataract surgeries and free mobile medical and Eye camps for underprivileged Senior Citizens.
The greeting cards are adorned with 10 colourful graphic designs and depict the important events from the Buddhas Birth to Parinibbana.
HASLs Fundraising Manager, Ruchilalani Batuwantudawa said the cards are printed on Linen Board and are sold at very affordable prices. She said for large orders customers can have their official logo printed on cards free of charge.
HASL, Executive Director, Samantha Liyanawaduge said many underprivileged people in the country are not in a position to go for cataract surgeries in private hospitals due to unbearable cost. We therefore utilize the proceeds from the sales of cards to conduct free cataract surgeries for Elders at HelpAge Eye Care Hospital, no- 14, Sinsapa Road, Wellawatta, Colombo 6.
Cards are available at all leading book shops and Super Centres and at HASL Head office at no- 102. Pemananda Mawatha, Raththanapitiya , Boralesgamuwa.

I didnt think President was serious about offer to SF:SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake yesterday said that he did not think that President Maithripala Sirisena was serious when he asked Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka whether he was interested in accepting the position of Army Commander or Overall Commander.
Minister Dissanayake was addressing the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys weekly press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He was replying to a question raised by a journalist regarding the said conversation which Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratna said at Wednesdays weekly Cabinet briefing had taken place between President Maithripala Sirisena and Field Marshal Fonseka.
There is no need to have special units because such units do exist, the minister said, However, I like the fact that Sarath Fonseka has done a yeoman service to his country while in the service of Sri Lanka Army.
I dont think that it would be worthwhile to delve too deeply into this. I really did not feel that there was any agenda so as to be considered big behind all of this, stressed Dissanayake.
It came to my attention because Minister Rajitha Senaratna had spoken about it in length, he said.
I think it was discussed how discipline may be brought into effect through various means and the idea that some powers may be given to Field Marshal Fonseka came up along the way in line with the subject, he said.
Irrigation Minister Wijithamuni Soyza said that he did not know whether the President had said something to the effect in lighter vein or not, but he wished that it was so because the government has a responsibility by the masses to run the country smoothly without being affected by actions that disturb the peace. A government cannot allow strike action that affects the daily routine of the people.Protests and strikes should not hinder the free movement of the people, he pointed out.

Isipathana hot favourites against Zahira today
Singer A Div. inter-school league rugby resumes:
High riding Isipathana College will go out as the hot favourite against Zahira College Maradana when the second round of the Singer A Division inter-school league rugby tournament resumes at Havelock Park today at 4:30pm.
The Pathana lads under the leadership of Sumudu Rankothge have an immaculate record in this years ongoing league tournament where they lost only to the Peterites.
Patanas cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards spearheaded by cracking number eight Devin Gunaratne (younger brother of Sri Lanka national rugby player Omalka Gunaratne) along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of playmakers scrum half Harith Bandara and full back Chamod Fernando who have been scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves.
On the other hand Zahira possesses a good team with playmaker and fly half ex- Isipathana College player Shaid Sinhawansa (nephew of Hasan Sinhawansa of CH & FC, Kandy SC and Up Country Lions fame) turning out for Zahira against his old school along with winger Yuzran Lanthra who can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the nail biting defeat they had against a top team like Trinity College Kandy where they lost in the last quarter by (26-34) in a first round game. This will be a do or die battle for Zahira and if they lose to Isipathana it could be worse for them as they will slip further down in the rankings.
Wesley-Joes will be a close game
Wesley College will once again come under bit of pressure when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season St. Josephs College Maradana in their Singer 'A' Division inter-school league rugby tournament match at the CR & FC grounds in Longden Place today at 4.30pm.
Wesley kicked off this season with a thrashing from the formidable Trinity College (24-64) but went on to beat Prince of Wales College Moratuwa (28-10), S. Thomas Mount Lavinia (23-19), Science College Mount Lavinia (36-10) before edging out Zahira College Maradana (32-29) by a whisker in their last game of the first round.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal (22-28) and Isipathana (32-39) before beating Dharmaraja Kandy (44-10), St. Anthonys Kandy (24-11) arch rivals St. Peters Bambalapitiya (25-10) and D.S. Senanayake whom they thrashed 72-10 in their final outing of the first round.
Wesley will have to watch out for the opposition three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent St. Joseph from scoring through their famous three quarter moves. The two forward packs are evenly matched and a close tussle for supremacy can be expected among the forwards.

Sri Lanka had to content with silver and a bronze medal as the second leg of the Asian Grand Prix 2017 concluded in Jiaxing Sports Complex, East China yesterday.
Himasha Eshan who won the 100m silver at the first leg with a timing of 10.43 seconds took 10.47 seconds to win the silver yesterday in the second leg. Me Hong of China (10.40 secs) and Indonesias Boby Yaspi (10.50 secs) won the gold and bronze medals respectively.
Nimali Liyanarachchi won the 800m bronze medal with a timing of 2:07.51 minutes while Wang Chen of China (2:05.86 minutes) and Indias Tintu Luka (2:06.32 minutes) clinched the gold and silver medals respectively. Nimali recorded a better timing of 2:08.47 minutes at the first leg to finish fifth. The first leg bronze medalist Gayanthika Abeyratne (2:03.78 minutes) did not perform well and secured only fifth place, clocking 2:10.42 minutes.
Except for the Chinese athletes many others were affected by the freezing climate, especially the Sri Lankans as the temperature slumped to 11 degrees Celsius.
Himasha was glad that he could remain around the 10 second margin. I had to travel to China soon after returning to Sri Lanka from Jamaica, where I underwent training and was very tired. This climate too made it very difficult to perform well, but I am determined to win the gold in the third leg, Himasha said.
Nimali said that she entered the race with a fresh mind, forgetting the bad experience in the first leg where she won a bronze. Her personnel coach Sujith Nilantha said a much better performance is expected from her in the third leg.
The only Lankan gold medalist of the first leg, Indunil Herath had a dismal performance in the mens 800m and was placed fourth (1:50.99 minutes). Indunil said that his aim is to record a much better timing which would enable him qualify for the Asian Games.

Laws needed to tackle private sector graft - Bribery DG
Bribery Commission Director General Sarath Jayamanne emphasised the importance of expanding the scope of corruption probes even to the private sector.
He said there is no proper discussion in the public domain to make private sector responsible for bribery or corruption offences in Sri Lanka. He was speaking at an event organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held in Colombo recently.
According to Jayamanne, the United Nations Convention against corruption review team who paid a visit to Sri Lanka recently, noted that the team has revealed that Sri Lankas law is silent with regards to private sector corruption. The team has recommended that Sri Lanka needs to take immediate measures to tackle corruption offences with regards to the private sector as well.
In 1994, Sri Lanka introduced a new offence called corruption targeting the public sector; however private sector has been omitted in that offence.
There was no public outcry; there was no demand especially from the private sector, so there was need to amend the law. If the law needs to be amended, there must be some kind of deliberation that should come from the public domain in order to expand the scope of the corruption charges even to the private sector.
In the Bribery and Corruption Act, there is a secrecy clause, which says you cant divulge anything what the Bribery Commission is doing. If details are divulged, it would be considered as a criminal offence.
However, the moment the person is caught accepting the bribe, the person has to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours. Once the person is produced to the magistrate, the entire country comes to know about him. With regards to corruption, we cant arrest someone within 24 hours.
Commenting on the role of Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), Jayamanne noted that FCID is not vested with powers to conduct investigations into bribery and assets declaration and corruption charges.
However according to him there are other offences under the penal code such
as criminal misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust, cheating and forgery which can be investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as well as FCID. Noting that bribery commission is not in a position to prove bribery, corruption or not even asset management incidents as bribery commission doesnt have the power to conduct money laundering incidents, Jayamanne further said the FCID is however vested with powers to conduct money laundering investogations in Sri Lanka These monies are not kept in Sri Lanka and we dont have jurisdiction to enter and see the bank accounts of another country. To this end, Sri Lanka is required to enter into a mutual assistance program with the respective countries to discover money stashed in foreign accounts.
Jayamanne termed bribery as a primary offence while corruption as a wide offence.

## Title: Legal perspectives of the garbage concern
## Supertitle:

Legal perspectives of the garbage concern
One of the burning issues that Sri Lanka has encountered during the recent past is the disposal of garbage, particularly in urban areas such as Colombo and its suburbs. However, unfortunately until the collapse of the garbage mountain at Meethotamulla on the Sinhala and Hindu New Year Festival day in 2017 the authorities do not seem to have realized the need to prevent such a disaster. This unfortunate incident resulted in the death and injury of a large number of innocent people and the destruction of their properties. Unlike the tsunami and the landslips in the hill country which were mainly due to natural causes, man made mishaps like the Meethotamulla disaster could have been prevented if the authorities exercised more care and complied with the relevant laws and regulations.
When the authorities go astray there are laws and mechanisms in Sri Lanka to put them back on the right track. These legal measures are threefold, namely, abatement or removal of nuisances caused, compensation to victims and prevention of future misdeeds. The creators of these problems including the government, provincial councils and local government authorities should not look upon the legal measures as interferences with their authority and resist them as the true intention is to assist them in the exercise of their power. Since the victims may not have the expertise or the resources to obtain legal remedies effectively the Bar Association of Sri Lanka under the guidance of its President U. R. De Silva considers it their duty to do so not only on behalf of the present victims but also for the benefit of future unborn generations.
The doctrine of separation of powers is enshrined in the Constitution of Sri Lanka according to which the legislative power is normally exercised by Parliament while the executive power is exercised by the President. However, the sovereignty is in the people and therefore the legislature and the executive are bound to exercise their respective powers in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Constitution. Any contravention of the said procedures may be challenged by the people in Courts of law.
Hence the Judiciary has an important role in ensuring that the peoples sovereignty is exercised in accordance with the law. Every lawyer in his capacity as officer of court should assist courts in the administration of justice.
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka is the official professional association of all lawyers of this country.
For this reason the BASL has a collective responsibility in assisting the courts in general and in matters of national importance such as the garbage issue in particular.
The Laws in place for this purpose
Sri Lankans have inherited a long history and a rich culture with noble values for the protection of the environment. Though not incorporated verbatim into the current environmental laws and regulations which are of recent origin such values have undoubtedly influenced and shaped the said laws and regulations. We, Sri Lankans, can be proud of the fact that Judge C. G. Weeramantry, a world-renowned Sri Lankan Judge and Vice President of the Apex World court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has applied Sri Lankan noble values in the solution of important international issues relating to the protection of the environment. In a landmark judgement of the International Court of Justice in the Danube River Basin Case between Hungary and Slovakia Judge C. G. Weeramantry adopted the principle enunciated by Arahat Mahinda in his admonition to King Devanampiya Tissa:
O great king, the birds of the air and the beasts have as equal a right to live and move about in any part of the land as thou. The land belongs to the people and all living beings; thou art only the guardian of it.
This sermon effectively conveys the message that since the King is not the owner of the land but only its trustee his duty is to protect and preserve it for the benefit of all living being. This kind of noble principle can be seen as the rationale behind the current laws and regulations too governing the environmental protection.
However, unfortunately the lack of respect for the environmental laws and regulations on the part of selfish individuals and institutions including pubic institutions motivated by their self-centred attitudes contribute to all sorts of environmental pollution. Consequently the need of the hour is to strengthen the enforcement mechanisms. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka is the most suitable institution for this purpose as it possesses the necessary expertise in order to assist court in the implementation of laws that aim at striking a balance between the needs of the present generation and those of the future unborn generations.
Responsibility for the disposal of garbage
The main responsibility for the removal of garbage or refuse in their local areas is with the local government authorities, namely, Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. Section 131 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance provides for this obligation and there are corresponding provisions in section 120 of the Urban Councils Ordinance and section 95 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act.
It is important to note that the framers of these statutory provisions were wise enough to envisage that the improper handling of garbage or refuse as they call it can cause nuisance. Therefore they have made it obligatory for the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas to take all such measures and precautions as may be necessary to ensure that no such refuse... it disposed of in such a way as to cause a nuisance.
Nuisance may be private or public depending on the extent of its consequences. Private nuisance is a species of civil wrong which R. G. McKerron defines at page 227 of his work Law of Delict as any unreasonable user of land which injuriously affects the use or enjoyment of neighbouring land. Public nuisance on the other hand is a criminal offence which section 261 of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka defines as:
Any act or illegal omission which causes any common injury, danger or annoyance to the public or to the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity or which must necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right.
It appears that the Colombo Municipal Council has exercised its powers under section 131 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance to dump garbage at Meethotamulla without much regard to the mandatory requirement under the same statutory provision to take all such measures and precautions as may be necessary to ensure that no such refuse.... it disposed of in such a way as to cause a nuisance.
It is clear that the phrase all such measures and precautions in this provision implies inter alia the environmental clearance in term of section 23A of the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 as amended by Act No. 56 of 1988 and Act No. 53 of 2000. National Environmental Protection Regulations under the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 have been made by the Minister in charge of the Environment and Natural Resources. Under these regulations published in the Government Gazettes Extraordinary No. 1534/18 of February 01, 2008 and No. 1533/16 of January 25, 2008 no person shall discharge, deposit or emit waste into the environment... n circumstances which cause or are likely to cause pollution .... otherwise than under the authority of a license issued by the Central Environmental Authority.
This regulation is salutary for it endeavours to strike a balance between two competing interests, namely, the need to permit local government authorities to dispose of refuse or garbage and the more important need to ensure that the impact of such disposals of refuse on the environment is minimal.
It is clear that the authorities have failed to attach sufficient importance to the laws and regulations governing environmental protection which as a result have become redundant to a great extent.
Consequently, irreparable damage has been caused to all Sri Lankans in general due to the consequent air water pollution and to the residents of the relevant areas in particular. Pointing the finger of accusation at each other at this moment serves no purpose.

What is important is to provide immediate relief to the affected people and to make wise decisions with a view to preventing the occurrence of similar incidents in the future. For instance changing the sites of garbage dumps from Meethotamulla to Dompe or Ja-Ela or Muthurajawela is not a satisfactory solution although it might help to forget and delay the issue for some time. Furthermore it will be like robbing Peter to pay Paul which means taking from one merely to give to another or discharging one debt by incurring another.
Particularly, the decision to deposit garbage at Muthurajawela is contrary to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance concluded at Ramsar, Iran in 1971. This convention entered into force in Sri Lanka on the 15th of October 1990. Hence our country has an obligation to uphold the principles agreed upon by the parties to the said Convention. Muthurajawela is a wetland which is believed to have originated about 7000 years ago. It was declared as a sanctuary by the government in 1996 in recognition of its vast bio-diversity. Nevertheless this declaration will serve no purpose if garbage were allowed to be deposited as it will destroy the ecosystem that has taken 7000 years to form in a few years. Protection of the environment is essential for the sustainable development of a country. However, unfortunately in Sri Lanka the laws and regulations have not been enforced properly against individuals and corporate or unincorporated bodies that resort to any act in order to fulfil their selfish objectives even at the cost of the environmental pollution and destruction. It is important for us at this juncture to be mindful of the following statement made by Chief Seattle:
The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites one family. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. The earth is sacred and men and animals are but one part of it. Treat the earth with respect so that it lasts for centuries to come and is a place of wonder and beauty for our children.
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka and its Legal Aid and Public Interest Litigation Committee in particular, consider it their duty to empower people who have suffered at the hands of unscrupulous people by providing free legal aid to needy people and by public interest litigation.
The services that may be obtained include orders from Magistrates Courts to abate or remove nuisances, claims of damages in the District Courts for loss of life and property and injuries caused to the person, Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus to quash illegal decisions and compel public authorities to perform their public duties. Furthermore, awareness programmes have been planned for the purpose of enlightening the general public on their fundamental rights as well as fundamental obligations in the hope that they will ten seek legal remedies in the event of a breach of duty. These services will be provided free of charge by senior lawyers who have volunteered to serve the general public.
In order to ensure the continuation of these services in future it has been planned to train young lawyers and law students at the Association. For this just cause the BASL solicits the assistance and cooperation of all stakeholders including the affected parties, the general public, government and semi government institutions, and the print and electronic media. They are welcome to contact Dr. W. D. Rodrigo President's Counsel (Phone 0718433233) and Ravindranath Dabare, Attorney-at-Law (phone 0777307850) for further information and necessary legal advice and/or legal action.

Mindful matters
Hilton Colombo Residences announced their pledge towards supporting Hiltons initiative of Meeting with Purpose effective as of April 2017. Daily News visited the JAIC Hilton to be briefed on how meetings can be conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Tonight we would like to introduce you, to the launch of a new initiative which is actually a global initiative of Hilton. Two weeks ago Hilton formulated the first stages of a plan to give rise to six new Hilton Properties or Hilton brands. So we are going to have in the future more than two Hilton hotels in Sri Lanka. On top of that we would like to inform you Hilton is currently the fastest growing hospitality company in the world. Hilton has 14 brands and we have over 4900 Hilton hotels worldwide, represented in 107 countries. Last year we celebrated the 100th country, said General Manager, Karim Schadlou Schadlou also pointed out that Hilton has been in Sri Lanka for nearly 30 years.
I have been with the Hilton for many years, and I am proud to be here today to launch the new initiative, which is a global initiative. Today is the launch of the Meet with Purpose. The pillars of the Meet with Purpose is actually three components  Mindful Meeting, Mindful Eating and Mindful Being. They form the launch of the Meet with Purpose, said Schadlou
Assistant Manager, Public Relations, Minoli Senanayake said that this initiative spans across the globe. One of the three components is Mindful Eating. And this concept is based on sustainability and healthy lifestyles.
When you go for a meeting you see so many food products. But this concept focuses a lot on mindful and healthy eating, so that you are aware of what you eat. This is all based on healthy food items which are locally sourced. So while we focus on our delegates, we also focus on the local produce and the farming community who need our support, said Senanayake
At the press conference there were a collection of Tuna sourced from down south, Crabs from Negombo and even the cheese is sourced from our local dairy farms. We believe that with Mindful Eating, we are also looking at the delegate and the local communities around us, stated Senanayake.
Manager, Marketing, Thivanka Tennekoon, focused on Mindful Meeting, which is basically about the environment
We have to be Mindful about our environment, to sustain the environment and have less impact on the environment. We have made all our lightings LED. We have made the investment this year. This is a huge investment for us and has less impact on the environment. Secondly our air conditionings are inverter type. It has less impact to the environment. The bottles we have here are all glass bottles. They can be refilled. We have thrown away all our plastic water bottles, so we have all glass water bottles, said Tennekoon. Tennekoon also pointed out that the food items are all locally sourced. Minoli picked up from where she ended to inform us about Mindful Being.
We have covered the food and facilities and now we must speak about the delegates themselves. We know that meetings are super stressful. Especially if you are in an area from morning till evening, you are stressed out. And you feel you are drained of energy. So this component is primarily focusing on the health of the delegate. So we want to incorporate some fun into the package. So we have our in-house supervisor and in-house instructor Manjula Jagath, who with his team, will incorporate some fun. We might have some stretching, some yoga sessions, a three to five minute massage session for the shoulders just to ease out by a therapist, when you have your coffee breaks. We also have a soccer machine so people can break away from that stressful mode. We also have a mini golf area so you can have some fun, explained Senanayake. Senanayake also pointed out that it is a great ice breaker because meetings can be stiff and formal.
We feel that with these three components, the meetings can be more productive for the delegates, the organizers and even for us as a hotel, pointed out Senanayake.
Head of Conferences & Events, Charith Edirisinghe elaborated more on the packages.
We are very excited about this which we will launch soon. We know that all our corporate companies are forward thinking corporate companies who will be joining with us because everyone is now thinking about health and well- being. In this health conscious society, this is a great opportunity for us to help society, as well as corporate companies.
Package wise we are starting from Rs. 3000 plus taxes, it includes morning coffee break, lunch and evening coffee break, where we give them the option of selecting the items that they really like, explained Edirisinghe.

MR and Bandaranaike policies
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa laments that SLFPers in the Unity Government had ditched the policies of SWRD Bandaranaike and that it was only those in the Joint Opposition that follow the policies of the late leader and who were in fact are the true blue SLFPers. Speaking at an event in Matale he also says that the SLFP MPs in the government were controlled by Sirikotha. Both these remarks have been the refrain of Rajapaksa and members of the JO all along. For Rajapaksa, it appears that the Bandaranaike policies are the be all and end all of the SLFP and he is finding it difficult to adapt to the new social order. True, Bandaranaike policies may be still appeal to some, especially the old guard of the SLFP. But Rajapaksa must concede that even Chandrika, the daughter of SWRD, had misgivings about certain policies of the SLFP's founder.
It would be appropriate if Rajapaksa casts his mind back to 1994. On that occasion his leader was Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, daughter of SWRD whom he says the SLFPers in the present government had deserted. It would also be relevant to jog the memory of Rajapaksa as to the events that unfolded upon CBK taking over the reins of the country. Of the significant statements made by Chandrika at the time, one particular statement stood out. Said she: I had been a good socialist all along but now I will be a good capitalist.
And CBK walked the talk. She not only rolled back the Bandaranaike policies but even went one better than the UNP. CBK recalled the Shell Company which was shown the door by her mother. Not stopping at that, she embarked on a privatization programme with a vengeance that must have even made Ranil Wickremesinghe blush. Not only that, the new President leaned heavily on the experts and advisers of the UNP to get her economic programme going. She retained the Central Bank Governor A.S. Jayawardena even amidst the objections of some of her ministers.
Her iconoclastic actions even elicited a response by Dullas Alahapperuma in parliament that aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata haravwa (the government had signaled to the Left and taken the turn to the Right). One was given the impression that it was a continuation of the UNP government in all but name.
Not only that, Chandrika strove to shed the communal patina that the SLFP had acquired since the Bandaranaike days and set about mending fences with the minorities. She took the daring step of appointing a Tamil, known to have links with the LTTE, as Chairman of the state run Rupavahini Corporation, without a thought to the ire this would invoke among the hardcore SLFPers.
In her second term as President, CBK, in a magnanimous gesture, also apologized for the Sinhala Only policy of her late father that placed the country's youth population at a grave disadvantage and strove to make amends towards this end. So determined was CBK to effect a radical departure from her father's legacy she even attempted to craft a federal constitution, that however was shot down by parliament. Chandrika also took the extraordinary step of deciding to share Tsunami funds with the LTTE, the project however coming a cropper with the JVP threat to withdraw from the government.
While the policies and concepts of SWRD were being rolled back with a vengeance by CBK one cannot recall Mahinda Rajapaksa who was a Minister in her government making even a whimper of protest. Perhaps, being part and parcel of the government, he would not have wanted to rock the boat, unlike now, where he can take the liberties to criticize what he himself acquiesced to in a different avatar.
Be that as it may, the SLFP has come a long way since 1956 and Bandaranaike policies, needless to say, could not fit in to this day and age, especially with the advent of concepts such as global village. Besides, the ideological and policy differences between the UNP and the SLFP is now blurred, although some individuals like Dullas Alahapperuma still romanticizes on the SLFP of the past. Who would have imagined that the once arch foes would one day jointly govern the country
Chandrika, no doubt, deserves all the credit for transforming the SLFP and bringing it in tune with the modern times. It is a very thin line that now divides the UNP and the SLFP, which is increasingly getting blurred. This is a happy augury for the country which had regressed due to the vituperative and contentious politics of the two major parties, over the decades.
Mahinda Rajapaksa's lament of the SLFP ditching the policies of SWRD may have to do with the fact that it was his late father D.A. Rajapaksa who followed Bandaranaike like his shadow when the latter broke ranks with the UNP and crossed the floor of the House. But he should not allow sentimentality cloud his better judgement.

New CB rules may boost capital, mergers for small NBFIs - Fitch
New Central Bank regulations to increase minimum core capital levels for all licensed finance companies could spur small companies to improve their capital buffers and may reignite industry consolidation, Fitch Ratings said. Fitch believes the new directive is likely to address the need for higher capital buffers for the non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) sector as a whole to ensure financial system stability, given our expectation of a deterioration in asset quality and capitalisation in the sector following aggressive loan book growth in recent years and persistent weak operating conditions. The Central Bank directive in February 2017 requiring all licensed finance companies to increase their minimum core capital levels to Rs 2.5 billion by end-2020 in stages from the current Rs 400 million, with the first target of Rs 1 billion to be reached by January 1, 2018. Capitalisation for the NBFI sector remains relatively low, with the core capital ratio at around 11.7% at end-September 2016. This level of capitalisation is similar to that of the banking sector, but we feel insufficient, as NBFIs have higher risk appetite than banks.
At end-September 2016, finance companies reported six-month NPLs accounted for 5.4% of total advances, compared with the three-month ratio of 2.9% for the banking sector. Fitch estimates that the ratio could be much higher for the finance companies at a three months level.
The new rules follow a previous plan to bring about financial sector consolidation, which did not significantly reduce the number of finance companies. There were 58 NBFIs covered by the Master Plan for the Consolidation of the Financial Sector in 2014-2015, some of which merged with larger finance companies or were acquired by banks. The sector currently comprises 46 licensed finance companies, of which the 20 largest ones assets as of end September 2016.

NMRA to investigate cancer patient fleecing
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to conduct an investigation into a private company that charged Rs. 429,000 from a cancer patient for a drug which cost only Rs. 125,000, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the company had imported the drug from India for Rs. 125,000 and sold the drug to the patient for Rs. 429,000 by keeping a profit of Rs. 304,000.
The minister had ordered the NMRA to conduct an investigation into the incident through Food and Drug Inspectors and produce a report.
He had given the order based on a complaint received from a cancer patient, the sources said.
Arrangements will be made soon to reduce the prices of expensive cancer drugs and surgical items similarly to the price reduction in 48 essential and commonly used drugs by the Health Ministry recently, the sources said.

One actor, many roles
Gihan Adrian Camil Fernando the award winning acclaimed actor, playwright, comedian, and singer is acknowledged by those who are passionate about the theatre as a superlative and noble actor for his flamboyance. He portrays his characters so precisely and energetically gripping and embracing all audiences and leaves them spellbound.
Hailing from Wattala Gihan was educated at De Mazenod College, Kandana, where he had excelled in studies and shone as a soccer player. After leaving school he had been employed for a few years during which period he had studied about theatre under numerous foreign theatre directors through the British Council and other related places. Initially Gihan had got the opportunity to portray roles under a number of directors including the late Somalatha Subasinghe, K. B. Herath, Rajitha Dissanayake, Ravindra Ariyaratne and Dharmapriya Dias.
The Silver jubilee of his acting career in theatre, the medium of art which Gihan cherished most, was celebrated in a novel manner over a year ago presenting a theatre festival titled Ma Dakina Mama. The event was held at the Lionel Wendt Theatre Colombo culminating with a festival dinner. A stand up show in which he imitated European actors and met his fans too was held parallel to the celebrations. The stand up show consisted of many items including clips from Wattala Giha and Maharagama Kumar, the popular two man show.
Gihan had selected Ravindra Ariyaratnes Charitha Horu Aran, Rajitha Dissanayakes Sihina Horu Aran Ravindra Ariyaratnes Balloth Ekka Behe Priyankara Ratnayakes Ada Kale Antigone and Dharmasiri Diass Sadaya Maarai Salli Hamarai for the theatre festival. Gihan won the best actors award in 2015 for Sadaya Maarai Salli Hamarai.
These five dramas were selected from nearly 50 dramas in which Gihan had portrayed varied characters. His 50th drama is 361 which is now running to packed audiences. Gihan stars opposite Umayangana Wickremasinghe in the production. It is directed by Ubesiri Wickremaratne. A few of his other popular stage dramas are Nethuwama Bari Minihek , Silgath Billo, Ada Wage Dawasaka and Ahe Malaya.
Gihan and his colleague Kuamra Thirimadura have successfully compiled a joint venture Wattala Giha with Maharagama Kumara a dual entertaining concert which has been successfully shown to audiences in USA and European countries. This show would be staged soon for the Sri Lankan audience. Gihan and Kumara sing well for this show.
Due to his acting talents Gihan was invited to act on the mini screen for the teledrama Hiru Kumari directed by Nalan Mendis over two decades ago. It was his first teledrama. However Gihan does not consider television as a form of art. He had confessed that television is merely a business which cannot be classified as an art. He had lamented that acting is his profession and he cannot be choosy when invited to portray roles in teledramas. Gihan had portrayed several vivid roles in teledramas which have become a hit with the viewers.
He says that acting in theatre is a satisfying profession. He has no regrets about getting into theatre acting. He had portrayed the roles of other professionals including our politicians in various productions. These have given him immense satisfaction and had won the audiences applause.
Several reporters and fans have inquired about Gihans tummy. He had stated that it is a natural tummy and if any director needs him to act with a reduced tummy he could oblige within a few months but for a good fee.

## Title: Paddy predicament
## Supertitle:

Paddy predicament
Paddy is the dominant crop cultivated in land coming under the irrigation systems in Sri Lanka. Although profit obtained from paddy farming is relatively low compared to the cultivation of other field crops (OFC), farmers preferred to continue paddy farming for various reasons, such as household food security, lower labour requirement, unsuitable soil condition to cultivate OFC and lower investment requirement. However, farmer should earn sufficient income to contribute to O&M expenses of turn over irrigation systems under the PIM policy.
If the government fertilizer subsidy is withdrawn, the estimated income of farmers per month would be lower than the current estimated level. Farmer families in most of the schemes receive substantial income from upland cultivation, labouring off farm income, self employment and other sources of income from the rest of the household members.
Therefore farmer dependents on paddy farming for their livelihood or other irrigated agriculture need to be increased to make them more committed towards sustainable O&M. Research identifies more constraints in crop diversification as unreliable and inequitable supply of water, lack of organisation or communication between farmers and poor scheduling of water.
Although FOs show relatively higher strength in the irrigation schemes, there are some emerging issues given below which might curtail the FOs strength in the future unless corrective measures are taken (a) low levels financial strength of FOs and high dependence of external resources (b) inadequate financial transparency between FO committee members and general farmers (c) lack of sufficient immediate benefit for most of the farmers other than the status they get in the society, relationship built with government official and training (d) poor communication network may harm the timely passing of information on FO activities and (e) lack of awareness on legal recogniztion given to FOs under Agrarian Development Act.
The major findings of the research study by HARTI reveal that (a) strength of FOs is highest under Bulk Water Allocation (BWA) programme in Mahaweli  H followed by Integrated Management of Agricultural systems (INMAS) schemes. FOs in the Management of Irrigation Schemes (MANIS) shows lower strength. (b) agency support for institutional strengthening is lowest in MANIS schemes mainly due to lack of physical and human resources available in the line agency. (c) impact of PIM on physical condition of infrastructure is ambiguous. (d) PIM policy does not adequately cover O&M part of the irrigation system that is operated by the State. Allocation for O&M by the government is inadequate to perform sufficient maintenance. Unless this situation is reversed and the policy gap is addressed, many systems may call for extensive rehabilitation within a short period of time. (e) In sufficient allocation of resources from the central government has become a disincentive for farmers to do a good maintenance job for the turn over parts of irrigation schemes as proper maintenance of main system also determine the reliable and efficient water delivery in secondary and tertiary canals. (f) PMC lacks power and authority. Therefore the decisions taken at the PMC are some times neglected by the line agencies, participation at the PMC meeting from line agencies is also voluntary and the officers are accountable to the heads of their respective departments but not the PMCs.
One important policy implication of research studies on this subject is the possibility of restructuring existing irrigation pricing system by taking into account the economic value of irrigation water. Such policy reform can encourage farmers to use irrigation resources efficiently by motivating improvement in water management practices and generating revenue for operation, maintenance and capital replacement and irrigation sustainability in the country.
Recommendations
It is very essential to further proceed with the PIM as an aspect of irrigation policy, after correcting the defects in the implementation of the PIM. Because the issues have arisen with regard to its implementation and not solely on the PIM policy itself. Having reviewed various research studies on this subject, the following recommendations are made for the improvement of the PIM.
01. Provision of adequate awareness to farmers and FOs on the transfer agreement, and their roles and responsibilities by the PIM policy.
02. Provision of adequate awareness to relevant line agency officers about their role and responsibilities under the PIM and to accept PIM as their duty.
03. Recognition and service priority should be granted to Farmer Organization (FO) leaders when they deal FO affairs with line agencies and other public departments.
04. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems prior to transfer.
05. Provision of guidance by the government to formulate rules and regulations to establish financial accountability, transparency and training, monitoring and auditing.
06. Provision of an honorarium to FO bearers, specially Jalapalaka for their services to increase their efficiency and to minimize abuse of FO fund.
07. Maintaining a separate O&M fund by FO from the resources collected from farmer contribution.
08. To increase cropping intensity through more efficient water management together with improvements in cropping systems.
09. As irrigation investment in Sri Lanka has not being playing a rationale role on resource optimization, one way to achieve an efficient allocation of water is to price its consumption correctly and reform water management policies to content it. Correct measurement of policy reform can encourage farmers to use irrigation resources efficiently by motivating, improving water management priorities and generating revenue for operation, maintenance and capital replacement.
10. In order to foster co-operation among settlers to ensure water sharing and involvement in maintenance activities, settlers should be chosen from homogeneous backgrounds, with irrigated agricultural experience. They should be selected in concentrated communities and should not be located at too great distance from their irrigated lands. Also they should be settled as early as possible into the project to avoid encroachment and ensure rapid development of homesteads and irrigated allotments. Finally, they should be settled in groups on the basis of a turnout area to facilitate water distribution. In older major settlement schemes where persistent irrigation problems exist, it is necessary to make efforts to rehabilitate physical resources and to re-plan social and institutional environment.

Pan Asia Bank posts Rs.350 mn profit in Q1
Pan Asia Banking Corporation has reported an after tax profit of Rs. 353.4 million for its January - March quarter (1Q17) recording an increase of 16 percent from the same period last year.
The performance was largely supported by the significant increase in the fee and commission income, slightly lower tax liability and the closer tab kept on the costs. However, the core-banking performance became subdued in response to the tighter credit conditions remained throughout the period.
The banks earnings per share was Rs.3.41 by the end of the 1Q17, slightly less than Rs.3.91 reported in same period of 2016 due to the increase in banks equity resulted by the Rs 2 billion rights issue in March 2017 which was promptly oversubscribed.
The banks newly appointed Director and Chief Executive Officer, Nimal Tillekeratne said this performance was a true reflection of the banks and ability to report consistently higher financial performance even amid challenging conditions. I am happy to announce our financial performance for the first quarter because the bank operated under less than favourable conditions such as rising interest rates, slowdown in demand for new loans and risk of new addition to non-performing loans.Meanwhile the income tax expense for the period came down by 12% to little under Rs.160 million for the quarter from a year ago as a result of effective tax management.
The bank was able to maintain its Return on Equity (RoE) at 18.95% which is among the highest in the industry, albeit slightly down from 19.97% reported three months ago.
Now that we have proved that we could deliver even under trying conditions, I am very much confident that Pan Asia Bank could continue to deliver exceptional performance exceeding the stakeholder expectations, Tillekeratne said in the earnings release.
Commenting further on the recent issue of rights, he confided that the bank could meet the minimum core-capital requirement of Rs.10 billion by the end of 2017 with the strong earnings forecasted for the remainder of the year.
By the end of March 31, 2017, the bank had a core capital base of Rs.8.7 billion and a total capital base of Rs.10.5 billion.
Speaking on the future direction of the bank he said, We have developed our new three year strategy with a clear focus on serving the diverse financial needs of Sri Lankas growing middle income class and also to uplift the Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises segment that are considered as the life blood of the Sri Lankas economy.

Peace talks should be held with weapons manufacturers rather than warring parties: President
Discussions on peace making should be held with the people who manufacture weapons but on the contrary, it has always been between the parties involved in the conflict, observed President Maithripala Sirisena.
I believe that for lasting peace and harmony in the world, rather than having discussions with the parties involved in the conflict, the attention should be given to the weapon manufacturers,he said.
The President was addressing the inauguration ceremony of an international conference titled Islamic Reality and Contemporary Challenges organised by the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre in collaboration with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs Dawah and guidance of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
President Sirisena said there would not have been much of a conflict in the world if the people who manufacture weapons focus on an alternative mechanism to earn profits.
Peace can be prolonged and strengthened if every state leader bans weapons and stop manufacturing them in their own countries, the President said.
He further said that the topic of the conference was relevant to the prevailing situation in the world.
There are a plethora of challenges among human beings for survival such as cultural, administration, religion, education and language. All religions expect their followers to move forward as good persons with esteemed character. All the religions and religious leaders preach peace and harmony among the people,President Sirisena said.
The President further said that people today fight for power and wealth. As a result, conflicts and issues erupt between them. The world always focuses on who did it rather than looking for ways how the conflict was initiated.
President Sirisena also noted that we need to build a society where every person would respect each other and spread peace and harmony not violence and extremism.

Pelwatte Butter made from  fat in fresh milk
Although there are numerous amounts of dairy companies that produce butter in the country, the healthiest choice would be to opt for a product that is made from fresh milk instead of milk powder without any additives included.
Pelwatte Dairy is a leading home-grown dairy company that produces many different dairy products such as milk powder, yoghurt, butter and many more. The brand is widely known for the natural approach taken in the production of their products.
Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one of them being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5 % fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage so in order to control the fat percentage a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.
Pelwatte produces both salted and unsalted butter varieties, and is sold in both home-sized and bulk packs. Pelwatte Butter is the cheapest high quality locally produced butter in the local market.

PMs contribution towards strengthening Indo-Lanka ties praised
Indo-Sri Lanka relations have been restrengthened and extended to a deeper fathom during the last two years and the contribution made towards this by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is highly appreciated, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh said when he met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation in New Delhi on April 27.
Rajnath Singh said that even though historic, cultural, communal and civilization relations between the two countries dated back to thousands of years, there had been instances when such relations had been strained. But during the last two years, these relations had been raised to new heights.
He said this relationship should be utilised to the maximum to enhance security, law and order and peace in the region.
The need for closer action and co-operation between the intelligence units of the two countries to combat regional and global terrorism, narcotic drugs transport, human smuggling and money laundering was also emphasised during this meeting, stated a press release from the Prime Ministers office yesterday. Both parties also agreed on the need for a constant dialogue between the intelligence outfits of the two countries. Views were also exchanged on the possibility of utilising Indian experience in Sri Lankas efforts to modernise its police service.
Secretary in charge of international security in the Indian Home Ministry Dr. Rina Mitra Director, Intelligence wing Rajiv Jain, Joint Secretary, International Co-operation Saheli Ghosh, Joint Secretary Incharge of Expatriates Mukesh Mittal, Fisheries Joint Secretary, Adithya Joshi and Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu represented the Indian delegation at the talks.

PM MEETS SWARAJ: Indo-Lanka MOU to bring mutual benefits to both countries: Sushma
The Memorandum of Understanding signed between Sri Lanka and India is an initial document aimed at bringing equal mutual benefits to people of both countries based on mutual friendship, cordiality and brotherhood of both countries, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said.
It can be used to reach an agreement on the development of various sectors and thereby accelerate development activities through it, she said.
Swaraj said this during talks she had with visiting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in New Delhi on April 26.
Since close relations and friendship existed between India and Japan and Sri Lanka and Japan, there were plenty of opportunities for India, Japan and Sri Lanka to join hands in carrying out development activities in Sri Lanka, Swaraj said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out the need to strengthen relations between the two countries at various levels in taking such relations forward to the future.
These relations could be strengthened in the state, private enterprise, investment as well as education, culture, technology and social levels. Talks also centred on the Indo-Sri Lanka fisheries problems. Swaraj said the Union Government in league with State Governments had started a joint programme to prevent Indian Fishermen straying into Sri Lankan waters. Accordingly, those fishermen would be diverted towards deep sea fishing within the next three years and the training of the first batch of Indian fishermen in this regard had already begun, she said.
She said the registration of the controversial bottom trawling vessels was being systematically scaled down.
The Indian Foreign Minister who appreciated Sri Lankas concerns about peace and free navigation in the Indian Ocean region, said arrangements had been made to conduct the Indian Ocean Conference organized by the Indian Foundation in Sri Lanka recently.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the chairman of this conference while Mrs Swaraj will be the co-chairman.

Completing 90 percent of the tasks set through the rally, Podi Team pulled to the top of the pack, and from the final checkpoint at the Ambewela New Zealand Farm to NuwaraEliya saw them pick up pace as they saw their end line.
Podi Team emerged as the winner. Team Eksath Threerodha Ratha Sangamaya came bagged teh second place whilst Team Ambalangoda was relegated to 3rd place. Last but not least, Team Pink Lions from Maharagama was awarded the prize of being the most creative tuk-tuk.

The progress review meeting at the Eastern Province Governors Secretariat.
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) yesterday called upon the government to fulfill its obligations on the recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism (CTFRM), the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and other commissions appointed by the government on the issues stipulated below without delay.
The NCCSL in a statement expressed its serious concerns on the slow pace and non implementation of the required and agreed measures and steps in its efforts that the government needs to take for National Reconciliation and Harmony in the nation.
The statement:
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) wishes to express its serious concerns on the slow pace and non-implementation of the required and agreed measures and steps in its efforts that the government needs to take for National Reconciliation and Harmony in our nation.
In this regard, we call upon the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to fulfill its obligations on the recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism (CTFRM), The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and other Commissions appointed by the Government, on the issues stipulated below without further delay.
Whilst welcoming the initial progress in returning lands to rightful owners, a much greater extent of land and property belonging to the people in the North continues to be occupied by the military.
However, notwithstanding the security concerns of the State, it is equally important and elementarily just, that land and property belonging to the people are returned to them for their own use for all purposes of rightful living. Following the conclusion of the war in 2008 and 2009, the affected families whose members have disappeared are yet to be notified of the status of these missing persons, even after having made repeated representations to commissions, committees and authorities appointed by the government. This long delay is causing untold trauma and mental agony to the families of the missing.
In keeping with the standards and practices of good governance, we call on the authorities to initiate urgent action to begin the legal process where indictments are to be filed and for immediate release of those against whom no charges whatsoever are framed.
We urge the government to be transparent in the constitutional reform process that it committed itself to during the elections, not to drag its feet on this issue and to work towards a genuine power sharing arrangement and thus win the trust and confidence of the people and contribute toward the building of a one Sri Lankan nation and present a people-oriented constitutional reforms bill to Parliament for discussion soon and for immediate thereafter to begin the process of adopting the new constitution and its implementing power sharing.

## Title: Ransomware risks and what you can do about it

Ransomware risks and what you can do about it
The new wave of malware is holding individuals and institutions to ransom, forcing them to pay up to access their own systems.
Today, life without a phone or a computer is hard to imagine. We are connected on every front and depend on internet connected devices for work and in our personal lives. We sign in to at least one online service or application every day, knowing little about the digital footprint we leave or what information we share whenever we post a picture, check in to a venue or send an email.
This seamless integration between man and technology has made us immune to possible vulnerabilities. In the late 90s and the early part of the 2000s, computer viruses were a huge threat. Email scams took center stage for a while with many unsuspecting computer users falling prey.
Computer hacking has been a threat from the early days of the internet, and in 2016 the world was rocked when the Bangladesh Central Bank was compromised in one of the most public cybercrimes in our region in the time since the computer was invented.
Ransomware is a type of malware-or computer infection-used for data kidnapping; an exploit in which a ransomware criminal encrypts a victim's data until payment for decryption is received.
And users at home and in the workplace are under threat from brutal ransomware attacks. Loss of access to critical files, followed by a demand for payment can cause massive disruption to a user's or even an entire organization's productivity. But what does a typical attack look like And what security solutions should be in place to give the best possible defense
According to Osterman Research, from June 2015 to June 2016 , e-mails with malicious links and attachments represented 59 percent of ransomware infections.To put it differently, potential victims are more than twice as likely to be infected by clicking something in an email than visiting a website soaked with malware-laden advertisements.
In a June 2016 survey from Osterman Research, one out of every two participants indicated that their organization had suffered at least one ransomware attack in the past 12 months. Moreover, just four percent of respondents from organizations-from a technologically-developed country like the United States-said they were very confident in their current security's ability to prevent a future attack.
With criminals flocking to ransomware as a source of cheap and easy income, ransomware authors have scrambled to meet the demand. According to Trend Micro, 50 new ransomware families were discovered in the first five months of 2016. That's easily on pace to surpass the 100 new ransomware families that Symantec2 said were discovered in 2015.
Ransomware behaviour and contingency plans
Once ransomware is executed in a system, it can either lock the computer screen, or, in the case of crypto-ransomware, encrypt important files.
For such reasons, ransomware is a great example of why backups are essential. After all, if an individual's files are only stored in one computer system, ransomware that infects that computer could encrypt them all and restrict access-or even delete them entirely.
Personal and commercial users are encouraged to regularly backup their files to an external hard drive or a remote file storage server. For users running Microsoft's licensed Windows platform, an automated backup solution called System Restore is featured. For Apple's Macintosh platform, users are encouraged to utilize Time Machine'.
Alternatively, users could backup their personal files to a location where they can't be written-over or erased. For example, placing them on a removable hard drive or uploading them to a cloud-based platform, such as One Drive and Google Drive. Future ransomware could potentially encrypt the files on your connected backup drive or on your network share if you have full write access. As a result, storing backups on an internal hard drive or network may not be enough, unless users can encrypt them using encryption tools, such as Windows BitLocker or VeraCrypt.
Should users files become locked by ransomware and they don't have the appropriate backups, they could recover them with Shadow Explorer. The tool retrieves Shadow Copies, which Windows uses for System Restore-and will often contain some personal files.
Avoiding Ransomware
Aside from using a legitimate backup strategy, users at home and in the workplace can avoid ransomware in the same way they might avoid other forms of malware.
First, one should refrain from downloading or running suspicious and unrecognized files. Ransomware often arrives in executable files attached to emails, malware-laden advertisements on illicit pirate websites, or in downloads via peer-to-peer networks. Hence, users should be on high alert and exercise caution over the files they might download or run on their systems.
Second, installing only genuine software can provide extra layers of protection from ransomware, frequent security updates and patches included.
Unlicensed software prevents such support from manufacturers and, may even contain dangerous malware. Users should also keep their software updated. In particular, using an old version of a web browser, operating system, or a browser plugin can allow for ransomware to be installed through open security holes.
Unfortunately, encryption is just the beginning-ransomware criminals are expected to raise the bar. Just recently, ransomware attacks had been directed at servers and databases with the intention of causing more widespread damage to critical services and systems.
For example, MongoDB, a free and open-source database system, runs on a range of platforms including Red Hat, SUSE, Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu-as well as Windows systems. In January, ransomware groups had deleted over 30,000 MongoDB databases and exposed over 680 TB of data- significantly more difficult to recover from!

The Right Royal Romance
It was six years ago, on a day like tomorrow (April 29) that a new dawn was ushered in for Britain's royal family. The event was an impeccably choreographed occasion of high pomp and heartfelt emotion, of ancient customs mingling with modern developments.
Viewing estimates for the ceremony, at 11 am. British time on the dot, hovered in the three billion range, give or take 500 million on the day Prince William married his College sweetheart Catherine Middleton (She has parents who made their own fortune with an Internet party-accouterments business and even a generation ago, would have been considered unthinkable as a prospective royal bride.) The whole world, however, approved of the union, and celebrated in various ways; Australians held bouquet-throwing competitions; people in Hong Kong wore Kate and William masks; New Yorkers rose by dawn to watch the entrance of guests like Victoria Beckham, teetering pregnantly in sky-high Christian Louboutin heels. Rowan Atkinsonand his wife as well as Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer and Prime Minister David Cameron who remembered camping out on the streets to celebrate Prince Charles and Diana Spencer's wedding in 1981, were also present.
Thirty years after that other fairytale wedding, the Metropolitan Police said, a million people lined the route of the royal procession, and half a million gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to watch the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, kiss (twice) on the palace balcony.
On her wedding day Kate Middleton wore a gorgeous, custom Alexander McQueen gown designed by Sarah Burton. Her something old was the design of the dress, using traditional craftsmanship. Something new was represented by her earrings, a gift from her parents. The tiara was borrowed, (previously worn by Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, the Queen and the Princess Royal) and she had a blue ribbon sewn into her dress for her blue item. Kate's bouquet was a picturesque arrangement of lily-of-the-valleys, sweet William, hyacinth, ivy and myrtle.
Prince William wore the bright scarlet coat of an Irish Guards mounted officer, the uniform of his senior honorary army appointment. He was also wearing gold sword slings, but no sword.
According to reports in the New York Times, The outfits of the guests were generally tasteful and royal-friendly on the day of the wedding. The Queen, wore a yellow Angela Kelly-designed single crepe wool primrose dress. A few things stuck out. The exotic costumes of foreign dignitaries, seeming throwbacks to imperial times. The hats worn by the ladies, which resembled, variously, overturned buckets, flowerpots, lampshades, fezzes, salad plates, tea cozies, flying saucers, abstract artworks or, in one case, a pile of feathers.
When Kate arrived next to him on the aisle, Prince William was seen remarking: You look beautiful"and joking to his father-in-law: "Just a small family affair!" ( there were 1,900 guests present as well as the eyes of the whole world.)During the service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Prince William said "I will" clearly and firmly, while his bride spoke more quietly, apparently slightly overcome with emotion.
Kate's sister, Pippa was chosen as the Maid of Honor and also wore a Sarah Burton dress. The bridesmaids included: Lady Louis of Windsor, Margarita Armstrong-Jones, Grace van Cutsem and Eliza Lopes. Prince Harry was the Best Man, and William Lowther-Pinkerton as well as Tom Pettifer were page boys.
The wedding ceremony passed without hitch, with the only moment of tension provided as Prince William struggled to put the ring, fashioned from Welsh gold given to him by the Queen, on his bride's finger.
Afterward, the bride and groom cut the eight-tiered wedding cake crafted by pastry chef Fiona Cairns at a private reception in Buckingham Palace's picture gallery. The cake boasted raisins, walnuts, cherries, lemon, grated orange, and French brandy. The lace-reminiscent decorations were inspired by a piece of Kate's wedding gown.
During their vows, Kate and William promised to "love, comfort, honor and keep" each other with a single exception - Kate, did not promise to obey her husband. Observers noted, she seemed already at ease in what will now be a lifetime job, one with a heavy burden of responsibility as well as great privilege. As the couple drove in their horse-drawn carriage from the church to Buckingham Palace, she waved like a pro  from the wrist, the royal way.
Reflecting on his and Kate's wedding day, Prince William confessed to ABC host Katie Couric that he wished his mother Princess Diana had been able to be there:
"I think she would have loved the day and I think, hopefully, she'd be very proud of us both for the day. I'm just very sad that she's never going to get a chance to meet Kate."
His brother Prince Harry added: "My mother would have loved Kate."

Samsung sees best quarterly profits in three years
Demand for memory chips and flat screens for televisions and phones has given Samsung Electronics its best quarterly profits in three years,
The South Korean tech giant reported a 48% jump in operating profits to $8.8bn (6.8bn) for the three months to March. Samsung said it expected further growth in memory chip orders and a pick up in earnings from its phone business.
It is relying on its new Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones to help rebuild its reputation after the Note 7 fiasco.
Last October it had to scrap the Galaxy Note 7 after recalling 2.5 million handsets. Batteries were blamed for overheating in the phones, which caused some of them to catch fire.
The two S8 devices launched last week and no sales figures are yet available, but Samsung said pre-orders had been 30% higher than for the Galaxy S7 in 2016.
Despite the financial success, Samsung remains mired in scandal with its de-facto head Lee-Jae Yong on trial over his alleged role in a corruption scandal that brought down South Korean President Park Geun-hye. BBC

There is no use going abroad to take part in various conferences, summits and seminars unless those who participate in these do something worthwhile for the country, Health Deputy Minister Fizal Kassim said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that Bangladesh is ahead of Sri Lanka and other countries in the region with regard to helping children with autism. Sri Lanka has a long way to go. We can learn from other countries to improve our condition, he said.
Deputy Minister Kassim pointed out that it is the responsibility of parents to identify children with autism early and seek treatment and rehabilitation.
They need to spend 70 percent of their time with children with autism to see an improvement.
However, at present, most mothers are only interested in obtaining the relevant vaccinations on time and not other important aspects.
With correct medical treatment, rehabilitation and guidance, children with autism can lead a near-normal life and carry out their day to day activities without help, he added.

He was speaking at the World Intellectual Property (IP) Day Seminar under the theme Innovation-Improving Lives organised by the National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) in collaboration with the Department of Commerce, Washington D.C. at the Taj Samudra Hotel on March 26.
A provisional programme for the World IP Day was also held under the theme Intellectual Property and Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions jointly organized by the NIPO and WIPO at Hilton Colombo.
Bathiudeen also said WIPO, Department of Commerce of Washington D.C., United States Patent and Trademark Office, University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka and Ministry of Science and Technology of Sri Lanka would contribute to a modern University Intellectual Property Policy in Sri Lanka helping to establish a framework for University staff and students to protect and commercialise new inventions beyond granting patents.
The Minister said, Innovation creates new markets, jobs and industries and it gives new life to existing industries. Also granting exclusive rights such as patent rights, registering industrial designs and copyrights can help innovation to be successfully commercialised.
NIPO Director General Geethanjali Ranawaka said the action plan for the Madrid Accession Project for the period 2016 to 2017 had been drafted with the aim of facilitating international registration of trademarks.
Intellectual Property Automation System (IPAS) will be launched and NIPO website will be upgraded to ease the execution of the Madrid project, she added.
The Director General further said that E-NIPO Project will be implemented with the collaboration of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Sri Lanka to create a platform to carry out activities related to copyrights and trademarks online.
She also said that the ultimate goal would be to promote Sri Lanka as a hub of traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.
WIPO Assistant Director General Minelik Getehun said, WIPO is an international organization with 189 member states dedicated to promote protection and beneficial use of innovation and creativity and productions of human mind among and between the member states. Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary Chinthaka S. Lokuhetti said that Intellectual property protection and the patent system promotes innovations and encourages economic growth while creating a favourable atmosphere for the creators to engage in further creative work.
WIPO Director Wend Wendland, US Embassy Chief Economic Officer Partha Mazumdar, University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan De Silva, NIPO Assistant Director Dilini Ratnayake, Attorney Generals Department Senior State Counsel Avanti Perera, Industry and Commerce Ministry Additional Secretary M.A. Thajudeen and Intellectual Property Advisory Commission Member Dr. Danister Perera also participated.

Sri Lanka prevails by huge majority
Motion to deny GSP Plus :
Granting of GSP Plus will lead to export growth
Efforts of the European United Left Nordic Green Left defeated:
The motion to deny GSP+ to Sri Lanka was defeated yesterday at the European Parliament.
The motion to deny the trade concession put forward by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, was voted down, as 436 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted against it, 119 voted for, while 22 abstained.
The proposal to deny Sri Lanka the GSP Plus status was tabled by 52 MEPs from the European United Left/Nordic Green Left group, who argued that the countrys labour laws are insufficient to protect workers, while there had not been enough progress in the field of human rights.
They argued that Sri Lankas efforts to fulfill its commitments have been worryingly slow and that they are inadequate to ensure real progress.
MEPs Anne-Marie Mineur and Lola Sanchez Caldentey, who visited Sri Lanka from April 10 to 12th, sent a letter to European Commissioner on Trade Cecilia Malmstrm arguing that the trade concession should not be restored unless Sri Lanka kept its promise to improve labour rights. The granting of GSP Plus will make Sri Lankan exports to the European Union market cheaper and lead to export growth.

Stage of creativity!
shini Fernando. Pictures by Siripala Halwala
When it comes to Drama, Bishops College have been impressive and maintained an excellent standard. Indeed Drama is inbred in these girls. Dramatic Moves features the Bishopian Drama Society that has made its presence felt very strongly in the drama circuit in the country.
During our time in school, many years back it was part of the English Literary Association and then subsequently it broke away and we formulated the Drama Society. Drama has been such an integral part at Bishops. Our pioneer directress was Irene Wanigaratne. Our first Shakespeare victory was in 1980. From then onwards we have had productions. We had a joint production in 1993 with S. Thomas College called South Pacific which was a musical. Last year the past pupils from both schools staged Divorce me darling, said Teacher in Charge, Ashini Fernando.
The Drama Club has a curious distinction that every time a student has played Juliet at the Shakespeare Interschool drama competition, they have won Best Actress Shanuki De Alwis, Oshadhi Welegama and Keshya Ranatunga
For last years inter-house we did a series of workshops with the children. Tracy (other teacher in charge) and I found four very modern scripts and we gave it to the four houses and they had to direct it and work it out for themselves. So now we are trying to open ourselves out to more contemporary stuff, stated Fernando.
At Bishops in the primary every year there is a concert. So one class will do the English Play.
Invariably at some grade, the girls will be on stage for either a Sinhala play or English play. There is also an English Day, where they do skits. There are so many avenues for them to be creative and have a hand in drama. It really helps that we start at a young age, but some join in later, but at a very young age, we see these kids enthusiastically getting involved.
The main thing is to give them that creative outlet, to come out and show their talent. As a result it is inbred in them. So whether it is Shakespeare or inter-house, or anything small, they get involved. They have been used to it and it comes quite naturally, pointed out Fernando.
Fernando mentioned that there are students who come just for backstage, because they know they are going to have a ball!
Over the years, we have tried to have different directors, so that the girls will be used to a different kind of approach. Two years ago, for Shakespeare we were directed by Javin Thomas. A couple of years ago it was Shashen Perera. But we have also have had our very own coming in as well. The girls get used to different ideas and different types of theatre. Because obviously times are changing. Now they have had the traditional style and have been exposed to people who are more modern, said Fernando.
Fernando also touched on the need to keep growing.
Understandingthe industry
The girls would love to win trophies obviously and that has happened over the years. But at the end of the day we need to show that we are growing and that we keep at the competitions. For example certain schools tend to fall off. They will do their own things at school, but they are not active in competitions. At Bishops we take part in the public school arena as well as internally. We keep adapting as new things happen. At last years series of workshops, we tried to concentrate on newer things, like movement and voice, without the traditional characterization. We even got them to go through a makeup workshop, because that is an integral part. And we addressed stage management separately.
That is something which has really helped Bishops College  moving forward and adapting to all the new things. The English theatre in Sri Lanka has picked up a lot. We have so many different kinds of theatre happening today. So it is important the schools open up to it. The girls do work hard I have to say. They know they have the backing and they have a history and they want to keep that standard, explained Fernando.
Fernando mentioned that even now when there is a production, there is such a following of past pupils. They still do keep in touch. Aaliyah Jabbar left school last year for the states. But she will still keep in touch with the girls. It is like a family. That is what theatre does to you. It brings people together. That has always been there throughout the years.
Fernando pointed out that commitment is tough because these childrens lives are so competitive with studies and other sports commitments. Bishops college is a 2000 plus school, so most of them do everything. So the balancing act is not the easiest. Today productions cost a lot. When you have directors time is precious.
Fernando stressed that when it comes to drama, it is about exposing the girls into what theatre is about. They should get that understanding of what the industry really is. Then the artistic side of it comes slowly. You cant forget that the girls are still at school level.
They are exposed to a lot nowadays and they are very smart.
**************
A tendency to lean
Tracy Jayasinghe, other teacher in charge
Bishops college has had a good foundation. But with times changing, they need more exposure. At Bishops for some reason, we have a tendency to lean more on comedy. But this is not to say we choose it all the time. We have done a lot of musicals within the school. School productions have a tendency to be musical, because of the numbers it allows. So it is a bigger production. We have quite a lot of talent with singing, dancing and acting, said Jayasinghe.
Jayasinghe pointed out the importance of parental support.
If the children do not have the parental support, I dont think they would be here right now. When they are cast in a production, there is a certain level of commitment expected from them all and they understand that. So this is something we discuss with them when they are cast. They put in the effort because they are keen and interested, explained Jayasinghe.
**************
Commitment and dedication
Anagi Fernando, President
The girls have always been involved in Drama in some way or another. We have been very lucky to do a lot of productions. As juniors we have had a lot of exposure  what it was to be part of the cast and crew. The technical part of drama and the fun side of it. We did a production called  Shake Ripple and Roll about three years back.
Every year students leave and new students keep coming up and every year our participation has been consistent and we always deliver a quality performance. We always dont have the same students acting and there are new faces.
Last year Anjuli Mahinkanda performed for the first time and she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She was in Grade 9, said Fernando
Anagi pointed out that Drama is important in the life of a student because it is an outlet to display students creative side.
Also in a way Drama disciplines you. It teaches students commitment and dedication. It is not something you can put up in a day. A lot of hard work goes into it. We learn to work together and show that commitment to put something on stage. There so much from each person who gives into it. Everybody brings something to the table. Because at the end of the day we are doing it to showcase what our school has to offer.
**************
A de-stress factor
Shawnae Algama, Immediate Past President
When it comes to Bishops, there is so much enthusiasm when it comes to Drama. That is the one thing that pushes us through. It is very exciting and we look forward to doing Shakespeare and other productions. If you just take a script in general, even though we act another part, we are taught to bring ourselves through that character. In a way it opens our eyes to a lot of things, said Algama.
Algama pointed out that you learn a lot in terms of theatre in terms of all the exposure you get. It is not only about acting, you learn how the backstage works, how the make- up works and how props work. Overall it is a lot of knowledge. It is definitely a de-stress factor in all of this. Most people say you need an outgoing personality for drama but there is actually a variety of people when it comes to drama.
**************'
Shanaya Klyn, Secretary
When it comes to Bishops College most of us have done drama since our younger days. It is more of a family that a club. The more productions you have done together the closer you get.
**************'



Nivanka Nanayakkara
I definitely enjoy doing drama because it is really fun. It is like a family and much commitment is required.
**************'



Mehak Sangani,immediate pastsecretary
Drama is definitely, one of the most fun things I have ever done. I have been part of it for about four years now. I just love it. Everyone wants to be part of the drama club in some way because it is definitely so much fun. It gives you a sense of fun which is different from other extra-curricular activities. It gives fun a different meaning.
**************'


Shinnali De Mel
Doing Drama has got me out of stage fright. I am now more comfortable taking part in productions. It has developed my personality and got me new friends who I will cherish for life."
**************'



Eleesha Munasinghe
Drama builds up your personality and character so well. It brings out the best in you. It introduces you to a whole new world. You make so many friends and you understand more things. It helps you grow so much as a person.
**************'



Lahari Jayetileke,Assistant Secretary
I was someone who was very insecure in my own skin. Drama helps me to get into someone elses skin, because I am taking on the skin of a character. It helps me to let go of myself, not to be myself but to be someone else. To me that has been the most amazing part. I was never one to do public speaking that involved me being myself.
**************'


Akanksha Hulangamuwa, Vice President
Especially at Bishops College we make sure that everybody who can take part in drama, actually does take part. Our school finds a way to make sure that everybody actually tries to take part. When you get the confidence to actually go on stage and learn to be yourself and a different person, it will open up your personality.
**************'


Shamimah Faizel
I was introduced to Drama through my sister. I have been acting since 2012. My first every acting experience was Shakespeare. I was in Grade 8 and it was Romeo and Juliet. Me and my sister did it together. We were the youngest in the cast. It was amazing how we bonded with everybody. With drama, different age groups bond so well. You grow as a person, learning something different each year.

Taiwan company keen to set up  garbage recycle, Electricity plant
One of the leading Taiwanese waste management companies is planning to set up office in Sri Lanka to introduce waste management systems with the ability for power generation.
APO Centre of Excellence Taiwan, Program Co Leader, Lihkkuan Lee said they have been efficiently using this system in Taiwan for the past 12 years. We purchase garbage from residents and then recycle them in our plants to generate electricity, she said.
She said that in addition to using power generated from waste, their company is also into solar power generation.We are now looking offers the Sri Lankan government or a private company to tie up with us and implement these systems in Sri Lanka.
She said that she was so sad to note that a garbage dump in Sri Lanka had collapsed and killed over 30 people whereas a garbage dump of this size could have generated power to half of Sri Lanka. For us garbage is a major asset.
Meanwhile Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in Chennai, Director General, Charles C. Li said Sri Lanka should look at using the resources and know how of this Taiwan Company seriously.
He said that due to influence by one of their neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka -Taiwan trade was at very low. Now with better international relations we are promoting trade between the two countries aggressively.
This is why several Taiwan investors attended the Invest in East Economic forum that was held in Colombo last year.
Inspriedge Chennai CEO, Sumit Bothra, said that the waste management and solar power generation proposed by the Taiwan company has being successfully practiced in India as well.

UK Police foil 'active terror plot'
Police say they have foiled an active terror plot after a woman was shot during a raid on a house in Willesden, northwest London.
The woman, in her 20s, was one of the subjects of the investigation and is in a serious but stable condition.
A raid also took place in Kent, with six people arrested in total.
Officers say the operation was not connected to an arrest near Parliament on Thursday, when a man was detained on suspicion on terror offences.
Police said the house in Harlesden Road, Willesden, had been under observation
At about 19:00 BST on Thursday, firearm officers entered the property. CS gas was sprayed and a woman was shot.
A 16-year-old boy, and a man and woman, both aged 20, were arrested. A 43-year-old woman was arrested in Kent.
Two further arrests were made in Willesden after a man and woman, both aged 28, returned to the property.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Neil Basu said: "Due to these arrests that have been made yesterday, in both cases I believe that we have contained the threats that they pose."
When asked by reporters whether police had foiled an active terror plot, Basu replied: "Yes."
He added: "There are constant acts of immense bravery by officers, armed and unarmed - those that the public see, where our officers run towards danger just as you saw yesterday, but a huge amount of unseen work that the public will never see behind the scenes."
The Met said the suspects were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts.
They are in custody at a south London police station.

Union Bank posts Rs 147 mn profit in first quarter
Union Bank has posted a profit of Rs 147 mn for the first quarter of 2017.The Bank showed a strong 95% growth on Results from Operating Activities, recording Rs. 147 mn in comparison to Rs. 75 mn in the previous year, reflecting the successful implementation of the Banks strategic initiatives.
Union Bank Director and Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe said the the Bank has successfully withstood a challenging first quarter. With a strong balance sheet, core income and Profit before tax growth, Union Bank will continue to invest and build on this to deliver on its focused business strategy.
This was mainly attributable to the healthy increase in Net Interest Income of 73% despite the challenging Macro-Economic environment. During the period under review, the Bank remained focused on aiding the growth of Net Interest Income through prudent management of the Net Interest Margin coupled with the Total Asset growth.
Net Fee and Commission income grew to Rs. 166 mn recording a 43% increase as a result of the successful implementation of the Banks long-term strategic plans for fee based products.
A change in the Asset Mix of the Bank brought about a decline in the Net Trading Income as funds were shifted to Interest Earning Assets from Investments in Units.
This trade-off in income is a partial contributor to the increase in Net Interest Income.
The Impairment charge for the period increased by Rs.91 mn owing to one particular asset being reported under Non- Performing Assets.
In order to support the strong growth in the Balance Sheet, operating expenses of the Bank increased to Rs. 771 Mn, reporting a 15% growth YoY, in line with the Bank strategic growth and expansion focus along with its investment in Human Capital development.
The Profit before tax grew by a robust 45% to Rs. 167 mn. An increase of 138% in tax expense was experienced as a result of shifting in the assets from investments in tax-free asset classes to higher yielding taxable interest earning asset classes, which caused an increase in the effective tax rate. Profit after tax for the period was Rs. 95 mn.
Total Assets of the Bank grew to Rs. 101Bn, a 8% growth YTD.

Unwarranted human activities, including the encroachment of the tank reservation cause environmental pollution at Anuradhapura Nuwarawewa reservoir. The capacity of the tank is 36,050 af.
The Nuwarawewa is the main water source to provide drinking water to 300,000 population. Nearly 100 acres of the tank reservation, including the tank bed has been encroached.
The majority of tourist hotels and holiday resorts in the Nuwarawewa tank are located within the tank reservation.
Public organisations and farmer organisations have made representation to the District Agriculture Committee, the District Secretary and the Zonal Irrigation Director about this menace.

Currently it markets a broad luxury range of womens and mens clothing, leather goods, shoes and jewellery. YSL Beauty products have a notable presence in the luxury beauty market across the globe.
Speaking at the launch, Jerome Georges-Vivien, the Zone Director for Yves Saint Laurent said: YSL fragrances have already been in the country for some time and we felt that it was the right time to launch the beauty products.
YSL was originally known for their couture and thereafter that they introduced accessories, such as watches and handbags. Luxury fragrances followed and thats where my interest lies. About 25 years ago we never had an opportunity to introduce any kind of couture in Sri Lanka, said Exclusive Lines Director , Hiru Surtani.
YSL offers a wide range of beauty products for women from lipsticks, eye shadow palettes, mascara and make up brushes as well as several others. The brand has also introduced an extensivecollection of perfumes for both men and women. YSLs fragrance line includes many that are considered pillars of the perfume industry such as Mon Paris, Black Opium, La Nuit de LHomme.
