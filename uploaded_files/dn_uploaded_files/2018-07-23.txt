Lakvijaya EPL will be renewed soon
Secretary to the Power and Energy Ministry Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda said Norochcholai Lakvijaya Power Plant anticipates a renewal of its Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) before long. He said all environmental and community requirements in this regards are now complete.
Secretary Dr. Batagoda said the power plant has completed 27 environmental and community requirements. Its operations are now devoid of any discrepancy. The Lakvijaya Power Plant has fulfilled all its requirements; the Authorities have to renew the EPL. It was only in the last year we failed to obtain the EPL. We have received it seven years before, Dr. Batagoda said.
Lakvijaya has been running without a valid EPL since June last year as the North Western Environmental Authority decided against the renewal of the EPL of the plant due to debate over environmental pollution caused by it. Dr. Batagoda said the relevant authorities must renew the EPL, otherwise the power plant cannot continue.
Dr. Batagoda said a group comprising the Central Environmental Authority, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry officials including the Minister and the civil organizations that have filed cases against the pollution caused the power plant, participated in a ground visit where the new improvements were monitored.
A group of youth spent hours walking in the power plant and the surrounding area. Their focus was on the recent ash emission controversy. At the end of their monitoring tour, the shoes worn by these persons were checked for ash and other hazardous components. The results came negative, meaning that we are properly managing the operations, Dr. Batagoda said.
Dr. Batagoda said the constructions of a Wind Barrier is afoot to minimise the environmental impact caused by the waste released from the power plant. Rs. 750 MN is allocated for the Wind Barrier project. The barrier expects to be of 12 km long and 15 meters high, he said.
The North Western Environmental Authority is considering renewing the environmental protection licence for the Norochcholai Power Plant, related sources said.

Major cities in Sri Lanka under fast development plan
The Word Bank, Asian Development Bank and several other donor organizations will fund infrastructural development schemes in 13 major cities in the country. The French Development Program provides 10 BN for the Anuradhapura Integrated City Development Project which is to commence in 2019, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at the second awareness programme, Mega minds towards the future we dream, for professionals. The first programme was held recently in Kandy.
The Minister said China built the Great Wall, but it would not surpass our ancient irrigation system. Anuradhapura has been the only city, which exists for nearly 1,400 years, the Minister said.
The French funded Anuradhapura Integrated City Development Programme will revive the lost glory and prosperity in Anuradhapura. A storm water management system will be built and tourism industry will be improved. Traffic congestion in the city will be lessened and historic monuments will be preserved, the Minister said.
The Minister said per capita income of South Korea in 1960 was similar to that of Sri Lanka. Today they have increased theirs tenfold higher than ours. Our youths are in queues to get jobs in Korea. Over 40,000 Sri Lankans are now working in Korea, the Minister said..
He said we are proud of having a 2,500 years old history. But boasting about it would not bring in prosperity. Small countries such as the Netherlands, Spain and Britain conquered us and we slaved once for them. Now is the most appropriate time for us to rise up to compete with other nations to achieve our future goals. We are blessed with our internationally praised national health service and the education system, the Minister said.
The Minister said Sri Lanka is not an isolated country now. Our CO2 emission is very low compared to its international levels. We must study Bangladesh, India, Pakistan before joining the global economic competition. Sri Lanka is in the centre of the Indian Ocean and that helps us emerging as a hub of trade and tourism in the region, the Minister said.
The Minister said Sri Lanka could be the regional leader in navigation and air travel. Trincomale could be the way to China, Far east, Bangladesh, Mumbai, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Middle East while the Colombo Port for the Middle East, Western Countries, Central Asia and African countries. We have to study these avenues. By 2023, Colombo will not have shanties.
Under the proposed town planning system, more employment opportunities would be available. A safe and peaceful environment and better standards of life would be ensured, the Minister said.

Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Banks, Finance & Insurance Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 60.83% (or 103.25Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.58Bn.

In terms of value Teejay Lanka & Lion Brewery led foreign purchases while Hemas Holdings & Sampath Bank led foreign sales.
Point of View
Bargain-hunting on blue-chips and select mid-caps sustained positive market momentum for the 2nd consecutive week, helping the broad-share Index gain almost 1% this week.
The ASPI gained ~53 points (0.9% W-o-W) relative to last weeks 29.4 point (0.5%) gain, helping the Index close just 8-points shy of the 6200-mark and maintaining last weeks positive momentum after almost 2-months of consistent declines.
Strong buying interest in blue chips JKH and HNB contributed to ~23 index points (of the 53 index point gain) while interest in other key stocks such as SAMP, NEST, COMB, DIST, DIAL, AEL, TJL and CINS also contributed notably to the weeks gains.
Market momentum was driven primarily by retail and HNI investors, with institutional investors remaining on the sidelines this week. Crossings over the week accounted for just 20% of the markets total turnover of Rs. 2.1Bn, down from last weeks participation level of 46% and lower than the average YTD participation level of 42%.
Despite the lower participation levels of the local institutional investors, daily average turnover for the week rose 8.8% W-o-W to Rs. 0.42Bn, up from last weeks daily average turnover of Rs.0.39Bn.
Despite the gains on the Index, the foreign equity sell-off on domestic equities continued for the 6th consecutive week, reflecting the decline in global risk-appetite for risky EM/FM assets and commodities amid heightened US-China trade tensions, the cooling Chinese economy, foreign currency volatility and tightening global market liquidity.
Net outflows from the CSE consequently amounted to Rs.104Mn, and although an overall negative position, the outflows were lower than that of the net outflows of Rs. 221Mn last week and Rs.900Mn the week prior.
June quarter corporate earnings releases (which have just begun) are likely to influence market direction in the week ahead.
Oil falls as supplies and trade tensions rise
Global oil prices continued to slide this week, with benchmark Brent crude oil recording a 5% loss to hit a 3-month low of $71.84/bbl on Monday.
Commodity prices have being on a declining trend since early-July, with Brent crude recording its biggest one-day fall in 2 years last week (-6.9%) amid shifting perceptions in the oil market.
Commodity prices which have been on a consistent uptrend since June17, hit a 31/2 year high of $79.8/bbl in mid-May 2018 amid ongoing fears of supply shortages due to OPEC-led production cuts and prospects of US-sanctions on the worlds 5th largest oil producer Iran. Despite trading at these highs over the last 2 months, oil markets have taken an about-turn since early-July, with prices falling by ~7.3% over the last 2-weeks as the focus in oil markets has shifted away from supply shortages and towards increasing production and the US-China trade dispute.
Concerns over supply disruptions eased as expectations of supply increased amid improved oil exports from OPEC and Russia and as Libya re-opened its export terminals.
Rising concerns over the potential damage to global growth from the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute meanwhile raised concerns about oil demand and heightened selling pressure on oil.
Indeed, in its latest outlook for global growth the IMF strongly cautioned against the rising trade tensions, adding that although it retains its global growth forecast of 3.9% in 2018 &2019, the expansion is becoming less even, with risks to the outlook mounting.
The IMF added that downside risks have heightened as escalating and sustained trade actions could derail the recovery and depress medium-term growth both through their direct impact on resource allocation and productivity and by raising uncertainty and taking a toll on investment1.

Earnings from merchandise exports UP to US$ 924 mn in May
Sri Lankas external sector demonstrated a modest performance in May 2018. The deficit in the trade account continued to expand at a comparatively slower rate in May 2018, as export growth outpaced import growth.
Tourist earnings continued to increase while workers remittances declined during the month. Inflows to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) moderated with net outflows from the government securities market and a reduction in net inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The countrys level of gross official reserves at the end May 2018, stood at US dollars 8.8 billion.
Meanwhile, reflecting the developments in the domestic and global foreign exchange markets, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 3.3 per cent against the US dollar by end May 2018 and by 4.5 per cent so far during the year up to 20 July 2018.
Earnings from merchandise exports increased to US dollars 924 million in May 2018 mainly driven by industrial exports, despite a reduction recorded in agricultural exports.
However, earnings from agricultural exports declined in May 2018 due to poor performance in almost all categories except spice and seafood exports.
Benefiting from the positive impact of the removal of the ban on fisheries exports to the EU and the restoration of GSP+ facility, earnings from seafood exports increased significantly during the month due to higher prices and volumes of seafood exported.
However, export earnings from tea declined due to the reduction recorded in both volumes and prices of tea exported.
In May 2018, tourist arrivals increased by 6.2 per cent to 129,466 while earnings from tourism increased, year-on-year, to US dollars 240 million in May 2018.
Meanwhile, reversing the positive development observed in the last two months, workers remittances declined by 3.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 580 million in May 2018 compared to US dollars 601 million in May 2017.
Foreign investment in the government securities market witnessed a net outflow of US dollars 89 million in May 2018, with a cumulative net outflow of US dollars 102 million during the first five months of 2018.
Foreign investments in the CSE including primary and secondary market flows recorded a net inflow of US dollars 5 million in May 2018 with a cumulative net inflow of US dollars 53 million during January-May 2018. Long term loans to the government recorded a net outflow of US dollars 325 million and US dollars 231 million during May 2018 and first five months of the year, respectively.

Government to write off debt
JAFFNA: In a bid to rescue families being crushed by mountains of debt, the Government has rolled out an extensive relief package for 12 drought affected districts, writing off micro-finance loans taken by women in these regions and offering a state subsidized loan scheme, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced in the Northern capital of Jaffna yesterday.
Microfinance loans taken by women in these regions, valued at Rs 100,000 or less will be written off under the relief programme. The Government will pay back these loans, while the micro-finance companies have come to an agreement to waive the high interest attached to these borrowings, Minister Samaraweera noted.
The write-off would cost the Treasury Rs.20 billion and be paid back over a period of five years, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the gathering at the Jaffna District Secretariat yesterday. Micro-finance companies were lending to desperate people struck by drought and poverty at interest rates of 40-200% per annum, the Premier noted.
The measures were part of an effort to address an exploitative cycle of debt, in which women were worst affected especially in the war-affected districts of the North and East and drought- affected districts in the North Central and North Western Provinces.
Loans taken from micro-finance companies at exorbitant interest rates have placed peoples lives in peril. Unable to manage the debt, some women in these regions have taken their own lives, the Finance Minster told large crowds at the Jaffna District Secretariat last afternoon, where a high level Government delegation rolled out the measures. Borrowers in the gathering were urged to fill applications to apply for the write off and hand them over to the District Secretaries of their respective districts.
Minister Samaraweera said his Ministry had decided to submit a Cabinet proposal to cap micro-finance interest rates at 30% per annum in a bid to prevent these companies from lending to vulnerable communities at predatory interest rates. The Government would also work to better regulate these micro-finance companies and bring amendments to the Micro-Finance Act in order to prevent the manifestation of similar debt traps and exploitative lending programmes.
Under the Enterprise Sri Lanka subsidized loan scheme, the Government proposes to pay 50% of the interest of loans granted to people in need, he added. The Government will pay the interest component directly to the Bank, the Minister noted.
Many of the women who took the first loans under Enterprise Sri Lanka in the North were hoping to finish building their houses, or pay off loans they took to get solar panels for their homes, so they do not need to pay for electricity again, he said.
Women in this country need never become the prey of loan sharks again, Minister Samaraweera asserted.
In the second phase of the Enterprise Sri Lanka project, the subsidized loan scheme will be rolled out all over the island, in order to pull people out of debt, the Finance Minister claimed.
State Minister for Finance Eran Wickremaratne, Industries Minister Rishard Bathurdeen, and UNP MP Vijayakala Maheswaran, and TNA MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, Marvai Senathirajah and E Saravanabhavan attended the event at the Kachcheri.

Penang Deputy Chief Minister II Dr. P. Ramasamy has brushed aside allegations linking him to terrorist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Star reported..
The allegations surfaced after a photo of him and pro-LTTE politician V. Gopalasamy were circulated online.
According to the Star report, Dr. Ramasamy explained that he was invited to be a peace consultant between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE back in 2003 when he was a professor at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in Political Economics and International Conflicts Management.
At the same time, I was also a part of the constitutional affairs committee which was tasked with formulating a peace solution.
While I did meet the leaders of Sri Lanka and LTTE members, I was merely facilitating peace talks between them. Is this equivalent to a terrorist act he said during a press conference yesterday.
Dr. Ramasamy said it was illogical to link him to a terrorist group which was destroyed in May 2009, calling it an extraordinary imagination.
You can make thousands of reports against me, but make sure they have basis.
Ill leave it to the police to investigate the matter, he said.
Dr. Ramasamy also rapped those who lodged multiple reports against him for failing to mention his efforts in securing peace in Indonesia and Columbia.
It was reported that he would be called by the police to give his statement if needed. (The Star)

President to commence water filling of Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda today
Sri Lanka, primarily an agricultural nation, marks a significant milestone today (July 23) when the waters of the last but largest reservoir of multipurpose Mahaweli Project at Kalu Ganga will receive waters from the river to irrigate parched dry lands in the Rajarata, Wayamba, Central and Eastern Provinces on one hand and faraway Vanni in the Northern Province on the other.
Water filling of the Kalu Ganga - Moragahakanda reservoir, which is six times larger than the gigantic Parakrama Samudraya, constructed centuries ago by King Parakramabahu the Great to make our country self sufficient in rice, takes place today with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena. This also marks completion of the Mahaweli Multipurpose Project of which the first project at Polgolla in the Central Province by the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike on January 8, 1976.
Indeed, Mahaweli is truly the biggest multipurpose national project, which was implemented by different governments during the last four decades. The project first planned and feasibility studies were done by the governments of Dudley Senanayake and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, was initiated by Mrs Bandaranaike in 1976 at Polgolla. However, the bulk of the work was done during the J.R.Jayewardene period, during which the 30-year project was speeded up to be completed in five years under the able leadership of Minister Gamini Dissanayake.
Although the bulk of the work was done during the UNP regime under the accelerated Mahaweli programme, the last phase-that of the Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda project was considerably delayed due to various reasons.
Maithripala Srisena, watched these developments first as a youth belonging to a Mahaweli farmer family and later as a novice Member of Parliament representing Polonnaruwa, the cradle of rice farming.
Much later in 2007, he succeeded in obtaining the government approval and initiated the Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda project, which was a dream vision of his. Immediately thereafter, he ran into difficulties starting with non availability of funds.
Undeterred, he continued his struggle and finally he could take effective steps to accelerate the project when he became the Executive President three and a half years ago.
Today, water filling of the Kalu Ganga reservoir will commence at the Kalu Ganga Dam, which is a large gravity dam, and the second vital component of the Kalu Ganga Moragahakanda Project that was constructed at a cost of Rs. 2,300 million, which is almost three times the entire cost of the previous projects of the accelerated Mahaweli Multipurpose Project.
The capacity of Kalu Ganga reservoir is 265 million cubic meters and will divert 100 million cubic meters a year to the Moragahakanda Reservoir. The reservoir will irrigate 3,000 hectares in the Kaluganga basin.
Water from both, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoirs, will be primarily used to support agricultural needs to an area of at least 81,422 hectares. This will increase rice production by 81% or 109,000 tons, amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of US$1.67 million, annually. In addition to irrigation of land, water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir generates 25-megawatt power at the Moragahakanda Hydroelectric Power Station.
The Kalu Ganga irrigation scheme is a historic turning point of the countrys agricultural and irrigation development component, since the time of our great ancient kings.
Once the Moragahakanda scheme is connected to the Kaluganga project, the water scarcity in North Central, Eastern and North Western areas including the North would be solved to a greater extent. It has been estimated that by 2019 under this Moragahakanda - Kaluganga irrigation project, an extent of 185,000 hectares would receive adequate water for cultivation both in the Yala and Maha seasons.
Meanwhile, the construction work of the long awaited North Central Canal Project is being initiated simultaneously.
Under the first phase of the NCP canal project, the upper Elahera canal, North Western canal Project and Minipe anicut rehabilitation will be initiated. Initially, the nine kilometre canal way channeling water from the Kaluganga reservoir to the Moragahakanda reservoir will be completed.
The 65 km upper Elahera canal channeling water from Moragahakanda to Manankattiya and Mahakanadarawa in the Anuradhapura district will be the next to be constructed. Once this project is completed the people in the Kekirawa, Dambulla, Hingurakgoda, Elahera, Galenbindunwewa and Palugaswewa in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Matale Districts will benefit.
Families who are living in Kaluganga Dam construction site were resettled about five kilometres away from their original homes at Guruwela resettlement area and compensations too were paid. The families affected under the Moragahakanda reservoir were provided new lands at the Thorapitiya resettlement area.
The project has paid special attention to minimise the impact on the environment. The following activities are currently being implemented as stipulated as in Environmental Effect Assessment (EIA) Report.
President Maithripala Sirisena said the implementation of the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Irrigation Development Project is not only a fulfillment of a long awaited aspiration of the farmers but also a personal dream, come true for him.
Another unique feature is, the Moragahakanda-Kaluganga scheme represents the spirit of cooperation prevailing in the government of consensus. While the massive projects hitherto were implemented by the governments of the UNP and SLFP separately, this the first major project implemented under the unity government of the two major national parties.

Sri Lanka, a special and trusted partner - Indian PM
Describing Sri Lanka as Indias trusted partner in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said his country had been and would always remain the first responder for Sri Lanka, in both good and bad times.
The Indian Prime Minister was addressing an event to expand the 1990 Suwaseriya Emergency Ambulance Service across the entire country with Indian assistance.
The Prime Minister of India joined Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through a live video conferencing from New Delhi for the launch of the island-wide expansion of the Emergency Ambulance Service in Jaffna on Saturday.
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Modi expressed happiness that the promise he had made, for the expansion of the ambulance service islandwide in Sri Lanka during his visit last year, was now fulfilled.
He noted that the event marks another major achievement in the development partnership of India and Sri Lanka.
The Indian Premier underlined that India sees Sri Lanka not just as a neighbour but as a very special and trusted partner in the South Asian and Indian Ocean family.
Noting that the expansion of the service islandwide started from the Northern Province, he said that India was happy to work together with Sri Lanka for wiping tears from the past and ushering in a bright future.
Prime Minister Modi noted that the local skill set and local employment in Sri Lanka will receive a boost with the expansion of the service.
Prime Minister Modi fondly recalled his last two visits to Sri Lanka. He highlighted that India had been and would always remain the first responder for Sri Lanka, in both good and bad times.
Prime Minister Modi appreciated the efforts of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for meeting the aspirations of all citizens of Sri Lanka.
Prime Minister Modi recalled what Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1927, when he had visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Student Congress of Jaffna- The message that I can leave for Jaffna as for the whole of Ceylon is: let it not be out of sight, out of mind.
Prime Minister Modi said that he has the same message today. He exhorted people of India and Sri Lanka to be in touch with each other, so that they could know each other better and become even closer friends. He encouraged people of Sri Lanka to come and experience the New India that is taking shape.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe thanked the Government of India for the generous assistance, and noted that this was an important milestone in the India-Sri Lanka bilateral relationship.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe together flagged off the first two ambulances.
The Emergency Ambulance Service was first launched in 2016 in Western and Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka under an Indian grant of USD 7.5 million. This grant included purchase of 88 ambulances, operational expenditure of the service for one year and setting up of an emergency response centre. This service is now being expanded to the remaining seven provinces with an additional grant of USD 15.02 million, covering the cost of 209 ambulances, training costs and operational expenditure for one year in all seven provinces.
The emergency ambulance service, which can be obtained by simply dialing toll free no 1990 on any network in Sri Lanka, is the largest Indian grant project in Sri Lanka after the Indian Housing Project. India remains committed to further strengthening the bilateral partnership with Sri Lanka based on Sri Lankas own choices and priorities.
Several Ministers and other dignitaries graced the occasion. High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu was also present.

Tokyo Cement chimes in with The Music Project for second Year
Tokyo Cement Group has extended their sponsorship with The Music Project for the second year. The Music Project is a NGO committed to empowering and uplifting the lives of disadvantaged youth through music.
The partnership this year will see Tokyo Cement sponsoring two schools; one in Mullaitivu and the other in Mawathagama, Kurunegala, where The Music Project conducts music lessons and train children from all age groups to play orchestral instruments.
The sponsorship ensures 110 children of Palinagar Maha Vidyalayam and 65 students of Gunananda Kanishta Vidyalaya will benefit from the programme which entails learning the primary instrument of recorder, leading to the mastery of any orchestral instrument of their choice. These children are among students from six schools under the programme, who aspire to join The Music Project Orchestra that performs on invitation at various events and venues throughout the country.
A music lesson being conducted at Ku/Sri Gunananda Kanishta Vidyalaya, Mawathagama
At the orchestra programme in Palinagar, 110 children eagerly stay after school for music lessons, the only extra-curricular activity on offer while their parents help set up the space and distribute refreshments. The scene is set for a learning model which is holistic and therapeutic. Clusters of children sit with their teachers on mats and under trees in their familiar surroundings, to learn the basics of playing the recorder.
This relaxed and easy approach to teach enables the children to grasp the lessons faster and go for simple musical achievements as a team, filling the air with wonderful creative melodies and warm, glowing smiles. The learning atmosphere is identical in Kurunegala. Again, sitting under trees away from the rigours of schooling in the idyllic setting of Mawathagama, scores of children learn through play.
Participants are taught to play instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, trumpet, French horn and a variety of percussion instruments, by their full time teachers and volunteers from various parts of the world. Much harmony is created, not just among children with their melodious tunes, but also among two farming communities distanced be many differences, yet united through music and the want to provide the best for their children.
Speaking about the funding partnership, S.R. Gnanam, Managing Director of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC said, We were motivated to support this far-reaching charitable effort because, we believe in building platforms for children to explore the world using exciting new tools, and not be limited by standardised education. These young children learn not only music, but also character-defining skills such as collaboration, perseverance and respect for others. Participating in the orchestra expands their horizon, while teaching them that every member is equally important and to work hard as a team to be successful.
The programme commenced working in the North and South in 2011, working initially to rebuild physical infrastructure of schools while nurturing the emotional resilience of communities, whose lives had been blighted by the war. The programme made music accessible to children from different backgrounds, enabling them to acquire a set of new skills with self-confidence.
The programme allows them to grow at their own pace and further their holistic well-being by performing in front of their own communities and wider audiences. Children who become members of the Orchestra work with their peers from other communities, inculcating a sense of team work and mutual respect.
Now in its seventh year, The Music Project aims to reach out to as many children as possible working with Zonal Education Offices and international NGOs with a view of using music for social cohesion.
The programme has trained teachers of Ampara, Kurunegala, Mullaitivuand Kilinochchi and distributed over 3000 recorders and teaching tools.
In addition to regular music lessons, two residential programmes are conducted annually for the children of formerly divided communities to forge ties with their peers using music as the link language.
Shalini Wickramasuriya, Trustee of The Music Project comments, Seeing children pursue their passion for music that presents new opportunities and improve their choices for alternative career prospects is very motivating. Replicating the El Sistema inspired model here in Sri Lanka has gained added impetus. In addition to improving the quality of overall education of our children, we are pleased to see connections being made through music. The children learn a variety of genres of music including Sinhala and Tamil tunes enabling them to appreciate our shared cultural heritage as a united Sri Lanka. The children are very aware of the role they play and that each one is responsible to make the orchestra successful, be it by practising ahead or being attentive on the day. We are particularly grateful to Tokyo Cement for supporting us yet again through a second year of sponsorship. This endorses their belief in the project and the hard work of our team of teachers and the communities which support the project.

VIASL refutes cover allegations levied by franchise importers
The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) rejected the accusations made by certain brand new vehicle importers in Sri Lanka that VIASL is importing vehicles from Japan and England under the cover of used vehicles in order to pay reduced taxes.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo VIASL, President Ranjan Peiris said brand new vehicle importers are in the habit of issuing statements saying that their association members (parallel importers) used to register brand new vehicles in that countries and again cancelling the registration in the same countries and thereafter importing them to Sri Lanka.
Peiris said the accusation was totally false as even the Gazette notification 2044/32 dated November 9, 2017 mentions that the tax on a vehicles are based on the engine capacity.
He also noted that the engine capacity tax imposed by the Finance Ministry was to prevent errors in calculating tax based on the valuation and to overcome any revenue leakage.
Peiris also highlighted a grave disadvantage faced by parallel importers and said as a result of the depreciation table being abolished; traders who import vehicles that are up to three years old are also required to pay the tax that is imposed on a brand new vehicle. He said an effective action is required to support parallel importers.
Parallel importers face a volatile business environment with regular taxation changes and depreciating exchange rates resulting in customer difficulties and delays,
The association also assured the public that they now import vehicles which are compatible with Euro Four Emission standards in keeping with the governments decision to switch the import of vehicles to Euro 4. We also thank the government for taking steps to introduce the Euro Four Emission standards which would help the country to maintain high standard vehicles and also help protect the environment.

We must rebuild, PM says in the North
JAFFNA: Leading the Government delegation to rollout Enterprise Sri Lanka in Jaffna yesterday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reminisced about the glory days of the Northern district, saying it was only rivalled by the district of Colombo before three decades of war destroyed the socio-economic fabric in the region.
Jaffna also had the best education system in the past, but now all those educators were living overseas, the Premier noted. The Government was focused on rebuilding the regions industries like sugar and coconut, and had set its sights on developing the Palaly airport and the Kankesanthurai Harbour, he announced.
Recalling that today (23) marked 35 years since the Black July communal riots, Wickremesinghe said he had been in the capital Colombo when the bodies of 13 soldiers killed in Jaffna were brought into the city, setting off the violence. It spread through July 23rd and 24th  because people were provoked and reacted violently. The LTTE got a golden opportunity, the Premier said.
The legacy of the war still lingered, the Prime Minister noted, because even though the war ended in 2009, peace had remained elusive. So many people are still missing, we need to figure out how to resolve this issue  in the South meanwhile, there are fears of a LTTE resurgence, he added, explaining that the country was still in post-war recovery.
It was important to work together to put the country on the right track, Wickremesinghe noted.
Extremism won, the country lost, the Prime Minister said. But we can catch up.
