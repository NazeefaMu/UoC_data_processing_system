Nearly 15,000 families to receive clean drinking water: President inaugurates Badulla, Haliela, Ella integrated water supply project
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, inaugurated the Badulla - Haliela - Ella integrated water supply project providing clean drinking water to about 15,000 families in Badulla, Haliela, Demodara and Ella.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem and State Minister of City Planning, Sudarshini Fernandopulle accompanied the President.
The project constructed spending Rs 11,800 million with loan assistance from the US, has a fully fledged water purification plant that could purify 15,000 cubic meters of water per day. The construction consists of a concrete dam built across the Badulu Oya with a 17 metre-high water storage facility that could hold 132,000 cubic meters of water.
The projects water treatment technology uses mixed tube settlers and absorption clarifiers to optimize the water treatment. Installations involve a recycling network that could recycle waste water which gets ejected through the purification process. The water supply network covers 42 Grama Niladhari divisions, providing pipe borne water to nearly 110,000 people. As pointed out by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board sources, the project has given them the opportunity to enhance their services by installing at least 25,000 new domestic water meters. The project has also seen construction of eight steel tanks over the extent of the supply area. Besides, the office of the Uva Province Deputy General Manager and Eladaluwa and Bandarapura water purification plants have been reconstructed with the aegis of the project.
The water supply schemes
in Mediriya, Morethota and Thelbedda have been improved in conformity with it, sources said.

## Title: The New Constitution from a Human Rights Context

The New Constitution from a Human Rights Context
The country is in a unique moment. Last week, the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly submitted its interim report on a new Constitution to Parliament for review.
Delivering a Constitution was a key campaign promise of the Yahapalanaya, or good-governance government, when they came to power in 2015.
Against this backdrop, though, high-level officials at the United Nations have repeatedly criticized the countrys progress on addressing its human rights abuses. Earlier this month, The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein called out Sri Lanka by name for what he said was its slow pace on achieving post-war accountability and reconciliation.
At a recent event organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, lawyers and academics talked about securing human rights in the current legal framework, with an eye towards the drafting of a new Constitution.
Judicial review of legislature
Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, a senior lecturer at the University of Colombos Faculty of Law, said that the new Constitution should give the Supreme Court the power of legislative review, like in the United States.
He said the current arrangement gives Parliament too much power to pass potentially harmful laws.
Mahanamahewa said Sri Lanka needed to blaze its own path as a human rights leader, as other countries in the region, like India, are falling behind. He gave the example of the recent murder of Gauri Lankesh, the journalist who often criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modis government.
She criticized the system, and what was the reward, he asked. In contrast, he said the media in Sri Lanka has emerged as a kind of parallel government, highlighting abuses like the Central Bank bond scam.
Further advocating legal reform, Mahanamahewa also said the ability to hear Fundamental Rights cases  the types of cases that tackle human rights issues in Sri Lanka  should not lie only with the countrys highest court.
Such cases are only practised by a few elite lawyers in the Supreme Court, he said. Instead, he argued, provincial High Courts should be empowered to hear Fundamental Rights cases as well.
Freedom from torture
He said South Africas Constitution, which contains a fundamental rights chapter, should be a model for Sri Lanka. Within those provisions should be things like access to legal aid and freedom from torture. Freedom from torture should be an absolute right, he said.
Torture is still routinely used in the country, he said, echoing statements made by UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson, made on his official visit to Sri Lanka in July.
And still, there is intimidation of media and human rights activists, Mahanamahewa added. He said that personally, he had made a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption about a sitting minister over a year ago, and had not received a response since.
According to him, the current structure of government favoured political protectionism. The President should be for all citizens, and not for a party. That should be in the Constitution, he added.
Victims rights
Former head of the Department of Public and International Law at the University of Colombo Jeeva Niriella added that from a criminal justice perspective, victims rights should also be included as a branch of human rights.
The present form of criminal justice  is more favourable to the accused, she said.
Though not pointing to the new Constitution specifically, she argued that Sri Lankas victim and witness protection programmes needed to be significantly reinforced. As of now, a victim has no way to appeal if their request for protection is denied, she said.
U.R. De Silva, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, also approached the topic of human rights from a criminal law perspective. He cited the 2006 case where the Supreme Court found that the detention of nearly 200 people suspected of violating the Immigrants and Emigrants Act was in itself a violation of their Fundamental Rights, as they were held without a fair trial.
In the universities, we hear theyre not talking about human rights, just violations, he joked. We need more protections in the Constitution.
A clash of ideologies
Dr. Kalana Senaratne, a visiting lecturer at the University of Peradeniya, agreed that the new Constitution-making process was fertile ground for better protecting the human rights of Sri Lankan citizens.
But he urged an understanding of the context in which the Constitution is being formed, and a realistic political analysis of its fate.
We cant think about whats happening today with the Constitution-making process  without understanding what really happened in the final months of the war, in 2009, he said.
He said that the battle between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces was more than just one between two armies, but one between two forms of nationalism.
On the battlefield we found two armed groups, but the political battle was the far more dangerous one, he said. Even though the fighting has ceased, these ideas continue, and will need to find compromise if a new Constitution is to be agreed upon, he argued.
He pointed out that the bulk of the 90-page interim report of the Constitutional Assembly is made up of criticism and commentary submitted by the political parties. It will be a delicate task to thread the needle, he argued, given that different parties have opposing demands for provisions they see as protecting their and their constituencies interests.
The Tamil parties want a secured devolution of power, for instance, while Sinhala nationalist parties like the JHU want Sri Lankas status as a Buddhist, unitary state further enshrined.
To further complicate negotiations, The UNP seems to want to abolish the executive presidency, while both the pro-Sirisena and pro-Rajapaksa branches of the SLFP want it preserved, at least in some form.
Its a very interesting era that were living in, admitted Senaratne.

Over agitation near refugee shelter: UNHCR alarmed and concerned
The UN Refugee Agency in Colombo yesterday, issuing a special press statement over the agitation that occurred near the refugee shelter in Mount Lavinia that housed 31 Rohingya refugees, said it is alarmed and concerned by the incident.
On Tuesday, a group of people protested outside the shelter housing 31 refugees  most of them women and children  who had been rescued by the Sri Lankan Navy from a boat in Sri Lankan waters in April this year.
The refugees were eventually evacuated to safety by the authorities to whom the UNHCR is grateful for the support and protection extended to the refugees, it stated.
UNHCR is equally concerned for the safety and security of our partners staff present during the incident who were providing humanitarian assistance to the refugees. UNHCR emphasizes that the refugees are victims of violence and persecution who need international protection and assistance, it added.
UNHCR urges the public and all those concerned with refugees to continue extending protection and to show empathy for civilians fleeing persecution and violence. In Sri Lanka, the presence of refugees and asylum-seekers is authorized by the Government. In consultation with the authorities, the UNHCR provides assistance to refugees until longer-term solutions could be found, the communique further stated, the release stated.

Panadura SC-Kalutara PCC match fixing incident: Sports Minister to launch independent inquiry
Minister of Sports, Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said an independent inquiry will be launched into the Premier Tier B match between Panadura Sports Club and Kalutara Physical and Culture Club played at Surrey grounds, Maggona from January 23-25.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) which had held initial investigations into the game had stated that both clubs were guilty of misconduct and had not played to the spirit of the game.
On the final day, the two teams produced 607 runs for 23 wickets lost in just 60.4 overs which led to suspicion of the manner in which the match was played.
The SLC imposed punishment on all the players and coaches of from both teams and they received a one year suspension from all cricket related activities in addition to a fine of Rs. 500,000 being imposed on each club.
Critics however have pointed out that it was unfair to only punish the players when the club officials themselves have not faced any censure.
I agree that the ruling is unfair and that match fixing cannot take place with the involvement of just the players, said Minister Jayasekara addressing the weekly cabinet briefing yesterday.
He explained that Chamara Silva, the captain of the Panadura SC who reported sick on the day, had submitted an affidavit to the Ministry and that all other players too were willing to do the same.
The problem was that when the investigations were launched, lawyers represented the teams as a whole. If individual cricketers were allowed to give their own statements, we could have got a better result, he said.
Jayasekara pushed aside allegations that action was not being taken against the club owners because they were members of SLC.
The law will apply to all equally. I am not worried about which position someone holds. I will send home all those who bring disrepute to the game and the country, stressed the Sports Minister.

Pen mightier than the sword
What great ones do the less will prattle of
The other day, I was just perusing through some great literature to find some solutions to our perennial national problems which have developed to a very disgusting level in the course of time. The ever stinking garbage problem is going to be eliminated with the active supervision of the President and the concerned authorities and it is a step in the right direction. It has been a long felt need. In the same manner, some other nagging problems are also going to be handled for the larger benefit of the nation, from various grapevines we come to know. Good.
My concern here is to put forward some literary findings I have laboriously made with the people in mind. It goes without saying that to most of the human problems, vast literature has everlasting solutions. It is because, the writers, not only in our country, but also in other countries wrote volumes and volumes in different genres such as poetry, drama, short stories, novels, prose, biographies, autobiographies, and also letters and travelogues of human significance. In other words, to pass a message to the human beings to tame them with the supreme intention of putting them on the corrective path. Yet, the corrupted man does not heed them.
Ill-gotten money
Due to mad rat race of money, they do not give due attention to morality. Money ruins the society, but total ignorance of man with regard to money, the magnetic effect of this substance drags him into the ditch. AVARICE by George Herbert, and Augustan Poetry led by John Dryden and Alexander Poppe seem enough to rehabilitate the whole world in general and Sri Lanka in particular. It is very discernible in our country today most of the high ups are entangled in a vicious circle that they find it difficult to escape. The eagles on the legal landscape seem to drain away the ill-gotten money of the corrupted elements of the country and the henchmen of the pseudo patriots and the fake leaders give the necessary back up to eyewash the downtrodden masses. Our old red brigade is playing an ugly role to cover up the pestering wounds.
In the meanwhile, a new slogan has invaded the political arena in the name of valiant soldiers. Our soldiers are valiant to the hilt. Their dedication is so great and the writer finds his vocabulary not enough to describe it. It is indescribable.
Yet, The pen is mightier than the sword. The contribution made by the writers in different genres to build this human kingdom is greater than that of the soldiers. You may just imagine that a world without writers is impossible. These soldiers may have read Charge of the light brigade by Alfred Lord Tennyson. It was very recently I read that Winstan Churchil had been reading Pride and Prejudice in wartime.
Patriotic writers
In our country what I have been observing during the recent past is that in almost all the spheres great and unimaginable feats are done, but the vulgar elements of the society grab the credit harping on it. This trend should be arrested and reverted. In numerous news conferences many a speaker that we didnt see during the war time now has become their saviours overnight. The combined effort made by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka with the true dedication of the valiant soldiers is written in letters of gold in the annals of the history of the soil. Yet, our own writers also have contributed a lot to write our history. One day if this commotion of Ranaviru Dadayama would go on unabated orchestrated by some other elements to come to power on their shoulders, our patriotic writers would also come to the Lipton Circle to register their protest and anger.
William Shakespeare has not been profoundly studied as a political analyst, yet a deep study into his drama itself would prove that he was a subtle critic of politics of the day. Hence, prattling on others victories ought not to be the great talk of the pseudo patriots.
It is high time for the common man to have a vigilant eye over the current political scenario of our country.
Share and share alike.

President instructs reduction of  prices of some essential items
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday instructed the relevant officials to take immediate measures to reduce the prices of some essential items to alleviate the burden on the people.
The President told officials to take immediate steps to reduce the prices of rice, big onions, coconuts and potatoes. He also told them to look into the possibility of bringing down the prices of other essential items.
During the meeting held at the Presidents office last evening, the President instructed Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen to import 500,000 metric tonnes of rice and to announce price reductions for all rice varieties sold through CWE (Sathosa) today.
After it transpired during the meeting that private traders sell rice at exorbitant prices with high profits, the President told Minister Bathiudeen to hold immediate talks with traders and take necessary measures to reduce the prices.
The President also directed officials to reduce the prices of big onions and potatoes at CWE outlets from today.
President Sirisena directed Consumer Affairs Authority officials to control the prices of potatoes and big onions after it was revealed that both commodities are imported at Rs.65 or less per kilogramme but are sold at very high prices by private traders for profit.
The President also told the Coconut Cultivation Board officials to organize mobile units to sell coconuts to the public under the purview of the board to bring down the prices as the prices of coconuts had risen sharply in the market due to third party involvement.
The President also told officials to streamline Tender procedures for importing essentials items to ensure a more efficient system.
He also called for the setting up of a Committee involving officials from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Agriculture to review the prices of essential goods on a weekly basis.
The meeting was attended by Ministers Mangala Samaraweera, Rishad Bathuideen, Mahinda Amaraweera, Sujeeva Senasinghe, Eran Wickremaratne and officials from the relevant ministries.

Reasons for inflation in 2017:CBSL clarifies
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has observed media reports highlighting adjustments to the Value-Added Tax (VAT) as the reason for increased inflation in 2017.
The CBSL wishes to clarify the Governors response to a query from the media on the rising inflation in 2017 at the press conference held on the Monetary Policy Review No. 6 of 2017 at the CBSL Head Office.
In his response, the Governor stated that in addition to the adjustments made to the government tax structure, the adverse impact of weather related supply side disruptions, rising international commodity prices and the impact of the base contributed to the acceleration of inflation thus far during 2017.
While the aforementioned factors lie beyond the control of the CBSL, it has maintained a tight monetary policy stance since early 2016, thereby containing demand-driven inflationary pressures and the build up of adverse inflation expectations.

Regarding available facilities in govt. medical faculties:SLMC had maintained a double standard policy: President's Counsel
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva yesterday, informed the Supreme Court that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had maintained a double standard policy regarding the facilities available in the Government medical faculties.
Romesh de Silva PC appearing on behalf of the original petitioner, a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM), told the Supreme Court that Medical Faculty of Rajarata University is facing a lack of facilities including human and physical resources. He further said that neither the SLMC nor the GMOA raised this issue. He reiterated that the SAITM consisted of minimum resources required for a degree awarding institution.
"The SAITM is a degree awarding institution in terms of the University Act. There is nothing wrong with the Court of Appeal judgement," De Silva said.
He contended that the judgement made by the Court of Appeal to register the students of SAITM provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance could not be challenged through this appeal due to the facts presented by the SLMC in the appeal were not sufficient to challenge the order of the Court of Appeal.
Further hearing fixed for September 29.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General informed Court that there was a possibility of a settlement being reached between the parties regarding the issue of SAITM.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the Appeal filed by the SLMC.
Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgement dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgement made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016 by the Court of Appeal.

Ronaldo marks milestone, in-form Kane fires Spurs
Paris: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice on his 400th Real Madrid appearance as the Champions League holders defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-1, while Harry Kane grabbed a hat-trick in Tottenham Hotspur's 3-0 win at APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday.
Gareth Bale struck an exquisite volley as the record 12-time European champions secured an 18th-minute lead at Signal Iduna Park, with the Welshman supplying Ronaldo for Real's second just after half-time.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang poked in Gonzalo Castro's cross to give Dortmund hope, but Ronaldo rifled past Roman Burki to cement a second straight win for Real in Group H and leave the Germans still without a point. AFP
It was the first time Dortmund have lost at home to Real in seven European games while holders Madrid have now scored in 38 successive Champion League games.
Ronaldo, without a goal in his last two outings following his return from a five-match domestic ban, took his Real haul to 411 on what was also his 150th career appearance in Europe.
"Im delighted for Ronaldo and Bale," said Real coach Zinedine Zidane.
"It is difficult to play in this stadium, we have never won here, so this victory was important to us, and the whole game was good for us from start to finish."
England striker Kane notched his sixth hat-trick of the year -- and made it 11 goals for club and country in September -- as Spurs backed up their opening victory over Dortmund with a comfortable win in Cyprus.

Sarfraz, Chandimal look  for new beginning
Abu Dhabi: Rival captains Sarfraz Ahmed and Dinesh Chandimal hope the recent two-match Test series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will give them a new beginning.
Pakistan want to turn the page after the retirement of their two greats Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq while Sri Lanka will look to lift their recent poor showing in the longer format.
Ahmed, who will lead Pakistan for the first time in Tests, is confident that his team will avail the first opportunity.
Obviously, you have two great players who were playing consistently but you have to move on, said Ahmed on Wednesday.
We have to remember the disciplines (of Younis and Misbah) and whatever they told us should be implemented on the field and start afresh, said Ahmed, who has already led Pakistan in one-day and Twenty20 international.
This is my first opportunity as captain in Tests, so I will be up for that challenge and my players are also up to that and are very excited at this prospect.
Pakistan will use experienced batsman Azhar Ali on number three after he opened the innings in the last 12 months and will promote Asad Shafiq from six to four.
We have strengthened our middle order and I am confident that Ali, Shafiq and Babar Azam will be up to the task to complement the batting, said Ahmed, who also has three Test hundreds.
Ahmed said his team will not underestimate the opponents.
Their team looks good, said Ahmed of Sri lanka. They have (Lahiru) Thirimanne and Kushal Silva back so both the teams are young and I think it will be a good series.
Chandimal believes Sri Lanka hves the talent to improve after being thrashed 3-0 at home by India last month.
From that last series we learnt a lot, especially we have done more work on our fitness and fielding. All we need to win is one game and everything will fall into place, said Chandimal, whose team has lost seven of their last nine Tests, including one against Bangladesh.
They also came close to losing to minnows Zimbabwe in July before pulling off a close win.
Chandimal said they can benefit from the retirement of Younis and Misbah.
Actually we can have a very good advantage because the main two batsmen are not there in their batting unit but we will have to step up in our performance as a unit and we have something in our powers to do that.
If Sri Lanka win the series they will rise one place to sixth in Test rankings while Pakistan will go down one place to seventh.
Pakistans series win will keep them on their current spot of sixth. AFP

Serendib Horticulture achieves intl recognition for plant tissue culture
Sri Lankas pioneering tissue culture technology company, Serendib Horticulture Technologies, which completed consultancies in Qatar and Rwanda during the past few years, has now been consulted by companies and foreign governments to introduce new systems and improve existing systems to ensure food security in Pakistan, Iran and Rwanda.
Serendib Horticulture Chairman Dilip de Silva explaining further said that the Sindh government of Pakistan is encouraging the private sector of Pakistan to get into agriculture by implementing public-private partnerships with government institutes.
Production of planting material through tissue culture technology is one such project. Serendib Horticulture will be partnering this project as experts in plant tissue culture to establish a commercial tissue culture lab, engage in capacity building and developing protocols for local fruit crops.
This project is at its pre-operational phase where the designing of the project is done by Serendib Horticulture. Chairman de Silva further stated that employees of Serendib Horticulture will be seconded for the project for training purposes.
Iran, which is highly advanced in tissue culture technology, has consulted Serendib Horticulture to commercialize tissue culture. This is a great honour to the company and to Sri Lanka.
The company has undertaken a contract to transform an existing tissue culture lab into a commercial entity.
Dilip de Silva who has visited Iran on this project will be leading a team of company experts during October to transfer technology and to implement commercial systems, mainly in the area of ornamental plants.
The company has now been hired by another company in Rwanda to establish a biotechnology center with funds from the government and donor agencies. The project will include a commercial tissue culture laboratory and a virus indexing unit. Rwanda which has an abundance of resources for agriculture will be focusing on banana, pineapple, passion fruit and strawberry. The company has already been given a contract to produce over 200,000 plants of Banana and over 4,000,000 plants of pineapple. This is a huge project to produce such a large number of planting material, said Dilip de Silva.
The company has been invited to present the project and the business plan in October, to the Minsters of Agriculture, donor agencies and banks who are supporting the project in Rwanda.
We will be using our experience in the field and will give opportunities to our staff to work and train Rwandan staff to establish a tissue culture facility. In this business you cannot compromise on quality and productivity with low cost options, especially in commercial plant tissue culture. Sri Lanka needs to harness the experience and the expertise available locally to develop agriculture, if not we will always remain a third world country.
The company is now working on expanding its facilities to meet the demand internationally and Serendib Horticulture is hoping to produce over 1.5 million pineapple plants for local farmers in the coming year. (IH)

JUDGES COMMEND CIDs efficiency
Seven accused including Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya of Punguduthivu in 2015 by the Trial- at-Bar of the Jaffna High Court yesterday.

The first and the seventh accused, Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa and Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan were released due to lack of adequate evidence to prove their involvement in the murder.
The Trial-at-Bar headed by Vavuniya High Court Judge Balendren Sashi Mahendran included Jaffna High Court Judge Illancheliyan Manicckavasagar and Trincomalee High Court Judge Annalingam Premashankar.
The second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth accused were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment (RI), with a fine of Rs 40,000 each. They were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.1 million each to the mother of the victim. The court also ordered to extend their prison term by four months if they fail to pay the fine. These convicts will also have to serve another two years if they fail to pay the compensation.
The fourth and the ninth accused were sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, each with a fine of Rs 70,000.They were also ordered the payment of Rs 1 million each in compensation to Vidyas parents.

Judge Illancheliyan Manicckavasagar delivering the verdict emphasized that neither the army nor navy was involved in the abduction, rape or murder of Vidya, as alleged by accused and the defense counsel.
If the navy or army was involved there should be evidence in that connection, but we have got nothing.The CID could only find evidence that were connected to the seven accused and that clearly shows that they carried out the rape and murder, the Judge said.
Judge Illancheliyan claimed that the former Inspector of Police, Kayts who prosecuted, delayed the case and as a result the CID found it hard to find adequate evidence against the accused. Meanwhile, the CID came in for high praise for their efforts in investigating the case speedily and efficiently.
Jaffna High Court Judge Illancheliyan commended the CID officers present in Court, IP Nishantha Silva, ASP Sisira Tissera and their team for their efforts in probing the murder of the rape and murder of the school girl in Jaffna.
DEFENCE TO APPEAL
Defence Counsel Mahinda Jayawardena said he will appeal the judgement and added that he does not see this as the final judgement.
Sri Lankan law was abducted, raped and murdered today, he said speaking to the media yesterday after the final verdict was given by the Jaffna High Court.
MOTHER relieved
Vidyas mother Saraswathy speaking to the media said that she was very complacent about the verdict that was given by the judges and thanked all the people who fought for justice in Vidyas case.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between China and Sri Lanka. The China-Sri Lanka relationship commenced a long time ago when the Pahian Bhikku visited Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Chinese Government assisted Sri Lanka through several infrastructure development projects such as Port City project, Southern Expressway project, irrigation projects, the OPD construction project of the Colombo National Hospital etc. He was addressing the ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo recently to mark the 68th Independence Day of China.
Minister Senaratne said that the Chinese provided Rs. 15 million worth emergency assistance for Sri Lanka's flood victims. China is to provide 2,572 metric tons of rice for the people affected by the drought. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Sri Lanka has increased. This is a plus point for Sri Lanka's tourism industry. A total of 271,577 Chinese tourists arrived in Sri Lanka last year and 162,189 Chinese tourists visited Sri Lanka by July, this year.
The political leaders of China and Sri Lanka toured in each other's countries for decades now.
In 1952, former Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai toured in Sri Lanka and the former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike toured China in 1961 and 1972. Those visits strengthened the bond between the two countries. China won independence under the leadership of great Chinese leader Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, he said.

Sri Lanka in talks for refinery at Hambantota Port

Sri Lanka's agreement to lease the port of Hambantota to a Chinese state-owned enterprise could soon blossom into a much larger economic development strategy.
Sri Lanka is reportedly in talks with two unnamed Chinese firms for the construction of a $3 billion oil refinery near Hambantota a larger investment than the value of the port itself.
The news of the potential refinery deal comes as China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) is closing in on the final agreement for a 99-year lease at Hambantota.
The government has already negotiated most of the financial terms, which will essentially satisfy the nation's debt for the port's construction.
The final signing should take place by the end of October, said chairman of Sri Lanka's ports authority Parakrama Dissanayake in a recent interview.
This timeline would allow CMPH to take over operations at the port as early as November 1.
Hambantota is located right on the busy lane between the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca, putting it in a strategic location for merchant shipping. It has little traffic at present, but some analysts suggest that its potential has not yet been fully realized.
With CMPH's deep resources and connections to the Chinese maritime industry, it could blossom into a busy hub for bunkering, transshipment and vessel repair services, argues Peter Fuhrman, CEO of China First Capital.
"While much of Chinas OBOR policy remains nebulous and progress uncertain, Chinese control of Hambantota seems more than likely to become a world-altering fact," Fuhrman asserted in a recent op-ed.
While it may prove to be a success, the transfer of Hambantota to a Chinese operator is controversial in Sri Lanka and in India, where it is viewed as a strategic liability. It is also controversial at the port itself: over 400 workers went on strike Wednesday to demand continued employment when CMPH takes over.

SriLankan, Foundation of Goodness  partner to uplift local rural communities
Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centre opened in Oddusudan 
In keeping with its theme of Child Empowerment and improving quality of life in rural communities, the 8th Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centre was declared open in Oddusuddan in the Mullaitivu District recently, a joint project of SriLankan Airlines and the Foundation of Goodness.
Making a commitment to the betterment of children and youth empowerment, SriLankan Cares joined hands with the Foundation of Goodness to construct the full-fledged training facility with the intention of developing the lives of underprivileged communities in the Northern Province of the country.
SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias said: We at SriLankan Airlines are extremely proud to lend a hand in securing a brighter future for these aspiring young men and women. Our CSR arm has contributed to a large number of community development activities since its inception in 2003. We are dedicated to improving the areas of health, education and talent of those who do not have the means of accomplishing their dreams. With the Village Heartbeat Project, we are one step closer to making their dreams a reality.
SriLankan Airlines Head of Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility Pradeepa Kekulawala, Chief Founder of the Foundation of Goodness Kushil lGunasekara and SriLankan Airlines Group Medical Officer Dr.Anomi Jayasinghe declare open the Oddusuddan Centre.
Founder/Chief Trustee of the Foundation of Goodness Kushil Gunasekara stated: The Village Heartbeat Project is aimed at benefiting the rural community and alleviating poverty by empowering the youth of rural areas. It has been a wonderful journey working with SriLankan Cares to make this project tangible. Our country is blessed with amazing talent and skill in the rural sector which we continue to harness for the grater development of our Nation. We look forward to working with them in future endeavours.
The Centre was declared open by SriLankan Airlines Head of Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility Pradeepa Kekulawala and Chief Founder of the Foundation of Goodness, Kushil Gunasekara.
Kekulawala also shared his thoughts on the success of the project: SriLankan Cares has always been in the frontline of the country's charity organizations. Children are the rightful owners of our future and they should be given all the support and care that they require to grow into driven citizens who will take this country forward. Sri Lanka has an adolescent population of more than three million. However, greater levels of investment in education and youth training are needed, especially for higher levels of skills and knowledge. Such efforts can contribute towards breaking the root causes of poverty and discrimination and significantly contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka's economy. The energy, creativity and free-spirit of young people can be channelled to make a positive impact in society.
SriLankan Cares raised funding for the construction, equipping and maintenance of the Centre. The Foundation of Goodness provided land in Oddusuddan for the Centre, coordinated its construction and will carry out training programmes and administration functions of the Centre.
In keeping with the three key areas on which SriLankan Airlines CSR is based - health, education and talent - SriLankan Cares ventured into this programme in order to aid aspiring youth in less developed areas to achieve their dreams by providing them with a multitude of facilities. The Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centre consists of a manifold of services ranging from Computer Training, English Classes, Women's Enterprise Courses, Youth and Women's Empowerment Programmes, Trauma Counselling for war-affected children and spiritual training to improve their essence of life. The Foundation of Goodness and the MCC Centre of Excellence played a great role in making the offering of these courses possible.
The Foundation of Goodness has constructed such centres in several locations throughout Sri Lanka through the Village Heartbeat Project.

Stokes included in Englands Ashes squad
LONDON: Ben Stokes was included in Englands 16-man squad for the Ashes tour of Australia announced Wednesday despite his recent arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.
Durham all-rounder Stokes was dropped for Wednesdays fourth one-day international against West Indies at The Oval -- the venue for the Ashes squad announcement after being arrested early on Monday in Bristol.
That followed Englands win in the third ODI in the southwest city on Sunday.
Stokes, 26, remains under investigation after being released without charge.
England national selector James Whitaker later told the BBC that Stokes would remain in his position of vice-captain to Test skipper Joe Root.
The squad contained three uncapped players in 23-year-old Somerset fast bowler Craig Overton, 20-year-old Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who will provide spin support to Moeen Ali, and Surrey wicket-keeper Ben Foakes, 24, included as cover for first-choice gloveman Jonny Bairstow.
Meanwhile there were recalls for middle-order batsmen James Vince and Gary Ballance despite the pairs struggles during their previous Test stints.
Vince was dropped at the end of the 2016 English season northern summer following a poor run of seven Tests that saw him post a top score of 42 in 11 innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
This season Vince is averaging a modest 34.82 in first-class cricket for Hampshire but England believe his game will be suited to Australian pitches.
Ballance only managed 85 runs in two Tests against South Africa at an average of 21.25 before he suffered a fractured finger.
Essex batsman Tom Westley, who failed to convince at number three during this seasons home series against South Africa and West Indies was dropped, while there was no recall for Durham paceman Mark Wood.
Toby Roland-Jones was ruled out following the Middlesex seamers recent stress fracture of the back.
A tour of Australia is the ultimate test for our squad, said Whitaker.
We have provided Joe Root and (coach) Trevor Bayliss with a well-balanced squad with options in all areas.
This has been Roots first season as Test captain, with the Yorkshire batsman overseeing home series wins against South Africa (3-1) and West Indies (2-1).
After a successful summer, having won the Test series against South Africa and West Indies, there is real competition for places and we have selected a squad that will work hard and compete against Australia, aiming to win the Ashes, added former England batsman Whitaker.
Overton has been involved in the England set-up this season with the Lions (A team) and the T20 squad.
He will now get his chance at Test level, said Whitaker.
He has taken 43 Championship wickets this summer and will relish playing in Australian conditions.
The selectors are backing James Vince to make an impact on his recall to the Test squad. He is a quality stroke-player and we believe his game will suit the Australian pitches.
Foakes, widely regarded as one of the best keepers in county cricket, was included after scoring more than 680 runs in the Championship this season at an average of 45.33.
In addition to Australian Baylisss regular staff, the England and Wales Cricket Board also announced Wednesday that former New Zealand paceman Shane Bond had been appointed as a fast-bowling consultant.
England have a vacancy for a bowling coach after Ottis Gibson left to become the new head coach of South Africa and Bond will be with the squad up until the end of the second Test.
Former England one-day captain Paul Collingwood, Stokess captain at Durham, will also take a coaching role during the Test series.
England hold the Ashes after a 3-2 win on home soil in 2015.
But their last tour of Australia saw them suffer a 5-0 Ashes defeat in 2013/14.
Their last Test series triumph in Australia was in 2010/11 when Collingwood was a member of a side captained by current ECB England cricket director Andrew Strauss that won 3-1.
England are due to travel to Australia on October 28, with the first of five Tests set to start in Brisbane on November 23.

England 16-man squad:

Alastair Cook (Essex), Mark Stoneman (Surrey), James Vince (Hampshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire, capt), Dawid Malan (Middlesex), Ben Stokes (Durham), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire, wkt), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), James Anderson (Lancashire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Jake Ball (Nottinghamshire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Mason Crane (Hampshire), Ben Foakes (Surrey, wkt)

Surrey takes lead against Lancashire
LONDON: A fine opening stand from Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns helped Surrey regain the lead against Lancashire, for whom captain Steven Croft scored a century.
Resuming on 17-0 and trailing by 184 runs, Rikki Clarke (3-29) took three wickets as the Red Rose slumped from 68-0 to 75-4 inside six overs. Croft hit a 173-ball 115 to rescue their innings as they posted 268.
However, Surrey took lead again as Stoneman and Burns helped them finish the second day on 79-0, ahead by 12.
Champions Essex are on the verge of ending the season unbeaten after earning a first-innings lead of 116 against Yorkshire at Chelmsford.
Yorkshire, whose survival in Division One was assured on the first day, collapsed to 111 all out in 45.1 overs replying to Essex's 227 all out. Jamie Porter, Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner took three wickets apiece.
The hosts reached 134-2 at the close, leading by 250, with Dan Lawrence and Nick Browne making unbeaten fifties.
Should Essex avoid defeat in this match, they will be the second successive team to win the County Championship title without losing a game.
Middlesex, the 2016 champions, won six and drew 10 of their 16 matches last season, while Essex had nine wins and four draws from their 13 games before their final fixture of 2017.
Promotion-chasing Nottinghamshire ended day two struggling on 108-5 in reply to Sussex's mammoth total of 565 all out.
Notts, who began second in Division Two, will be promoted with five batting bonus points and a draw at Hove.
Centuries from Michael Burgess (146) and Chris Jordan (147), plus a rapid 72 from Jofra Archer, took Sussex past 500 for the third time this season. Stuart Whittingham's 3-37 reduced Notts to 65-5, before Billy Root and Chris Read steadied things until the close.
Worcestershire will go into day three against Durham needing just two points to clinch promotion back to Division One of the County Championship.
After resuming on 90-3 at New Road, the hosts looked like they might miss out on any batting bonus points at 132-5.
But Ravichandran Ashwin (82) and Ed Barnard (75) each hit their county-best score, allied to Joe Clarke's 65.
Having reached 335, the hosts then claimed a bowling point as Graham Clark (60) helped Durham close on 142-5.
Eighteen wickets fell on an eventful second day between Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, whose promotion hopes rely on winning at Grace Road.
Day one was lost to rain but Northants wasted no time in moving the game forward, reducing the Foxes to 26-7.
Ben Sanderson (5-39) and Richard Gleeson (5-49) starred, with Ben Raine (57) the hosts' only major contributor.
Luke Procter (82) gave Northants a solid start but they slipped to 199-8 by the close, leading by 71 runs.
Somerset took a big step towards avoiding relegation from Division One as they dominated day two at Taunton, taking a 253-run lead over Middlesex.
The hosts, who need to win to have a chance of avoiding the drop, dismissed Middlesex for 142, with Jack Leach (4-54) and Craig Overton (3-7) starring. James Hildreth (82 not out) put on 100 with Tom Abell (34 not out) as Somerset recovered to reach 159-3.
Hampshire's prospects of being relegated to Division Two of the County Championship increased significantly as they collapsed against already relegated Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
On a day when rivals Somerset edged into a winning position against also threatened Middlesex, Hampshire were bowled out for 116 - a deficit of 72. That was after earlier allowing their hosts to make 188, having been 28-5.
Glamorgan captain Michael Hogan reached a milestone of 500 first-class wickets in style as he hauled his side back into their game against Kent.
Kent closed day two on 98-6 in their second innings at Canterbury, a lead of 171 over Glamorgan after dismissing the visitors for 229.
Wayne Madsen and Alex Hughes both hit centuries as Derbyshire made 460 against Gloucestershire on day two.
After 70 overs were lost on day one, Madsen (121) and Hughes (142) took control, putting on a 233-run partnership to move the score to 307-3.
It was a day of landmarks for Madsen and Hughes, with the former posting his 25th first-class ton for Derbyshire and passing 10,000 first-class runs in his career, while Hughes' 142 represented a new career-best score. AFP

For tackling and scrum ban in school sport: World Rugby rejects call
World Rugby has rejected extreme and alarmist claims made in a study that calls on scrums and tackling to be banned at school level, with a number of former international players also speaking out against the proposal.
Allyson Pollock and Graham Kirkwood from the Institute of Health at Newcastle University had urged the government to remove the tackle and other forms of harmful contact from school rugby. They argued that removing collision is likely to reduce and mitigate the risk of injury and said governments have a duty to ensure the safety of children.
But World Rugby, the sports governing body, has raised doubts over the data on which Pollock and Kirkwood based their claims, made in the British Medical Journal. World Rugby and its member unions take player safety very seriously and proactively pursue an evidence-based approach to reduce the risk of injury at all levels, a spokesman said.
The continual claims made by Pollock are not based on like-for-like injury statistics and her extreme and alarmist conclusions are simply not supported by the data. It is well documented that, for most sports, injury rates increase with age, but the quoted research mixes 9-12 with 18-20 age groups.
The Rugby Football Union echoed the views with the new chief executive, Steve Brown, saying: Ultimately, the values and quality of our sport far outweigh the risks attached to it through some studies. People play our sport because they want to be physically active. They like the values of the sport, its culture and other stuff that goes with it, the connection it gives people.
I dont think there was anything new in the report. It was stuff that had been out there previously. Its serious business and an important report but for us its not particularly new. What we are constantly doing is developing how the game is played in schools and rugby clubs for young people and making sure that it is safe, that there is appropriate coaching and that people are aware of what they should and what they shouldnt be doing at that important development stage.
Last year, the nations most senior medics rejected a call for a ban on tackling in youth rugby. But Pollock, who has been researching the subject and rugby injuries for more than 10 years, and the senior research associate Kirkwood, have reopened the debate.
We call on the chief medical officers to act on the evidence and advise the UK government to put the interests of the child before those of corporate professional rugby unions and remove harmful contact from the school game, they wrote.
Most injures in youth rugby are because of the collision elements of the game, mainly the tackle. In March 2016, scientists and doctors from the Sport Collision Injury Collective called for the tackle and other forms of harmful contact to be removed from school rugby. The data in support of the call is compelling.
Among the former players to speak out were the World Cup-winning flanker Maggie Alphonsi, who said that the benefits far outweigh the perceived risks. Will Carling, the former England captain, suggested organising children in weight categories, not age as an alternative  a system used previously in New Zealand. Peter Robinson, the father of Ben Robinson, who died at 14 from second impact syndrome following a school game, and who has worked to inspire a change in concussion guidelines, added on Twitter: Banning tackling at schools not the answer. Mismanagement of concussion is the greatest risk in the game. - theguardian

## Title: Test of  the 20th Amendment
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, September 28, 2017 - 01:00
Test of  the 20th Amendment
The governments strategy to counter the JO came in the form of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill. It was passed in Parliament last Wednesday with a two-thirds majority, with 159 votes for and 34 against the Bill. This Bill was first introduced to Parliament in July but was activated in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict on the 20th Amendment. Only the JO voted against the Bill, which was supported by both the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). In a news briefing, JVP parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake maintained that the party has been consistent in its stand that elections to provincial polls should be held on one day to prevent a government exploiting elections and holding them on a staggered basis
The political guessing game that had everyone on tenterhooks as to when Provincial Council elections would-be called, came to an anti-climactic end last week when the government caught the opposition by surprise by enacting legislation that could effectively delay the polls for many months to come.
Early last week, the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was ecstatic. That was because the Supreme Court had determined that the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution required approval not only by a two thirds majority in Parliament but also by the people at a referendum-and the government simply could not risk a referendum on the issue.
Under ordinary circumstances, this would have meant that three provincial councils- in the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central provinces- would stand dissolved by the 1st of October, elections would have to be called by the Elections Commission immediately and polls would have to be held, probably in December 2017 or, at the latest, by January 2018.
The JO saw these elections as a testing ground for their political fortunes. They could have cashed in on the fact that the two ruling parties in the government of National Unity -both the mainstream faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as well as the United National Party (UNP) - were suffering from the burden of incumbency and are not exactly riding a wave of popularity right now.
Besides, because it was a provincial election, its Members of Parliament could have also actively campaigned for the JO or its proxy party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), even though campaigning for a party other than the UPFA or the SLFP could have invited disciplinary action by the mainstream SLFP.
Democratic process of elections
For all the publicity that the JO has generated, it is also mindful of the fact that the brand of politics that it sells- Sinhala nationalism stamped with the Rajapaksa brand name- has been untested at the polls since the January 2015 debacle. The verdict against former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Secretary Lalith Weeratunga could have only detracted from its popularity. So, it was very keen for a contest to gauge its strength and was raring to go.
That is why it summoned the best legal resources at its disposal and challenged the 20thAmendment in the Supreme Court. After the Courts decision was announced in Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the JO was all set to activate its membership in anticipation of an election.
All these plans went into disarray however, as the government launched a retaliatory strike. Critics of the move would argue that it was anti-democratic in that it sought to delay the democratic process of elections. The government counters that, saying its actions to conduct provincial election on the one and the same day for all councils makes practical and financial sense.
The governments strategy to counter the JO came in the form of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill. It was passed in Parliament last Wednesday with a two-thirds majority, with 159 votes for and 34 against the Bill. This Bill was first introduced to Parliament in July but was activated in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict on the 20th Amendment.
Only the JO voted against the Bill, which was supported by both the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). In a news briefing, JVP parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake maintained that the party has been consistent in its stand that elections to provincial polls should be held on one day to prevent a government exploiting elections and holding them on a staggered basis. Ratnayake provided examples of this which occurred during the Rajapaksa regime.
Among the significant changes proposed in the Bill is the reservation of 30 per cent of nominations to females and the demarcation of electoral boundaries. The latter is the factor that will lead to the delay in elections as it requires re-demarcation by a delimitation commission. This was the same issue that led to the postponement of Local Government elections which are now overdue by two years.
With the new Bill being signed into law, the terms of office of the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central provincial councils will not be extended. Instead, they will be administered by the Governors of the respective provinces, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha announced shortly after the new legislation came into effect.
For once, the JO was outsmarted strategically in Parliament. The decision to pursue the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill was taken jointly by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
While President Sirisena was in New York attending sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the two leaders of the government kept the telephone lines busy, discussing developments and talking to minority parties to gain their support for the Bill to ensure a two-thirds majority. Instructions went out to parliamentarians to remain in Colombo for the vote and even saw Colombo district parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra arriving in Parliament with her baby.
The JO, out-manoeuvred by the move claimed the government was not acting in keeping with the spirit of democracy. This government has also openly insulted the judiciary and flouted the Constitution by introducing changes to the provincial council selection law through the back door when the Supreme Court had given a clear ruling that the extension of the terms of the provincial councils or a postponement of elections would require a referendum in addition to a two thirds majority in Parliament, a statement issued under the name of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
Governments resources
The manner in which they changed the Provincial Council election system with just days to go for the automatic dissolution of the first three provincial councils shows that they will do anything to avoid holding elections. Such gross abuse of the law making process has never before been experienced in this country, Rajapaksas statement said.
Rajapaksa attempted to take the moral high ground on this issue and could indeed claim that whatever the deficiencies in his administration, elections were always at hand. However, it must be noted that these elections were conducted mostly during Rajapaksas second term in office when he was extremely popular in the afterglow of the war victory against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
Hence it was politically advantageous to Rajapaksa to conduct those polls and strengthen his stranglehold on power. This, Rajapaksa did in style, holding provincial polls on a staggered basis, concentrating all the governments resources in a few regions.
After one set of polls were secured, that was to have a domino effect on other provinces going to the polls a few months later.
Those in the government point out that although Rajapaksa now cries foul over the postponement of polls, the one province which Rajapaksas UPFA could not secure, the Northern Provincial Council, did not have elections conducted until September 2013, more than four years after the conclusion of the war with the LTTE. Even then, Rajapaksa only reluctantly agreed for the poll to be held, after much diplomatic arm twisting from India and the international community.
Now, Rajapaksa is at the receiving end of a similar strategy from the government. In addition, the UNP and the mainstream SLFP led by President Sirisena worked in tandem in this instance to thwart the plans of the JO.
This, those in the government say, was an eye-opener for politicians in both camps within the government, underscoring the importance of working together.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also noted the significance of co-operation between the two major parties when he presented the draft constitutional reforms to Parliament last week.
Without doubt, he will hope that the success of the governments strategy with the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill will convince both UNPers and SLFPers in government to continue working together as the country faces the challenge of drafting a new Constitutionor, at least, extensively revamping the existing one.
That is the next major hurdle that awaits the government.

USAID awards Rs 97 mn to recycle municipal waste in coastal belt
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on September 25, awarded approximately Rs 97 million ($625,000) to three local organizations to recycle municipal waste in the western coastal belt and Galle district.
The three organizations, Janathakshan, Sevanatha, and the Sri Lanka Centre for Development Facilitation, will help communities partner with local government to prevent improperly disposed of plastic and polythene waste from entering marine environments.
They will also raise awareness and train communities on proper solid waste management. The grants will support partnerships between local government, civil society, and the private sector to create public awareness on proper segregation and reuse of plastics and polythene.
Over the past decades, municipal waste has evolved from a focus on disposal methods to a greater focus on prevention and recycling. USAIDs support will help Sri Lankans expand their efforts and move municipal waste management up the waste hierarchy that includes waste prevention, reuse, recycle, recovery, and disposal, said USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives Andrew Sisson.
USAID funding will be used to help conduct a thorough analysis on what causes the excessive usage of polythene and plastics by businesses such as supermarket chains, restaurants, and hotels.
The project will also evaluate existing efforts on sustainable waste management. Experts will develop a plan for using alternative materials based on the analysis. Additionally, the grants will be used to create livelihood and income generating opportunities such as composting and the sale of recyclable and reusable plastics.

When case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky, two suspects former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera were present in Courts. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
The CID sought a further date to submit the progress of the investigation into the incident. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for November 8.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

Watchful public will lead to more efficient govt. service: Mangala on RTI

As the government celebrated its second Right to Information (RTI) day this year, Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera believed that a morewatchfulpublic will lead the way to an efficient government service.
Previous occurrences around the world has proved that when people have access to information and are watching, the public service is forced to perform, Minister Samaraweera said.
Addressing a workshop organized by the Department of Government Information held today at the Global Towers in Wellawatte, the Minister quoted economist Joseph Stiglitz and his theory of asymmetric information to highlight the need to have the RTI.
Prof Stiglitz says that due to the ability to gain access to information, public officials are forced to inform, which is not otherwise available to the general public. Officials are only able to impose policies on people serving them, he explained. 
When the system of access to and distribution of information is improved, one can minimize the misuse of information by public officials, he added.
The Minister also dismissed allegations that the RTI would simply discourage public officials from carrying out their work due to the fear of censure.
These arguments have been put forward by those who dont want this implemented. We have continuously trained government officials and spoken to them about how they can do their job without breaching any laws and serve the people more efficiently, he said. 
They have also appointed 3,000 Information Officers to government institutions.
The RTI Act which came into force in June of 2016 has since helped many discover information previously not available.
The Minister pointed out that the mother of Roshen Chanaka who was murdered in a protest 2011, was able to get the report on an inquiry because of the RTI.
The report was complete in 2011 and was handed over to the President at the time. But it was not made public until now, said Samaraweera. 
The Minister who stressed that the RTI was one promise made at the election campaign which the government has kept, said they would work to further strengthen it through their Vision 2025.

We dont want a minimum  room rate - GM Hilton Colombo
The minimum room rate introduced for Colombo City hotels by Sri Lanka is a regulation that is highly unwarranted, said General Manager of Hilton Colombo, Mahesh Fernando.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the hotels 30th anniversary celebrations, he said that they dont want any authority dictating terms to them.
Why do you need somebody to tell us what to do with our room raters Let the market sources (demand and supply) decide that, he said.
Fernando, with hotel experience for nearly two decades and having worked all over the world for top brands, said that in most other countries this is not the case.
This is the reason why successful tourism destinations like Thailand, Bali or Singapore dont have a minimum room rate criterion. Imagine what would happen if a country like the Maldives which sells resorts from US$ 180 to US$ 2,000 decides to implement a minimum room rate he asked.
This is rubbish and is killing the industry and indirectly depriving revenue to Colombo City hotels as well.
I think its high time that minimum room rate concept disappears, the Hilton Colombo GM said.
Asked what would happen if a similar class of hotels undercuts the hotels room rates, he said, Let that happen, we are not worried. Our business would still be there. Guests who value brands and our service would still come to us.
Asked to comment on the competition, he said that Colombo Hilton has been in the city for three decades and they dont see it as a threat.
On forward bookings, he said they are very positive. We also see a lot of Sri Lankan expats and their families coming and staying with us, especially towards the end of the year.
He also said that the hotel is now making profits despite an ongoing renovations and payback of some dues. When the renovations are completed by November, the hotel would have 50 suites in an inventory of 380 rooms, GM Fernando said.
With the growth of Sri Lanka tourism and seven new Hilton hotels to be added in Sri Lanka from next year, we are very optimistic of the future.
Commenting on the discouraging of hoteliers to build tall structures on beachfronts, he said that too is a drawback to the industry.
Yes, there are areas that should be left for people to enjoy the scenic beauty. But why not other areas he asked. He said for a major brand to come in they need to have more rooms and for this they have to build high rises.
The cost to build two hotels with lower floors to have around 250 rooms is expensive as one has to find more land. Hence they should be allowed to build at least 15 floors. I think Marriott Weligama has done the right thing to build high.

Weerakkody slams Shivajilingam for demanding international intervention
Minister Chandima Weerakkody, yesterday, condemned a statement made by Tamil National Alliance Provincial Council member M. K. Shivajilingam demanding an investigation in to war crimes in Sri Lanka through an international court.
Minister Weerakkody thumbed down Shivajilingams statement at a media brief held at the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, pointing out that the statement was quite a hideous one.
Minister Weerakkody pointed out that it has done severe damage to the Sri Lankan governments image in the international arena as well as the local reconciliation process.
In a backdrop where the Sinhala Buddhist majority is all set for a reconciliation process, making such a statement is utterly irresponsible, Minister Weerakkody said. Whoever makes such a statement, let it be a Sinhalese, a Tamil, a minister of the government or a member of the opposition, is utterly wrong. It does not matter who made such a statement, but the statement itself, he said.
Minister Weerakkody speaking of Shivajilingams statement pointed out that an internal issue in the country should be taken before the UN or such international organization, only if the victims have no space whatsoever for justice.
But it is not the situation in Sri Lanka at the moment. There is a government fully enforcing the reconciliation process. It has endured democracy and justice. So, instead of making such unbecoming statements, these people should make use of this democracy and call for justice to solve matters within the country itself, Minister Weerakkody pointed out. According to sources, TNA Provincial Councillor Shivajilingam has told the UNHRC in Geneva that since Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka had admitted to the Sri Lankan Army committing war crimes, an investigation is in demand which would be implemented through an international court.
Meanwhile, Minister Weerakkody speaking on Sri Lankas success at the United Nations General Assembly, said UN General Secretary and many other international organizations have ensured President Maithripala Sirisena that Sri Lanka will not have to worry about the security of its War Heroes and political leaders who were at the forefront of winning the war.
UN General Secretary has ensured nothing will be done against Sri Lankas conductsince the present government has re-established democracy and is strongly involved in the reconciliation process, Minister Weerakkody said.
There was a time we spoke of electric chairs. There was a time we feared for our War Heroes and certain political leaders.
"There were times Sri Lankas name was mentioned as having democratic and human rights issues, at UN assemblies. Now, as a country, we should be sincerely happy that Sri Lanka is not presented in such a light anymore, Minister Weerakkody said.
He pointed out that the good governance policies adhered by the government are the main reasons the UN and the international community have confidence in Sri Lanka.

ADB to help develop rooftop solar power systems in SL
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a US$50 million loan to help fund rooftop solar power generation systems in Sri Lanka to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the countrys energy mix.
ADB will also administer a US$1 million technical assistance from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility to help build capacity, increase awareness of stakeholders, and support the projects implementation in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankas energy sector has made tremendous progress over the last two and a half decades in bringing electricity to almost everyone in the country, said Mukhtor Khamudkhanov, an ADB Principal Energy Specialist. But there is a need to diversify the countrys energy mix toward more renewable and sustainable sources.
Sri Lankas electrification rate stood at 99.3% in 2016 compared to just 29% in 1990, showing steady progress in improving access to electricity. However, the country remains highly dependent on fossil fuels.
In 2016, thermal power contributed 67.2% of the total power generation compared to hydropowers 24.6% and 8.2% of nonconventional renewable sources. This dependence on carbon-emitting energy sources makes Sri Lanka vulnerable to fluctuating fuel prices, while hampering the governments efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% as part of its commitment to the Paris agreement.
ADBs Rooftop Solar Power Generation Project will boost access to clean and reliable power in Sri Lanka. Specifically, the project will finance rooftop solar power subprojects equivalent to additional capacity of 50 megawatts while building capacity and awareness of relevant authorities, private sector partners, and customers. It will also develop a market infrastructure and bankable pipeline of subprojects for the solar power systems through greater cooperation with private financial institutions and the establishment of technical guidelines and standards for the system.
Total cost of the project is US$59.8 million, to which the private sector will provide a US$9.8 million equity contribution. The projects expected completion date is the end of 2021.

Meanwhile, renovation of the Karadikulam and Padarakal irrigation tanks in the Addalaichenai DS Division is nearing completion, Mayooran said.
About Rs. 10 million will be spent on the reconstruction of these tanks under the Addalaichenai irrigation unit in the Akkaraipattu irrigation region under the Climate Resilience Improvement Project, he further said. By rehabiliting these tanks, about 750 acres of paddy lands could be cultivated during both Yala and Maha seasons.

Arrest Rohingya refugee  attackers - Minister
Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday called for the arrest of the mob of monks who attacked a Rohingya safe house on Tuesday (26).
Regardless of whether they are clergy or not, action needs to be taken, he said addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing. He also asked that the IGP investigate into the actions of police officers who stood by and failed to control the mob.
The 31 Rohingya refugees who have been transferred to the Boosa army camp for safety after the attack had been housed in a two storey building in Mount Lavinia by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) until their application for asylum to other countries are processed.
This is not the first time we have had Rohingya in the country. They first came here in 2008. Where were the monks then They had no problem then because Rajapaksa was in power,, the minister said.
In March 2008, 55 Rohingya refugees were rescued off the coast of Mullaitivu. Having been taken into Sri Lankan custody, in July 2008, they were released to the care of the UNHCR. By 2012, they had found asylum in the US and left the shores of Sri Lanka. In February 2013, the Navy rescued another two boat loads of 170 Rohingyas from the Eastern coast. By 2015 November, they too had been resettled in the US and Canada.
In April this year, the Navy rescued 30 refugees, among them was a pregnant woman, they had already been registered as refugees in India when they arrived. In August, they were housed in Ratmalana rented by the UNHCR through its partner organization Muslim Aid.
The government of Sri Lanka which is party to the 1951 Refugee Convention is bound by the principle of non-refoulement which states that, No refugee shall be returned to any country where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Sri Lanka has over two million of its people living as asylum seekers or refugees outside of this country.Those countries have given them shelter and work. And our people here are attacking 30 people, Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the Emigrants and Immigrants Act of 1948 does not enable asylum seekers or refugees to be granted citizenship or permanent residence in the country.
As a Buddhist I am very disappointed by such animalistic acts.The Buddhas vision was to protect the persecuted.The problem here is that Buddhists have become Sinhala Buddhists, Minister Senaratne said.
In reply to allegations made by opposition MPs that the children of refugees have been given access to local schools, Minister Jayasekara said it was the governments responsibility to extend basic human rights to those who live in the country, a fundamental principle of Buddhism.

B e s t Royal wedding g o w n s
A royal wedding isn't just a union between two people and their families. It's a national and sometimes an international affair that attracts throngs of well-wishers, close media attention, and high-profile guests all hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple.
The Duchess of Brabant
Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz married Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant in 1999. The wedding was held in December and included plenty of movement - to the Brussels Town Hall for the civil wedding, and then to the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula for the religious wedding, and then on to the reception - so a winter coat dress was called for. The coat was a silk crepe design with a tall collar and long sleeves. At the front, it closed with buttons and a trim line around the waist. The coat covered a simple sheath dress beneath.
Princess Claire
When British-born, Belgian-raised Claire Coombs married Prince Laurent (son King Albert and Queen Paola), the simple elegance of her dress won the day. Just as he designed her sister-in-law Princess Mathilde's triumph, NATAN's Edouard Vermeulen designed this dress for Claire. Claire wore the same antique veil as Mathilde, but here, Vermeulen accentuates the lace on the veil by adding an overlay bodice made of Chantilly lace from Calais.
Crown Princess Mette-Marit
This is a wedding dress you might not like at first. At first, it might seem way, way too simple, too bland, not enough sparkle. But just keep looking at it - eventually, it will hypnotize you. Designer Ove Harder Finseth collaborated with Mette-Marit on this surreal, dream-like interpretation of the fashions first worn by Queen Maud of Norway. The dress itself was created from thick custom-dyed ecru silk crepe and 125 meters of silk tulle. The two meter long train on the dress was unusually shorter than the silk veil, which was a whopping six meters long - nearly 20 feet! Such a veil does take a bit of management.
Diana, Princess of Wales
Diana wore an ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown, with a 25-foot (7.62 m) train, valued then at 9000. It became one of the most famous dresses in the world and was considered one of the most closely guarded secrets in fashion history. The dress was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who described it as a dress that "had to be something that was going to go down in history, but also something that Diana loved", and which would be "suitably dramatic in order to make an impression".
Princess Margaret,Countess of Snowdon
This was also the first royal wedding ever televised, and was watched by over 300 million viewers worldwide, so her effect on ushering in the sleek styles of the 1960s could very well have stretched far beyond the royal family. Her dress was a white silk organza with a satin-bound silk tulle veil and not a stitch of embroidery in sight. The whole design was made to accommodate the princess's short stature, including the tiara.
Sarah, Duchess of York
Despite a wedding that took place in the midst of high 1980s fashion, this dress managed to eschew most trends in favor of an extremely flattering, classic design. Of all of the dress' elements, the only item that has fallen prey to the passing of time is the slight shoulder pouf of the sleeves. Designer Lindka Cierach didn't have an enviable task, working with Sarah Ferguson. The bride had a particular fondness for whimsical motifs, most especially bows.
Princess Maxima
Princess Maxima has her fair share of hot mess appearances, but when she gets it right, few can surpass her. In this Valentino couture gown, Maxima was at the top of her game. The dress was made of ivory Mikado silk. It was an excellent material selection; despite the fact that the wedding included lots of movement not a wrinkle was to be found.
The Duchess of Cornwall
She enlisted the design help of Robinson Valentine for her 30-years-in-the-making big day. For the civil service, they created a delicate cream silk chiffon dress and with a detail of woven disks made in Switzerland at the hem. Over that, she wore an oyster silk basket weave coat featuring herringbone embroidery. At her lapel, a Prince of Wales feather brooch. Beige shoes from LK Bennett, a purse from Launer, and headgear from Philip Treacy rounded out the look.
Princess Grace
Helen Rose from MGM's costume department was recruited to design the royal wedding gown. Rose used rose point lace on the bodice, veil, train insert and prayer book; Valenciennes lace for the skirt support and ruffled petticoat; and taffeta for the skirt. The dress was quite uniquely constructed.
Queen Anne-Marie
The Jrgen Bender dress isn't complicated: the gown is relatively unadorned - the lace detail on the skirt is hard to pick up - so the waist and the sleeve length are running the show here. And this has to be about the most perfect sleeve length ever.

Children benefitting through Parental Reproductive Health: Way of the uncut diamond
October 1st is the World Children's Day and coincidentally, also the Elder's Day. In the year 1924, the League of Nations, currently known as the United Nations (UN) made a universal declaration titled Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Sections of the Declaration were extended with many improvements from time to time by the UN, and was duly adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1959. This Declaration was followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN in 1989, to which Sri Lanka subscribed in 1991.
The basic concepts of the Declaration emphasise on the benefits that should be accrued to the child in many ways for his/her development. Some of them are:
a. Promoting mental and physical development,
b. Feeding the hungry, nursing the sick, helping the backward, reclaiming the delinquent, sheltering and providing succour for the orphan and the waif,
c. Prioritising for relief,
d. Protecting against exploitation,
e. Recognising talents and lending support to enhance them.
In the family context, all these and many more become the first and the last responsibility and the bounden duty of the parents towards their children, irrespective of the number of children in the family. The most vital requisite to enable parents to discharge such responsibility towards their children is their sustained status of general health.
General health of a family, in its simplest definition, is the well-being of the father, mother and their children in all aspects of their life, be it hygienically, economically, socially, environmentally or else-wise and most significantly in the context of a family's close positive relationships. Primarily it is a fundamental human right for all - which include parents - to attain the highest level of general health. It is, also a valuable social and economic imperative, because the physical energy and the mental capacity the parents derive through sound general health are the driving forces that help in the progressive development of their children. It is common knowledge that mentally sick and physically ailing father or/and mother will guide their children too to the same style of life.
Reproductive system
Among the long list of elements that comprise general health, the concept of Reproductive Health (RH) is the most important component, according to World Health Organization (WHO). It says, RH is the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being in all matters related to the Reproductive System, and to its functions and processes in the body of a male and a female. RH is definitely not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Thus, parents with ill-functioning or mal-functioning Reproductive System will not be able to enjoy the said state of complete well-being, which in turn will affect the growth and the progress of their children. Hence, knowledge about RH and accessing services related to RH should be the top-most priority in the life of a father or a mother with children.
Reproductive Health issues are related to the fulfillment of the joys of a family life and the avoidance of risks that hamper the prospects of development of the children. Good RH promotes the opportunity to have the desired children by the parents and to eliminate chances of unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. Besides, it contributes enormously to physical and psychosocial comfort and closeness of the husband and wife, thereby enhancing the happiness of their children as a family unit. On the other hand, poor RH is frequently associated with diseases, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, exploitation, and even death, all of which reflect serious implications on the children.
Knowledge on RH helps parents to decide freely and responsibly the number of children they desire, spacing and timing of the arrival of their children free of discrimination, coercion and violence - an important factor which brings proven benefits to the children already living and to those to be born. The Interactive Population Centre, a renowned organisation promoting RH knowledge, says The neglect of reproductive health and the lack of its awareness are the main causes of many family problems. This is clearly evident from what takes place everyday in the country and as reported in media, in the form of gender-based violence, HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, teenage pregnancy, abortions, and abandoned children.
In terms of the female partners in families, failure to access RH information and services by every third such partner in the world has made her incapable of making decisions in regard to her private life behaviour, which lead her to unsafe practices and negative consequence and bad RH status reports the WHO. It further states, Yet, this does not signify that male partners are free from similar problems. On the contrary, they are advised to pay more attention to their role in RH, taking into consideration that they can be carriers of various infections and problems of the same type. They too, therefore, need to access RH information and services along with their wives, This again is a clear indication that both parents in a family should invariably follow best practices in HR, if they are to provide positive benefits and comprehensive support towards the growth of their children.
Decision-making in RH matters
Between the spouses, RH concerns and needs of the husband are of lesser serious nature than those of the wife. But he has particular roles and responsibilities in terms of the RH of his wife, because of the reliance the wife places on him for decision-making in RH matters, which also impacts the developmental needs of their children. He is, therefore expected to be involved up-front in the promotion of RH knowledge and best practices in the family for themselves and as a supporter of his partner, by encouraging and enabling her to access RH services. Such involvement will help both partners to share responsibility for family health, which includes the health of the children as well.
Sound RH of the parents is a central feature of the general health of a family. It is a reflection of the health of children during childhood, and crucial during adolescence and adulthood, and sets the stage for health beyond the reproductive years for both men and women, and affects the health of even the next generation, states the UN Population Information Network.
This reveals that the health of the new born is largely a function of the mother's health based on her RH status, and how important it is during her reproductive years and throughout the lifespan of all children in her family, irrespective of their number. In other words, failure to address the RH problems at any stage of life of parents sets the scene for later health and developmental problems, not only for the husband and wife, but even for their children and their generations.

Citizen's Mail [28.09.2017]
Can you categorize missing persons
After eighteen months a belated gazette has been signed. This means, that this country has acknowledged, that persons have gone missing, and must be accounted for. To us the ordinary citizens all persons who have gone missing must be investigated and their final fate must be made public.
It is universally accepted among civilised, democratic nations, that no person must be involuntarily lost or missing. But how come, our learned lawyer prime minister said recently, that the organisation of missing persons will only investigate persons missing from the date of signing the gazette.
If so, this gazette is not necessary, since under the good governance no disappearances have taken place. He seems to have forgotten that this whole exercise of missing persons was initiated after the civil war ended.
This was an essential component in the UN declaration. The problem with the Sri Lankan politicians is that since 1948, they are accustomed to placate its citizens here and there.
This has led to the mistrust of the people particularly the minorities and the divisions are getting farther than closer.
But they are believing that their rhetoric day in and day out, by showing a few minorities here and there, holding hands and by distributing Cabinet positions, and positions in the government service will automatically resolve all minority issues, which is simmering and someday, they will rise to get back what they believe, as lost.

'Closure of Deduru Oya bridge will not affect bus commuters'
The proposed closure of the Deduru Oya bridge for urgent repairs will not bring any injustice to bus commuters on the Nikaweratiya Kurunegala route, said the operations superintendent of the Nikawaratiya SLTP depot.
He said steps have
been taken to stop buses of either side of the
bridge and to provide connecting buses to the destination after getting commuters to walk across the bridge.
He added, if this operation is to be a success, the RDA should erect a pedestrian crossing along the bridge.
However, the Wayamba Provincial RDA Directress said the bridge had still not been closed for repairs utpo September 27 morning.
The delay in effecting repairs to the bridge would cause added problems with the onset of heavy rains.
However, authorities had a duty and responsibility to complete the renovation work in time for the December GCE Ordinary Level examination.

ComBank innovates with FastPay mobile payment option
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched its own mobile payment option, enabling accountholders to make instant cash-less transactions via the Banks existing mobile banking app, through a simple and innovative mobile payment option.
FastPay links Commercial Bank accountholders who use the Banks mobile banking app with point-of-sale terminals of vendors who use the Banks online banking service, enabling the accountholders mobile phones to be used like debit cards to access funds in their bank accounts.
This elegantly hassle-free and secure payment system allows a customer to make purchases and inform the cashier at the retail outlets that he or she wishes to pay via FastPay.
The cashier then enters the customers mobile phone number and the platform generates a notification to the customers mobile phone and the transaction is completed when the customer authorises payment from his phone.
This is once again a simple easy-to-use feature made possible through technology, Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan said. At Commercial Bank, we are constantly looking for ways to make financial transactions more convenient, safer and as inclusive as possible. FastPay will enable cash-less and card-less payments even in remote areas where card payments are less common.
This new payment option will initially be available at the Barista outlet at the World Trade Centre, Cafe Mocha - Gandhara and Barista outlets at Laksala premises at Thunmulla, Bambalapitiya, Peradeniya and the National Museum. Customers who use FastPay for payments at Barista during the launch period up to end of November 2017 would receive a 50% discount on the total bill value, the Bank said.
Merchant outlets offering the FastPay option to their customers will receive their money in their accounts when the customers accounts are debited at the end of each transaction and the sales proceeds can be viewed on the same day through the Banks online banking facility.
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for seven years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 256 branches and 695 ATMs in Sri Lanka.

CTSU accuses Education Minister over 'politically-driven' appointments
Politically-driven recruitment made by the Education Minister in the education sector has resulted in a major crisis within schools, the Ceylon Teachers Service Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the Education Minister has given 2,000 non-academic appointments at national schools across the country based on political influence without following a proper and transparent recruitment process.
Most of these recruitments are from the Kurunegala district, especially from Kuliyapitiya.
These employees do not even obey the Principals and work on their own agendas in schools. This has created a lot of administrative problems at schools. There are over 3,886 vacancies for sports teachers island-wide. However, attempts are being made to recruit non-academic individuals as Sports Instructors who have not even passed G.C.E.O/L. Since these people come to work on school grounds after 1.30 pm, who will be held responsible for what happens during that time, Jayasinghe questioned. He said CTSU vehemently condemns the use of schoolchildren to hold a 2.5 mile long bridal veil in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record. We urge authorities to conduct a transparent and impartial investigation, and reveal the responsible parties of this incident, he added.

Cultural Core
She has taken Sri Lankan culture to the world. Young, concerned and full of ideas Julia Wijesinghe wants to make a difference. She has been bestowed with the title of Young Ambassador for Sri Lankan Cultures by the US Embassy in Sri Lanka for her exceptional effort in showcasing Sri Lankan history, culture and values to the world.
The founder of the first Sri Lankan museum in the world which is outside Sri Lanka, Julia began her unique venture when she was merely 18 years old.
My inspiration comes from the goals and dreams that I have aspired to achieve since I was 15 years old. My parents, Lakruwana and Jayantha Wijesinghe, have done a lot for the Sri Lankan community, including opening the first Sri Lankan restaurant in USA, in New York City. As a result of seeing them take pride in their culture, it inspired me to do something on my own to represent my country as well. Although I was raised in the States, my parents took me to Sri Lanka every year.
This gave me the opportunity to experience Sri Lankas historic sites and its rich heritage, Julia explained adding that her aim in opening Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY was to safeguard Sri Lankan tradition and not let it fade.
She has laboured three years to turn her dream into a reality. Finally her efforts paid off as the museum opened doors to the public on March 27. Since New York is a cultural melting pot, Julia needed to put on her thinking cap to organise the museum in a manner so that it stood out and lured visitors. The task was no cake walk. You need to know what you are representing and you need to possess a thirst for knowledge to carry off the task.
I learnt many things about Sri Lanka during my visits and from reading books. I met the Veddas, and tried to learn their language. The first historical place I went to in Sri Lanka was the Kelanyia Temple. It is very special to me because my parents got married there.
Then I started to travel to places like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and other historic sites. When I went to these places I wanted to learn more so I would question everything. Gathering all the artifacts and artwork that I required was a challenge indeed. All this would not have been possible without my fathers help. He has set up a foundation to help young school children in Ratnapura too. He is obsessed with antiques and whenever we visit Sri Lanka we would go somewhere new. I always look forward to my visits to Sri Lanka. I also collect more items for my museum there, Julia mused.
Julia is studying at The College of Staten Island In New York, majoring in computer science. Due to her studies the Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY is open only on weekends. Weekends are a treat for visitors because they get to experience Sri Lankas rich heritage with a tour of the museum with Julia as well as a chance to indulge in traditional Sri Lankan food at the restaurant buffet.
A lot of people see me as the leader of Sri Lankan cultures to the world. I was featured in The New Yorker Magazine too. I have had positive feedback from Sri Lanka as well because they feel proud of me because I have shared Sri Lankan heritage with the world, Julia said.
The museum which is combined with Lakruwana restaurant, comprises of many artifacts like Buddha statues (replicas and originals), ceremonial weapons, musical instruments, cooking implements, temple objects, a rubber-tree log, gemstones, and statues of Hindu deities like Krishna and Ganesha. Books about Vaddas and Sri Lankan rituals make up the small library. Paintings done with kithul and a collection of ayurvedic medicial masks adorn the walls. There is a special section for tea and coconut exhibits. Julia says that the most popular piece in the museum is the sculpture of the Buddha during his seven-year penance which is sculpted using metal junk. She says that she wishes to add some ola leaf manuscripts (puskola poth) to her collection.
Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY represents every religion and culture of all the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka.
Our culture is unique in a lot of aspects, whether it is the food we eat or the way our families are. There is one thing in Sri Lanka that no other country has. We may be a small country on the map, but our culture and history are diverse and fascinating. I have always believed in unity, and I know a lot about other religions as well, Julia noted.
She is also passionate about dancing. She does a lot of natya kathak and Bharathanatyam. She used to do ballet but now trains in Kandyan dancing.
My future plans are to excel in computer science and have a job in that position. The most important thing is to continue with my museum and share our Sri Lankan pride with the world to signify how awesome we are as Sri Lankans. I wish to bring my museum to a bigger place and make it a landmark. I am keen on spreading awareness and letting the world know where we stand, Julia opined.
Her message to Sri Lankan youth at home and across the world is to care for each other and unite as a family.
We need to show the world what we are made of. You should always muster a smile and bring light to anyone you see because you never know when youll make someones day even brighter, she added with a smile.

To discuss 20A: PM ready to meet lawyers
*BASL upholds govt call to hold elections in January
 *Wants to ensure legislature follows proper ratification process on Bills
Upon learning of the concerns of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) regarding the ratification of the 20th Amendment and its agenda and being informed that the BASL Lawyers were trying to get a discussion with the President and Prime Minister about it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had on Sunday, informed the BASL higher-ups that he would soon announce a date for a meeting with them. Addressing a press briefing held at the BASL premises at Hultsdorf in Colombo, BASL President U.R. de Silva yesterday, said they have uncertainties regarding the ratification process of the 20 A with reservation whether it underwent a proper procedure inconsistent with the Constitution prior to being law. The 20th Amendment also touches on the provision to hold elections for all Provincial Councils the same day.
We consider the BASL that it is a positive stance taken by the government to hold elections in January next year, as they have announced already, he said.
We were planning to get a sit down with the President and Prime Minister to discuss this when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed us on Sunday night that he would provide us with an opportunity of a meeting with him and the leaders of political parties, he said.
We are thankful to the Prime Minister for this move, he said
If during a discussion with the President and Prime Minister that we could be satisfied with the appropriate procedures followed in the process of ratification of Bills, while there would be no conflict of views to be generated, he said.
The BASL is going to stand by the rights of franchise of the public and needs to make sure that these rights are well preserved, he said.
Silva admitted that the BASL could not do anything once a Bill become law in Parliament, but said: It appears that at some point the line seemed to have been crossed in the case of establishing the 20 A .

Dogs Have Feelings  Here's How We Know
Q: Only a decade ago, the idea that dogs and other animals had feelings would have been laughed at. Tell us about your work with MRIs and what it can tell us about the emotional lives of our best friend.
A: About five years ago I got this crazy idea to see if I could train my own dog to go into an MRI to see what she was thinking and whether she reciprocated any feelings I have for her.
Callie is a black terrier mix, adopted from one of the local shelters here. She had no particularly defining traits other than she was high energy and very curious, like many terriers are.
I teamed up with a local dog trainer and worked through the details of how to go about training a dog to go in the MRI. The first thing we did was build an MRI simulator in my home and get her used to the very loud sounds these machines make. I recorded the sounds of the magnets and played them at home, at low volume, while I played a game with her, gradually increasing the volume to the real level. It took about 2 to 3 months, working mostly by trial and error. But it turned out to be easier than I thought it would be.
We started with simple things, like teaching her a hand signal that meant she would get a treat and another that meant no treat. When we did that, we were able to observe activity in the reward pathways of her brain indicating that the technique worked.
Encouraged by our success with Callie, we put out word to the dog community here in Atlanta that we were looking for volunteers to participate in this project.
We began holding MRI classes every Sunday. People would bring their dogs in and wed give them mock-ups of the MRI to take home for practice. Within a year we had a team of close to 20 dogs.
With that many participants, we started doing much more interesting, complicated things in the scanner, like asking how their smell system works, how they recognize people and their household by their own scent.
Scientists find it hard to accept the idea that animals have feelings. Most people who live with dogs understand this intuitively. The confusion comes because we have language and can label those feelings. We have words for things like love, fear, sadness, or guilt. Everything we started doing to elicit positive emotions showed that dogs had corresponding parts of their brains to humans.
Q: You suggest that there are striking similarities between dogs and humans in both the structure and function of a key brain region: the caudate nucleus. Unpack that idea for us.
A: The caudate nucleus is a structure common to all brains, particularly in mammals, which we know to have the richest density of dopamine receptors. Dopamine used to be thought of as a pleasure neurotransmitter but its much more complex than that.
The caudate nucleus is active when an individual is in a state of anticipationsomething happens and they have to decide what to do with that information. Its particularly strong when that information is in positive domains. You see something, you want to approach it, maybe consume it.
When we see this structure active in dogs, we can interpret that they are experiencing something important to them and something they like. This is completely analogous to what happens in human brains under the same conditions.
Obviously dog brains are not the same as humans. One big difference is in the size. A dog brain is about the size of a lemon, at best, if its a big dog. Theres not the same real estate in there, so they cant do some things we can do. - National Geographic

Du Plessis welcomes  DRS rule change
Potchefstroom: South African captain Faf du Plessis on Wednesday welcomed a change to the decision review system that will come into effect for the first time in the first Test against Bangladesh starting at Senwes Park on Thursday.
The change in the DRS system is one of several changes to playing regulations made by the International Cricket Council, including a restriction on bat sizes and a provision for players to be sent off the field for serious misconduct.
Teams will no longer lose a review for a leg before wicket decision if television replays show umpires call  a provision for umpires to have discretion on close decisions. Previously an unsuccessful review meant losing one of two opportunities for challenges in Test matches.
The umpires call is a very good change, said Du Plessis. The system is there to back up the umpire but if you ask for a review and have made the right call (on whether the ball is shown to be hitting or missing part of the stumps) at least you get it back.
Another change to the regulations is that reviews will not be re-set after 80 overs as in the past. AFP

'Education sector will see radical changes in the near future'
Steps have been taken to create a radical change in the Education Sector within the next three years, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Concurrent to the nine main subjects, 26 new subjects have been introduced for students who fail the GCE Ordinary Level examination. These vocational subjects will carry them forward not only to advanced level, but for university education as well. The pilot project of this programme will be started in 42 schools from October 2. All students who cannot proceed to Advanced Level would be provided with technical education within their schools themselves. Steps have already been taken to provide computes to all schools above grade 6 level. Similarly, Information Technology will be made a compulsory subject, he said.
Minister Kariyawasam was addressing a meeting after opening a new administration building costing Rs. 50 million at Matale St. Thomas College, recently.
Minister Kariyawasam said opponents were accusing them of destroying free education. "Would the government provide insurance cover upto over Rs. 500,000 to schoolchildren numbering 4.5 million if it was intent on destroying free education" he said.
A student would be paid Rs. 1,000 per day if he or she obtained treatment in a government hospital and upto Rs. 100,000 in case of a private hospital.
Minister Kariyawasam said English text books would be provided in respect of grades 1 and 2 from next year. Another new 15,000 teacher appointments would be made before the end of this year. Already 4,000 principals had been appointed.
A group of 852 administration-grade principals had also been appointed. Applications would be called soon to fill all existing vacancies in the education sector by December this year. Agriculture State Minister Vasantha Aluvihare, Parliamentarians Ranjith Aluvihare and Matale Zonal Director of Education Mahinda S. Yapa were also present on the occasion.

Embarrassment of Riches
For the photographer Tina Barney, proximity to, and membership in, the upper class has come to define her body of work chronicling the life of the patrician set. Her images, taken over some forty years, are at once a choreographed glimpse into the lives of the leisure class and candid meditations upon universal themes of family. Barneys recently published an eponymous monographwith an introduction by Peter Galassi, the former curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Artcomes at a time when economic inequality is at the forefront of peoples minds. 
Here, she reflects on the critical reception of her work, the importance of time in her photographs, and the role of family in creating them.
INTERVIEWER
Youve noted many times in past interviews that youve never consciously set out to photograph the upper class. You were, in your words, photographing family and friends. How do you respond to those who discuss your work within the context of wealth, of social status
BARNEY
I never really think about it. Its the viewer, the writer, the critic, who puts that subject matter on me. Its almost not interesting for me to talk about it, but then, people are so fascinated by it that I guess it must be interesting. My fascination is with the repetition of traditions and rituals. The idea that families, no matter where they come from, kind of do the same thing. They get up, they make breakfast, they go to school, they come back, they have Christmas, they have Halloween.
INTERVIEWER
Where do your photos fit within the climate of America today versus when you were exhibiting them in the eighties It seems to me that the eighties embraced wealth, and that that attitude changed after the 2008 financial crisis.
BARNEY
Lets just say its not the tools that are different, its the props.
INTERVIEWER
Perhaps, because of the intensive setup involved in shooting on large format, your images possess a tension between the composed and the candid, the staged and the spontaneous.
BARNEY
You got it. Theyre kind of sloppy. Really, if you go back and look at images from the eighties, there are so many photographic mistakes that most people wouldnt keep, and thats the differenceI would leave the mistakes. I think thats why they look unpretentious and believable.
INTERVIEWER
Speaking of timing, your photographs seem to exist in this perpetual summer.
BARNEY
Thats because its the best time to photograph, right
INTERVIEWER
Youve said before that when you first began taking pictures, you photographed what was in front of youyour family. But why have you continued to photograph them
BARNEY
I felt I hadnt finished answering a question. It just kept on getting more interesting. The deeper I went, the more interesting it became. Its like a drug. I just cant stop. I could go on forever and ever. I could keep photographing. I havent finished yet. It just isnt finished.
INTERVIEWER
How do you see your images connecting with millennials, with the younger generation
BARNEY
I have absolutely no idea. I hadnt thought about it. I have a terrible feeling, because I mentor at the School of Visual Arts, that people that age already dont really care about my photographs. I think theyre interested in things that go fast, and in otherworldly experiences.
INTERVIEWER
If you ask me, Newport, Rhode Island, can be otherworldly, too. Last questionwhy do you prefer printing your images in such large format
BARNEY
In my big prints, I want everybody to be able to see the detail of the quality in the pictures. Of course, my photographs arent monumental at all when you compare them to the other things happening in photography now. But back in the eighties, it was a big deal. And for me, it was in order to see more. Thats all I wanted to do.

## Title: Facebook, Hamlet and Isis
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, September 28, 2017 - 01:00
Facebook, Hamlet and Isis
It was 10 pm when word came from the Zarari familys neighbours: Isis was launching a book raid on their street. The family convened in their living room, grouping around the dark wooden shelves that contained dozens of banned volumes. In this moneyed quarter of Mosul, each of them had a different vice to hide. For Said, the head of the household, it was his copy of The Game of Nations  Miles Copelands controversial treatise on his time with the CIA. For his wife Asma  like Said, a lawyer  it was her legal texts.
Their twenty-five-year-old daughter Hasna was a graduate in English literature. She would die if the militants found her copies of Hamlet and Wuthering Heights. Particularly, she reflected, because one of them featured a picture of the handsome British actor Tom Hardy on the cover.
Philosophy texts
Her elder brother Hakam, a PhD candidate in physical chemistry, reasoned that Isis would not object to the leather-bound copy of his thesis on the theoretical study of critical packing parameters of hydrotropes using DFT theory and QSAR calculations, a highly complex examination of the way that certain surfactant compounds fit together. But he had a guitar hidden on top of the ceiling panels by his wardrobe. If discovered, it would lose him his head.
The family were faced with the decision of whether to risk their lives for the sake of some books. First, they decided to burn them all. But as they emptied the shelves, a sense of regret stole over them. Armed with shovels, they went into the garden and buried the ones they couldnt bear to lose. Arabic philosophy texts went into the ground wrapped in black plastic bags, alongside Robinson Crusoe and Twelfth Night. Tom Hardys chiselled features were soon obscured under a foot of soil, the lawn patted flat on top.
The next day, Said waited until lunchtime to set fire to the remaining books which they had piled up in the garden. Clouds of smoke choked the neighbourhood. Dozens of tomes on philosophy, law and ethics glowed under the hot sun. The quarter in which the Zararis live is one of Mosuls wealthiest  home to government officials, traders and top-tier professionals. It is Mosuls Belgravia, and like its London equivalent, its inhabitants usually live a life set apart from the citys harsh reality.
But when Isis swept through Mosul in 2014, many of the Zarari familys neighbours fled. They believed that life in the city, Iraqs second largest, would be impossible under the militants harsh brand of Islamic law, in which women had to cover even their fingertips and men were lashed for smoking. The Zararis, however, decided to stay at home and weather the crisis. Their house, on two floors, contains a dozen rooms, all packed with paintings and crocheted hangings. They would be comfortable there. Besides, they were used to danger. Even before the arrival of Isis, Mosul was a very dangerous place, in which car bombings, assassinations and kidnappings were commonplace. If they kept to the rules and didnt venture too far, they reasoned, they could avoid the worst of what Islamic State threatened. But month by month, the rules became stricter, and living conditions worsened for everyone. Electricity and water were cut off or were in sporadic supply. The streets were lawless.
Packing parameters
When they lost their books, the family foundered. Hakam tried to study. But the internet had been inaccessible for months, and anyway the electricity was intermittent. Even the theoretical study of the critical packing parameters of hydrotropes had its limits as an engaging subject.
You have no idea how bored I was, he told me. It was a month after the familys neighbourhood had been liberated from Isis by Iraqi forces, and we were standing on the lawn outside his house, shaded by an orange tree. But staying inside was better than being with Daesh. As we spoke, a mortar thudded nearby. No one noticed. At the beginning of the Isis occupation, Hakam could still communicate with the outside world. Whatsapp, Viber and Facebook all worked, and he would get regular updates from friends in other parts of the country. Soon, however, the militants began to crack down on illicit internet usage.
If they found a SIM card they would execute you, he said, laughing. We just stopped talking to other people. The Zararis began to search for engaging, therapeutic pursuits that complied with the militants laws. There were not a lot of options. Anything that required electricity was out of the question, as was music or dancing or almost any activity that involved leaving the walled compound of their house.
For Said and Asma, two of the most highly qualified professionals in Mosul, gardening became their salvation. They developed an obsessive fascination with cultivating rare breeds of roses and cacti. Around the flower beds in their garden, they planted orange trees for shade. On a luminous afternoon in the spring of this year, Asma flicked through photos on her iPad to show me the garden in full splendour, beaming at their perfection. Paper-thin poppies and scarlet peonies had flourished, along with a yellow bloom she called the Mosul Rose. We did all of this ourselves, she said. We worked together for this. For their daughter Hasna, who barely left the house, they bought a half a dozen parakeets. Within weeks, she had tamed them.
They all have their own names, their own story, Hasna said, running her hands over the bars as the birds pecked at her fingers. And theyre in a prison, just like us.
As Iraqi, Uighur, Russian and Syrian fighters patrolled the battle-scarred streets outside the house during the years of Isis occupation, all they could see was a pink cement wall. But behind it lay an oasis, where things carried on almost as normal. Last autumn, however, when forces led by the Iraqi army began an offensive to liberate the city from Isis, the veneer began to crack. Air strikes pounded the city. For two weeks, the family slept in their clinker-tiled bathroom. One day, a car screeched up to the door. Inside were three Isis snipers demanding to be let into the house. We said of course, Said laughed darkly, as he showed me around the garden, where the outer wall bore deep scratches from shell shrapnel. Take it.
The family fled to a relatives house, as Isis used their sanctuary to launch a last stand against the advancing forces. It took two months for the neighbourhood to fall to the Iraqi army. When the family finally returned to the house, they feared the worst.
They left seven RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] here, said Hakam, pointing at the roof. One of the fighters had knocked out a firing hole in the terrace wall. There was rubble everywhere. But the house was ok.

## Title: Find solution to Rohingya refugee issue

Find solution to Rohingya refugee issue
The Rohingya refugee issue, which was thrown Bangladesh into a crisis, is certainly having its spillover effect in Sri Lanka too. Some 30 Rohingya refugees, who had arrived in the country, as early as April this year, fleeing Myanmar's military crackdown, were dealt a double whammy the other day coming under a mob attack here. True to form the mob was led by a group of monks.
According to our front page report, in yesterday's edition, police were forced to move these refugees from their temporary safe house in Mt.Lavinia after a mob led by a handful of Buddhist monks attacked the multi-storied compound where they (refugees) were being housed. The 31 refugees, including 16 small children, were initially placed under police protection, after the group gathered outside the building demanding that they be expelled from the country. The police had removed the refugees after the organisation, calling itself Jathika Balamuluwa, insisted on their immediate eviction. However shortly after they were brought back to their temporary home, the monks and their supporters blocked the Galle road and pelted stones, smashed windows and furniture inside the building, while the refugees remained huddled in an upper storey of the building.
It is estimated that over half a million of Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh amidst, what some western government called, genocide against the this Muslim minority community in Myanmar, by the military. The multitudes continuing to flee Myanmar, in increasing numbers, have caused a huge refugee problem in neighbouring Bangladesh. India too, it is reported, is bracing itself for a massive influx, as the military in Myanmar continues with its relentless campaign. Under the circumstances, there is a justifiable apprehension in Sri Lanka, too, of an invasion of Rohingya refugees to this country, by most.
But, mob attacks led by Buddhist monks on a hapless group of a few dozen refugees, would certainly not be endorsed by a majority of Sri Lankans, who went out of their way to protect innocent Tamils who were attacked by mobs during black July, even risking their lives. Besides, Buddhist monks are the last persons one would expect to be in the forefront of such attacks, given the sublime teaching of the Enlightened One, to show love and compassion to one and all. Television footage showed some of these monks running helter skelter, as if possessed, to invade the building, housing the Myanmar refugees, and scuffling with police, which certainly is not conduct associated with the serene demeanour of a member of the Bikkhu community.
However, it is no surprise when one considers the identity of these monks, who behaved violently and in a manner disgraceful to the robe. These were all political monks, who have been running amok since the fall of their mentor, guide and philosopher in January 2015. These were the very Bikkhus who were in the forefront to collect money to pay-off the compensation of two convicts, who misused public funds, by sending novice monks on pindapatha rounds.
There is today a huge outcry by sections of the Sangha, to the remarks made by Sarath Fonseka and Ranjan Ramanayake. They charge the duo for insulting the Sasanaya and denigrating the saffron robe. One would have thought that the conduct of Buddhist monks, or clergy of any other religion, should be exemplary and display a sense of sobriety in public, as men entrusted with spreading the message of the religion, they champion. But can any right thinking person say, with any conviction, that the conduct of some of our monks confirm to this worldview of members of the clergy. Is the kind of aggression displayed by these marauding monks, where some were seen pelting stones on the dwelling of some innocent refugees, fleeing death, compatible with the teachings of the Buddha
The Mahanayakas should be more assertive and take measures to rein in some of their disciples who do harm to Buddhism and the Sasana. The foot ought to have been put down the moment a pindapatha was organised to collect money on behalf of two convicts. True, the Sangha have been in the forefront to advise the rulers and protect the country at times of peril. Also aggressive behaviour of the Sangha is not of recent origin. The signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord saw the Sangha take to the streets. But what we are today witnessing is members of the Sangha being used as tools of a political project. Media conferences are addressed by monks, the content of which bear striking similarity to the issues canvassed by Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition.
There was not even a whimper made when the country's war winning army commander was thrown behind bars, the constitution manipulated to make Rajapaksa, President for life, or, when the country's first female chief justice was thrown out on her ear.
Be that as it may, the government should take swift measures to deal with the Rohingya refugee issue, before things escalate, permitting the JO and their political monks to inflame another Ahungalle.

He said that the ban in selling tobacco especially at the arrivals is an issue. However this is a decision taken by the government and we respect that. We not happy that there are a lot of uncalled for taxes for tobacco sales at the departure section too and this is worrying.

Plans are afoot to remodel the arrival lounge, hence the arrival shop refurbishment will coincide with the remodeling of the arrival lounge at the BIA, where in we expect to have a larger space which will enable us to deliver a better shopping experience for our customers. Our new facility in the departure lounge opened last month and the initial response has been very encouraging and positive, said Thimmayya.
Flemingo currently employs more than 300 people for its Sri Lankan operations. Flemingo is committed to deliver value and benefits to the customers as well as make BIA a favourable shopping destination and one such initiative is Flemingo Duty Frees Loyalty Programme.

Foreign Minister Marapana holds talks with EU's top higher ups in Brussels
Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana who is on his first official visit to the European Union Headquarters in Brussels, held discussions with EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and European Commissioner Christos Stylianides on September 26, 2017.
The Foreign Minister was accompanied by Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva, Ambassador to the European Union Rodney Perera and senior officials.
The Foreign Minister conveyed the Government's appreciation to the European Union for the restoration of the GSP+ facility to Sri Lanka. It was noted that as the EU was Sri Lankas largest trading partner with an annual trade turnover of over US$ 5 billion, the GSP+ facility would provide for a significant increase in Sri Lankas exports to the EU market. During discussions, the European Commission announced that an additional sum of Euro 40 million would be allocated shortly for trade facilitation and support Sri Lankas reconciliation efforts.
EU High Representative and Commissioner Stylianides welcomed the significant improvement that had taken place in Sri Lanka since the election of the new Government and expressed their confidence in the ability of the Government to continue to honour the commitments arising from GSP+ requirements despite the apparent slow progress in some areas of concern.
Foreign Minister Marapana exchanged views on areas of mutual concern related to improving human rights standards through the reforms of legislation to bring in line with international standards and the implementation of the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka. Foreign Minister Marapana reiterated that since the election of the present Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, a bipartisan approach has been taken by the two major political parties to address issues of national importance and that new mechanisms have been introduced in Parliament to have wider consultations with all political parties on bringing about reforms. He stated that while this process would take more time, the Government was firmly committed to respecting human rights and progressing in the implementation of its international obligations. Foreign Minister Marapana explained to the EU High Representative and Commissioner Stylianides, that progress was being made on Constitutional reforms. Discussions also took place concerning the new security challenges, particularly global terrorism and the need for closer cooperation between Sri Lanka and the EU in this area. The Foreign Minister also discussed regional bilateral issues. The EU leaders emphasized that the Indian Ocean region was an area of particular priority to the EU.

FORMER THAI PM YINGLUCK SENTENCED
THAILAND: Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced in absentia to five years in prison.
The Supreme Court convicted her of mishandling a rice subsidy scheme which allegedly cost Thailand at least $8bn.
Ousted in 2014, weeks before a military coup, and later impeached, Ms Yingluck denies all charges and fled before the verdict, reportedly to Dubai.
Public opinion is divided. She remains popular with rural and poor voters.
During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme and insisted she was a victim of political persecution.
Yingluck is now thought to be in Dubai where her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, lives in self-imposed exile avoiding a 2008 sentence for corruption.
Yingluck entered politics only after his sentence and was seen by critics as a proxy for her ousted brother.
Both siblings remain popular among Thailands rural poor, but are opposed by an urban and middle-class elite.
She is unlikely to serve any of her sentence because she is out of the country.
The trail ran over two years, with a ruling initially scheduled for late August. When Ms Yingluck surprisingly failed to show up in court, the verdict was postponed and an arrest warrant was issued for her. -

FR against Meetotamulla garbage dump fixed for argument

A fundamental rights petition filed against Meetotamulla garbage dump was fixed for argument on February 14 next year by Supreme Court, yesterday.
This petition was filed by seven residents of Meetotamulla area citing Colombo Municipal Council, Urban development authority, Western Province Waste Management Authority, Central Environment Authority, Kolonnawa Municipal Council and the Attorney General as Respondents.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) informed the Supreme Court that they have taken a decision to refrain from dumping garbage at Meetotamulla area in Kolonnawa.
The Supreme Court had also granted leave to proceed with this fundamental rights petition.
The petitioners are seeking a declaration from Court stating that the proposed expansion of the dumping site is an imminent infringement of their fundamental rights. The Petitioner stated that the Kolonnawa city is a highly residential area, with high population density and laments in the middle of this highly residential area is a huge and growing garbage dumping site, with a huge mountain of garbage, which has now grown to over 18 acres in extent.
They stated that the garbage from the Colombo Municipal limit is brought and dumped into this mountain of garbage and that approximately 750 to 1,200 tons of garbage come into the site on a daily basis.
They allege the stench is now becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there are tremendous and serious health hazard, with around 30 people of the area having died due to germs and dengue, rat flu, skin deceases, kidney diseases. Hundreds of other families are affected and their numbers are growing daily.
They say that there are other sustainable solutions (other than the dumping of garbage in the aforesaid manner), which could bring an end to this problem, but that these measures are not being taken by the respondents. They alleged that the respondents are taking immediate measures to demolish another 100 houses to expand the site for a further 3 acres.
They added that there are people and companies who are interested in purchasing the garbage (for money) and who are willing to recycle the garbage at their own expense in an environment friendly manner. Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva Appeared for the AG. President's Counsel Saliya Peiris with counsel Nuwan Bopage appeared for the petitioners.

Government targets Rs.7 bn in revenue, 600,000 jobs  from tourism by 2020
Action-oriented Tourism Strategic Plan implemented 
Tourism Development Authority Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said the government had set a target to double the countrys tourism revenues and employment opportunities by 2020.
Accordingly, the government expects to earn Rs.7 billion while creating 600,000 jobs in three years.
Addressing the World Tourism Day event in Colombo yesterday, Ratnayaka said the government had developed Tourism Vision document looking forward to 2025, and an action-oriented Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020, for the next three and a half years.
These visions and plans were developed not just by government agencies, but with complete stakeholder involvement, Ratnayaka explained.
He said to execute this plan, the Tourism Development Authority needed support and commitment from many parties.
At least 20 different government agencies will have to work collaboratively to deliver the plan. Its going to be a lot of work, a lot of patience and also a lot of fun! To lead us we have a focused and fun loving Minister and a highly rated Ministry Secretary. And a key and able partner is going to be the Chairman of the Tourism Promotions Bureau, he added.
It is estimated that this year 2017 more than 2.5 million people will leave their home countries and come to Sri Lanka to follow their dream of visiting an interesting and exciting destination.
A majority of these tourists will return to their homes with an enriched understanding of our people and with fond memories that will bind us to them for the rest of their lives. They will be ambassadors for Sri Lanka and promote us at every turn. Twenty years from now a Sri Lankan travelling through China or a Sri Lankan doing business in Africa will benefit from the relationships being built today through tourism.There is no way to truly quantify and estimate the power of this industry.
Ratnayaka said tourism revenues this year should exceed US$ 3.5 million with 300,000 Sri Lankans having jobs associated with the industry.
The leaders of the government want sustainable employment with higher skills and better salaries for our people. They want us to bring back our people who work in other countries by paying them competitive salaries.
The theme for World Tourism Day this year is Sustainable Tourism -A Tool for Development. The Chairman said it was fitting for Sri Lanka as the country had embarked on a journey to transform its tourism sector towards a sustainable and inclusive future.

Hugh Hefner: Playboy magazine founder dies aged 91

Hugh Hefner, founder of the international adult magazine Playboy, has died at the age of 91.
Playboy Enterprises Inc said he passed away peacefully at home, from natural causes.
Hefner began publishing Playboy in his kitchen at home in 1953. 
It became the largest-selling men's magazine in the world, shifting seven million copies a month at its peak.
Cooper Hefner, his son, said he would be "greatly missed by many".
He paid tribute to his father's "exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer," and called him an advocate for free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom.
Hefner's trailblazing magazine helped make nudity respectable in mainstream publications, despite emerging at a time when US states could legally ban contraceptives.
It also made him a multi-millionaire, spawning a business empire that included casinos and nightclubs.
The first edition featured a set of nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe that Hefner had bought for $200. They had originally been shot for a 1949 calendar.
The silk pyjama-clad mogul became famous for his hedonism, dating and marrying Playboy models. In his later years he threw decadent parties at his luxurious mansions in Chicago and Los Angeles.
He claimed to have slept with more than 1,000 women, and credited the impotence drug Viagra with maintaining his libido.
From 2005-10, a reality TV show called "The Girls Next Door" showcased Hefner's libertine lifestyle - and the harem of young blonde women who shared it.
In 2012, aged 86, he married his third wife Crystal Harris - who was 60 years his junior.
Though critics saw Playboy as a byword for sleaze, its founder - who was born into a strict Methodist family - never shared that view.
"I've never thought of Playboy quite frankly as a sex magazine," Hefner told CNN in 2002. "I always thought of it as a lifestyle magazine in which sex was one important ingredient."
Hefner faced obscenity charges in 1963 for publishing and distributing Playboy, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
The magazine's most significant intervieweesincluded civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, Beatle John Lennon, and Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro.
Its huge sales were certainly driven by glossy colour pictures of nude "playmates", but it also developed a reputation for fine writing, with Norman Mailer, Kingsley Amis, Kurt Vonnegut, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov and Ray Bradbury among its contributors.
Their contributions allowed men to say they did not buy the magazine only for the pictures.
US President Donald Trump appeared on the cover in March 1990, with the tag-line: "Nice magazine, want to sell it"
Hugh Hefner - silk pyjamas and all - was a character who divided America.
Was he really the godfather of the sexual revolution, or just a dirty old man
A louche purveyor of corrupting smut, or an enlightened publisher of contemporary literature
Feminists, and others, accused him of reducing women to sexual objects - if not de facto prostitutes - at the Playboy mansion.
But then there was also his support for racial integration and gay rights, along with a hefty dollop of great writing and agenda-setting interviews.
In short, he was a character more complex than tabloid editors allowed.
And in terms of sexual mores his early permissiveness - daring or shocking depending on your taste - now seems, if not quite quaint, then certainly not unusual.
In that respect Hugh Hefner was ahead of his time, for good or ill.

India's mobile market getting hotter
India has nearly as many smartphone users as the US has people, and it is about to get many millions more.
The South Asian nation is already one of the world's hottest mobile markets, with everyone from Samsung and Apple to China's Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi fighting with Indian brands such as Micromax for a piece of the action. And it's just getting started. Experts say India's tally of 300 million smartphone users could grow by more than 50% in the next few years.
There are about 650 million mobile phone users in India, and just over 300 million of them have a smartphone, according to technology consultancy Counterpoint Research. That means India is already a bigger smartphone market than the U.S. and second only to China.
It also means there are about1 billion Indians who do not yet have a smartphone - a huge market opportunity.
"India is in a very sweet spot in terms of smartphone growth," said Shobhit Srivastava, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. "You have over 300 million people sitting on a 2G device that will eventually move forward to a smartphone... this is the potential that India holds."
Two out of three Indian mobile users - or roughly 433 million people - are planning to upgrade their phones in the next year, according to a recent Counterpoint survey. More than 66% of India's 1.3 billion people still don't have access to the internet. The hundreds of millions set to come online over the next decade will likely do so through mobile devices.
"Mobile has already become the the primary device from which users access the internet," said Srivastava.
Until recently, connecting via mobile had been prohibitively expensive for most Indians but that is beginning to change thanks to a collapse in the price of data.
India's wealthiest man, Mukesh Ambani, sparked a price war a year ago by offering new users six months free access to his Reliance Jio 4G network. The result: India now has some of the cheapest mobile data in the world. (BBC)

Insurance awareness throughout Sept. to  commemorate National Insurance Day
Following the declaration of September 1, as National Insurance Day and with Insurance Awareness Month well under way.
The President of the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka, Deepthi Lokuarachchi and the Chairman of the Marketing and Sales Forum, Hashra Weerawardena were keen to express their ideas and opinions on certain aspects of the industry that will play a crucial role in ensuring that one day every citizen of the country will enjoy the security of Insurance.
On the topic of the importance of need analysis, Lokuarachchi stated, It is an imperative requirement as it ensures that the plan that is proposed to the prospective customer will match the needs and requirements of his/her life. 
Lokuarachchi also explained the manner in which Insurance advisors can convince policyholders to keep their policies active - Once the need is met, Insurance companies must continue to emphasize the value of maintaining a policy and paying premium so that in the case of an eventuality the desired purpose of the policy can be achieved. The payment of the premium will also enable the dependents to benefit from the life policy in case of an unfortunate event in the life of the assured. The continuation of the way of life even in this eventuality is the reason why a person would get a Life Insurance policy in the first place.
Premium payments and savings are synonymous in Insurance.
TheLife Insurance premiumincludes the premium charged for therisk elementand savings the component of the life policy, said Lokuarachchi when asked the difference between Life Insurance premium payment and savings.
The President of the IASL also went on to explain that the payment of premiums could be considered to some extent as a means of compulsory savings in a Life Insurance policy.
However, he added that there are charges associated in the provision of life cover, which do not necessarily form part of the direct savings.
When questioned about the low level of Insurance awareness in Sri Lanka when compared with that of banking services Lokuarachchi replied, Its not a question of awareness. But the reason for the low level of penetration is the reluctance of the people to part with their cash, as they dont like to accept the fact that death and misfortune may come upon them at any unforeseeable time.
The Chairman of the MSF, Hashra Weerawardena was asked to describe the efforts of the organization during September, the month dedicated to Insurance awareness in the country. The activities for Insurance Month commenced at the launch of the first-ever National Insurance Day on September 1, at the Independence Arcade where a special stamp and first day cover were introduced in commemoration of the event.
Vignettes of the event. Pictures by Chinthaka Kumarasinghe.
In addition to that, sixteen locations across the island were selected for regional activations with the fullest support of the many Life and Non-life Insurance companies, who are sponsoring and organizing these events.Up to now we have completed regional activations in the following cities  Negombo, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Kiribathgoda, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Bandarawela, Embilipitiya, Kandy and Matara  we have also lined up programs in Galle and Maharagama during the next couple of days, he explained.
The regulatory body - the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) has provided the necessary guidance and support for these events by participating at several locations island wide, thus providing the momentum for the Life and Non-life Insurance advisors and sales staff members to meet and explain the true value of Insurance, stated Mr. Weerawardena regarding the role of the IBSL in the campaign.

Japan election: PM Shinzo Abe dissolves parliament

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has dissolved the lower house of the parliament ahead of a snap election.
The poll,announced on Mondayand which comes a year early, will take place on 22 October.
Abe is seeking a fresh mandate amid a rebound in his approval ratings and the ongoing North Korea nuclear crisis.
The right-wing hawk became prime minister in 2012, and his Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) leads a ruling coalition that controls the Diet.
Abe suffered adrop in popularityearlier this year over allegations of cronyism.
But he's seen fresh support after North Koreafired two ballistic missiles over Japan,which Abe took a strong stance against.
His call for a snap election was seen as taking advantage of a weak opposition, and the LDP is still leading in opinion polls.
But he now faces a new contender in the form of the fledgling conservative Party of Hope, which was only formally unveiled on Wednesday and has already begun attracting some support.
It is led by the popular Yuriko Koike,Tokyo's first female governorand a former television news anchor.
Several lawmakers from the main opposition Democratic Party, which has been struggling, have already defected to the Party of Hope.
On Thursday, the Democratic Party's leader proposed to his members a de facto merger where all their candidates would run under the Party of Hope's banner, in order to present a united challenge to Abe and the LDP.

Justice ensured for Vidya
President promised victim's family to fast-track Court and swift investigations to bring the criminals to book
It has even been alleged that this entire tragedy was enacted due to one of the suspects being in the business of extreme sado-masochistic pornography
Reproduced here are excerpts of the article written by Thulasi Muttulingam that was originally published on the Daily News on June 4, 2015.
Vidya Sivaloganathans family remembers her as sensitive and soft. She had recently cried when her mother said they would have to sell the familys goat because they couldnt afford to keep it anymore. No amma. Shes part of the family now. Well reduce our meals and share with her what we eat. Please do not give her away, she had begged. Every evening, as soon as she returned home from school, she would go straight to her pets.
We reared the livestockthe goat, the cow and the chickens for eggs and milk, but Vidya always treated them like personal friends, said her mother Saraswathi Sivaloganathan, I often scolded her over it because she was always cuddling them and getting her white uniform dirty. She would cuddle them before going to school and then cuddle them as soon as she returned from school too.
The animals knew, said her brother Nishanthan, 22, It was finally the dogs who led us to her body. On the days leading up to her funeral and at the funeral itself, the dogs and goat acted half-crazed against certain individuals, wanting to head-butt or bite them. We thought they had become unbalanced with grief just as we had and tied them up. But it turned out the individuals the animals had been reacting against were Vidyas rapists and murderers. They had had the nerve to show up repeatedly at our house to offer their sympathy until the Police caught them.
Much has been reported in the local Tamil press and online websites about the case, but the family deny many of the incidents thus reported as unfactual.
Firstly, I had no idea who could have done this to my daughter. We had no enemies in the area, says Vidyas mother.
According to the family, when they went looking for Vidya after 3.00 pm on May 13 when she still hadnt returned from school, the only one to talk of seeing her at all was one particular schoolboy. He had said that he and a schoolmate had been trailing behind Vidya on their cycles when she turned a corner ahead of them and they heard a crash. When they turned the corner themselves, they had seen her overturned bicycle and one shoe but Vidya herself missing. One of them had also seen a flash of a yellow shirt among the bushes, but nothing more. They had apparently continued on their way to school without thinking to mention this incident to anybody.
I screamed when I heard this story, said the mother, I asked the boy repeatedly why he hadnt thought to raise the alarm at least to the teachers. At school, the teachers had merely thought Vidya was absent for the day; but she was a girl who didnt like to miss school even if she was sick. The rapists had planned it well to kidnap my daughter on her way to school. We didnt think to look for her until several hours later and by then, it was too late.
After hunting for her in all possible places in and around the stretch from her home to her school, the frantic family finally informed the nearest Police station at Kurkattuwan. There they said they couldnt lodge complaints and to take our case to the Kayts police station. By the time we reached the Kayts police station, it was 11.00 pm, said Vidyas mother.
She denied reports that the police were rude to her, but said that it was difficult to communicate with them as they spoke only Sinhala.
It was raining heavily and past midnight by the time the anxious family reached home, yet all the talk of elopement had ironically given them a sense of hope. To their knowledge Vidya neither had a boyfriend nor was interested romantically in anyone, but at this stage they were desperately hoping that she was alright somewhere, and thus, were clutching at straws. They were unwilling to let the thought of any harm having befallen her cross their minds.
I kept nervously wondering how and where we would find her, but I certainly never thought we would find her as we didgang-raped and brutally murdered.
She covered her face with her hands at this point to blot out the horror of that memory. The entire family has been psychologically traumatized over the horrific misfortune that befell their beloved youngest member. All of them are apparently, repeatedly falling ill due to this and are constantly in and out of hospital as a result. On the day I visited, Vidyas father, a stroke recovery patient, was at the hospital for further treatment. He had been recovering well from his stroke of two years before, but this incident had again heavily impacted his health.
It was Vidyas brother Nishanthan who saw her body first.
It was eventually one of the dogs, Jimmy, who led Nishanthan to his sisters body. While the youth was scouring about in the bushes, Jimmy appeared with one of Vidyas shoes in his mouth. He had then led the dazed Nishanthan to the back of an abandoned derelict house, to where his sisters body lay on a heavily accumulated pile of fallen leaves.
I was on the other side of the path, looking into a well when I heard Nishanthan yell out Amma, said Saraswathi, the mother. I immediately ran over, tearing my feet over the thorny bushes in my haste, and found Nishanthan fainted on the ground. From the periphery of my vision, I saw my daughters discarded uniform and looked no further. To this day, I have not looked at what condition she was found in, although I understand it has been made widely public all over the internet. I do not want to know.
In fact, her brother adds, the Police, when they eventually showed up at 10.00 am, told us that the rain might have done much damage in washing away whatever evidence there were. I think it was the perpetrators themselves who took this photo and then released it. They felt so invincible and proud of their actions that they felt able to do this.
Nishanthan also believes that the abandoned house behind which his sisters body was discovered is not the actual scene of her rape and murder. I went out the previous day along that path to search for her. The dogs accompanied me then too. How come they didnt sense her there at that time I think the perpetrators had abducted her to one of their houses and then simply dumped her body there past midnight.
Some of the arrested suspects houses have been damagedfully or in part, by angry villagers. Or so the story goes. There is an uneasy suspicion on the part of some people including Vidyas family, that this might be a good way to get rid of evidence as well.
According to several online websites which the local Tamils are following voraciously, the perpetrators were caught with the rape videoed on their mobile phones. It has even been alleged that this entire tragedy was enacted due to one of the suspects, a Swiss PR Resident, being in the business of extreme sado-masochistic pornography; that Vidya was raped and killed for the sake of such a pornographic video and that this high-definition video had been apprehended too.
Police spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekara, however, denies this. The suspects were caught on the information of local people. We have no video evidence of the crime and while forensic investigations are ongoing to match samples of DNA between suspects and what was found at the crime scene, the results are not out yet; they will take some time.
In any case, ASP Gunasekara further clarified, this investigation is not in the hands of the Police anymore. A special unit of the CID is investigating the case now. The special investigations unit is also investigating whether there were any lapses in the Jaffna polices handling of the case, due to widespread peoples protests over the issue.
President Maithripala Sirisena, when he met the family in Jaffna, had promised them to fast-track Court and swift investigations to bring the criminals to book. That is all they have now to look forward to. Their gentle, animal-loving Vidya who had skipped off to school on May 13 after telling her pet goat that she would get back to pet her some more, will no more turn in through their gate to do just that. All that her grieving family can hope for is that the perpetrators of the horrible crime against their beloved girl be brought to book.
I want justice for Vidya. President Maithripala told us that it was not within his power to deliver Vidya back to usbut that he would do all he could within his power to deliver justice. We are waiting, Vidyas mother said.

Kabul air strike: US attack causes civilian casualties

A US air strike against militants in the Afghan capital Kabul caused civilian casualties after a missile malfunctioned, officials said.
The strike was in support of Afghan troops fighting insurgents who attacked Kabul airport with rockets shortly after US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis arrived on a visit.
It is not clear how many civilians were killed or injured.
The US recently confirmed it would send 3,000 extra troops to Afghanistan.
"Tragically, one of the missiles malfunctioned, causing several casualties," the Nato mission in Afghanistan, known as Resolute Support, said in a statement.
Resolute Support deeply regrets the harm to non-combatants.
An investigation into the attack and the malfunctioning ammunition has begun.
" The rocket attack on the airport was claimed by both the Taliban, which said they had targeted Gen Mattis's plane, and their rival, the Islamic State group. Gen Mattis held talks with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani about plans to strengthen Afghanistan's military.
Support from US-led Nato troops would give Afghan forces a "compelling battlefield advantage over anything the Taliban stands to mass against" it, Gen Mattis said.
He said the US would not allow "a merciless enemy to kill its way to power".
US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but more than 8,000 US special forces remain in the country supporting Afghan troops.
Sixteen years after the US-led invasion, the Afghan government still only controls about 60% of the country.

On-line database for paddy sector
It has been decided to have an on-line database system for paddy/rice stocks which could easily be accessed by any official or member of the public at any time.
The Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office issuing a press release stated that every year, the government makes an effort to stabilize the price of paddy. However, owing to non-availability of comprehensive information, success is limited.
Establishing a computerized digital MIS system for the paddy sector will strengthen that effort and decision makers, relying on this MIS, will be able to make informed decisions as to the quantity of paddy and rice available in the country, and the actual need to supplement by way of imports, the release stated.
The project will be implemented under the cooperation of government and private institutes, led by the National Planning Department, with the guidance of the Central Programme Management Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs of which the Prime Minister is Minister.
This will include the data of the extent of paddy such as cultivable, actually cultivated in any season, harvested stocks available, stock purchased by the Paddy Marketing Board, pledged loans granted by banks, import and export figures etc. The database is expected to be uploaded at district level preferably just after the harvesting of each season initially by the officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority and the Paddy Marketing Board attached to each district. Updating of the MIS will start with the next harvesting of the Maha season 2017/18, the release stated.
The information related to the extent planned to be cultivated, actual extent cultivated and paddy production in any given season, is uploaded to the MIS with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture and the District Administration, in each season.
The data provided by the Sri Lanka Customs on the value and quantity of import and export of rice are uploaded to the system monthly. The state and private banks agreed to provide holistic details of pledged loans taken by millers in each season. The pledged loan details could be used to do certain verifications for the existing stocks with millers and stocks with traders. The online database for paddy/ rice has been developed with the technical assistance of the Faculty of Computing and Technology, University of Kelaniya, the press release added.

Mangala condemns attack on Rohingya refugees
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday condemned the attack carried out on Rohingya refugees, on September 26, in Mount Lavinia, while they were under the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Minister Samaraweera urged the police to to take strongest possible action against the perpetrators of these crimes against these innocent refugees.
Making a statement yesterday, Minister Samaraweera said that it was unbecoming of a Buddhist nation practicing non violence and compassion, to attack the refugees who were only given shelter temporarily in Sri Lanka. I would like to condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack against Rohingya refugees who were under the care of UNHRC in Mount Lavinia yesterday by a group of thugs in robes. he said.
In fact, I condemn these actions not only as a minister in charge of media I am also condemning it as a Buddhist who is very proud of the fact that Buddhism is a religion of non violence and compassion. Minister Samaraweera added. These refugees, 30 of them, were rescued at sea by the Sri Lanka Navy in April this year and they were under the care of the UNHCR waiting to be resettled elsewhere in the United States or Canada. In fact this is not the first time Sri Lanka has given temporary shelter to such refugees. Minister Samaraweera further said.
Further explaining, Minister Samaraweera said, Way back in 2008 March, the SL Navy rescued survivors of a boat who were drifting in high seas and they were kept until 2012, when these people were resettled in the USA. Again in 2013 the SL Navy rescued two boats of Rohingya survivors from a shipwreck in the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. There were two of them. These two were kept under the care of UNHCR until they were settled in the USA and Canada in 2014 and 2015.
It is a shameful act and every right minded citizen of this country especially Buddhists must condemn this action by these so called priests. And I also urge the police to take strongest possible action against the perpetrators of these crimes against these innocent refugees. Minister Samaraweera emphasized.

Microsoft partners accelerate digital transformation  opportunities in Southeast Asia
Microsoft held its second annual Southeast Asia New Markets Partner Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, earlier this month, bringing together 138 attendees from nine markets - Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka - as well as partner leaders from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
With the theme 'Connect, Collaborate and Win together, the summit gave partners a platform to discuss, learn and collaborate on how they can re-envision their business model to engage their customers, empower their employees, optimize their operations and transform their products with Microsoft. The company's partner mission - 'One Team' - celebrates partner successes and focuses on helping them transform their customers operations with Microsoft solutions.
The two-day session also gave partners the opportunity to engage with Microsoft's APAC leadership team and gain insights into Microsoft's latest product roadmap, programs and tools available to partners to accelerate their business. A key highlight of the Partner Summit was the Partner Awards celebration night, which took place at the Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit hotel. Microsoft APAC leaders, including Michelle Simmons, General Manager of Southeast Asia New Markets, Valerie Beaulieu, General Manager of Small and Midmarket Partners Solutions Group and other leaders attended the event.
The Sri Lankan partners who were recognized this year included N-ABLE (Digital Transformation Award for Sri Lanka), Trident Corporation (Distributor Award for Top Revenue and OEM Award for Best Device Distributor-OEM and FPP), Tech One Global (Distributor Award for Top Cloud Growth), V.S. Information Systems (Reseller Award for Top YoY Growth) and H-ONE (LSP Award for Top Cloud Growth).
I am delighted by the innovation and impact our partners have been delivering and would like to congratulate all the winners at this year's Partner Awards on their achievements, said Michelle Simmons.
Our research has shown that just 44 percent of ASEAN business leaders believe they have a complete digital strategy in place, despite 91 percent saying they believe it is important to have an agile data-driven business.
The 4th Industrial Revolution will bring profound change to Southeast Asian economies and we believe Microsoft, together with our partner ecosystem, has a unique opportunity to help businesses and organizations in their transformation journey, so as to empower millions of people in our region to achieve more.
It is immensely encouraging that so many of our partners were recognized at this year's Awards Night. It serves as a testament to each company's dedication towards pushing technology and digital transformation, reflecting Sri Lanka's growing ICT industry.
We have a strong partner ecosystem here in Sri Lanka, with over 100 partner organizations helping us to take our varied technologies to home users, businesses as well as public sector organizations and SMEs, said Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives.

Nail it right!
Pamper your nails with a stylish makeover and you will never shy away from flaunting them. Every one desires healthy, well groomed nails. However, sometimes that can be a tricky thing if you dont know how to take care of your nails. Here are some pointers to keep in mind which will make you feel that it is worth holding your hands out for.
Use a base coat
There are many benefits in using a base coat. It makes your manicure last longer. It prevents the polish from staining your nails. Certain brands of base coat strengthen your nails as well.
Lotions and cuticle oil
Lotions and cuticle oil are used to moisturise the cuticle, skin and nail area. It can protect the cuticle and nail against damage and improve the health and appearance of the cuticles and nails. Cuticle oil should not be used as a first-line of defense against dryness. It needs to be used to fix extremely dry and cracked nails.
Disadvantages ofusing gel nail polish
The advantages of gel nails outweigh the disadvantages. If applied poorly and too regularly, the gel polish has a tendency to weaken the nails since there is less oxygen allowing the nails to thrive. The removal process must also be done with care as the filing can damage the surface of the nails. We always recommend a period of one week to two weeks before each application.
Painting regular polish over gel
Painting regular nail polish over gel nail polish is possible but the nail polish has to be of a good brand. When removing the nail polish, be sure to use acetone free polish remover. An acetone remover will lift your gel polish.
Finger nail polish colour andtoe nail polish colour
There are no rules about matching finger nail polish colour with toe nail polish colour. It depends on each individuals preference. According to my opinion, if the colour on the toes is bright, a nude finger nail is nice. Then there will be no crazy colour clash happening between fingernails and toes, and vice versa.
Colours and skin tones
There are certain shades of colours that go with certain skin tones. Cool tones such as blues and greens suit a person with a fairer skin tone while warmer colours such as reds and browns look better on darker skin tones.
Combating thick nail polish
Nail polish gets thick because it dries out. When applying a nail polish the room conditions should be dry. Air should not directly enter the bottle. If youre applying nail polish at home, turn off the fans and air conditioners. There are a few products that can be put into a dry nail polish to bring it back to life. As a quick fix, we use nail polish remover. However the bottle of nail polish will be of no use after a few applications.
Proper application
Applying nail polish without getting polish on the sides and cuticles demands skill. There are also stickers and oils that can be used to prevent this.
If the nail varnish is separated in the bottle, simply shaking the bottle before use. If the gel polish on the brush dries because it has been accidentally left outside soaking the brush in acetone should clean it. A mail polish that lasts long and doesnt stain the nails are signs of a good nail polish brand.
Drying gel nail polish sans a UVA lamp
Gel polish doesnt dry, it cures. If you live in a place with strong, solid sunshine, its possible that the UVA light from the sun could cure the polish. However it would most likely take a long time. Some UV lamps take at least five minutes to cure with directed light, which is why it would most likely take longer to do this without using a UVA lamp.
Stop nail polish frombubbling and chipping
To stop nail polish from bubbling, the polish needs to be applied on to a clean surface. A good top coat will prevent your nail polish from chipping. Still it depends on what you do. If you are frequently washing your hands or moving things around, the colour will chip faster.
Taking off gel nail polish
To remove gel nail polish buff the surface of your nail with a nail file to remove the shine. Then soak a cotton ball in the acetone and place it directly on top of your nail. Follow this by wrapping each finger with a small piece of foil, and after 10 to 15 minutes, the gel manicure should slide right off with the cotton ball.
Remedy for nails/cuticleswhich are dry and/or weak
Eating the right foods for starters should be a priority to strengthen weak nails. Nails are made out of protein, so the first thing you can try is adding more protein to your diet. Eat lean poultry, fish, beef and pork, as well as spinach and other vegetables that contain protein.
Step two should be buying targeted products for your problems. Cuticle oils and base coats which strengthen your nails will help.
Remedy for yellow nails
Next time you get a manicure or pedicure done, dont apply any polish. Leave the nails clean so they can breath and be healthy. A simply buff can reduce stains, but too much buffing can also make them thin. So it should be done with care.
In fashion now
Nail art is still quite popular. Geometric patterns are more on trend than florals at the moment. Also having one or two nails painted differently is how most fashionable girls wear their nails today.
A short, round nail is also the trend. Long, square French tips are quite outdated. Nude coloured nails are the range.

Amazing aloe Vera
Widely used in cosmetics, this wonderful plant has regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties.
Perhaps youve already been introduced to this marvel of the plant world, in which case it will come as no surprise to hear that aloe vera is one of the star ingredients of many cosmetic products, and, indeed, there are whole product ranges based around it.
The little natural wonder is no newcomer to the beauty stage, though: evidence suggests that it was already being used to care for and beautify the skin over 3,000 years ago. There are more than 300 species of the plant, but not all of them provide the gel we know as aloe vera  the wonder-working gel with a whole range of properties beneficial to both healthy and damaged skin.
Regeneration and anti-inflammation
Natural aloe vera extract is excellent to soothe irritated or burnt skin as it has great regenerative and anti-inflammatory qualities. The secret is that it reaches deep into the skin because of its vitamin content  A, B1, B2, B6, B12  plant sugars, glucomannan, pentose, hexose and galactose.
After-sun benefits
Thanks to its calming effects, the plant is widely used in after-sun products and treatments for skin irritations. It also helps to destroy dead cells, regulates the pH of the skin and eliminates toxins. On top of all this, it also has moisturising properties, which makes it effective for dry skins.
An ally against stretch marks
A further area in which it aloe vera useful is in the battle against stretch marks, as it can help with prevention and concealment.
A friend to your hair
Hair and skin are closely related, so maybe its not surprising that your locks can benefit from this wonder plant: many shampoos include it to revitalise and add shine, strength, and flexibility.
These are just some of aloe veras cosmetic properties, but there are also studies that suggest its medicinal properties make it effective against intestinal problems and inflammation of the eyes. One final suggestion, while theres still a little summer left: why not keep some aloe vera gel in the fridge ready to apply after youve been in the sun: your skin will feel cool, refreshed and moisturised. -hellomagazine.com
