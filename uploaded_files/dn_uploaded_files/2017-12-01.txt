## Title: WOES OF THE SANDWICHED GENERATION
## Supertitle:

## Date: Friday, December 1, 2017 - 01:00
WOES OF THE SANDWICHED GENERATION
As a sensitive senior citizen, I thought of perusing through some great literary works in order to find a solution to the woes of the sandwiched generation. I found in a remote corner in my home library lying a yellowish book partly eaten by some silverfish. Yet, they had left the most important lines in the book for me to ponder on.
Men may come and men may goBut I run forever.
Alfred Lord Tennyson, the Nobel laureate of the Victorian period of England had written these golden lines in his BROOK.
The lines referred to a brook he had surveyed to write a poem, but I was inspired by the lines to write this article on behalf of the most affected segment of the population not only in our country but also in other countries too. To say frankly, Lord Tennyson has been my muse in many a writing.
History of the parliament reminds us that from time to time elections are held and peoples representatives are elected to govern the country. They enact legislature and implement. The political parties of the representatives change and some go into oblivion after their defeat. Some seasoned politicians remain forever through their common sense and some do volte face very adroitly to stick to their seat.
The political turncoats are many in history, yet their interpretations are very thought provoking. Hoodwinking of the people is their mastered art and they are very consummate in it. If I come back to my topic again, MPs come to the parliament on peoples back and they leave, but this great edifice remains forever, runs forever.
Great expectations
The portfolio of finance is one of the most important in the Cabinet and the people always have great expectations on the minister of finance. Some of them in the annals of parliamentary have proved their mettle and some have brought utter disgrace to this sublime office of the country.
One aspect is conspicuous and that is the portfolio is offered to one of the most senior and battle hardened politico who could keep the steering wheel well balanced. He or she should be prepared to face both brickbats and bouquets alike. Ones disposition, personality, and the soul are best displayed in this exercise.
The budget is to be presented to the parliament in a few days; in the offing. Intensity of the great expectations is on the rise. The relevant and irrelevant authorities have already implied what to expect and what not to.
While there is hope there is life. My concern here is to air my views on behalf of the sandwiched generation. This term simply means the segment of the population between the young generation and the old generation, in other words, the sons and daughters of the old people and the fathers and the mothers of the children.
A sandwich is two slices of bread, often spread with butter with a layer of meat, etc. between them.The middle layer is well pressed and so is the sandwiched generation; crushed by the dual responsibility of looking after the old parents who deserve their nursing and bringing up the children which is a gigantic task in the modern society.
It is discernible that the income level of this generation fluctuates due to many a volatile situation of the economy. The oil price bugbear, severe droughts, political instability, shortsighted political decisions to cushion the spiraling cost of living, foreign aid blockades, to cap them all, the enormous wastage of the administrative system on tamashas and many other unnecessary fanfare lead the way to ruin.
The sandwiched generation is compelled to bear the brunt. Free education has almost become a misnomer and the the educational expenditure of the schoolgoers has become an unbearable burden to the parents while they have to look after the unproductive aged parents.
The lions share of the income earner has to be spent to feed the hungry mouths of the children and the dependents.
Village money lenders and the mushrooming micro credits financiers are always eying this segment of the society to thrive on. They fall prey to these governmental and private sector octopuses and forever become debt stricken.
Gross national product
The situation is pathetic and they fall into the ditch of social outcasts, economically.
The government is also entrapped in the net of foreign debts and both people and the rulers are forever ruined.
In general, people are also very lethargic and spend most of their time at the tea kiosks and on culverts criticizing the governments and nobody realizes the gravity or the crux of the ongoing ordeal. The pith of the matter is that the economy ought to be driven by the long time objective of the maximization of the gross national product.
In so far as, in a welfare state like Sri Lanka people have got used to eat without pouring honest sweat.
The sandwiched generation has to attend many a social function at the village level and at the working place. Birthdays, weddings, funerals, celebrations, pilgrimages, parties of myriad nature, finding dowries for the girl-children and making houses for the sons add to the daily burden of this segment of the population.
The stress, depression, ignorance and many other sociological factors lead them to commit suicide. The alarming crime rate, bank heists, highway robberies, drug business and the drug addiction could be attributed to this great tragedy. Moral paralysis of the society seems to be the tip of the iceberg.
The sandwiched generation is buried to the throat. The well-designed budget could be the harbinger for them to relieve for another year! Hope is eternal in the human heart.
After all, The sandwiched generation has always been a weary lot in face of inescapable gamut of suffering, to clinch it over.

Lanka, Korea trade growing by 7%
The National Budget 2018 has some of the strongest announcements of liberalization seen in years, including the removing of para-tariffs on 1,200 imported items, said Minister Malik Samarawickrama
Speaking in the Republic of Korea, he said that the budget also announced very progressive steps towards UN sustainability goals by declaring that all government vehicles will be either hybrid or electric by 2025, and dramatically reducing taxes on electric cars.
The focus of the government is to shift the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports, and foreign direct investment.
Our government is now firmly focused on making the country more open to the world and become an attractive place to do business. We are also committed to improving the ease of doing business. Yes, we have slipped on the rankings recently but that has only made us more determined to double up our reform efforts. By next year you will see the results as we have taken several measures in this regard. Sri Lanka has been most successful during times of greater outward orientation, when it was more open to exports and FDI. But for sometime during the past decade we had slipped on this, and growth was driven more by domestic activity.
The total trade between Korea and Sri Lanka is now just under US$ 400 million and has been steadily increasing and exports to Korea over the last 5 years have been growing by 7% each year, but there is a lot more potential to grow this in the further, he said.
We would also like to diversify our exports to Korea, beyond the current focus on apparels, coconut products and rubber products. Sri Lanka is keen to be a partner of Koreas supply chain especially in automobiles and electronics products.
The new Logistics and Industrial Zone in the south of the country  in Hambantota  is being developed with Chinese investment and we expect a lot of investor interest in this
While we are of course very keen to attract Korean investment to Sri Lanka, we are even keener to attract Korean know-how and technology to Sri Lanka.
More broadly on the macroeconomic front, we are taking measures to build strength and resilience.

Allow import of at least 2 years older electric vehicles - Electric Vehicle Club
The plans to improve electrical vehicles could fail if meaningful steps are not taken by the governmen, the Electric Vehicle Club of Sri Lanka said in a statement.
Co-founder and Interim Committee Member of Mahisanka Abeywickrama Electric Vehicle Club Sri Lanka however thanked Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera for taking measurements to improve the electric vehicle usage in Sri Lanka in 2018.
Also the plan of removing all fuel vehicles from 2025, imposing the carbon tax, proposal to install electric vehicle chargers, the reduction of taxation for buses and trains are highly appreciated. However there are a few issues that needs to be addressed.
The first issue is imposing higher tax percentage for electric vehicles over100Kw. It is clear that electric vehicles that will come in 2018 will be of a motor capacity between 100kw-150kw. Therefore it would not be practical to import these vehicles during next year. The attached tables shows how the taxes of electric vehicles are greater than hybrid vehicles if compared within same class
The second issue is that the decision not to give tax relives for used vehicles (later it was brought down to one year used vehicles), is not practical.
The main reason is that in Sri Lanka, brand new electric vehicles are still not imported. Second reason is that the efficiency of the car will remain thought out years when compared with hybrids and petrol cars.
When it comes to an electric vehicles, the main component which will depreciate when running is the electric battery. When a new batter is replaced with the old battery, the old battery could be used for home solar systems for another 5 years. After that period there is a process of re-exporting and recycling and even batteries of hybrids cars follow the same process. It is true that without a proper recycle or disposing process, if used electric batteries are thrown to the environment, there will be pollution.
There are many steps the government can take to properly collect and re-export the used batteries without restricting the importation of electric vehicles.
The Club said even though brand new electric vehicles are not sold in Sri Lanka at this point, it would start during next year. And there is a possibility of their prices being very high. Furthermore, European countries give special grants and other relies when purchasing an electric vehicle. As a result their prices go down drastically and by importing those used vehicles our country also will benefit from those grants in indirect way. The Association proposes that by considering above facts, they would appreciate if the government could allow bring down at least 2 years older electric vehicles.
Promoting use of electrical vehicles in proper manner will give huge benefits to Sri Lankas energy security, environment, and people and generally to the whole community. If the government really cares about all these the club said they believe that above mentioned facts will be taken into consideration.

CH will be the favourites against Police
The confrontation between CH and FC and Police Sports Club in the Dialog 'A' Division Inter-Club League rugby first round match at Police grounds in Police Park today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
CH and FC who has been getting thrashed by other clubs some seasons ago, came back to their normal pattern of play in their last three matches against Army losing (15-20) against CR & FC winning (19-12) and going down fighting against Havies (26-31) in their last match under the coaching of dedicated and hard working former CR, Kandy SC, Havelocks and national coach Tavita Tulagaese "Laga".
The CH and FC side has been training hard under their new captain Rohitha "Chichi" Rajapaksa last few weeks and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win like they did against formidable CR side.
Police on the other hand started training under the watchful eyes of their Head Coach Shamly Nawaz, who is also the CR & FC assistant coach some time back under Inthisham Marikkar. They have a really low record thus far losing all their matches hence the Cops will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the rejuvenated CH team in their home grounds at Police Park.
The forte of the CH & FC team has been their power-packed forwards. The CH 'eight' especially their ever green flankers Yoshitha Rajapaksha and Sasanka Ariyaratne, along with Sathya Ranatunga, Terrence Henry and Sajith Saranga have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a close fight up front by the Police forwards spearheaded by Peterite number eight Sajith Saram, captain Jayanga Silva, former skipper Romesh Archarige, ex Royalist, Havies and CR hooker Lahiru Pavithra ably supported by Hashan Silva.
In the set scrums the CH hooker Pulasthi Gunaratne should get the better of his vis-a-vis Sameera Wickramanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the CH duo of Saranga and Matheesha Sarathchandra and Police's Archarige.
With the halves combination of Avishka Lee and Shamry Burah having hit it off well in the last match the CH side will hope that Avishka will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Lee Keegal and Dinushan Ariyapala.
In addition they have two experienced wingers in Anuradha Herath and Heshan Maduranga who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with Antonian full back Samuel Maduwantha often joining the line to form the overlap and will go as the play maker for CH and if he gives off his best in attack and place kicking then they will pull off a victory.
Going by the two teams starting line ups a close tussle for supremacy can be expected but CH will have the edge in their bid to notch up another win.

Multi-cultural education will help inter-faith harmony
The key to inter-faith harmony lies in a multi-cultural education. Multi-cultural education encourages pluralism. Right education creates a reverence for diversity in nature and a sense of belonging with the whole world.
Opening up a childs mind to respecting other religions bringing up a child in a world that encourages human values like a sense of oneness with others, trust and compassion is the sustainable solution.
When children understand that human values exist in all great traditions, when children glimpse the humanity of believers of other faiths and when children know that truth is expressed outside their own religion, then narrow-mindedness, the root of terrorism will not survive.
The only way to get rid of fanaticism in the world is through education that is broad-based, multi-cultured and multi-religious, so that a child growing up is not narrow-minded. He or she will respect the teachings of other religions also.
When multi-cultured education takes hold, especially amongst the young religious leaders, then future harmony is assured. Progressive times require a new indoctrination  one that raises human values above everything else and promotes oneness of humanity. Interfaith harmony lies in its spiritual foundation. Integrating people by awakening the core of every religious teaching  universal brotherhood and love. Spirituality unites people and promotes people into doing something constructive for the world. These inspirations that come from within will enable us to act better.
Spirituality, will pave the way for a reined way thinking which is all encompassing, uplifting and unifying. The most effective, and perhaps only tool towards building long-lasting inter-faith harmony.

Clear strategy of trade liberalisation  in Budget 2018 - Finance Minister
The government has embarked a clear strategy of trade liberalisation in Budget 2018 with a view to reaching Sri Lankas ancient status as a trading nation, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was speaking at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association, held in Colombo this week.
According to the Minister, to this end, para-tariffs will be removed over a three-year period which will enhance the spirit of competition in the economy.
Over the years, all of these tariffs and para-tariffs have created a protectionist economy, incentivizing the diversion of resources away from the export sector. The government in parallel will bring in strong anti-dumping laws and trade remedies along with trade adjustments. This will ensure fair competition and support vulnerable industries to become more profitable.
The government is also supporting industries efforts to link with global value chains. Steps have been taken to enhance market access with the revival of the GSP Plus and soon to be concluded FTAs with China, Singapore and India.
A world-class logistics network is also essential to help connect with global value chains. Significant steps are being taken to enhance trade facilitation measures, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Budget 2018 included allocations for the establishment of a single window, a trade information portal, and numerous other proposals to improve the trade and investment climate. The liberalization of shipping and freight forwarding sectors will also contribute immensely to freight trade, the Minister noted.
This will help attract investment to position Sri Lanka as a logistics hub. It is also encouraging to note that the apparel industry has made important progress in backward integration. The government is keen to see the development of local designs, innovative product development and R&D.
Sri Lanka will one day be a hub for design, development and logistics for all major apparel players. This will enable true value creation in the industry.
The apparel industry has made great strides into other key themes emphasized in Budget 2018.
As Sri Lanka needs to build its foreign earnings, the role of the apparel industry is more important than ever, the Minister said, adding that the government has taken steps to create an enabling environment for further export growth.
The apparel industry aims to achieve an export earnings target of US$ 8 billion in the coming years.
The government will take necessary steps to create an enabling environment to facilitate this objective.
The Minister also urged apparel exporters to strive harder in the coming years to go beyond industry targets.

Dealing with children's fussy eating habits
Children are always fussy when it comes to food, and parents do their best to outsmart, trick or persuade them into eating all foods without bias.
Well, not anymore, a new study has found the best ways to tackle fussy eaters and experts have given the top 6 tips to handle your child's tantrums.
According to the study published in the Journal of Child Health Care most children develop picky attributes around the age of two.
50 percent of two-year-olds are fussy eaters, compared to only 17 percent of three-year-olds. The research further observes that parents feels responsible and guilty about such behaviour fearing it will impact their child's growth and health.
Using rewards to cope with fussy eating was reported to be an ineffective method, as was adjusting all meals to the child's taste.
Lead author Dr Brengre Rubio, from the Department of Psychology at the IFSTTAR Institute in Versailles, France said to the Daily Mail, "These two techniques are counterproductive as they encourage short-term tasting of the food but are associated over the long-term with pickiness and a restricted diet."
The results of the study were based on focus groups involving 38 parents of children aged 18 to 38 months.
Parents agreed that family meetings tended to get problematic and they would have to justify why their child refused to eat, admitting that 'mealtimes were not a nice time'. Parents reported that their children would put food into 'yes' and 'no' categories. Generally refusing fruits, vegetables and any new type of food. The group also reported that sometimes the tantrums would end with the child throwing the entire meal on the floor.
Although researchers noted that children are more open to trying different foods when they are not in their own homes.
And while parents worry that their child's health may be affected by their fussy eating, as they wouldn't get enough nutrient and possibly get sick more often, Dr. Rubio observed that previous research has failed to find a connection between the effect of picking eating habits on children's weight.
However, the study did find the following to be the top six ways to deal with fussy eating:
Preparing meals together with children
Enhancing the offending ingredients with flavor.
Repeated exposure to the complained about food
Mixing in other foods that children like, such as cheese
Making food look more interesting, for instance, by making it look like a face
Modeling  that is setting a good example by tasting the food yourself

Sri Lanka is a country where people of different communities, cultures and religions live in peace and harmony. It demonstrates the joys of humanity in diversity living in coexistence and harmony, stated President Maithripala Sirisena in his message marking Milad-un-Nabi.

After ending the dreaded war lasting three decades, our prime expectation is to move towards the prosperity as an exemplary country, where the people of all communities live in harmony and brotherhood as children of the same mother. I highly value the fact that the national Milad-un-Nabi celebration this year is held in Jaffna Peninsula by depicting the compassion, tolerance and love practiced by all religious leaders in the world.

Depression to continue
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharashana Yapa yesterday asked the public to remain vigilant as heavy rains and strong winds are to be experienced over the next few days.
The Meteorological Department expects showers, or, thundershowers over most parts of the island during the next 24 hours with heavy rainfall (above 100mm) to be expected in some places in the Northern, North-central, Uva, Southern, Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Central Provinces.
Inclement weather on Wednesday night left seven persons dead, 23 missing and over 20,000 affected in 66 Divisional Secretariats in 11 districts in the country, the minister said.
The deep depression which developed within 24 hours on Wednesday to the South West of Sri Lanka has begun to move away from the island and into the Arabian Sea.
The Meteorological Department expected this to turn into a cyclone within the next 12 hours but it would be closer to Pakistan and Iran by that time.
While one depression moved away from Sri Lanka, the Meteorological Department was froced to direct its attention to another,in the Eastern Coast.
We cannot say what intensity this would take, but we are watching it, said the Minister.
Director General of the Meteorological Department S.Premalal explained that, whilst, there was a possibility of another disturbance, It was still in the developing stage and it was very far from us to have a direct impact.
Addressing a media briefing, at the Ministry of Disaster Management, the Minister explained that the government had set up four welfare centres in the Nuwara Eliya District to cater to, especially over 50 families displaced in the Ella divisional secretariat division.
They have also given out 1900 tents to people whose houses have been damaged severely (Colombo-500, Galle-200, Matara-200, Kalutara-1000 tents respectively).
Community Police Division Director, SP Priyankara de Silva explained to the media that they have been working together with 400,000 community police members, around the country, to control the situation.
The SP, prioviding statistics, further said that as of yesterday, 17 properties were reported to be damaged in Galle, whilst two fishermen were killed in Hikkaduwa, one person by a falling tree in Hunupitiya,Gampaha, with, another seriously injured, another killed in Badulla by a falling tree, 10 reported missing in Ambalangoda with only one body found so far .In addition 30 families in Kataragama have been displaced. The Police Lifeguard unit, he said, has been deployed for rescue operations.
The Colombo National Hospital, in the meantime, reported that 15 casualties were brought to the hospital for medical treatment for various injuries resulting from the adverse weather. One of them died upon admission. According to sources, seven of the casualties are still receiving treatment at the hospital with two of them under Intensive Care .
The Accident Ward asked people to be careful when walking along roads because there can be fallen live electricity lines, invisible drains filled with water, fallen trees etc. Precautions should be taken to avoid injury, during bad weather.
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO), in the meantime, has issued the three warnings of yellow, amber and red in the districts of Rathnapura, Matara, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Matale, Moneragala, Galle, and Hambantota, with the districts of Rathnapura, and, Badulla receiving red notices (rain over 150mm) in the divisional secretariats of Kolonna in Ratnapura and Haldamulla,and, Bandarawela in Badulla.
They added that in the last 24 hours, no large scale landslides have been reported. Earth slips ,along the Up-country line, at Nanu-Oya, and, the main railway line, caused long delays of train services on these lines. The army was deployed to clear the blocks on the Nanu-Oya line, and, service was expected to resume by last evening.
According to the Sri Lanka Railways,the Kelani Valley railway line, too, was obstructed yesterday morning but they managed to restore the service quickly.
The other railway lines will function, as usual, but,slight delays of trains are to be expected, as some of the rail tracks are blocked by fallen trees due to the strong winds that occurred on Wednesday night.
Minister Yapa, in the meantime, stated that one trawler, in Tangalle and three boats in Dodanduwa, Galle had gone missing, on Wednesday night,despite fishermen being asked not to go out to sea,since November28.
We have informed them but there are a few who dont listen, he said.
Premalal noted that the deep depression experienced this week was similar to the weather disturbances in 2011 and thus they warned the fishing and naval communities early on.
Last time, around 50 fishermen died, but ,this time we saw it could become worse, and, so, we warned them early, said Premalal. According to Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department Director General Christy Lal Fernando,the fishermen of Tangalle and Dodanduwa have been badly affected due to the adverse weather condition which prevailed in the country.
During a meeting headed by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday at the Ministry, the Director General stated that three fishing vessels that had left the shores of Dodanduwa are reported missing and a fisherman had died.
Another multiday fishing vessel that had left the shores from Tangalle is also missing and a body of a fisherman was found on the Tangalle beach. Radio signal buildings in Galle and, Matara have been damaged due to strong winds prevailed in those areas.
Meanwhile, a fisherman had died in Kahawa, Ambalangoda after his boat toppled. The fisher community is advised not to go to sea today and tomorrow due to the adverse weather condition and be alert about the bad weather warnings of the Meteorology Department.
During a meeting held three days ago, Minister Amaraweera had informed Fisheries Department officials to make the fisher community aware about the severe weather warnings published in various foreign media websites.
Navy Media Spokesman Commander Dinesh Bandara said the Navy had deployed the Sayura ship and Doras for search and rescue operations, and, he further said that the search and rescue operations will be carried out even in rough seas, in search of missing fishermen and boats.
The DMC in the meantime has sent out teams to all districts to clear fallen trees. The Ceylon Electricity Board which faced power cuts, all over the island, by Wednesday night had informed the Minister that they were restoring power to the affected areas gradually. Department of Irrigation Director Hydrology P. Hettiarachchi informed the public that water levels in the Nilwala, Gin ganga, and, Kalu ganga were rising rapidly, owing to the prevailing inclement weather conditions,in the Western and Southern provinces.
The Nilwala River, according to the Department, has its water levels reaching spill level and to the brim in the areas of Pitabeddara, Panadugama, and Sapugoda. People living downstream in these areas are advised to be vigilant.

FA to obtain bilateral concessional loans up to U$ 500 million
A framework arrangement (FA) was signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and Government of Korea in the presence of the Presidents of the two countries. The commitment amount of the FA was increased from U$ 300 million to U$ 500 million to celebrate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Korea.
The FA will now enable the Sri Lankan government to obtain bilateral concessional loans up to U$ 500 million as means of Official Development Assistance (ODA) from EDCF (Economic Development Cooperation Fund) entrusted with Korea Eximbank.
The EDCF loans with 0 percent to 0.15 percent interest rate and up to 40 year repayment period (including up to 10 year grace period) are extremely concessional that Sri Lankan governments shoulder to finance for infrastructure development projects will be lightened.
Under this new FA, the two governments will work closely on executing projects identified through the mid-term pipeline for the years 2017-2019 under priority sectors of country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka. These priority sectors include transportation, water and sanitation, education and rural development. Importantly, these projects are aligned with Sri Lankas national development plan (Vision 2025: A country enriched) in its journey to reach upper middle income country. As of now, Korea Eximbank entrusted by the Korean government with the EDCF has approved USD 771 million for 27 development projects in Sri Lanka. The first EDCF loan agreement with Sri Lanka has been signed in 1990, for the rehabilitation of the Colombo-Galle road (A2). In terms of the loan amounts committed from EDCF, Sri Lanka is ranked at fourth place among all 54 countries which have received the support from the EDCF.
Some of the completed projects supported by Korea Eximbank in the past are Hatton-Nuwara Eliya Road Improvement Project, Hambantota Administrative Complex Project, Greater Galle Water Supply Project Phase I & II.
The mid-term pipeline projects to be financed through the new FA include for example, supply of garbage compactors, establishment of ICT Hub for secondary education, land data infrastructure and land information service system etc which will be finalized through policy dialogue between governments next month. These projects are symbolic of an effort to share Koreas development experience and knowledge with Sri Lanka. With the newly signed FA, the Korean government will further strengthen economic development partnership with Sri Lanka by supporting Sri Lanka to achieve sustainable development.

Fantasy Vs. Reality!
The dramatists of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya are overcomers in every sense of the word. Dramatic Moves features these hard working and resilient girls who ardently practice drama and pursue victory.
English Drama, Teacher in Charge, Inoka Palihawadana commented on the friendships formed in doing drama.
These friendships are lasting friendships and these friendships are the best part of student life.
After taking part in a drama, you find a difference in the students. We teach them to express their feelings and that makes them more confident. It is almost a kind of a meditation. It helps them even in their lives.
We see friendships continuing after the drama, even though they are from different classes.
They have not met earlier before the drama, but after the drama the bonds have remained. It is mostly the unity they get from drama. We feel that all should do drama. The students who are seasoned in drama also help out. So what we need is a lot of participation.
We also learn a lot because students are very different from each other. But once they get united it is remarkable. They get to know that the characters they enact are really there in society. This teaches them how to react to situations in life, said Palihawadana.
All Societies, Teacher in Charge, Kumani Boyagoda pointed out that the emotional side in students benefit from doing drama.
I have been teaching for nearly 20 years and at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya there are nearly 50 societies. Here drama plays a different role. Our children are enthusiastic about taking part in the drama competitions.

We have inter-house drama competitions as well. The students have to live in the drama, unlike other societies. So the children are able to build themselves up emotionally. That is their strong point. Our students are able to balance their academic work and their drama, said Boyagoda.
Self- discovery
Dramatist Imara Gamage, felt that drama is a process of self- discovery that begins at a very young age laying the foundation for greater things in life. This initial step and exposure surely prepares someone for what comes next in life.

Most of the time I was perceived as a silent person because I am not a talkative or bubbly person in public. But through drama they realized that I was not the person they thought I was! When you get to enact these characters you get to show a different side of yourself. I believe drama has given me that exposure, said Gamage.
When the girls enact different characters, they have the opportunity to enact humour or anger or different other emotions. They get to depict it through their character.
For Gamage, it helped her develop the way she expressed her feelings.
Even though Shakespeare lived during the 16th or 17th century, the feelings are still real and the plot and characters are still relevant to this age.
There are people who are like Romeo and Juliet today. We all have seen people like that in todays society. So when it comes to getting into that character is not that hard, said Gamage.
The school once did a production by themselves called Fantasy Vs. Reality and it was related to the Disney World, and in that Gamage got to play the character of Aladdin who is a playful guy and a male part.
Aladdin is playful and funny and I am not good at playing those characters, but I got the Best Supporting Actor for that character.
I put a lot of effort to get into that character, so it was a great experience. When getting into the character even when it is a complex character, it helps to know each detail about it. A lot depends on the research you do.
Once we did Othello, we read about the character and watched DVDs, and we get to see how those characters are depicted through these adaptations, explained Gamage.
Innovation and creation
President Binuri Weerasinghe has been fortunate enough to receive a life altering experience. She has had the opportunity to play an extraordinary character, a character with depth and a plot of intrigue. It is a once in lifetime experience for many and one that is greatly valued.
Last year when we did Shakespeare we did Hamlet and I portrayed the part of King Claudius. (The man who married Hamlets mother) that was a side to a person I had never explored before. That was the most complex character I have ever portrayed.
When you think of King Claudius there are so many emotions involved  there is love, anger, betrayal, loyalty and all at once. It is definitely the most complex character I have ever done, explained Weerasinghe
Weerasinghe has certainly had her baptism of fire in drama. She has had an experience that brought out the best out of her. She has learnt how to think quickly and how to think positively and productively.
On one occasion, I recall we had to write our own script for an inter-house drama competition and we had to perform it on World Childrens Day. So there was a three month gap between that.
Then I was told in a days time we have to perform that drama! I could not remember a single word! I went through the script that was written by us and the idea went in to my head, I did not study any lines, it was just on the spot and I created the lines. Because you just cannot study it overnight. So innovation and creation all that happens when you forget your lines on stage!, pointed out Weerasinghe.
The inter-house drama competitions take place annually. Some people who have not done it before are absorbed into this because it is very active. It is a brilliant way to identify talent and push people to know what they are good at.
To get comfortable doing drama, you need to do it for some time. It helps them explore sides of them they did not know.
Drama as a whole develops a person in so many aspects and sometimes you cannot even describe how. You get to explore the feelings inside you. That is hard to achieve through other aspects of art. Drama does that for me and other people to whom I have spoken. Drama is a really good way to express yourself and find freedom within yourself, said Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe entered drama at a tender age. She credits who she is today to her experience in drama. She has discovered sides of herself that she never knew. It is a huge influence on her life.
To create chemistry between two actors you really need to get to know the person, before you get on stage. Getting to know your fellow actors make it easier. You have to talk with each other and make each other feel at ease.
Be friends. The more you know the person the more comfortable you are around them, said Weerasinghe.
From what she says, drama is not only your character but the characters around you. Your character on stage and off stage is affected by other characters around you. That is an enriching experience.
Lastly All Societies, Teacher in Charge, Kumani Boyagoda stated that what the school has achieved is due to the unwavering support of the other teachers.
I would like to specially acknowledge the tremendous support given by the Principal R.M.A.R. Herath, Asst. Principal Champa Illankoon, English Teacher, Sunethra Weerasinghe, English Coordinator, Gayathri Dharmarathne and the Sinhala Drama Teachers, Jayani Kapuge and Ishara Wickramasena. They have been a huge support to us in every way possible.
Sunethra Weerasinghe has helped us a lot in doing drama. And it is not only her but all the other wonderful teachers who have helped and molded our students. They have all been real pillars of strength, said Boyagoda.

Fighting HIV/AIDS
AIDS/HIV (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome/Human Immunodeficiency Virus) caught everyone by surprise nearly three decades ago. Since then, 35 million people worldwide have succumbed to complications arising from AIDS and a further 75 million have become infected with HIV. In 2016, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV.
Today, on World AIDS Day, the world will focus on the progress made so far in the fight against AIDS and the steps that should be taken to eliminate the disease. There used to be a time when HIV/AIDS meant an automatic death sentence, but these days are gone now. Remarkable progress is being made on HIV treatment.
UNAIDS has launched a new report showing that access to treatment has risen significantly. In 2000, just 685,000 people living with HIV in mostly developed countries had access to antiretroviral therapy. By June 2017, around 20.9 million people all over the world had access to the life-saving medicines. But the battle is far from over. More than 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV and one million people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2016 alone.
New infections among adults globally have not decreased sufficiently. The 2016 United Nations Declaration on Ending AIDS target is to reduce new HIV infections to fewer than 500,000 by 2020. No single prevention method or approach can stop the HIV epidemic. Several methods and interventions have proved effective in reducing the risk of, and protecting against HIV infection including male and female condoms, the use of antiretroviral medicines as pre-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary male medical circumcision, behavioural change interventions to reduce the number of sexual partners, the use of clean needles and syringes, opiate substitution therapy and the treatment of people already living with HIV to reduce viral load and prevent onward transmission.
Thus access to HIV drugs and awareness campaigns on prevention are more important than ever. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, has a right to health, which is also dependent on adequate sanitation and housing, nutritious food, healthy working conditions and access to justice.
The right to health is supported by, and linked to, a wider set of rights. Ending AIDS as a public health threat can only happen if these rights are placed at the centre of global health, so that quality health care is available and accessible for everyone and leaves no one behind. Accordingly, this years World AIDS Day campaign focuses on the right to health.
The My Right to Health campaign will provide information about the right to health and the impact it has on peoples lives. Almost all Sustainable Development Goals are linked to health and achieving the SDGs, which include ending the AIDS epidemic, will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health.
The right to health is firmly enshrined in our law, but even more importantly, it is deeply ingrained in the national psyche. Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries that provide a completely free health care service. Sri Lanka has around 4,000 adults living with HIV. While there are no problems with their treatment per se, the bigger challenge is changing societal attitudes towards those living with HIV. There are still a lot of misconceptions about the disease in the wider society, which have not been effaced even after sustained media campaigns.
One prime example was the virtual expulsion of a student who had HIV from a school in the North Western Province. The parents of other students apparently did not want this child to remain in the school, for fear of the disease spreading among their offspring as well. This shows that the parents were completely in the dark about how this disease is transmitted. Every attempt should be made to educate the masses on the true nature of this disease and methods of transmission in order to end the social stigma faced by the victims. The only silver lining in this incident was that the student was admitted to a far bigger school whose teachers and parents had no qualms about having a student with HIV.
While todays anti-HIV drugs can prolong the lives of patients to the point where at least some of them reach the full natural lifespan, scientists have not lost sight of the ultimate goal  a cure and a possible vaccine. A greater understanding of our bodies complex immune systems is essential in this quest since AIDS is a disease that essentially cripples ones immunity to disease. HIV is very adept at evading the bodys immune responses. The main way it does this is by developing mutations that enable the virus not to be recognised by a persons immune system. At the same time it continues to replicate and reproduce itself. Controlling the behaviour of this virus will be the key to any eventual cure or vaccine.
Judging by the progress made so far in the world of medicine, where certain diseases such as polio and smallpox have been eradicated from Earth, there is no doubt that scientists will achieve the same goal vis--vis AIDS/HIV.

First Down Syndrome person to compete for Miss USA
I want to be able to show others what inclusion is all about, that someone with special needs can go after their dreams.
Those are the words of Mikayla Holmgren, a 22-year-old from Stillwater, Minnesota whos just made history by becoming the first person with Down Syndrome to compete in a Miss USA state pageant. Not only that but she proudly returned with not one but two awards: the Spirit of Miss USA Award, and the Directors Award! I was super shocked, I was in tears, she said. I went from a special needs pageant to the biggest pageant in the world. Its kind of crazy.
Mikayla is no stranger to performing in front of crowds, having been dancing since the age of six, but the Miss USA state pageant was by far her biggest challenge yet. When shes not stealing the show at beauty pageants, Mikayla is an ambassador for Best Buddies, a non-profit organization aimed at enhancing the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Mikayla is such an incredible and accomplished young woman, said Denise Wallace, executive co-director of Miss Minnesota USA.
She is the epitome of what the Miss Universe Organization strives to look for in contestants.

Fortunaglobal introduces  Affluence Soft Token
Colombo-based Fortunaglobal, a leader in omni-channel banking software solutions for Sri Lanka's FinTech sector has started rolling out its software (soft) token solution to local banks.
Offering up a higher level of security that is time based, this solution is a better option when compared to the more expensive hardware tokens.
Part of Fortunaglobal's Affluence omni-channel banking and financial services platform, which is widely recognized as being the benchmark for Sri Lanka's FinTech sector, the Affluence Soft Token is a software-based security token that generates an One Time Password (OTP).
Suren Kohombange
For banks and financial institutions that are looking to introduce additional layers of security, especially for overseas clients who significantly benefit from a short-lived OTP via SMS, this solution offers a great relief from a major pain point.
Further, easy integration, via standard APIs, with any third party solution is an added advantage. Importantly, the solution works seamlessly with any banks existing Internet Banking or Mobile Banking solution.
A replacement for hardware tokens, this solution provides a distinct OTP for each activity, from a shared secret key that is unique to the mobile application installed on one's smart device.
Affluence Soft Tokens add even greater levels of security to Affluence-based banking transactions since, even if an user's traditional password is stolen or compromised, attackers cannot gain access without the OTP, which changes after a set period of time.
Further, the Affluence Soft Token also offers numerous other features, from secure transactions with two factor authentications, to allowing end-users to securely generate the OTP from their desired mobile device, as well as giving them the option to revoke and re-activate Soft Tokens using the same simple activation process. It even provides enhanced compatibility with a wide range of mobile devices.
Commenting, Fortunaglobal CEO Suren Kohombange said, Not only is our Affluence Soft Token solution cost effective compared to more expensive hardware tokens, it also offers greater security.
At the same time, it continues to be flexible and simple to use. All the hallmarks of a revolutionary product that can help banks and financial service companies immeasurably.
Fortunaglobals Affluence suite of B2B and B2C digital banking solutions currently provides next generation services via an omni-channel platform that fast tracks and evolves the delivery of banking and financial services, while at the same time simplifying them for banking staff and end-consumers.

Fragments of the past
Juliet Coombe discovers the artistic beauty of recycling broken china in the historic city of Galle Fort and its similarities with Gaudis mosaics.
New things you can replace. Old things are irreplaceable. Such is the mentality that has underpinned the empire that is now the Historical Mansion, right through from the inventor of the museum, Hussain senior, who has passed the museum onto his eldest son Kamal who now runs it, along with the arcade, gem making workshop in the central courtyard and the fabulous antiques gallery with filigree jewellery that is hundreds of years old. Newness is not important to Kamal, he simply wants to preserve what his father collected so that future generations can understand and appreciate the lives that were lived without electricity hence the notches in the walls for candles and if you wanted water you had to draw it from the central courtyard well.
White colonial archways
The Dutch well that stands in the open courtyard is one of the few things that Hussain did not have to alter, it being one of the oldest and still functioning wells within the Fort. Kamals father was originally a gem merchant who collected antiques simply as a hobby. But he decided to set up the museum as a service to the country, a monument that could live forever, preserving his beloved collection and giving one a valuable snap shot of how we used to live our lives from the way we cooked to how broken China traded in this fascinating merchant city got a new life in his fathers home across the road.
You enter into this time capsule through an old wooden doorframe with a typical Dutch Style gable, underneath a gloriously colourful stained glass window to find yourself in a cool entrance hall framed by enormous white colonial archways. The museum has a specific route which you can follow round the building beginning with an array of ceramic plates, past an old gramophone complete with an interesting selection of records and even a small glass bottle labelled Tsunami Sand, 2004 forever preserved as a reminder of what the country experienced on that terrible day thirteen years ago. A lace maker and an old gem cutter sit side by side, displaying the talents that are so infamous around this area of Sri Lanka.
Kamals favourite part of the museum, however, is the old Sri Lankan kitchen at the back of the building, perfectly conserved the way it would have been many centuries ago, complete with an arched stone oven and small clay pots, the likes of which Kamal tells me, he would not have even found in his grannys house!
That is the beauty of the Historical Mansion. Within it everyone can find something that reminds them of their history or even learn something about it that they never knew before. The VOC slab is the oldest object in the museum-they found it when they were re-constructing the Old Dutch well in the courtyard. Like Antoni Gaudi the family love putting the fragmented colonial and trading history together and in some cases turning them into new ways of seeing something as simple as a broken tea cup.
The historic mansions
I learn how artist Antoni Gaudi had only one romantic love in this world and she loved him not, so he devoted his life to the One above and created some of the most breathtaking and unique architecture the world has ever seen. When someone buys a china pot or plate they dream of having it on show in their drawing room or dining room and they enliven it with a story around its history or how they obtained it but when it meets with some slow motion, fumbling, shattering accident it is wholly broken along with the dream and the story. Thus was the fate of many a china vase on its voyage across the high seas to Sri Lanka, with storm force winds throwing the old seadogs and their crafts about like matchsticks, forever recreating that timeless vision of furniture sliding from wall to wall and possessions spilling out of cupboards with each heave and roll.
Sri Lankans as you will discover walking around the old city of Galle Fort are an ingenious and clever nation spawned from hybrids of incredibly deft and diligent indigenous tribes and pioneering immigrants of many cultures and people that have come and gone in its great trading history of the last half millennium. Never missing an opportunity to recycle and reuse the seemingly useless, with ingenuity, the people would take ships ballasts, in the form of coral and erect the walls of their houses with it. The ballast would weigh the ship down enough for it not to roll over in a storm and in turn would create space for loading up various spoils taken from Sri Lanka. Similarly, the creator of the historic mansions used the broken china that had to be offloaded for creating beautiful patterned mosaics in half moon designs around doorways in his central courtyard. Broken China designs can be found on walls, in temples and on floors, giving new life to each piece and an opportunity to beautify architecture in a wonderful and intricate way. Not only that, the embedding of these colonial broken pieces helps us today, in some cases date from which period the house was built, as with each colonial nation, different broken pieces would arrive, creating a time lock for keen historians.
Gaudis mosaics are amongst the most beautiful in the world as he has a particularly close connection with the earth and nature. This connection can be seen in his absolutely stunning building of the Sagradia Familia where the pillars and arches look like a surreal forest growing within the fabric of the edifice, looking like a cathedral of enveloping trees. His other architectural wonders include many amazing mosaics and his unique gift for making buildings look like they have literally grown, like plants, out of the ground and are in full bloom with incredible arrays of bright colours. So, too, are a number of temples and houses built in Sri Lanka that make use of these ornate broken china mementos of another age, creating new dreams from old broken ones.

High quality transport service in the offing
A high quality transport service will be one of the yardsticks of the sustainable development of Sri Lanka, which is now on a path to development. Railway service will be a powerful transport medium in this respect, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The Minister said this at a workshop on the proposed Colombo Suburban Railway network held at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla on November 17.
Minister de Silva said the development of the Colombo Suburban Railway network was one of the main objectives of the government which had identified the contribution expected from the Sri Lanka Railways towards a national transport network.
As such, the government had planned to launch this project in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank. Under this project the Kelani valley railway line would be developed as a double line with a modern signal system from Maradana up to Padukka.
Furthermore, the treble line from Maradana to Ragama would be developed as a quadruple line and the double line from Veyangoda to Rambukkana would be developed as a triple line.
It had also been planned to develop the Coastline Railway from Colombo Fort to Panadura as a triple line instead of the present double line.
At present, a feasibility study was being done on the Kelani valley line and a report was being prepared to evict unauthorised settlers along the railway line and settle them on suitable alternative places. The Minister said he would request officials to undertake these projects systematically.

Kandy continue their dominance by grounding Airmen
Rugby in the city of Kandy is a moderately popular sport. Before the arrival of rugby, this city was home to a game known as football, today this game is in the funeral parlour. So, now rugby is the number one sport at club and school level.
History makers of club rugby Kandy Sports Club won a turbulent, bloody match of rugby through sheer grit, mental strength and a complete lack of regard for their own safety. They are now ranked once again the number one team. They are the most remarkable side in recent memory.
The history of Sri Lanka rugby has never recorded a club rugby team so dominant since 1994.
In the past 23 years Kandy SC has dominated the league as no other team. They have won the title on 20 occasions and they are the only unbeaten club this season and heading the points table with 4 wins in 4 games, 27 tries, 16 conversions, 4 penalties giving them 179 points against 43, bonus points 3, and total points 23.
Last Saturday they beat Air Force SC at Nittawela by crossing the goal line on 9 occasions, through Dimitri Wijetunga, Tharindu Chathuranga, Fazil Marija, Richard Dharmapala, Anurudda Wilwara, Danush Dayan, Gayan Weeraratne and Srinath Sooriyabandara. Everyone knows the role undertaken by this side, and are all out to put on a good show in the rest of the matches.
Against Air Force SC they dominated the game from the kick-off, they have an insatiable hunger to win every single game they play. It looks like they cannot be beaten by any team. Kandy SCs attacking style of play helps to drive their ability to demolish opponents, and they are blessed with some of the best rugby brains. The way they play rugby it is obviously an expensive game that many other teams dont advocate. No one in the Kandy SC set-up is more important than the players.
Though Air Force SC lost they too played a game of rugby to their best of knowledge, whatever they tried that was the best they could do with a side of this calibre. For the Airmen on the field Kandy SC was too strong. For the defending champions Kandy SC everything seemed to be going well, especially in the second half. All the players were capable of adding flair to the traditional strength of a physical pack. From the opening moments of the kick off, it was nice to see Kandy SC handling the ball well in wet conditions.
They were marshaled by the brilliant captain Gayan Weeraratne. His box kicks and passes were on target and it was no coincidence that it was his darting run in the 44th minute that set up one of the tries. The pack showed more snarl than it has in the earlier games.
In the second half the first 30 minutes Kandy SC played with wonderful fluidity, exploiting Airmens lapses and lack of organization to rack up a points and the Airmens rugby systems started to creak and open holes.
At the final whistle from Ajith Kumara, the Kandy SC fans started cheering their favorite team players as they approached the dressing room. Next Saturday, its another opportunity for Kandy SC to display their wares, against CR & FC at Longden Place.

Met Man says no confusion over deep depression
Confusion over terminology featured prominently in the aftermath of Wednesdays bad weather. Meteorology Department Director General, S. Premalal insisted that the Met Department credibility was not at stake and that they had given ample warning on the deep depression over the Bay of Bengal.
The public however was waiting for a warning of a tropical storm. Premalal stressed that the Department had monitored the situation closely since November 28, and issued continuous warnings.
On November 28, there was an indication of atmospheric disturbances in the Bay of Bengal, but there was no indication of a depression, low or otherwise. This was in the South Eastern Coast. Then on 29th morning it became a low pressure area. By this morning (30), it has moved away from us, and become a deep depression. Last night (29) it turned from low depression to deep depression, he told at a media briefing held at the Disaster Management Ministry yesterday.
This was a sudden development, he said and added that a system which usually developed over a few days, in this instance developed exponentially within 24 hours.
The first advisory on heavy rains, stormy and rough seas was issued at 11am on November 28 by the Meteorology Department.
We have continuously been updating on the weather. On Wednesday morning too we issued a warning and though it did not include thunder showers, we said strong winds up to 70-80km/hr in the sea and 60-70km/hr winds on land could occur,Premalal said.
On Wednesday afternoon, a stakeholder meeting was called and a red warning issued by the Met Department. This was mostly delivered to fishermen and naval officers venturing out to sea,those most at risk. At 8pm on Wednesday, once again a red warning was issued noting that there would be very strong winds especially in southern and south western area.
Premalal further explained that it was wrong to interpret or categorise the deep depression as a tropical storm, We have to stick to certain classifications. We have warned people. I cannot wrongly categorise things, he said commenting on the Department denying earlier this week that a storm was coming as reported in the foreign media.

Manufacturing our very own paper pulp egg trays and cartons using waste paper is just one way in which we achieve this goal.
The company has also invested in renewable energy with the implementation of a 1 mega watt roof mounted solar energy plant at our breeder farm in Walahapitiya. This has helped us set a benchmark in Sri Lanka while minimizingtheir carbon footprint.
As Nel Farms celebrates 75 years, they can take pride in being one of the largest producers of Table eggs and Day old Chicks in Sri Lanka.

Over 51% likely to embrace  new forms of payments - Visa
Over 51% Sri Lankans are likely to embrace new forms of payments and 68% find convenience and security of digital transactions driving the adoption, a Visa survey said.
Visa, the worlds leader in digital payments technology, announced an independent study, conducted in collaboration with YouGov, which measure the consumer sentiment around digital payments in Sri Lanka. The study observed a growing inclination among consumers (51%) in favour of adopting newer modes of digital payments, indicating increased awareness, acceptance and adoption of digital forms of payments among Sri Lankan consumers.
Going cashless is more than a convenience and for many, it has become a preferred choice, says Anthony Watson, Country Manager for Visa in Sri Lanka. More and more consumers are becoming digital natives, expecting a differentiated experience, oriented towards convenience and practical usability. IoT, contactless payment technology, enabling simplified, secure and faster eCommerce experience are some of the trends defining the next wave of the future of payments.
The study shows that while consumers are steadily embracing digital payments, they are also seeking secure payment forms.
One of the factors that surfaced as the key drivers of this adoption include the convenience and security of the digital form factors of payments, as stated by 68% respondents. Among those who have used less-cash currently than before, 55% state that the main reason to transit away from cash include the ease of transaction offered by digital modes of payments.
The survey was aimed at understanding the pulse of the Sri Lankan consumers and their views towards the transition to a digital economy. The study indicates that amongst people for whom this adoption was tough,53% stated they find that merchants they go to only accept cash while 54% find insufficient modes of payments as a key barrier while32% noted that they were worried about the security of their transactions.
Significantly, over half of the consumers (66%) value security more than convenience when it comes to making payments online. This is similar across the board - gender, ages, household income and even education levels.
The survey also highlights a popular trend among Sri Lankans to prefer card payments to pay for special incentives such as hotel and airline tours or holiday promotions which remain popular among Sri Lankan consumers through special credit card offers.
The survey was conducted across three countries, Sri Lanka, India, and Bangladesh and also shows that millennials are more likely to use digital payments for everyday essentials like paying at bus or subway gates, shopping at supermarkets, online, department stores, fast food restaurants, taxis/cabs etc. than earlier generations. The study also shows that the inclination towards embracing digital is higher among those from a higher income household.
While there is a visible shift in consumer spend pattern form cash to digital modes, there is also a clear and willing adoption of this transition among consumers today. People across geographies realise the benefits of adopting digital modes of payment and are open to experimenting with newer forms of payments.
While the study indicates consumer willingness to transition to digital forms of payments, it also highlights the opportunity for the industry to expand digital acceptance footprint across Sri Lanka in keeping with evolving consumer spend patterns. adds Watson.
The study, which sampled people in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka this October, was conducted by market researchers YouGov on behalf of Visa using active sampling, a method that focuses on ensuring the quality of the sample, rather than the quantity of the respondents Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) is the worlds leader in digital payments.

Over 90% of bonds from 2008 to 2014 were direct placements - Minister
State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne, elaborating on the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Treasury Bond issues said it was imperative to investigate Treasury Bond issues between 2008 and 2014, since 90% of them were direct placements.
The Prime Minister made it clear that the Presidential Committee of Inquiry instituted to probe the Bond issue conducted its investigation in a transparent and open manner and that this fresh investigation will follow on those same lines, he said.
The recommendations will be tabled and those found guilty will be answerable to the judiciary.
He added that it was imperative to investigate the Issuance of Treasury Bonds between 2008 and 2014, primarily because 90% of the Bonds were issued on direct placements rather than on open tenders.
The PM showed three orders of the Monetary Board, one of which suggested that as a temporary measure it should go to the Employment Trust Fund. However, despite this being approved, it was eventually bypassed and direct placements were made to third parties.
This he said,would have resulted in a loss to the government and the country. This new investigation will not take away from what has already been conducted but will merely add to it, he said. It would have been impossible for these matters to have been investigated during the previous regime.

Pakistan attack: 'Heavy gunfire' heard at Peshawar training centre

Several people are reported to be injured after gunmen stormed a college in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
At least two gunmen, reportedly disguised in burkas, arrived in a rickshaw and entered the Peshawar Agriculture Training Institute early on Friday morning.
There is a heavy police presence in the area and the incident is still ongoing, media reports say.
The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
The university is thought to have been closed for Eid celebrations.
There were also reports of a blast heard from inside the campus.
Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, has seen some of the worst violence during the Taliban insurgency in recent years.
In 2014 Taliban militants attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, leaving 141 people dead in one of the worst assaults in the country's recent history.

Annual school big matches and carnivals: Beer companies banned from sponsorships: Akila
The government has not approved the sponsorship of beer companies for annual big matches and carnivals of leading schools, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was responding to a question posed by MP Buddhika Pathirana during the oral question round in Parliament yesterday.
We have banned obtaining such sponsorships for any tournament at schools. Measures were taken to ban the advertising intoxicants, The Education Minister said.
MP Buddhika Pathirana said toffees mixed with heroin were sold to schoolchildren.
Tattoo machines have found their way into schools and during school carnivals beer companies set up stalls. Some past pupils associations support this trend, MP Pathirana said.
Minister Akila Viraj said committees were appointed at school level to address the drug menace and implement a programme to minimise children getting into the habit.
It is not that easy to deal with the situation since drugs are available outside schools. We are doing our best to control, and we initiated a programme to arrest those engaged in such activities. Those were now minimised, he said.
Kotte has unapproved high-rise buildings: Harsha
Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said that of 39 high-rise buildings in Kotte constructed in 2015-2016, only four had been approved by the relevant institutions,
The Deputy Minister was speaking at the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of Western Development and Megapolis Ministry were taken up for debate.
He said an audit unearthed the finding.
We obtained 37 files of the 39 projects after going through a tough process. After evaluating them,we found that 12 were constructed without complying with the Jayewardenapura Kotte Development Plan formulated in 2008 and other building regulations but the relevant licences. Another 15 had not approved by the Central Environmental Authority, Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board, and Civil Aviation Authority but the Kotte Municipal Council. The inquiry said the rest, six projects, would not fall into the category of condominiums, de Silva said.
He urged the Megapolis Minister to study the procedure taken to give approval for those condominiums thoroughly. He said many of them were in Kotte.
The countrys capital city does not have a proper sewerage system, he said and urged the Government to give priority for the Kotte sewerage project planned with the JAICA funds.
He urged Minister Patali Ranawaka to take actions against LG officers who had not adhered to the proper procedure in approving the condominiums.
Petitions against LG polls withdrawn: Musthapha
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told the Parliament that the individuals who filed petitions preventing the local government election from being held, agreed to withdraw their petitions.
He said he agreed to provide certain reliefs that the petitioners had pleaded in their petitions.
He was responding to a query made by Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
The JVP leader said he was informed that the Court had refused the motion, to take the petitions against the LG elections on November 30.
He queried what measures would the Minister take to hold the election without delay.
Minister Musthapha said the petitioners agreed to withdraw the petitions after the Prime Ministers discussion with them following the Party Leaders Meeting.
He said the representatives of the Attorney General informed the Court on Thursday that the matter was settled and the petitioners were ready to withdraw the petitions.
Previous regime created bubble development
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said previous regime developed the country under a debt bubble. Instead, the good governance government develop the country through direct investments of the private sector, he said.
He was speaking during the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of Western Development and Megapolis Ministry were taken up for debate.
During the past two years, nearly 500 projects were initiated throughout the country after conducting proper environmental and social evaluations and following proper tender procedures. In 2014, the construction field developed by 14.9 percent. Unlike in the past, now construction is streamlined, he said.
He said the construction sector during the Mahinda-Gota-Basil era developed by a mere 7.5 percent despite the hype they created. In 2014, it was 10.6 percent and in 2015, 2.7 percent and in 2016, 14.9 percent, he said.
During the first six months of 2017, the GDP growth was 3.9 percent, while the construction field developed by 12.8. If not for the revolution we created in the development field, the GDP could have easily dropped another digit. I do admit that there was a development in the construction field during the previous regime, but that was totally based on borrowing putting a huge debt burden on the country. Instead of the credit capital, now development has forging ahead through equity capital, Ranawaka said.
The government has initiated projects that strengthen the future generations instead of placing a heavy debt burden on them. Benefits of these projects are enjoyed by all, not just a privileged family, the minister said. He said the government has joined hands with the private sector to initiate development without putting the country into debt.
The government is democratic. It does not rule with an iron fist. Some were sceptical that without Gota cleanliness in the Colombo city could not be maintained, but we have proved them all wrong and we have achieved the goal of bringing the garbage in Colombo to zero without putting our soldiers to clean up the roads. We achieved our target without threatening the people and sending them white vans. We achieved our goal by educating them and through proper understanding, he said.
MPs hardly use e-Chamber system: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday brought to the notice of Parliament that parliamentarians do not use that much the Chamber Management Information System (e-Chamber) introduced in August 2016.
Speaker Jayasuriya announced that the e-Chamber staff was on standby for a week from December 4 to assist the members to make changes to their passwords.
The Speaker said the staff were also readty attend to the related needs. He said the members must use their fingerprints as the password to access it. The MPs can provide their fingerprints to the e-chamber staff in this regard, he said.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva brought to the notice of the Chair that the e-Chamber system has a major flaw. He said the system was read only and therefore, ineffective. He said a read only facility has no use.
The Speaker said he would bring the matter to the notice of the e-Chamber staff.
Rs. 6000 allowance to be increased to Rs. 10,000:Teacher assistants will be promoted: Minister Akila
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said teacher assistants recruited in 2015 would be absorbed into the teacher cadre.
He was responding to a query posed by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the standing orders 12(2) in Parliament yesterday.
Dissanayake said that around 3,000 teacher assistants were recruited to underprivileged schools. He said they were paid only a Rs. 6,000 allowance per month.
The sum is insufficient to cover even their travelling expenses, the JVP MP said.
The Education Minister said the allowance would be increased to Rs. 10,000 from February 2017.
Teachers who obtained their training certificates in 2017 were absorbed into the 3(1) teacher cadre. Accordingly, 1,013 teachers were recruited to the Sinhala medium and 24 are to be recruited to the Tamil medium this year.
We intend to recruit 589 teachers to the Sinhala medium and 1,605 to the Tamil medium in 2018.
The Sinhala medium will have 164 teachers and the Tamil medium 744 teachers in 2019, the Minister said.

Parliament authorities shortened yesterdays session by one and half hours due to the inclement weather. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced to the House in the morning that the sittings would be adjourned at 5.30 pm and the House agreed.
We will have to adjourn the sessions early today, so that the staff can get back to their homes early, the Speaker said.
Lokuge, Fonseka erupt in verbal battle
A heated exchange of words between Joint Opposition MP Gamini Lokuge and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka ended up in unparliamentary language yesterday.
The argument erupted in Parliament as MP Lokuge insulted Fonseka on a personal note while he was speaking at the Committee Stage debate on Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Regional Development Ministry were taken up.
The members abused at each other even using names of animals and filthy words. JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake, who was chairing the House at the time, promptly ordered to expunge the unparliamentary language used by the two members.
What are you two doing You are insulting Parliament and the people who elected you. Go and have your argument elsewhere, the presiding member warned.
MP Rathnayake reminded MP Lokuge repetitively to stick to the subject being discussed in the House without provoking other members to stand up and reply.
Basangoda Water Project: Previous regime disregarded engineers estimation
The good governance government could save 18.5 percent of the estimated value of the Basangoda Water Project as the previous regime had estimated it higher than the engineers estimation, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government had not amended the water bills for a four-year period and has no idea to increase the bills.
He was speaking during the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget Proposal for financial year 2018 under the finance heads on the ministries of Regional Development, Development Assignment, Megapolis and Western Development, and City Planning and Water Supply.
Minister Hakeem said the first phase of the Basangoda project would provide water for 300,000 people and the second for 200,000 people.
The Minister said the Welivita Water Project would commence as a public private partnership to provide water to Colombo and added that many other projects would commence as PPPs.
He said producing High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipesshould be competitive and the government has a policy decision to encourage local manufactures. He said local company only a local producer was no in the business and foreign investors should be brought in the field to create competition. According to the governments policy decision, it was not done, he said..
He said water to Mannar, Pesalei and Udepuram would be provided under the ADB Dry Zone Project and added that water would be provided to Kalmunei, Samanthurei, and Pothuvil among others.
Hambantota port workers will not be deprived of jobs: Samarasinghe
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the Government had not deprived the Hambantota, Magampura Port workers of their employment.
He was responding yesterday in Parliament to a question raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardena, who alleged that 470 workers of the Hambantota Port were ousted from their jobs and were kept at bay by police.
Minister Samarasinghe said the employees of the Hambantota Port were notified in writing that they could continue work at the port, and they were not deprived of their employments.
We have, in fact, given them the opportunity to obtain compensations and continue work. We have not put them out of their jobs. What they want to do is up to them now, and they need to inform whether they are willing to continue work, he said. Labour and Trade Union Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said a kegutunate company had recruited these workers.
We have to work within this framework since the courts have accepted the company. The issue is in court; we cannot make a decision until court decides.
The Port Authority chairman had made a decision to prevent the workers from entering the port. This is unacceptable. I will discuss with him and resolve the issue, he said.

Plea for rational thought
When one is angry or overcome with hatred one is unaware of what he does or says. Often we repent over what we have done in rage or fury. If so there is no need to exaggerate the ill-effects of harm done to others while you are enraged. When rage enters through the front door reason flies out of the back door, it could be said. Devoid of reason man loses his human characteristic. For rational thought or the power to distinguish between good and bad, between what is beneficial and what is harmful is an attribute only man is possessed of in the Universe.
All other species could only react to the natural or man-made environment. Only man has the ability to transform the environment through the faculty of reason and labor. It is the result of the Second system of signals found only in the human brain, as Russian scientist Pavlov discovered. That is why even the worst architect is better than the bee which weaves a delicate and intricate hive, according to Marx.
Post-independence history
Hence, in the absence of rational thought man descends into the status of a beast. Man becomes inhuman. Communalism or rabid chauvinism reduces man to this inhuman state, as we have witnessed over and over again in our post-independence history. Since the faculty of human rational thought is lacking, our society is unable to understand even the simple day-to-day events. That is why they are blown out of proportion to assume monstrous dimensions. Our attempt today is to explain by few examples how it happens.
Take for example the incident where a Provincial Minister refused to hoist the National Flag at a ceremony in a Vavuniya. This is an isolated incident. No similar incidents took place parallel to it or in the immediate time frame.
If we refresh our memory we would remember that in the immediate aftermath of Sri Lanka winning Dominion status, the then Left called it sham independence and did not take part in celebrations. It boycotted the functions and did not respect the National Flag. Nobody labelled them as traitors. It was accepted as a legitimate form of protest. Even as late as 1974 the JVP delegation at the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Berlin, German Democratic republic did not get up when the Sri Lankan National Anthem was being played in the stadium.
The delegation comprised Rohana Wijeweera, Vaas Tilakaratne, Kelly Senanayake, Somawansa Amarasinghe and Sunila Abeysekera. It was also accepted as a legitimate protest. Customs and traditions vary from country to country. For example, in the United States burning the national flag as a form of protest is an accepted custom. In revolutionary Cuba the US National Flag is never burnt as a respect to the American people despite its resistance and hostility to US imperialism.
If the Provincial Minister has committed an offence it is a refusal to perform a duty after having pledged to defend the Constitution of the country. At best disciplinary action could have been taken against him, according to law. Anyway, breaching promises is a national pastime. Buddhists observe the five precepts at least once a month. Yet it is a pledge breached as soon as it is made. Hence, no need to mention about the breach of promises by politicians.
National Anthem in Tamil
A similar furor was made regarding the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil. That was despite it being sung for decades in Tamil following independence without any harm being done to the Sinhala language.
A huge hue and cry was made to mislead the people that war heroes were being brought before Courts of law. No such a thing has happened. Members of the Security Forces number over 100,000. Yet it is only a handful, purpose less than one percent that is being charged in Courts of law for crimes allegedly committed outside the context of the battlefield against unarmed civilians. This is nothing new. One could recall the Premawathie Manamperi trial, Krishanti Coomaraswamy trial etc. The accused could prove their innocence, if any, at the trial as everything is decided legally and not by a Kangaroo Court.
The same is true of the members of the Buddhist clergy that is being accused of violating the law of the land. Punishing those actually guilty is not a slur on the noble teachings of the religious savants. It rids the religious orders of miscreants and hence purifies them.
There is no convention of granting immunity to criminals among the civilized nations of the world. Even Joseph Stalin who almost single-handedly led the Soviet Armed forces against the fascist war machinery of world magnitude through the sacrifice of over 20 million citizens did not have the privilege of an amnesty for his wrong doings. Hence no need to talk about tin-pot dictators of a lesser calibre. There is no such thing as granting amnesty through gratitude, however great the personality may be or how historic his or her role in history was. We have also precedents in treating VIPs. Remember what happened to Ven. Buddharakkhita and Talduwe Somarama etc.
National question
For decades politicians with the able support of the media have been blowing up trivial incidents into speculative controversies and wasting time without engaging in the tasks of finding solutions to urgent and important problems facing the people. For example, they could for months debate about a non-existent clause in a Constitution yet to be drafted and leave the National question unresolved without even an attempt at solving it. They could haggle over the Office of Missing persons without instituting it properly, equipping it with physical and human resources wanted for its functioning.
People who have lost their sanity are confused and intoxicated with hatred or racial and religious prejudice that they are unable to understand what is happening. They keep on asking Whats happening from everybody with everybody repeating the same question in answering. That is why innocent people fall for cheap promises, for day dreams of politicians to bring in jobs and prosperity without a national plan or programme as if by the power of a magic lamp a la Aladdin.
The political culture that prevailed in the country for decades is such that even now law enforcement officials become paralyzed at moments, especially due to political pressure or force of habit. That is why e police looked on indifferently when the Rohingyan refugees were attacked in their presence in broad daylight and prison officials and members of security forces allegedly committed crimes during the so-called Welikada prison riot. It is due to the same factors that the police as well as the judiciary arrested and deported a British national illegally for bearing a tattoo of the Buddha in her body.
We urgently need a sane society. Reconciliation, peace, development and prosperity could be achieved only then. All of us  parents, teachers, elders, the clergy of all denominations  have failed miserably by the future generations, by the young. Reform should begin within us and amongst us, first of all. It should be top-down and not bottom-up.

Police community services to be improved
Police community services in the Southern region are to be improved.
According to the Director attached to the Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara Condred Ranawake, these programmes are successfully in progress in the Matara district at the moment. The formation of civil security committees at Grama Niladari Division level in the Matara district is already completed. They are to be extended to Galle and Hambantota districts as well.
The police community services will bridge the widening gap between the Police and the civil community in the country. It would also pave the way for the prevention of child abuse, domestic violence against women and also the use of dangerous drugs and liquor. The minimization of minor complaints that are being made to the police by the public and the reduction of the crime rate prevailing in the country are also expected through these programmes, director Ranawake said. The Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara organizes and handles all these programmes in the Southern region. The support of the police would also be mobilized for this.
The Asia Foundation and the British High Commission are assisting in this regard, Ranawake added.

Policy review on the status of health in the plantation sector
Mdecins du Monde (MDM) and the Human Development Organization (HDO) have released a desk policy review on the healthcare delivery system in the plantation sector and the needed actions for improvement.
The launch was held at the residence of the Ambassador for France to Sri Lanka in the presence of Minister Mano Ganeshan, Ministry of National Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Faizal Cassim, Deputy Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and civil society and academia.
Sri Lanka maintains its high standards of health services and education with remarkable health and education indicators, and is identified as a country comparable with the developed world.
A low maternal mortality ratio, low infant mortality rate, high literacy rate, and high life expectancy are some of the key achievements. While this is well recognized and appreciated, still, women and young people in the plantation sector face significant barriers in accessing health services and specifically sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights information and services, which create adverse effects on health and wellbeing of women and youth, violating some of their basic human rights.
MDM, or 'Doctors of the World' in English, is a French medical organization working since 1980 to improve access to universal health care. MDM works in 44 countries across the globe and has been working in Sri Lanka since 2005.
In 2015, MDM started a 1 M project co-funded by Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (French Agency for Development, AFD). The AFD/MDM co-sponsored intervention is implemented by Human Development Organization (HDO), a local organization working in the plantation sector in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, and MDM is also actively working in the Northern Province.
HDO is a rights-based nongovernmental organisation situated in the plantation, promoting rights of plantation community since 1992. Among other things, by its action, HDO contributed to granting of citizenship by the state of Sri Lanka of 265,000 plantation people in 2003.
The overall objective of the work MDM is doing in Sri Lanka with HDO is to improve awareness on sexual reproductive health mainly on knowledge about general SRH issues, service accessibility, availability, to reduce morbidity and mortality linked with STI, unwanted and early pregnancies and gender-based violence in the plantations, with a specific focus on women and youth.
Following this, HDO commissioned two technical experts to conduct a desk policy review to highlight the current health system in the estate sector, challenges and needed actions for improvement.
Health care provision and standards existing in the estate sector are very far distanced from the national health care system in Sri Lanka in terms of quality and benchmarks. The estate population is considered a marginalised group in Sri Lanka as they lag behind in areas such as housing, safe drinking water, nutrition, sanitation and education.
It is a well-known fact that the economic contribution of the estate community is remarkable, but their health needs remain unsatisfied compared to urban and rural segments in the country.
Twenty-five percent (25%) of population in the plantation live without any sanitary facilities (HHI and ES 2012/2013), 35.9% of children under-five (U5) are underweight and the poverty headcount ratio in the estate sector is 10.9% vs 2.1% from urban and 7.6% from rural areas.
There is also a higher incidence of home deliveries (2.2%) in the estate sector compared to 0% in urban and 0.5% in rural areas (DHS 2006). This has created many socioeconomic problems in the estate sector affecting the health of the children, adolescents and women in particular and the men.
Reproductive health services are reaching the estate population on a par with the national population. However, knowledge on sexual and reproductive health and its service provision among the women and youth are low in the estate sector compared to the rural and urban sectors.
Lack of regular mechanism to deliver these services in the estate sector and lack of sexuality education in schools that contributes to low level of SRH knowledge specially for unmarried young people is highlighted in the review.
The desk policy review identified problematic areas existing in the health care delivery system in the estate sector with recommendations to the government and/or the relevant stakeholders directly associated with the health of the estate community. Full integration of the estate health sector into the government system is the main solution identified along with the improvement of education, housing and infrastructure development inside the estates.
Presently, preventive health services of the estate sector are under the provincial health authority but the curative sector is still not completely under the national health system: although the nationalization process of estate hospitals was initiated in 1996, there are numerous factors delaying the process of nationalization.

PROPHET MUHAMMAD - A NOBLE LEADER
Meelad -Un- Nabi celebration falls on the first of December to commemorate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).

Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born to a noble family in the city of Makkah in Arabian Peninsula 1400 year ago in the year 570 AD. The Muslims all over the world follow his guidance as the last and final Prophet of Almighty Allah (SWT) and his qualities and character were attracted by Islamic and non-Islamic scholars with reverence and respect. He was respected by everyone because of the noble qualities he had in his whole life. Especially his qualities in mannerism, humour, peace loving, kindness and mercy, generosity, equality, pleasantness, modesty, concern about orphans and kids, respect to the people of other religions and religious leaders touched everyones heart without race, colour, gender, religion and faith.
Inspirational Leader
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) showed exceptional traits of an unbeaten principal in both religious services as well as in handling a lot of secular issues using his leadership skills. Todays renowned scholars talk about the leadership qualities of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his powerful mission to keep the religion powerful today and the decisions made by him in different circumstances which made success to overcome critical issues. The Leadership of Muhammad is a management book based on the life story and leadership skills of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) written by Professor John Adair, a British academic, a leadership theorist and an author of more than forty books on business and other leadership.
In this book, Professor Adair has taken examples from the life of the prophet Muhammad to highlight the extraordinary qualities as a leader. Professor Adair weaves Prophets life together with aspects of Bedouin culture and ancient proverbs to provide key point for leaders and aspiring leaders and also has taken examples of tribal leadership and essential attributes such as integrity, moral authority and humility of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Further he describes in this book how Prophet Muhammads understanding of the tribal norms of Arabia helped him become an inspirational and effective leader focusing on the qualities and personality traits that made Prophet an exceptional leader, political authority, and a humane role model.
Sir. George Bernard Shaw describes in his book Genuine Islam published in 1936 about the leadership of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), if a man like Prophet Muhammad were to assume the powerful leadership of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring in the much - needed peace and happiness.
As a leader, there are some general characteristics that an individual must possess to become a successful leader such as confident, honesty, communication skills, empathy, optimism, encouraging, intuition, acting as a role model and so on. For Muslims no one has ever come closer to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in having leadership distinctiveness and they consider Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as the greatest reformist and leader.
According to modern scholars pint of view the leadership style showed by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a good example in solving global issues to bring in much-needed peace and happiness.
Humanity of Prophet Muhammad
Well-known personalities and renowned scholars have quoted about the noble qualities and humanity of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Well-known writer and Nobel Prize winner Sir George Bernard Shaw had said in his book Genuine Islam,  I have studied him  a wonderful man and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ, he must called the Saviour of Humanity.
Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Ghandi said in YOUNG INDIA journal, I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days it was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet Muhammad, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and his own mission.
On June 8, 632 AD (Twelfth day of Rabi-Ul- Awwal) Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) passed away at the age of 63 after a short illness. His 23 years of powerful prophetic mission and teaching under an exceptional leadership 1400 year ago is realistic and result-oriented.

Reflect on Prophets teachings: PM
Muslims all over the world believe that Prophet Mohamed was the Last Prophet, the one who preached a message of goodwill and peace to the world, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Milad Un Nabi message.
The message added: He lived a life exemplary to his followers, filled with kindness, love, compassion, fellowship and sharing.
He brought unity and peace to Medina in Saudi Arabia, which at the time was torn by sectorial violence and strife. Today, all Muslims gather at Medina, a holy and a sacred shrine in Islam. It is imperative that we recall this on his sacred day of birth.
In commemorating this occasion with the deepest bonds of fellowship and co-existence, it is time for us to reflect on the values he taught and shared with the world, as we look to emerging as one nation in a spirit of peace and harmony.
I take this occasion to wish all Muslims celebrating the Prophet's Birthday, a blessed time of rejoicing.

'She's beautiful, like an angel!'
US First lady Melania Trump hosted children to the White House Monday as she walked through a fully-decorated executive mansion, unveiling her vision of a Trump Christmas  simple, yet elegant, with elements of Americana and nature.
'She's beautiful, like an angel!' one young boy remarked, as the first lady  whose cream-colored belted dress with bell sleeves could have been worn by a tree topper  walked into the East Room to help a group of kids make garland. 'Are you the first lady' another youngster asked. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made sure to note that Melania Trump 'personally selected and was involved in every detail' of the decorations unveiled today.
Melania Trump entered the holiday festivities by taking the grand staircase, into the foyer, as three ballerinas danced to 'The Nutcracker Suite,' in a room filled with faux fur trees glistening with snow.
The dancers and the song were symbolic as 'The Nutracker Suite' was the first theme used at a White House Christmas. This year's theme, 'Time-Honored Traditions,' piggybacked on that, which each room paying homage to a tradition, including a Gold Star tree, a way to respect fallen troops,and a gallery of silhouettes of past presidents in the Green Room, acknowledging an early craft.
As the first lady entered the various rooms, she made small talk with the young kids, all students locally at Joint Base Andrews, in Prince George's County, Maryland, right outside of Washington, D.C.
'What are your plans for Christmas' she asked. 'Did you write your letter yet Do you have any pets at home'
Before the first lady arrived in the East Room, decorated with several large trees and the White House creche, the children's chaperone told them to 'act natural,' as they grinned for the cameras.
When FLOTUS arrived they all went in for the group hug. 'So how is it going This is so cool right' the first lady later asked when walking into the Red Room, which was decorated with gingerbreads and candies. Singing a similar tune to her predecessor, Melania Trump warned, 'A lot of sugar right' as she helped the group assemble gumdrop Christmas trees. In the Green Room, a quartet of kids cut out their own silhouettes to go along with the presidential ones hanging on the nearby mantel, which was also decorated with a large 'Merry Christmas' banner. In the Blue Room, the first lady didn't host guests Monday, because the size of the Endeavor-Wisconsin based Christmas tree.
The tree, which she and 11-year-old Barron greeted last week in front of the White House, is so large at 18 feet, 6 inches, it takes up nearly the whole room. The Trumps decorated the tree with ornaments from all the states and territories, along with blue bulbs and large gold and blue bows.
The downstairs of the East Wing was fully decorated too, with reporters allowed into the Library, the Vermeil Room and the China Room before the first lady's guests were let in. In the Dining Room, a table was set for Christmas dinner, featuring a table purchased for the White House by President James Monroe.
Being good Republicans, the Trumps chose to adorn the table with President Ronald Reagan's red and gold china.
In the Library, the Trumps put out an 1866 edition of Charles Dickens' a Christmas Carol, protected by glass. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had read the the story at the White House each year he was in office, the White House noted.
Melania Trump continued her tour by sitting down with another group of children in what's called the 'Bookseller's Area' downstairs.
There, they colored White House Christmas cards underneath a display of Christmas cards sent out by the president and first lady going back to the Dwight D. Eisenhower years.

Silk Road presents more opportunities than  just laying foundations for infrastructure
Chinas Belt and Road (B&R) initiative is an ambitious undertaking that has the potential to reshape the global economy and transform world trade.
Many governments, multinational development organisations and international corporations welcome the opportunity to support the series of cross-border infrastructure projects.
With over 60 countries and 4.4 billion people included in the route passing from Asia to Africa, covering a third of world GDP, the economic and financial benefits of B&R are likely to go beyond the countries getting new bridges, railway lines and roads.
Countries such as Singapore, which are well positioned along the Silk Road, will form crucial links between China and other countries along the route, helping drive B&R. But many corporations are either unsure of how they can be meaningfully involved or are doubtful that the initiative is relevant for organisations not in the business of building airports and roads. Others are concerned about the risk-return trade-offs of such investments, as they come with long payback periods.
These concerns are not without merit. It is important that organisations conduct proper due diligence and risk assessments before embarking on any venture. However, it is also critical that businesses, regardless of size and types of expertise, proactively seek B&R opportunities or they risk being left behind.
The risk of being left behind
Chinas mega project is less about the hard physical aspects of infrastructure than the connecting of businesses and populations. Instead of focusing on pure infrastructure ventures, companies need to consider the business opportunities better-connected B&R countries can offer, as the spillover effect is simply too large to ignore.
Increasingly, organisations across Asia need to view B&R as a business enabler in a region facing an ageing population and increased youth migration. Evolving demographics and urbanisation are expected to transform consumption patterns, changing the way goods and services are delivered as innovation takes shape.
For companies to take advantage of opportunities provided by B&R and changing demographic trends, collaboration and competitive differentiation are key. Establishing your competitive edge
Smaller companies can partner with bigger conglomerates on B&R projects which the former may otherwise not be able to secure or have the resources to take on singlehandedly.
And instead of competing head-on with Chinese companies with a greater advantage in capital-intensive construction projects, businesses with less construction expertise should focus on their competitive advantages. For businesses in Singapore, this includes competing in areas such as intellectual capital and local infrastructure-related consultancy services such as designing policy frameworks and structuring projects to ensure appropriate returns on infrastructure investments.
Chinas plan of a digital Silk Road, which requires the growth of telecoms infrastructure and networks, will also provide opportunities for online retail and digital businesses, as widespread access to internet services will pave the way for greater cross-border e-commerce. Brokering deals
Asian countries like Singapore, with their well developed financial capabilities, are likely to become important partners for Chinas overseas infrastructure plans. Their renminbi capabilities will provide alternative products to major-currency funding options. Given its financial hub and shipping centre status, Singapore can also broker both capital and trade deals between China and ASEAN.
The B&R path ahead is worth travelling. The journey will require an open attitude and a global vision but as long as businesses are able to identify their niche and strengths, the B&R will present more opportunities than can be imagined.

SILVA third ton maker at the house of Lords
Left hand batsmen like left arm bowlers in cricket are very rare. They are born and not made. And when they do come, unlike right-handers, they are a treat to watch especially at peak performance.
But a left-hander who in addition to his batting that was stylish and eye catching was also a rare wicket keeper who excelled in both aspects, starting at school level and later crowning it by representing the country is AMAL SILVA who grew into our Legend.
Early Cambrian
SAMPATHWADUGE AMAL ROHITHA SILVA learnt his early trade at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa before joining the Bambalapitiya school St. Peters College and motoring on the highway to stardom a few years after the country gained entry into the elusive club of Test status.
Luck plays a big part in sport like in life and SILVA had the fortune of winning his Test cap when regular wicket keeper Guy De Alwis suffered an injury and had to stay out. He won his Test cap and his crowning moment and one that he will not forget was when he joined a rare band of batsmen who have scored a hundred (102 not out) at the house of Lords in England.
He faced 255 deliveries and sticking it out in the middle for 320 minutes in the second innings the home of English cricket which country gave the wonderful game to the world.
Seam and swing
He faced the seam and swing of Ian Botham, Jonathan Agnew, Paul Allott and the off spin of Pat Pocock. He thus became the third Lankan to score a hundred at Lords, the first two being Sidath Wettimuny 190 and Captain Duleep Mendis 103 in the first innings.
Playing with and against the elite in world cricket was unjustly denied the country for long until Gamini Dissanayake came along as President of Sri Lanka Cricket to work the oracle. What Dissanayake did to bowl out the lords at Lords is well documented in history, needs no reiteration and like good wine needs no bush. On the subject of cricket and the revered name of Dissanayake cannot, but be mentioned.
Now to SILVA the dusky little left hand batsman and wicket keeper who was stylish with bat and the large gloves. He had it in him to negotiate the new ball with aplomb and play seam, swing or pace with ease and trouble the scorers which batting is all about.
Behind the stumps
Then behind the stumps he was safe rarely missing but grabbing the snicks and whipping off the bails when bowlers lured batsmen out of the crease. A good wicket keeper should have the ability to spot the weakness of a batsman, read how the wicket is playing and advice the captain and bowler accordingly. And SILVA had that ability in abundance.
He was undoubtedly an asset to a team and captain.
SILVA had the rare and good fortune of coming under the coaching of that great former Peterite Dr. H.I.K. Fernando Asias best glove man in the pre Test era during his formative years at the Bambalapitiya school after moving from the Moratuwa school. Fernando taught him the tricks of the trade and also taught him how to play a straight bat, that is so important not only in sport, but in the all important life as well.
That essential early grooming helped him to serve his school well in the game, helping them to many victories before branching out into the mans world of club and Sri Lanka cricket.
Joining NCC
SILVA chose right in joining the Nondescripts Cricket Club and coming under the guidance and influence of another classic, NCC and country glove man in my former team mate at SBC and another Fernando in Ranjit. It was from there that he graduated and made the dream of every cricketer come true that of sporting the Sri Lankan cap.
SILVA who played in only just nine Tests scored his second ton against India in the Second Test at the SSC making the nelson 111 and capping it all by grabbing nine catches and a stumping. In the First Test although not making a big score pocketed nine catches and then scoring a century. Having to wear the big gloves behind the stumps and then revert to smaller gloves in opening batting was too strenuous and his form dipped which forced the selectors to look at other options. SILVA later served Sri Lanka as a selector.

Sweet Tongues..!
"Oh Bob!" she said as I entered the hall for a meeting and she held my arm, "where've you been"
"Bbbut, bbbut," I stammered, "I just missed coming here once!"
"I missed you," she said and just as I was getting ready to fall into her arms when I saw her eyes flit to someone else in the room and her grip on my hand relaxed and she was up and away. I watched as she gave the same treatment to another gullible fellow and then grinned to myself, "Sweet tongue!" I said to myself.
Over the years I've come across dozens like this woman, men who come up to me and utter the most heavenly lines and women who even go farther, but whose words mean nothing.
Some of them succeed, like Moses Mendelssohn:
Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of the famous German composer, was short of stature and even worse was hunch backed. He was also madly in love with the attractive daughter of a rich merchant in Hamburg.
One day when he visited the merchant he was allowed to up to her room to see her. The beautiful young woman was repulsed by his misshapen figure and did not even look up at him. Several attempts to make conversation with her failed.
Finally Moses asked in a low tone, "Do you believe marriages are made in heaven"
"Yes," she replied, "And do you"
"Yes I do," replied Moses and then continued, "When a boy is born, the Lord in heaven announces which girl he will marry. At my birth I was shown my future bride, but was told, "Your wife will be humpbacked! But I pleaded and said, Lord it would be a tragedy for the woman to be humpbacked; give me the hump and let the woman be beautiful and my prayer was answered!"
Well needless to say Moses got his bride, and I hope he had as good a heart as he had a tongue!
Then there's the tale of a priest who was famous for his preaching! He now lay on his deathbed. Reviewing his life he realized he had used his eloquence to build up his reputation more than leading people to a spiritual life, so he felt troubled. A friend of his noticing his discomfort came over to his bedside and said reassuringly, " Have courage Fr Joe, when you die and go before God, just remind him of the excellent sermons you've preached."
Fr Joe replied sadly and this time there was no oratory in his voice, "if the Lord does not remember them then there is certainly no use in me reminding him of them!"
Count Charles Talleyrand said, "Speech, was given to man to disguise his thoughts!"
Sounds familiar isnt it, when we hear politicians who dont mean what they say But it puts a responsibility on you and me doesn't it We need to look beyond the sweetness of a gifted tongue..!

Whist this looks favourable on the face of it, production is below the 2015 October figure of 26.8 Mnkg and 28.1 Mnkg harvested in 2014. Sri Lanka is yet to get back to pre El-Nino production levels and every month this year has recorded lower quantities compared with the corresponding period of 2015.

Temperament lacking in our batsmen  Former World Cup star Gurusinha
Thursday: Asanka Gurusinha, the former Sri Lanka batsman who played a pivotal role as a solid number 3 for many years and helped the country win the 1996 cricket World Cup is of the view that the present crop of batsmen lack the temperament to play long Test innings.
Gurusinha a master of denting some of the best bowling attacks in the world paved the way with his batting for strokemakers like Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga to dominate the bowling.
Whats happening today is that the top order by not batting for a length of time and pushing the bowlers to come for their third and fourth spells are exposing the middle order too early when the bowlers are still fresh which has resulted in Sri Lankas rather abysmal displays.
The biggest issue we are having is that we are not batting three or four sessions. Thats where we are struggling. We have always had fantastic batting line ups. Not too long ago, we had guys like Mahela, Sanga and Thilan batting so well for us, said Gurusinha presently the teams cricket manager and a national selector.
When you are getting 150s you are going to bat for four sessions. The biggest thing right now is that we dont have batsmen at the moment who have batted for four sessions in the last 18 months other than I would say Chandi (Chandimal) and Dimuth (Karunaratne). If you are going to get 400 runs in an innings, you need at least one guy to bat long. That was one reason why we won against Pakistan as we scored 400 plus and batted for more than 150 overs.
Dimuth and Chandi havent clicked. Chandi showed lot in the last Test. He showed there werent any demons. Dimuth was perhaps unlucky in the second innings. He knows that we have great expectations of him. The rest of the batsmen have not done that. We cant expect Chandi and Dimuth to everyday score runs. As batsmen you are going to fail. That is the time we need the rest of the batters to rise to the occasion, he said.
Gurusinha said that three or four years ago the batting was good and one had to observe the cricket the present day cricketers play and how they handle tough situations.
It is the temperament that is lacking. We might concede two maidens and then hit some big shots. Our head coach Nic Pothas did some analyzing, in the last innings, 65 percent of our runs were scored in boundaries. Whereas India scored in excess of 600 and only 35 percent of those runs were in boundaries. It shows that we are so aggressive and search for boundaries and lack temperament and patience required to building an innings, Gurusinha pointed out.
That is what the other sides are doing. I dont want to bring India as an example because they are so good, but if you take Steve Smith, he won that game for Australia and he batted for over 400 minutes. That changed the game for Australia. You have to get these guys up and running. We have to seriously take a look at the cricket we play at all levels from provincial to club cricket and get players to start batting and scoring those big hundreds. I am very pleased to see Kaushal Silva getting 140, I know it was a two-day game, but I think he batted for three sessions. If we can get six to eight batsmen doing that, Sri Lanka cricket will benefit, he said.
TOO MUCH T20 CRICKET
When it was pointed out that in the eighties and nineties domestic cricket was one and half days duration and Sri Lanka still produced top class batsmen, Gurusinha said, The reason is that today they are playing so much of T20 cricket. Young guys who are coming into the Test squad are playing too much T20 cricket. Even schools are playing T20 tournaments. They are focusing on that. When you come to a two-day game or three-day game they keep playing all these shots, but Test cricket is Test cricket. The name says it all. It tests your mental toughness and your skill. Thats what we are lacking at the moment.
How is it that India benefits playing all those T20 IPL tournaments
I was talking to a couple of people in the Indian coaching staff and it is their Ranji trophy which is quite strong. You take the Ranji Trophy there are big scores in every game. Even though they play IPL, all the players need to go back to Ranji Trophy and perform, said Gurusinha. Everyone is talking about Bumrah as a T20 bowler, he is playing Ranji Trophy and is amongst the wickets. I think India has told him that they are interested in him playing Test cricket, but youve got to go back and prove it to us. What IPL has done is to give so much talent and they are harnessing it in so many areas, one-days and Tests and building on that. I would love to have that kind of a situation where we have to drop or rest a player and the replacement is someone who averages 50 in Tests.
COACHES GIVE PLAYERS PIECE OF THEIR MIND
Gurusinha said that he hoped in the next six months or so the proposals Sri Lanka Cricket has put in place will change things. You are not going to get results overnight. Short term you have to look at club cricket and work these things out. However it is up to the players as well what they want to achieve. The coaching staff sitting on the side they are killing themselves. They are doing everything. The only thing they cant do is to get to the middle and do it. The game has to be handled by the individual.
Suffering the heaviest Test defeat Gurusinha said was very tough and painful and added, Nic Pothas was absolutely right, we couldnt see any fight in the second innings or in the first innings. You have to give everything you have. That is the way we play for. I would give my life for my country. That was lacking in some players.
Pothas and Thilan Samaraweera had a very stern chat with the players. Their thoughts on how they played. First innings we lost six wickets to straight balls. Second innings it was poor batting. Some of the shots were so bad. Then you saw Suranga Lakmal batting as if nothing was happening there. We need our top six firing. What I said before coming here is that if our batting clicks we are fine, but if our batting fails, then we are in for trouble.

Thirimanne in danger of losing his place to Dhananjaya
Thursday: Sri Lanka are looking at changes to their batting order as well as taking a decision on who would replace the injured Rangana Herath for the third and final cricket Test against India starting at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Saturday.
Sri Lanka trail 1-0 in the three-match series and need to put up a much better batting performance than they displayed at Nagpur to salvage something out of the series and prevent India from beating them 2-0. The rain-hit first Test was drawn at Kolkata.
One of the batting changes Sri Lanka have in mind is the important number three slot where Lahiru Thirimanne has failed to fulfill the early promise he showed and has struggled so far to produce the runs required of a batsman in that position. Ever since he was brought back to the no. 3 slot in the series against Pakistan in the UAE, Thirimanne has produced just one half century in six innings. A good part of his dismissals have been due to poor shot selection that has led to his downfall.
It is to me the most important position in the batting order  number three, said Asanka Gurusinha, who was one of the successful number three batsmen Sri Lanka had when they won the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Sometimes you walk in the first over or you stay in the dressing room for two three sessions. Its the mental switch that you have to do between certain scenarios. It is affecting us. It is a lie if I say no. Thiri played some very bad shots in the last game which he shouldnt have. You said the word temperament and that is lacking.
Dimuth (Karunaratne) and the other openers the momentum has to be built for the rest of the batsmen. We have stroke makers coming in from Angelo (Mathews). We had Aravinda (de Silva) who was a stroke-maker, if you bring Aravinda in the 30th over you know that he will just keep batting and get big scores. Same like Mahela Jayawardene when he comes in 30th or 35th over and thats easy for him. We need to look at what we are doing at number three, said Gurusinha currently playing the role of cricket manager as well as national selector.
One option Sri Lanka has for the number three position is to give it to Dhananjaya de Silva who sometimes opens the batting for his club Ragama CC and fared quite well in the recently concluded Sri Lanka A tour to the West Indies scoring a century and two half-centuries in leading his team to a 2-1 win in the unofficial test series. It was this performance that won him a recall to the national side for the current tour and he finds himself a step away from taking on the all important no. 3 position which has become a nightmare for the team since Kumar Sangakkara retired in August 2015.
The other batting option Sri Lanka are looking at is the number 7 spot which at the moment is occupied by batting all-rounder Dasun Shanaka. With Dhananjaya de Silva will also able to turn his arm over bowling off breaks, uncapped Roshen Silva is being looked as a possibility.
Despite Sri Lanka calling for uncapped leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay as replacement for injured Rangana Herath, Lakshan Sandakan who has taken 20 wickets from 7 Tests with his left-arm chinaman deliveries looks the most likely choice to replace the veteran spinner.

Treasury Bond saga explodes on Joint Opposition
The Treasury Bonds issuances from 2008 to 2014 will be investigated once the on-going Presidential Commission probe into the Bonds issue is concluded, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declared in Parliament yesterday. Making a special statement in the House, the Prime Minister likened the method followed in Treasury Bonds issuances till 2015, to a pyramid scam.
Tabling a report obtained from the Central Bank on Treasury Bonds issuances from 2008-2014, the PM said the overwhelming majority of Bonds had been issued on direct private placements and that process seriously lacked transparency. During the said period, Rs.5,147 billion worth of Bonds had been issued and out of that, Rs 4,702 billion had been direct private placements.
The direct private placements accounted for 90 percent of the total Bond issuances. The total value of Bonds issued from the public auction method stood at only Rs 435.5 billion, the Premier pointed out.
He said Bonds had been issued to a few selected primary dealers at arbitrarily decided interest rates without Monetary Board approval.
The direct private placement method had been heavily misused. That is why we decided to shift to public auctioning, with the aim to replace the corrupt system with a transparent and effective system. We have obtained the USA expertise to streamline the auctioning system, he noted.
The Premier said the former Government had no Monetary Board approval to raise money through direct private placements, as it dominantly did.
When we inquired in March 2015, it was stated that the Monetary Board decision was to raise money through captive sources to meet the short term financial requirements of the Government. For example, the Monetary Board had recommended issuing Bonds from the ETF, EPF and National Savings Bank etc, the Prime Minister said.
Wickremesinghe said while tabling the Monetary Board decision.
The Prime Minister, pledging to investigate the massive scam behind the bonds issuances from 2008-2014,said it could be termed the largest pyramid scam.
He added the large scale scams in the Stock Market during the same period would also be investigated. He also directed the attention of the Public Finance Committee to probe into the loans obtained and bonds issued without the knowledge of Parliament.
He said the Government, since 2015, had only raised Rs.157.5 billion through direct private placements at four occasions. I obtained a report from the Central Bank on the total amount of money the Government has to pay from 2017-2045 for treasury bonds and their interests. As per the report, we have to pay Rs 4,154 billion for Treasury Bonds till 2045 and Rs 3,086billion as their interests. The government will have to raise more money through bonds in the future. Therefore the above figures will further rise. We will carry forward the Vision 2025 plan to strengthen the economy in order be in a strong position to repay these massive debts, he added.
The Premier, outlining the measures taken by the Government to resurrect the economy, said it targets a rapid increase in the Gross Domestic Product by 2025, thus improving the countrys ability to confront the debt burden.
The Prime Minister, while assuring his Governments commitment to strengthen Parliaments control over public finance said the transparent mechanisms put in place have paved the way for credible investigations.
The President and I are committed to usher in a new political culture. It is a new experience and a complicated process. Mistakes can happen, but let us go forward rectifying them. Unlike the Rajapaksa regime, we are not ready to cover up wrong doing, trample the supremacy of the law and bury social justice. On January 8 we took over a country trapped in a debt crisis, where there was no law. Fraud and corruption were rampant and the country was engulfed in terror. Our Government,led by the President,is on track to change this plight. That road is difficult and full of traps. I pledge to continue this mission to create a civilized Government, just society and a democratic Sri Lanka, he concluded.
