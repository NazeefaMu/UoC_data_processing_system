How Sri Lanka can Benefit from IoT Revolution
A person wants to have his urine tested. He dips a test stripe similar to litmus paper in to his urine and takes a photograph of it from his smart phone.
Then he uploads the image to an app. After several minutes he gets his urine test results. Above story is not a science fiction where a writer predicting how the world is going to look like in the future. Healthy.io of Israel is doing exactly that. This is possible thanks to the technological advances in sensor technology, telecommunication, and computing joining together.
In the above example test stripe and smartphone camera act as sensors. Vast advances in wireless and fiber communication makes it possible to send those images to a server located in the other side of the world within few seconds. Advances in machine learning and big data analysis makes it possible for the server to analyze the image and then predict clinically useful parameters of a urinesample from it.
Dr. Vijitha R. Herath
Above is an example from thousands of more such examples how advances in sensor technology, telecommunication, and computing facilitate new and innovative business ideas. Internet of Things (IoT) revolution would make converting new and innovative business ideas to reality that much easier.IoT is defined as The interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.
A modern smartphone consists of around ten advance sensors most prominent one being high resolution camera. Others include gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor, magnetometer, and etc. In most cases sensors function of IoT can be performed using modern smart phones. Therefore, for a country with an advanced telecommunication infrastructure and advanced computing expertise it would be easier to utilize IoT revolution for the economic benefit by building new and innovative businesses.
The beauty of IoT is the ease it offers in building new business by minimizing capital requirement. In the example given in the previous paragraph customer has the sensor. Data exchange can be done through internet cheaply. Most of the capital goes to setting up high performance computing facilities. With the recent advances in computer technology cost for such facilities has gone down drastically.
Now lets look at Sri Lankan scenario. Sri Lanka has a well-developed state of the art telecommunication network that provides broadband internet access to a large section of populace. Usage of smartphones is ubiquitous in Sri Lanka.
The third ingredient necessary to successfully deploy IoT based business is the expertise in advanced computing. Lets look into this area more closely. Being a country with a large agriculture based industry, maintaining the quality of agricultural products reaching the markets is important to ensure the customer confident. If the customer confidence about a range of products deteriorate due to substandard quality of certain items, then customer will refrain from buying products from the whole range even though most items in the product range are of good quality. If there is a cost effective way of identifying substandard products earlier in the supply chain, then it could be possible to stop them from reaching the markets. IoT can help solve this problem. But, how Suppose there is anexpert database that has gathered large amount of image information of a certain food product with a varying degree of quality. From this huge dataset it could be possible to extract certain parameters that points to the product quality. To do this, experts in the fields of food science, data analysis, and computing should get together and develop machine learning algorithms that enable computers to use huge quantities of data and come up with sensible quality parameters. Once this goal is achieved a buyer in the middle of the supply chain can take an image of the food product from his smartphone and upload the image to the expert database through an app.
When an image is received the expert database could analyze the image and grade the quality of the food product using information already existing in the system. Theresult can be conveyed back to buyers smartphone through internet. This process may take few minutes and the wholesale buyer could be able to verify the quality of the product he is buying. This brings us to the point we are trying to address. In order to build advance computing expertise that can perform tasks similar to the one discussed earlier it is necessary to train human resource in the areas of data analysis and machine learning algorithm development and bringthem together with subject experts in the individual areas of interest.
Therefore, in order for Sri Lanka to extract full benefit from the IoT revolution happening around us today, she needs take steps to develop human resources in the areas of data analysis and machine learning algorithm development as a beginning. Parallel to that steps need to be taken to improve the awareness among university and school students about business opportunities arising from the IoT revolution. With a competent workforce it would be easy for entrepreneurs to execute their innovative IoT based business ideas.

Kim promises no more nuclear or missile tests
SOUTH KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he would halt nuclear tests and intercontinental missile launches, in a Saturday announcement welcomed by US President Donald Trump ahead of a much-anticipated summit between the two men.
Pyongyangs declaration, long sought by Washington, will be seen as a crucial step in the fast diplomatic dance on and around the Korean peninsula.
It comes less than a week before the North Korean leader meets South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a summit in the Demilitarised Zone that divides the peninsula, ahead of the eagerly-awaited encounter with Trump himself.
But Kim gave no indication Pyongyang might be willing to give up its nuclear weapons, or the missiles with which it can reach the mainland United States.
The North had successfully developed its arsenal, including miniaturising warheads to fit them on to missiles, Kim said, and so no nuclear test and intermediate-range and inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fire are necessary for the DPRK now.
As such the Norths nuclear testing site was no longer needed, he told the central committee of the ruling Workers Party, according to the official KCNA news agency.
The party decided that nuclear blasts and ICBM launches will cease as of Saturday -- the North has not carried any out since November -- and the atomic test site at Punggye-ri will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the end of testing.
Within minutes of the report being issued, Trump tweeted: This is very good news for North Korea and the World -- big progress! Look forward to our Summit.
Seoul too welcomed the announcement, calling it meaningful progress towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But Kim offered no sign he might be willing to give up what he called the Norths treasured sword, saying its possession of nuclear weapons was the firm guarantee by which our descendants can enjoy the most dignified and happiest life in the world.
Pyongyang has made rapid technological progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, which has seen it subjected to increasingly strict sanctions by the UN Security Council, the United States, the European Union, South Korea and others.
Last year it carried out its sixth nuclear blast, by far its most powerful to date, while Kim and Trump traded threats of war and personal insults as tensions ramped up.
Even when there was an extended pause in testing, US officials said that it could not be interpreted as a halt without an explicit statement from Pyongyang.
South Korean envoys have previously cited Kim as promising no more tests, but Saturdays news is the first such announcement directly by Pyongyang. Analysts cautioned that the declaration was promising but limited.
Certainly this is a positive development, said Daniel Pinkston of Troy University. Its a necessary but not sufficient step in North Korea returning to its past non-proliferation commitments.
And Christopher Green of the International Crisis Group added on Twitter: I dont see how North Korean statement constitutes a step toward denuclearisation. It is a moratorium on testing, but recommits North Korea to nuclear weapons status.
Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, described North Koreas annoucement as a strong signal and an important step in the right direction.
But he called for North Korea to sign up to the nuclear test ban treaty alongside the seven other countries who have still yet to do so: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and the United States.
Japan -- which has seen missiles fly over its territory -- gave a mixed response, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offering a cautious welcome but his defence minister saying North Korea did not mention the short- or medium-range missiles that put Tokyo within reach.
Beijing said it believed the move would help to promote the process of denuclearisation and attempts to find a political settlement on the peninsula.
UN chief Antonio Guterres hailed Kims announcement as a positive step forward on the path towards denuclearisation.
The EU also welcomed it while Russia said it was an important step towards the future easing of tensions on the peninsula. - AFP

Kipchoge, Cheruiyot celebrate Kenyan double at London Marathon
LONDON, Sunday - Eliud Kipchoge stormed to his third London Marathon title on Sunday to complete an impressive Kenyan double after Vivian Cheruiyot dominated the womens race in warm conditions.
Kipchoge, 33, saw off the challenge of Ethiopias Tola Shura Kitata and home favourite Mo Farah to win his third race in the British capital in four years in a time of 2 hrs 4 min 27 sec, finishing more than half a minute in front of Kitata (2:05:00), with Farah third (2:06:32).
Cheruiyot, 34, timed her run perfectly to win the womens event in a time of 2 hours 18 min 31 secs ahead of compatriot Brigid Kosgei (2:20:13), and Ethiopias Tadelech Bekele (2:21:40).
Kipchoge, the winner in 2015 and 2016, led the way in the mens race with Ethiopian great Kenenisa Bekele and last years winner Daniel Wanjiru of Kenya also in the mix. Farah was at the back of the lead group despite twice making a mess of picking up his water bottle at the designated drink stations.
The British track great, who won gold in the 5,000 metres and 10,000m in the past two Olympic Games, admitted his second full marathon had taken its toll in a race where there was a world record pace at the halfway point.
I am knackered, said the 35-year-old, who broke the British marathon record.
The guys went for it, they were on for world record pace, so it was do or die. I went with it and hung in as much as I could.
Its so different to the track. Its incredible. Its different pain, different training but Ive really enjoyed it. I gave it all, 110 per cent as I normally do.
Cheruiyot took advantage of failed attempts to break Paula Radcliffes 15-year-old world record by last years winner Mary Keitany and runner-up Tirunesh Dibaba.
In unusually warm conditions, first Dibaba and then Keitany dropped off the pace, allowing the 2016 Olympic 5,000m gold medallist to claim victory. After nine miles Keitany and main rival Dibaba were 25 seconds ahead of Radcliffes time. But Dibaba was soon reduced to a walking pace to leave Keitany with only her two male pacemakers for company.
Keitany, looking for a fourth win in London, also started to slow down as it became apparent Radcliffes record of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds would not be threatened.
Britains David Weir won the mens wheelchair race for the eighth time after a thrilling sprint finish. The 38-year-old pipped Switzerlands Marcel Hug into second place, with Daniel Romanchuk of the United States third.  AFP

Kuda Wewel Dalaya detected with gunshot injury
The baby elephant known as Kuda Wewel Dalaya frequenting the main road bordering the Digampathaha reserve in Dambulla has sustained a gunshot injury in one of its legs. Officers attached to the Sigiriya Wildlife Office noticed it during an inspection tour conducted on April 20 following a tip off.
After close observation the wildlife officers noticed that the wound had festered. As the elephant attempted to pounce on the officers, they had to drive it away into the jungle by firing an Ali Wedi.
Wildlife officer W.M. Bandaranaike said the baby elephant and six other elephants who come to the reserve to feed on the garbage collected from Dambulla and dumped there have received gun shot wounds mostly caused by trap guns.

## Title: Lalith

## Section: Editorial

Lalith
Twenty five years ago, this day, Sri Lanka lost one of her illustrious sons to an assassins bullet, who, had he lived, would certainly have gone on to change the course of the country's political history and carve a niche for himself among the great leaders in post independence Sri Lanka.
Lalith Athulathmudali was no ordinary politician but one who was cast in the mould of an SWRD Bandaranaike. He was on the same intellectual plane as SWRD, both being Oxford alumni, and spoke with authority on many topics. To him politics was only a vehicle by which he strove to achieve his vision for the larger good of the country. It is indeed the country's misfortune that it had to lose a statesman of the calibre of Lalith Athulathmudali in the prime of his life before the full effect of his multifaceted talents and services could be realized and his vision for a prosperous Sri Lanka fulfilled.
Lalith was one of the brightest young stars in the J.R. Jayewardene government of 1977. While Gamini Dissanayake entered parliament in 1970 Lilith was thrust into the limelight from virtually nowhere, politically speaking. After winning the Ratmalana electorate by over 7,000 votes, it was only natural that he would be entrusted with a responsible Cabinet portfolio in keeping with his academic achievements.
The country's economy was in a shambles and the food shortages brought about by the faulty trade policies of the Sirima Bandaranaike government, had to be arrested, if the new government was to fulfill one of its primary election promises. JRJ had little hesitation in handing the important subject of Trade to Lalith, even though he was a novice to parliament. He went about his business with great aplomb putting right all the deficiencies and ensuring that the food shortages that characterized the previous government, causing its downfall, was eliminated.
This was only the beginning of what was to be a long and eventful political career during the next eleven years of the JRJ tenure, for this towering figure, culminating in him being entrusted with the high profile National Security Ministry, during the height of the Eelam war. It is here that Lalith shone the most, giving leadership in the prosecution of the war and personally visiting the battlefield to provide moral support to the soldiers. The inspirational speeches he made when visiting the men on the battlefield, no doubt, provided them with the will and courage to confront the enemy with added zest. It is no exaggeration to say that the Vadamaarachchi Operation, in 1987, was the high point in the political career of Lalith Athulathmudali. The LTTE was on the retreat and Prabhakaran on the verge of capture. Had the Indian government not intervened to thwart the effort, the Eelam war would certainly have been brought to an end at that stage and the tens and thousands of lives that were lost subsequently, averted, not to mention the vast destruction caused all round.
It would certainly have made Lalith a hero of the entire nation which mantle though went to Mahinda Rajapaksa 22 years later after much blood was spilled, in the intervening period.
That Lalith was a patriot to the core was not in doubt and he was one of those in the Cabinet who stiffly opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord and boycotted the signing ceremony with Prime Minister Premadasa. This was also the time of the JVP's second uprising which took a most virulent form and Lalith was a victim of its consequences when he was almost killed in the parliament bomb attack which claimed life of a government minister.
Though Premadasa was the Prime Minister it was obvious that JR was grooming both Lalith and Gamini for leadership and due to this there was open competition between the trio not to mention friction. Both held important portfolios through which they strove to build their public profiles. It was the expectation of many that either Lalith or Gamini would be the obvious choice to succeed JRJ although Premadasa was the Prime Minister. However when Premadasa eventually prevailed, both Lalith and Gamini supported him at the Presidential election, a honeymoon that was all too short-lived, as subsequent events were to prove.
Twenty five years after his death there is still speculation as to the circumstances surrounding the assassination. True, Scotland Yard investigators who were got down by Premadasa declared that it was the work of the LTTE. But there are those who are yet not fully convinced. This is due to the fact that it was Lalith who masterminded the whole business of impeaching Premadasa and there was much bitterness and acrimony that followed the failed bid, not least due to the breakaway by the Lalith Gamini duo, together with a few other stalwarts from the UNP, to form another political party.
Lalith, no doubt, was a man in a hurry, and politically ambitious. But sadly, with his exit and that of Gamini Dissanayake the Grand Old Party was deprived of two giant leaders, the consequences of which it is still enduring.

Manufacturing sector PMI reaches 12-month high
The Manufacturing Sector PMI reached a 12-month high and signaled a strong upturn in manufacturing activities by recording 65.6 index points in March from 55.6 index points in February 2018 and was in line with the pattern observed in previous years.
The increase of PMI in March was largely attributable to increasing orders in line with the seasonal demand as reflected by increase in new orders and production sub-indices. Stock of purchases and employment sub-indices also increased during the month. Further, lengthening of the suppliers delivery time sub-index also contributed positively to the overall increase. However, most respondents, especially in the textiles and apparel sector, highlighted difficulties in finding both skilled and unskilled workers.
Overall, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion in manufacturing activities during the month. Moreover, the expectation for activities remains positive for the next three months.
The services sector PMI recorded 58 index points in March 2018 from 58.4 index points in February 2018. This indicates that the services sector activities expanded at a softer pace in March 2018, mainly supported by new businesses, business activity, employment and expectations for activity sub-indices. The expansion in new businesses remained strong and was observed across financial service activities, insurance activities and wholesale and retail trade activities.
Although business activities usually see a seasonal upturn during March compared to February, a notable development in this survey round was the deceleration of Business Activities mainly in accommodation, food and beverage services; transportation and wholesale and retail trade sectors.
Backlogs of work declined along with the increase in employment in March 2018, continuing its trend observed in previous month, while a modest expansion was observed in Expectation for Activity.
Expected labour cost increased due to expected salary increments and incentives to be granted during festival season, while Prices Charged of the Services sector increased, albeit at a slower rate.

Marsh follows Renshaws lead with county hundred
LONDON, Saturday - Shaun Marsh followed Australia team-mate Matt Renshaw in making an early-season century in Englands County Championship as he marked his Glamorgan debut with an innings of 111 at Gloucestershire on Saturday.
Renshaw made 101 not out on debut for Somerset on Friday and 24 hours later it was all-rounder Marshs turn to reach three figures.
Marsh struck 18 fours on a lively Bristol pitch as Glamorgan ended the second day of this Second Division clash on 296 for five in reply to Gloucestershires 236 all out.
His innings meant Marsh become the 10th player to score a first-class century on debut for Welsh county Glamorgan, a list that includes fellow Australians Matthew Elliott and Mark Cosgrove.
Meanwhile New Zealand paceman Matt Henry took a career-best 12 for 73 as Kent routed Durham inside just two days at Chester-le-Street.
Not content with taking five wickets in Durhams first innings, Henry took seven for 45 as the hosts slumped to 170 all out in their second innings.
That left Kent needing just 93 for victory, and with Daniel Bell-Brummond making an unbeaten 45, they reached the target just one down to wrap up a nine-wicket win.
South Africas Heino Kuhn made a useful 54 in visitors Kents reply of 169 to Durhams first innings 91 in this Second Division clash.
It was a very different story for Kuhns Proteas team-mate Aiden Markram, a star in South Africas recent Test series win over Australia, who had the dubious distinction of marking his Durham debut by falling for a pair of ducks on Fridays first day.
In the First Division, reigning champions Essex left Lancashire a target of 320 for victory.
Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, two key figures in Essexs run to the title last season, finished with five wickets apiece for the hosts as Lancashire were dismissed for 144.
Harmer then weighed in with the bat making 49 during an eighth-wicket century partnership with former England wicket-keeper James Foster, whose 69 was the top score in Essexs second-innings 313. AFP

## Title: MASTER MANIPULATORS!

MASTER MANIPULATORS!
Emotional blackmail is an issue far more prevalent than most people realise. What it actually entails is psychological manipulation which is a very common occurrence in varied relationships. Basically the perpetrator suffers from a personality disorder.
All the same some are darned skilful at it. These are the Master Manipulators who love to indulge in mind games. They actually prey upon the emotions and sensibilities of another for personal gain. This form of mental extortion usually occurs within close relationships such as with parents and children, husbands and wives, lovers, colleagues or others with closely developed intimate ties. Emotional blackmail basically is the use of fear, obligation and guilt to control another person. These mind-benders are shrewder than many imagine. No, they do not get on your nerves initially. But once they win your trust they can turn your life into a living nightmare. What they really do is control your mind by making you feel guilty and selfish. They then keep up the pressure to bleed you white.
Yet several among us are victims of emotional blackmail and do not even realise it. In essence, the emotional blackmailer attempts to hold others responsible for how hurt he or she will feel if they do not give in to their demands. People who use emotional blackmail are those who wish to control others to ensure their own selfish ends. They are what one would call mind-control freaks.
Usually victims who are susceptible to this extortionist type of behaviour are considerate individuals who do not want to appear selfish or uncaring. They are also sensitive to criticism. The upshot of handling such a problem is that they usually end up being stressed out. Under anxiety from emotional blackmail, one may become a sort of hostage, compelled to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the others breakdown.
We all know that such irrational demands start with kids at a very young age. Observe how they constantly have their way by faking a tearless cry where the eye muscles dont even twitch. Many parents fall for it every time. The children as a rule crave for something desirable and often expensive and keep assailing you with their unreasonable claim without letup. Mostly their unjust clamorous needling sends parents up against the wall. Everyone is made miserable when such unrealistic expectations cannot be met.
But the spoiled tykes do realise that persistent pestering power often works like magic. Children can be single-mindedly ruthless in pushing for what they want considering it a notion of entitlement. They wear down parents with so much constant nagging that they eventually give in and purchase the desired item.
They can become so infuriatingly bossy and push their peers around with the air reminiscent of midget tyrants. And yes, when things dont go the way they expect they simply cant stomach it. They find the disappointment too much to take and often make typical angry outbursts such as: Its not fair! But the key to getting round these high-demand brats is to delve deeper into their little minds.
These children are crying out for understanding, affection, praise, and acceptance even when they know they are being unreasonable. They are under the mistaken belief that everyone else around them exist to make them feel happy. They feel there is never enough to fill their egoistic worlds even when people bend over backwards to cater to their most irrationally demanding whims.
More worryingly these kids with their demanding ways will continue such manipulative tactics well into adulthood. But hold on a bit and you will realise that parents are not the only victims here. Press the fast-forward button that takes you many years into their adulthood. And you will observe that several parents will whip out any excuse in order to keep that kid nicely attached to their apron strings.
Emotional blackmail is not confined to any particular groups or gender and can occur across all ages. Parents use it on children, children use it on parents and even grandparents often enter the picture with their opinions. One parent may even use it on the other.
Threats often show up as emotional or behaviour-based. Such threats are those where the blackmailer uses an emotional state to control the victim. This commonly occurs through rage, screaming, crying, whining or complaining.
Through making the situation uncomfortable enough, they force the victim to do something they are unwilling to. When this occurs in public places, embarrassment adds pressure for the target to yield. After several episodes of emotional threats, the victim often gives in to avoid the very possibility of another scene. The very threat of emotional discomfort or blackmail creates pressure to give in.
Self-harm and suicide threats are among the most terrifying and effective manipulative tactics in an abusers arsenal. One extreme form of emotional blackmail is abusers threats to kill themselves if their demands are not met. This is a below-the-belt blow, but often an effective strategy because it taps directly into our compassion for another human being, and our fear of being the cause of them ending their life.
The only way to combat such extortive demands is to understand that you are not responsible for the choices of another. Giving in to blackmail tactics even terrifying, dire threats such as suicide reinforces the blackmailing behaviour to a point of desperation. Not all people who threaten suicide do go on to take their own lives. But here is the bottom line: Whether he or she does or does not, you cannot be held responsible. The responsibility lies entirely with them for their own actions.
People who use emotional blackmail at work or in relationships do not usually start off using that form of communication. More often than not, the new relationship starts off as quite wonderful, warm and hopeful for a mutually beneficial alliance. In intimate relationships, the depth of emotional connection is very alluring. When the blackmail begins to happen, the victim does not see it as part of the regular relationship but rather as something outside of the norm. They convince themselves it is temporary. When women get involved in abusive relationships, this slow introduction of emotional blackmail is how they become battered women.
It is important to remember that you cannot change a manipulative persons behaviour; only he or she can do that for themselves. But as in any blackmail transaction it takes two to tango. And you dont have to keep in step to the blackmailers beat. Following enlightenment comes change. Its easy to focus on other peoples behaviour and to think that if they change, things will be fine. Not so! The change has to begin with the blackmail target.
In a nutshell, emotional blackmail is a psychological-emotional ransom note that says, if you dont do what I want then I will make you hurt. [emailprotected]

Michael Jackson's famous moonwalk shoes are going up for auction

The black loafers that Michael Jackson used to perform his signature moonwalk for the first time on stage are going up for auction.
The star owned the Florsheim Imperial leather shoes and wore them while rehearsing his performance of "Billie Jean" for the "Motown 25" TV special in 1983.
That rehearsal marked the first timethe King of Popperformed his famous backward-sliding dance move on stage, according to GWS Auctions.
"Anything related to Michael Jackson is extraordinary, and to have something so incredibly historical as these shoes worn by Michael when he first did that now famous moonwalk is beyond special," Brigitte Kruse, owner of GWS Auctions, said via email. "We are so very honored to be able to offer them at auction."
She said the auction house has a "very conservative estimate" on the shoes of $10,000.
"These shoes are in wonderful condition for their age, with evident signs of use to the soles," thecatalog descriptionreads.
The shoes have been owned by choreographer and dancer Lester Wilson, who said Jackson gave him the shoes in his dressing room after rehearsing with his brothers for the special, the auction house said.
It's possible the shoes were used during the performance on the special, too, because according to the letter of authenticity, Jackson referred to the pair as his "magic shoes" and a pair of performance shoes has never surfaced, GWS Auctions said.
"Billie Jean"and the album on which it appeared, 1982's "Thriller," made Jackson the first artist to have a No. 1 pop single, pop album, R&B single and R&B album chart simultaneously.
Jackson began performing at age 5 with four of his five brothers as The Jackson Five. His first solo album, "Off the Wall" in 1979, sold more than 20 million copies and had four Top 10 singles.
The music superstar died in 2009at age 50 after suffering cardiac arrest at his home near Los Angeles.

Mitra Innovation to host PMO Summit
Mitra Innovation will host their first annual Project Management Office (PMO) Summit on the April 26, at the Jaic Hilton Colombo. Mitra Innovation is a UK based Technology Innovation and Cloud Integration provider, with an engineering hub in Sri Lanka. The event titled Pursuing Excellence aims to share knowledge on project management and best practices with the Sri Lankan IT community and project managers.
Managing Director of Mitra Innovation Dammika Ganegema said Over the period of the last decade, I have seen that the practice of knowledge sharing within the Project Management community has noticeably decreased, resulting in creating many administrators and not project managers.
This is the first of many PMO meetup sessions to follow over the next few months where our intentions are to help build a stronger Project Management community that can drive strategic and complex projects without limiting to ICT alone.
A workforce of close to 100,000 employees currently contributes to the Sri Lankan IT industry, which in turn generates a revenue estimated to be in between $600 million to $700 million. However, often we see projects failing by means of not achieving the desired business objectives due to budget overruns and noticeable lack of quality.
Director and Head of Delivery Bivendra Narangoda, said at Mitra Innovation and in Sri Lanka we are happy to witness that project management techniques and practices are rapidly evolving to deliver projects successfully.
It will be wonderful to share these experiences and the learnings that we have gathered throughout these years with our Sri Lankan Project Management community.
Dananjaya Hettiarachchi who leads the Global HRD and Talent Development strategy for Mitra Innovation said today a balance must be struck between process and engagement to ensure that innovation is nurtured and sustained within projects. From a talent perspective, the challenge for project managers is to move from a transactional culture to a transformational one in which the right work environment drives performance.
The Mitra Innovation PMO event on Pursuing Excellence will feature keynote presentations from renowned global IT leaders including Mike Braithwaite  Head of Service Delivery and Transformation at Bank of England, Peter De Almeida  CEO of N-Able, and Derek Bell - COO of Mitra Innovation.
The event will also include a discussion forum with a panel of well known IT experts.

Nadal beats Nishikori to win 11th Monte Carlo Masters title
MONTE CARLO, Sunday: Rafael Nadal romped to a record 11th Monte Carlo Masters title by brushing aside Kei Nishikori in Sundays final to retain the world number one ranking.
The 31-year-old saw off Nishikori 6-3, 6-2 to become the first man to win a tournament 11 times in the Open era with his 76th ATP Tour triumph.
Nadals 31st Masters title is also an outright record, pulling him out of a tie with Novak Djokovic.
The 16-time Grand Slam champions era of utter dominance on clay looks unlikely to end any time soon after Nadal took his run of consecutive sets won on the surface to 36.
The Spaniard will next set his sights on an 11th Barcelona Open victory next week, and it is hard to see anyone preventing him from extending his record number of 10 French Open titles at Roland Garros at the end of the clay-court season.
He was pushed by Japans Nishikori early on and fell a break down, but roared back against an opponent who appeared beaten midway through the first set.
It was still an excellent week for former world number four Nishikori, who only returned from a four-month absence with a right wrist injury in January.  AFP

Navy arrests 101 fishermen
The Navy had recently apprehended 101 fishermen along with 14 dinghies, for engaging in illegal fishing practices in the seas off the Trincomalee Harbour during the past two weeks.
During the apprehension, 13 unauthorised (Surukku/Laila) fishing nets and 6.24 kg of illegally caught fish were also taken into naval custody. It had been announced that these types of nets used in illegal fishing methods, had already been banned. Further, according to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 and the letter from the Director General of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, DFAR / FM / AD / 13/496 dated 22.01.2017, engaging in fishing activities in the waters, within 7 nautical miles, in Trincomalee has completely been banned.
The apprehended persons and their fishing gear were handed over to the Assistant Director of Fisheries of Trincomalee through the Department of Coast Guard for onward legal action.
Sri Lanka Navy with the assistance of the Department of Coast Guard has intensified the apprehension of illegal fishers as the use of Surukku Nets has been on the rise in the eastern seas in recent times. Moreover, the Navy urges the fisher folk not to engage in illegal fishing activities in a bid to prevent depletion of fish stocks to alarming levels.

New Cabinet to be sworn in this week
The full set of new Cabinet Ministers will take their oaths this week, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He disclosed this at a meeting held at the Panadura Divisional Secretariat on January 21.
The meeting was held to mark the distribution of furniture and other equipment among 14 social organisations in the division.
These included Death Donation Societies, Youth and Women Societies in the area.
Dr. Senaratne said the new Cabinet has been formulated on a scientific basis.
It would be a full Cabinet. The Ministers would take oaths once the President discussed the new list of Ministers on his return from Britain after attending the CHOGM meeting. The Government would march forward as one component and launch a new programme of work targeting future elections.
The Minister said during the recent local elections too, he suggested that the two main parties contest together. But, it was not implemented.
Although the Prime Minister agreed with this idea, certain lawyers in the Presidents camp took an opposing view. And this caused a confusing election result.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said the Joint Opposition would not win the 2020 General Election.
It could not gain 50 percent of the total vote without the support of minority communities, he said.
The present government would win the next election too by uniting all forces under its banner. It could follow a better path and march forward as it has learnt a good lesson, Minister Senaratne added.

No debate or vote on Presidents policy statement - Experts
President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to deliver the Policy Statement of the coalition government at a ceremonial sitting when the second session of the Eighth Parliament commences on May 8. This statement however, will not be up for debate or a vote, contrary to unfounded claims.
Based on Article 33 of the 1978 Constitution, the President has the power to summon or prorogue Parliament at any time he prefers and would deliver a Statement of Government Policy at the commencement of a new session of parliament, a parliament official clarified.
According to constitutional experts, the Policy Statement will not be up for debate or vote, contrary to misleading claims in media reports. This Constitution does not give room for a debate or vote on the matter, unlike the previous ones, where at the time the Policy Statement was read out by a Governor. In this instance, the President will preside over during the ceremonial sitting and would remain at the Speakers Chair.
Unlike previous governments, here the Presidents tenure of office is not dependent on the majority in parliament, hence it does not warrant a vote.
The Presidents Policy Statement is said to be on the current policies of the incumbent government and the future course of action as a unified state.
When the Daily News questioned some politicians and experts about some news reports on the media about the Presidents speech on May 8, they too endorsed the above view.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said there is no plan for a Throne speech in Parliament on May 8.
Amaraweera said the Presidents speech will be a policy declaration which highlights the governments policies and future course of action.
News reports which said there will be a call for a vote on the Presidents speech Amaraweera explained that it was pure speculation and an attempt to mislead the public. Minister Lakshman Kiriella meanwhile said the government was not afraid of any vote and was confident of defeating any vote in parliament.
He said the recent vote on the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister, the government had shown its might and had proven it cannot be defeated in parliament with a majority vote.
Minister A.H.M.Fowzie when inquired, also refuted claims that there will be a Throne Speech and said the Presidents speech will only be a policy statement which outlines the future programme of the government. He said there was no provision to call for a vote on the Presidents speech in parliament.
Government Information Department Director General Sudarshana Gunawardana yesterday refuted news reports which appeared in several media stating that the Government will come to end once the crown speech made by the President is defeated on May 8.
The DG said the news is baseless, inaccurate and misleading the public.
According to these reports, the Opposition is planning to call for a vote after the speech. If the government is defeated at the vote, the Prime Minister should resign and a new Prime Minister and a new cabinet will be appointed. These media reports further said that Parliament can be dissolved prior to completion the four and a half years, if the vote is defeated.
The Information Department said there is a custom under the Westminster Parliament model to deliver a crown speech by the state leader when a new parliament session is begun. However, there is no provision for a vote, the DGs release said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that it is futile to talk about this vote. It doesnt arise at this moment. If there is any vote it depends on the nature of speech. This is only a policy statement,he said.
Senior journalist, attorney-at-law K.W. Janaranjana speaking on the new reports said it may be an attempt by those who brought the recent no confidence motion in parliament to prolong the political instability.
He said after defeating the NCM, the government had been able to reinstate political stability and added that news reports may be an attempt to create confusion and political instability.
He also said it seems media had not studied the procedures in parliament with regards to the Presidents speech before publishing such news. He said in the present Constitution, there were no provisions to call for a vote on the Presidents speech.
UNP parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardene dismissed the news reports as a foolish attempt to hoodwink the people. He said that the Joint Opposition and the Rajapaksas smarting under the defeat at the NCM were now stooping to the level of planting false news to fulfill their ulterior motives.
Even if there is any vote in Parliament, the government will comfortably defeat it, he added.

No heart surgeries if British doctor returns
Anaesthetists attached to the Cardiothoracic unit of the Karapitiya Hospital have decided to stop work if visiting British Cardiac Surgeon Dr. R.K. Premin who has been temporarily suspended, resumed heart surgeries at the hospital again.
This decision was taken at a meeting of the GMOA Karapitiya branch recently, branch joint secretary Dr. K.T. Samararatne said. This decision has also been communicated to the Director General of Health Services, GMOA General Secretary, Karapitiya Hospital director and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
He said the SLMC should not allow this British surgeon to perform heart surgeries at Karapitiya again as he had not been granted a licence in Britain to perform such surgeries. This surgeon had been performing surgeries at Karapitiya from 2015 without a valid licence from Britain.
Dr. Samararatne said all staff in the Cardiothoracic unit would keep away from service if this surgeon was allowed to start working again.

Obese couples risk health of future children
Diet and lifestyle during the pre-conception period can profoundly affect the childs development, researchers find
Couples who are obese, as well as those who smoke and drink alcohol, could be risking the health of their future children, say experts who are calling for far more awareness of the effects of modern lifestyles on babies in the womb.
A series of three scientific papers in a leading medical journal spell out the consequences of poor diet and lifestyles for the next generation. They urge schools, GPs and nurses to talk to young people and those who may be planning a family about how to be fitter and healthier before they embark on pregnancy.
What happens in the pre-conception period can have a profound impact on the growth, development and long-term health of children, they say. Some of the interventions that exist to help pregnant women be healthier are taken up too late. Folic acid helps prevent neural defects, but most women do not start to take it until they have seen a GP to confirm their pregnancy, which can be after a month or two. The crucial time is in the early days and weeks.
Lead author Prof Judith Stephenson of University College London said: The key message is to act earlier, before conception. The idea that there are things you can do before the pregnancy that will affect the health of the baby is not always grasped.
The general view of most women is, Once Im pregnant I will go and see the GP and things will get going from there.
But she said the scientists did not want to distress parents who might have been overweight when they had their children. All the evidence points to early events being very influential in later life, but you are not doomed at that stage, she said. Things you do throughout childhood and adolescence also have a powerful influence on future health.
Couples are already advised to stop smoking and drinking when a woman is pregnant. Now they should be counselled about their nutrition and losing weight as well. One of the best opportunities to intervene is when a woman visits a nurse or a family planning clinic to have a contraceptive implant or coil removed. But GPs could also ask whether couples are considering having a family during any other routine visit.

The poetry of art
The poets pen and the artists brush are guided by similar forces. The need to capture a moment in time or to explore the deep recesses of the mind could be the primary preoccupations of both artist and poet. Certainly, there are also instances when these intentions fuse and inform each other.
At a recently concluded exhibition of paintings by artists Noeline Fernando and Sampath Amunugama, I was overtaken by the creations before me. The paintings were brilliantly curated, the dark contrasted with the vibrant and the abstract with the concrete. I visited the Barefoot Gallery towards the tail end of the exhibition to meditate on the poetry they wove.
There is something very intriguing about a painting that is untitled - its an invitation to freely interpret. A majority of Sampath Amunugamas paintings were untitled and interestingly so. When observing his work I could imagine the fluid movement of his brush, musings in primarily black and white. When considered collectively, Amunugamas paintings shared many similarities. Splotches of black paint, tiny plant-like elements and most importantly the human form, dissected. It seemed as though he was exploring a familiar terrain  the landscape of the mind. I enjoyed studying Amunugamas paintings as they reminded me of a collection of deeply personal poems.
In stark contrast, Noeline Fernandos paintings were an exploration of colour and life. They captured social settings that were laced with emotions. From the North to the South of Sri Lanka, Fernandos paintings traversed, as the artist captured her perspective on a social setting or situation. Grief and dislocation were frozen in time on her canvases.
Fernando mentions that her travels with her children, Manik and Dilsiri Welikala often inspire her work. Ambalangoda, immediately captured my interest. A city that is well-known for its rich dramatic tradition and mask-making was captured in the most imaginative way possible. The canvas in my memory was somewhat like a patchwork of colour, primarily in tones of yellow, red and green. I couldnt imagine a better way to express the allure of the city.
Where opposites are embraced and contrasts are celebrated, art thrives. The exhibition by Fernando and Amunugama was proof of this statement. It was a remarkable convergence and a reminder of the poetry of art.

POINT OF VIEW
Why this ban on Vesak pandals
In all newspapers, both Sinhala and English, the striking headlines Ban on Pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days, appear. It is also stated that this action was taken by the Minister for Buddhasasana, Jayawickrama Perera, at a request by the Mahanayake Theras to encourage Buddhists to engage in spiritual activities. The President of All Ceylon Sasanarakshaka Balamandalaya of Colombo and Chilaw Disawes and Chancellor of Kelaniya University, Ven. Wellampitiyawe Kusaladhamma Thera too has supported this call.
I wonder whether the Buddhasasana Minister, the Mahanayaka Theras and the President of Sasanarakshaka Balamandalaya are unaware, have forgotten or overlooked what is said in the Paranibbana Sutta when Ven. Ananda announced the demise  Parinibbana to Mallas. In the book titled Last Days of the Buddha - Maha Parinibbana by Sister Vajira, translated from Pali to English.  Mallas were very sorry that they could not pay homage and called upon every Malla, the men, wives, sons, daughters and went to Sala Grove, the recreation grounds of Mallas. They gathered with perfumes, flower garlands, music and went to pay their last respects with music, dance, flower garlands. This they did for six days before removal of the remains of the Thathagatha.
If what is said in Parinibbhana Sutta is accepted and the performance of Mallas with music, dance, what is wrong in the present day Buddhists to celebrate Vesak on a grand scale, by having Olu Bakkas, Borukakul Karayas, Kavedi and Veddah dances to the accompaniment of drum beat and flutes, go in a Perahara (procession) with highly decked elephants, chanting Sadhu! Sadhu!

Queen celebrates 92nd birthday with charity concert
UK: Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 92nd birthday on Saturday with a star-studded, Commonwealth-themed charity concert featuring Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue and Shaggy.
The monarch took to the stage herself at the end of the show at the Royal Albert Hall, where her son and heir Prince Charles led the crowd in a birthday hip hip hip hooray.
Her grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry, accompanied by his fiancee Meghan Markle, also watched performances by stars from around the Commonwealth, the 53-nation grouping which held its summit in London this week.
The queen usually celebrates her birthday in private, saving the pomp for her official birthday in June, but the concert was held in aid of a new youth charity, The Queens Commonwealth Trust.
This organisation in your name will provide a platform for those working to make a difference in their communities across 53 countries. Your Majesty, Happy Birthday, said Harry, who will be president of the trust.
Australias Kylie was among the performers, alongside Canadian pop chart-topper Shawn Mendes and South African all-male choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
US-Jamaican reggae star Shaggy shared the stage with British star Sting, while Jones and Craig David also performed.
Earlier, the queens birthday was marked by a traditional gun salute in Hyde Park and the Tower of London, while at Windsor Castle, the band played Happy Birthday during the changing of the guard.
The queen has been the symbolic head of the Commonwealth since her father king George VIs death in 1952, but its leaders agreed on Friday that Prince Charles would eventually succeed her.
The summit was overshadowed by a row over Britains treatment of Caribbean immigrants, while Charles himself also came under scrutiny.
A non-white writer, Anita Sethi, claimed he joked about whether she was really from the British city of Manchester when they met at a Commonwealth meeting this week.
Sethi -- whose mother was born in Guyana -- said Charles asked her where she was from and when she replied, said: Well, you dont look like it! and laughed. She wrote in The Guardian that she felt humiliated and angry, adding that some people, including the prince, urgently need a history lesson about immigration. - AFP

Reforms of soes critical to minimize fiscal risks-IMF
Reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are critical to minimize fiscal risks for Sri Lanka says International Monitory Fund (IMF) subsequent to their fourth review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility.
Strengthening institutions and accelerating structural reforms is key to lay the foundation for more sustainable and inclusive growth in Sri Lanka.
After constructive discussions with the authorities in Colombo and during the Spring Meetings in Washington DC, Manuela Goretti, the IMF mission Chief for Sri Lanka, issued the following statement:
The IMF team reached a staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the fourth review under an economic reform program supported by a three -year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. All the end-December quantitative performance criteria under the program were met, as the authorities have successfully advanced fiscal consolidation and strengthened international reserves.
Due to a weather-related spike in food prices, inflation exceeded the upper limit for the inner band for December, but has since fallen back within the inner band. The authorities are taking actions to implement all the pending structural benchmarks for this review, despite some delays. Following subdued growth in 2017 due to the lingering effects of weather-related shocks, a recovery is underway as agriculture has started to rebound and food prices decelerated. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 4 percent and inflation to remain below 5 percent in 2018.
Exports are also recovering and the recent sovereign bond issuance was successfully oversubscribed. However, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks given the still sizable public debt, large refinancing needs, and low external buffers. Subject to cabinet approval of an automatic fuel pricing mechanismconsistent with the EFF-supported program, the Board is expected to consider Sri Lankas request for completion of the fourth review in June 2018. The measure would represent a major step towards completing energy pricing reforms in 2018.
Further efforts remain needed to strengthen governance and mitigate fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Progress in implementing the Inland Revenue Act (IRA) and other revenue measures in the 2018 budget remains essential for meeting social goals and improving debt dynamics.
The central bank should continue to remain vigilant in guarding against inflationary pressures, while continuing to build reserves and supporting greater exchange rate flexibility.
Under the EFF-supported program, sustaining the reform momentum is critical to strengthen the resilience of the economy to shocks and promoting inclusive and strong growth.

Relief for drought-affected families
Rs. 485 million in drought relief has already been granted to 167,000 families in the Puttalam district, said Power and Renewable Energy and Disaster Management Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
The minister also instructed officials to prepare a Cabinet paper for provision of compensation to those drought-affected families who have not yet received compensation.
Minister Siyambalapitiya issued these instructions during a meeting held at the Puttalam district secretariat on the issues of the drought-affected people in the Puttalam district.
The minister also stated that water would be provided to 25,000 families who have been severely affected by the drought in the district.
When the issue of coal dust from the Norochcholai coal power plant was taken up, Minister Siyambalapitiya said that all the measures have been taken to construct a wind barrier to prevent the minimal coal ash that is being released to the environment at the moment.
However, earlier the CEB stated that the rumors and several reports on the pollution from the Norochcholai coal power plant was an exaggeration.
CEB officials said the stories fabricated in media are untruths as anyone could see that maximum efforts have been taken and monitoring is carried out to ensure there is no damage to peoples health as well as to the environment.

Meteorology Department issues warning
Sea level surges
A weather warning was issued by the Meteorology Department yesterday on a sea level surge in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle until April 24.
When contacted by the Daily News, the duty forecaster said the surges are a result of high tide and a depression condition developed closer to Sri Lanka. The duty forecaster said that there will not be a Tsunami danger. There can be significant wave height which can increase up to 2.5-3.0 meters during the period.
The Natural Hazards Early Warning Center said that the areas will experience rough seas and requested the fishermen and coastal population to be cautious during the period.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle. Winds will be South-westerly in direction in the sea areas around the island and wind speed will be 20-30kmph, the Duty Forecaster said.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in the Western, North-western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces and the Galle and the Matara districts after 2.00 p.m. Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity, the weather forecast said.
Civilians living near Marawila, Thoduwawa coasts and the Arachchikattuwa Muthupanthiya island were affected by a sea surge yesterday. According to eyewitnesses, the sea has turned extremely rough by last Saturday evening and the sea water has risen. A resident of Thoduwawa, one Peter Paul Fernando, 75, said that they have never experienced such a change. We were not affected even when the tsunami came. This is a first. The police and the Grama Niladhari visited us. But our fate is in the hands of the God. he said.
According to a young man, Nilukshan Madhuranga, living at Muthupanthiya island, a stream of sea water flowed across the island. He fears a possibility of the island being divided from its mid section. Another resident at Thoduwawa, one Marian Fernando, said that they are concerned of what might happen if the sea turns rougher. All of us are out from our houses today and stand by the road. We dont know what will happen to us tonight. Water level is going beyond the road now. We have never witnessed something similar to this before. It has also been reported that tourists visiting Kalpitiya islands in boats were terrified by the rough seas.

Lalith Athulathmudalis 25th death anniversary
In the shadow of a Renaissance Statesman
In an interview with Samangie Wettimuny The Man of Unmatched Impact in the series, Footprints on the sands of time published in the Daily News on May 15, 2017, Lalith Athulathmudalis only daughter Serela Athulathmudali who was barely 11-years-old at the time of her fathers untimely death recalled the greatness of her father and the lessons she learned from his legendary life.
Reproduced below are excerpts of the interview:
Years rolled on, and many a tear rolled down her face. She was barely 11-years-old when her father was assassinated at the peak of his political career. Eleven years later when her mother succumbed to her illness, the feeling of loss was unbearably intense that it made her quit her opera singing career.
He never flinched at the sight of trouble. He was dubbed a Hawk by his opponents. His mental faculties were so dazzling that he could negotiate with tough envoys at the time the country needed astute and perceptive diplomacy to take it out of troubled waters and to a safer mooring point. At times, his intellectual power was unimaginable. That was Lalith Athulathmudali, the colossus who ignited the political arena with bright sparks whatever he did.
The Oxford scholar, who gave up his illustrious legal and academic careers to serve the people, was elected to Parliament in 1977 as a UNP MP and soon carved out a niche in the political arena. The brilliant orator well known for his unmatched intelligence and vast knowledge in legal and international affairs was also the first Sri Lankan to be elected as the President of the Oxford Union in 1958. His brilliance was unmatched that his reasoning resonated the star-studded Cabinet of the first Executive President of Sri Lanka, J R Jayewardene, where he served as Minister of Trade and Shipping and Minister of National Security. However this erudite politician found himself marginalized by President Jayewardenes successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, when he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and later Minister of Education and Higher Education.
The pragmatic leader, who firmly believed that education was the only long term solution to poverty, introduced the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund in 1981 to provide financial assistance to the needy undergraduates. The programme which started with only 400 students continues to benefit millions of university students in the country.
As Minister of Trade and Shipping, he introduced Intellectual Property Law, pioneered in establishing Sri Lanka Export Development Board under Sri Lanka Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979 and established the Ports Authority in the same year. As Minister of National Security he was entrusted with the great responsibility of containing the LTTE.
Having been expelled from the UNP in 1991 following the impeachment attempt, they formed the DUNF which became the main rival political party of the UNP. He soon became the leader of the new party, but was assassinated at the peak of his political career while addressing the 1993 Provincial Council election campaign rally in Kirulapana.
He left behind a mission unaccomplished, but his political legacy lives on.
Today, the much loved daughter of late ministers, Lalith Athulathmudali and Srimani Athulathmudali, sings only for fun when she is at home in Sri Lanka and can join her fellow workshop players or her old friends from Adlib for a while!
I am always asked to enter the political stage, and I always say no. The truth is I do not believe I have what it takes to govern!, said Serela Athulahmudali ready to recall the treasured memories she had of her father who undoubtedly possessed many a defining characteristic of a charismatic leader!
The Founder of the Mahapola Scholarship Trust and the illustrious National Security Minister of J R Jayewardene regime would have been 80 now, had he not been brutally assassinated allegedly by the LTTE.
Had he been still alive today and if he felt that he had his part for his people, he would have been happy teaching (lecturing) or just teaching his grandson, Haren, says Serela.
I would have been happy with whichever he had chosen, had he been alive, she added.
Memories
Even though her stay with her father was brief, wisps of memories came floating by as she turned back the cherished pages of her golden days spent under the loving care of her father.
I suppose my earliest memory of my father was him saying to my mother Serela is too tired to say paan to which I would respond paan!
It was because of her father that she learned to treat everyone with dignity. In the short time I had with him he taught me that everyone deserved dignity.
Dignity of labour is important, he used to tell her often. I didnt understand exactly what he meant by it at the time, but as the years passed, it is the lesson that has stuck with me the most, Serela emphasized.
Serela took a stroll down memory lane as she recalled how they used to go to Gangaramaya to engage in religious practices way back in the late eighties and early nineties.
But we would never go on Poya days because my father would say it was too full and he was afraid he would lose me in the crowd! We would recite a small Gaatha together at home if he was there, she added.
Her father, a staunch Buddhist, taught her how to bestow Metta (loving-kindness) on all living beings. The way her father used to narrate these lines with her before retiring to bed is still etched in her mind. Today my son is learning it too.
Highest award
Serela Athulathmudali
Not many are aware of the sensitive, personal story that propelled Minister Athulathmudali to introduce the Mahapola concept. Back in the fifties Athulathmudali had completed his MA in law at Oxford and was studying for his BCL when his father died. College expenses being so high, his mother was left with no other option, but to recall him. Lalith, however, was not ready to give up. He presented his case to the then Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike who took immediate measures to present a proposal to Parliament and grant him a Scholarship of Rs. 5,000. Come back and serve your country, Premier Bandaranaike told him.
Not only did he return to the country to take up politics, but also he introduced the Mahapola concept which continues to benefit many a student keen to accomplish their higher education dreams.
This visionary politician who wholeheartedly wished to see a country filled with intellectuals, however, did not live long to see his own daughter achieve her goals in education. Serela has a faint memory of her father handing over the best Orator Trophy to her at the Trinity College Award ceremony held in the late eighties.
I dont really remember much about that day except for being very nervous about having to recite a poem out loud in front of him and my mother, but I do remember that when he handed me the award, the smile on his face was all that I could see, she recalled.
Photograph
The adorable daughter of Minister Athulathmudali drew everyones attention wherever she visited with her parents. The photograph of President Premadasa helping little Serela to read a book that was published in a newspaper in the early nineties, grabbed everyones attention for its sheer cuteness.
Asked if she could recall the days she visited the then President Premadasa who was soon to become her fathers main political rival Serela relpes;
I do, but not because of visiting the President. I was running around after being told not to and bumped into someone who was carrying Kirihodhi, which then landed all over my brand new white dress!
Work unfinished
Lalith Athulathmudali contributed immensely to bring about favourable changes in the political, economic and social life in the country. After forming the DUNF, the first task was to contest the Provincial Council elections. He was gunned down in Kirulapana while addressing a rally during his campaign to become the Chief Minister of the Western Province. The news sent shockwaves across his home, across the country. He died with his mission unaccomplished, but the highest number of preferences he polled despite his death, bear testimony to his immense popularity. Thousands of mourners thronged his residence and the then government even feared an uprising of his allies.
Though she was barely 11 years at the time of her fathers death, her memories of those grief-struck days remain sharp and clear. The great pain and confusion she experienced when he was brutally murdered still haunts her memory.
I remember my mother was heartbroken and my uncle Dayantha was angry, she recalled.
Serela calls her father a great politician in the true sense of the word because he genuinely cared about the people.
Oxford days
Athulathmudali had his primary education at St. Johns College, Panadura, before moving to Royal College, Colombo. Having won the Steward Prize, he entered prestigious Oxford University to pursue his higher studies in 1955 and made his motherland proud by being the first Sri Lankan to be elected as the President of the Oxford Union in 1958. He obtained B.A. (Jurisprudence) from Oxford and enrolled as a Barrister of Grays Inn. He did his LLM at the University of Harvard. This illustrious scholar also served as a law lecturer at the University of Singapore, Hebrew University in Israel, University of Edinburgh in UK and Ceylon Law College. In 1985 he was appointed a Presidents Counsel.
Serela cannot remember her father ever talking to her about his school days or Oxford days.
But still I hear about his school days from his brother or sister, but I dont remember him ever telling me about them. I do remember finding an old report card of his which had an F for music with the phrase good for words, singing no tune written next to it!
At the time of his death, Serela had not seen him for nearly two weeks as he was too busy with the impeachment.
The last time I remember seeing Thaththi during this period was when he was attacked by someone wielding a bat I believe and he had hurt his ankle. He laughed and said I was trying to see if I could still jump a hurdle and my Amma who was bandaging his leg looked up and said hes forgetting how old he is to which he responded with a laugh.
Mother's decision
Her mother Srimani Athulathmudali who later led the DUNF founded by her husband was elected to Parliament in 1994.
However Serela never encouraged her mothers decision of taking up politics. She said she did not ever wish to see her mother following in her fathers footsteps. But Srimani was determined to carry on her late husbands legacy.
Serela added that her son is very proud of being Sri Lankan even though his father is Brazilian.
He wants to come back home. He knows that his grandfather was a politician and that he was assassinated. He always asks if they have caught the assassin yet to which I have to tell him no!, she finally noted with a tinge of nostalgia and regret.

Stop stirring your tea!
We all think we know how to make the perfect cuppa.
Every now and then, someone new comes out claiming that weve all been making it wrong, throwing us into a tea-stained fug of confusion.
But few are more qualified to tell us how tea should be made than a member of The Royal Household.
According to former royal butler Grant Harrold, theres a particular method of brewing a cup worthy of the Queen herself.
He revealed the four steps to the perfect royal cup on BBC Three series, Miss Holland:
Pour the tea into the cup from a teapot
Add milk to the cup after the tea  never before
Stir back and forth  never a circular motion and never touching the sides
Sip  dont slurp  from the cup
Most of that sounds pretty obvious. Only a maniac would add milk before the tea. But a large percentage of us probably do swirl our tea around and thats where were apparently going wrong.
If we stir in a circular motion, we can create a storm in a teacup and see the tea coming over the sides which we should never allow, Harrold explains to Business Insider.
If the spoon touches the sides, it makes a clinging sound and we dont want that at the afternoon tea table.
As for the Queens favourite brew, she enjoys loose tea Assam or Earl Grey, made with tea leaves in a teapot. Oh and Harrold has been clearing up another bone of contention  how to eat scones.
The royal way to eat a scone is to either cut it with a knife or break it with your hands and put the cream on first and then the jam. If her majesty was visiting Cornwall she would spread the jam on first then the cream, or in Devon, it would be cream first then jam, because that is the way they do it and she is a very diplomatic lady.

Thilanga divided SLFP: Navin
Thilanga Sumathipala was responsible for dividing the SLFP by giving a dead rope to its membership saying a large number of UNP parliamentarians would back the No Confidence Motion (NCM). Had there was no such conspiracy, S.B. Dissanayake could have been a front runner for the next Presidential election, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake was addressing the media after he called on the Most. Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at the Malwatte Temple in Kandy and received his blessings recently.
Dissanayake said he knew that a large number of SLFP Parliamentarians would fall in trouble if Sumathipala supported the NCM. Today the SLFP was divided into two segments and a large number of its membership had fallen in trouble because the NCM flopped.
Dissanayake said the 16 SLFP members who voted in favour of the NCM did so to join the SLFP. However, others in the SLFP had made a good decision by no presenting in Parliament. Dissanayake said a vast majority of people still detested Rajapaksa family members as expressed by almost 55 percent of voters at the last election. He said the government had steered the country towards a better track by stabilising democracy and ending fear suspicion and the white van culture.
He said he discussed several economic, political and social problems confronting the country with the Malwatte Prelate, who had a broad idea about such problems facing the country.
The Prelate was of the view that political reforms should be undertaken on a priority basis. Problems were common in any democratic political party and the UNP was no exception.
However, the UNP was way ahead of other political parties in its organisation and public appeal. The UNP. being a moderate right wing party, could not introduce radical reforms in a hurry. The party should strengthen its Sinhala Buddhist foundation.
The UNP lost many of its leaders with LTTE terrorism, he said.

That throbbing pain in your head
Today Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Ms. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS (Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin, one of the three senior Consultants attached to the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about Migraine, one of the common diseases report from the people.
Q: What is Migraine 
A - Very severe episodic headache. To diagnose Migraine, there should be five attacks of similar episodic of throbbing nature.
Q: How can we diagnose Migraine and what are the main symptoms 
Dr. ChandraJayasuriya
A - There are warning signs before headache. They are called aura. Patterns of lights in visual fields, back dots, flashes of light, distorted field of vision are the common symptoms of aura. They last for five to 30 minutes. Only 25 percent of affected people get aura.
During a typical attack of headache, it is felt in one half of the head. It lasts approximately two to 70 hours. These are associated with vertigo, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound or smell. Pain is worsen by physical activity. About 60 percent can have a family history. Females are affected more than men (3:1). Among affected children, boys are affected more than girls. Exact causes for Migraine are not known. It is believed to be a neuro-vascular disorder.
Q:What are the trigger factors for Migraine 
A - Loud sound, sunlight and other powerful sources of light(watching television and playing video games), stress, fatigue, inadequate sleep, contraceptive pills or injections, food (these may vary from person to person. Can be identified by keeping a headache diary), junk food, alcohol and alcoholic beverages, trauma to the head, changes in temperature etc.
Q: What are the treatment available for Migraine 
A - The patients need an explanation about the nature of the disease. It is not a life threatening condition. Treatment can be divided into four sections. They are the treatment during aura, treatment during the attack, treatment for preventing the attack and lifestyle modifications.
The warning signs of aura are vertigo, pallor, inability to talk, sensitivity to light, slurring of speech, chills and numbness. The treatment during aura are massaging and hot fermentation of head and neck, relaxation therapy and Pranayama yoga exercises for better breathing techniques, taking analgesics and anti-emetics before headache and vomiting appear.
The signs of an attack are severe throbbing pain, hyperemia of skin, sweating with pallor, confusion and loss of memory, irritability, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to light and slow speech due to pain. The treatment during attack are analgesics for pain, tablets of Triptan give immediate relief. These should be kept in the handbag all the time. With the first sign of headache, a tablet can be taken.
There are treatment to prevent attack. If the attacks are prolonged, prevalence medication is recommended. If regularly taken for three to six months, it prevents the frequency and severity of headache.
There are lifestyle modifications. The persons who suffer from Migraine should avoid bright light, oral contraceptives etc. they should get away from bright lights and noises. When such a person missed a meal, they should take a snack without delay to avoid hypoglycemia which could trigger Migraine. Massaging the head could be helpful as it increases blood circulation of the head. Hot fermentation helps to increase blood floor. having a good night sleep and waking up and going to bed at the same time every day could be help. The room should be arranged with fewer lights. The analgesics should be taken only when necessary and not regularly.
The patients need to maintain a `Headache Diary. About 10 percent of sufferers have food triggers. Keeping notes regarding the food and the affect could be helpful to avoid attacks. Acupressure can be used to relieve pain. Tap on three areas : temple, shoulders and inner aspect of the wrist and repeat. Regular exercises for 30 minutes per day would improve the mood due to endorphins. Certain food such as eggplant, potato, sugar, spinach, cheese, red wine, fried food, bananas, tomatoes, artificial additives, soy food etc should be avoided.
Q:What is a `HeadacheDiary 
A - The Headache Diary has information on three things. they are headache, triggers and treatment. The information on headache includes date and time of the start of the headache, the time of the end of the headache, frequency, severity, warning signs (prodrome or aura), site, character (throbbing,pounding) and severity of the pain (scale 1 to 10) and accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting or any other symptom that occurred during or after the attack).
The information on triggers includes records of all meals and liquids taken on the day of headache and on the day before, records on all activities on the day of the headache and on the day before. Remarks on any unusual activities. Records on the time went to bed and woke up including whether there were any disturbances. Records on all medications or nutritional supplements taken before the headache. Records on any stressful event that occurred before the headache. Records on the feelings such as excitement, anxiety, happiness, depression, and anger.
The information on treatment includes effectiveness of therapy for each attack, list of prophylactic medications : Propanolol, list of analgesics : NSAIDS, list of abortive medication : Triptans, records on any other steps taken to relieve pain.
The patient needs to fill the diary each time when he/she experiences even a mild headache. When he/she has enough entries, he/she will be able to find the pattern of headache, its triggers and effectiveness of treatment. Then he/she can inform it to the doctor.

Title deeds for 666 Uva residents
A title deed distribution ceremony for residents of the Moneragala, Medagama, Badelkumbura and Bibile Divisional Secretariat divisions of the Uva Province, was held under the patronage of Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatileka at the Moneragala Librarary Auditorium on Saturday. Six hundred and sixty-six such deeds were distributed during the event.
Addressing the ceremony Minister Karunatileka said the government had planned to provide deeds to those who would utilise state-owned lands for cultivation and settlements purposes and also for lands belonging to temples and other religious institutions, and government institutions such as hospitals, police stations and schools.
He said, the Uva Wellassa area is replete with natural resources and people who lived there during ancient times, had rendered a yeoman service to build a prosperous country by constructing tanks and cultivating lands to provide food to the country.
"They also built world-famous Buddha statues such as the Maligawila statue. Hence, it is with respect that we distribute these deeds to the kith and kin of the Uva Wellassa region who sacrificed their lives 200 years ago in 1818," the minister said. Minister Karunatileka commended the service rendered by Moneragala District Secretariat officials, Uva Provincial Land officers and Land Ministry officers, for the successful organisation of the programme.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa and Moneragala District Secretary D. S. Padmakulasuriya also addressed the ceremony.
Uva Provincial Council Member Kudabandara Medawela, Land Ministry Secretary R. M. Karunaratthne and other dignitaries were present.

Title-holder Selby knocked out in first round of Snooker World Championship
LONDON, Saturday - Defending champion Mark Selby suffered a shock first-round defeat in snooker's World Championship on Saturday as fellow cuemaster Ronnie O'Sullivan was made to struggle.
The opening day of the tournament saw Selby beaten 10-4 by Joe Perry in an all-English contest while their compatriot O'Sullivan, bidding for a sixth world title, found himself 6-3 down to Scotland's Stephen Maguire.
That match resumes on Sunday.
Selby was aiming to become just the third player after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry to win three successive world title since the tournament moved to its present home of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in northern England back in 1977. But Perry didn't look back after racing into a 7-2 lead in the morning session and not even Selby, renowned as a tough match-player, could overturn such a heavy deficit on this occasion.
I lost it really in the first session, said Selby.
My safety wasn't up to scratch and every time I made a mistake he punished me heavily.
Selby, however, was quick to acknowledge the quality of Perry's performance, adding: He's underachieved if anything. He should have won a lot more than he's won. I've always rated him as a top player.
The last three or four years I've had some good success here so I can't complain.
Meanwhile an elated Perry said: I'm delighted, I'm chuffed. When the draw came out it's one of your two worst nightmares.
When you beat the world number one, world champion, in any tournament it's a great feeling, the 43-year-old, a World Championship semi-finalist in 2008, added.
To do it at the Crucible makes it even more special.
O'Sullivan, nicknamed the Rocket for the breathtaking speed and fluency with which he plays when in top form, showed his enduring class with back-to-back century breaks against Maguire.
But Maguire held his nerve to win the last two frames of the day and leave O'Sullivan facing the prospect of his first opening-round defeat at the World Championship since he lost 10-6 to Hong Kong's Marco Fu in 2003.
In other matches, 2006 world champion Graeme Dott went 6-3 up against Ali Carter, twice a losing finalist, with Chinese debutant Lyu Haotian leading Fu by the same score.  AFP

Tragedy of going back
In 2012, having published four books and won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, Jhumpa Lahiri moved to Rome. There, she experienced what she described as a radical transition, a state of complete bewilderment. A set of preconceptions had hardened around her writing, and in Italy, Lahiri hoped to jettison these in pursuit of a new vulnerability. She looked to the Italian language to reinvent herself on the page, restoring the joy and freedom in her work.
One consequence of this immersion was In Other Words, Lahiris memoir about language, and her first book written in Italian. (An English translation by Ann Goldstein appeared in 2015.) Just as important, in their way, were her first efforts at translationa pair of novels, Ties and Trick, by her friend Domenico Starnone, the author of more than a dozen books and a winner of Italys prestigious Strega Prize. Ties, published last year, tells the story of a marriage in extremis and dissects a lifetime of accrued routine, deception, and petty resentment. When it came to light that Starnone is married to the writer who goes by Elena Ferrante, critics returned to Ties, suddenly eager to read it as a counterpart to Ferrantes own Days of Abandonment.
Trick, Lahiris second Starnone translation, out in March, is another vivisection of family life, a novel as lean and unflinching as its predecessor. An elderly illustrator, Daniele, visits his childhood apartment, now his daughters home, to babysit his four-year-old grandson. The boys frenetic energy fills Daniele with foreboding, forcing him to reckon with his past and his senescenceto accept that his creative powers are waning and his body is failing him.
In a pair of phone conversationsone last year, after Ties came out, and one more recently, following the publication of TrickI talked to Lahiri about the raw power behind Starnones work; about her approach to translation and her love of the Italian language; and about balconies, which are scary.
INTERVIEWER
How did you come to Ties, and what made you decide to translate it
LAHIRI
Well, I read it when it was first published in 2014. I was living in Rome, and I knew Domenico already. We had become friends. I had read some of his other work. A fellow writer friend of mine gave me a copy of Lacci. She bought it for herself, too, and we decided to read it together. I just remember as we were reading in our separate homes, sending constant text messages basically saying, Oh my godwhat about the part on page so and so And, Oh my goddid you get to the passage where he described  After I read it, I sent a text to Domenico saying, What a remarkable book. If I ever translate a book from Italian, I would like it to be this one. At the time, I was so immersed in my Italian project that I wasnt really thinking about moving back into Englishand yet this book struck such a chord in me that I couldnt forget it.
INTERVIEWER
You write in your introduction about the books sense of containment and, simultaneously, disorder. Its divided into three sections with strikingly different tones. First comes Vanda, who conveys, in a series of letters to her husband, an exacting, unsparing anger in the heart of their marriage. Then comes Aldo, the husband, who attempts to earn our compassion even as he describes his reprehensible decision to leave his family. Finally, theres Anna, one of the couples two children, who recounts her grim upbringing with a kind of pitiless frankness. I have to imagine that these three posed a challenge to you as the translatorparticularly the opening section comprising Vandas strident letters, which are almost alienating in their intensity. How did you find your bearings for these different tones in the book
LAHIRI
The real challenge of Ties was these three very distinct voices. Oddly, it was Aldos voice that felt most natural to me. Vandas was the most challenging section. I kept coming back to it, just knowing in my gut that it was off. It was so hard to try to capture her craziness, her desperation, her humanity, her sense of humiliationthat raw, unfiltered rage. But also her manipulation because shes a highly manipulative character. I think all of the characters are, in Ties. Theyre transparent, like open boxes, and at the same time, theyre utterly impenetrable in terms of their motivation. Its wonderful to have such contradictory characters to work with, but it made it hard to settle on a registerand at a certain point, you must settle, right You have to say, There are certain words that Vanda would use and certain words she wouldnt. I was aware also of their ages. The book is set in the present day, but Vanda is almost eighty. I had to think about which words someone of that age would use to express this ragetheyre not the ones I might use.
INTERVIEWER
In the introduction, you write about the fertile lexicon of Italian words just for the English word disorder. Were there any concepts or words in particular that were especially hard to convey
LAHIRI
Well, Starnone uses these Neapolitan words. That terminology was less familiar to me than it is now. Its in a totally different register compared to most Italian writing. Im in a very refined place, shall we say, when Im sitting down to translate Domenico because his knowledge of the language, his knowledge of the weight words carry, their etymology, their Latin roots, I meanthe fact that theres a Latin dictionary at the heart of this novel is not a casual coincidence. As I say in my introduction, the book, to me, really is about language, what language contains and doesnt contain. Thats the real philosophical root of the novel, in some sense. Can language even bear the weight of this mess of our lives Is our project as writers even  possible I was making lists, writing down lots of unfamiliar words that have slowly entered my arsenal. Theres the repeated use of this adjective scontento, scontontechawhich is discontent in English, but it has different shadings. A little kid might be scontento if his parents arent paying attention to him. But scontento, this scontentet, can also speak for a much more existential sentiment. It was interesting to translate this word, apparently simple but actually very subtle, over and over again.
INTERVIEWER
In a piece for The New Yorker a few years ago, you said that Domenico once wrote to you, A new language is almost a new life. Grammar and syntax recast you, you slip into another logic and another sensibility. Learning Italian, I imagine, has caused a metamorphosis for you as a writer. But I wondered how translation has furthered it, or how its changed your relationship to both languages.
LAHIRI
The discovery of translation has been fundamental to my sanity, coming back to the United States. Its just been so meaningful to me to have Domenicos work, in particular, to translate. It comes with this growing friendship that I find very comforting in some sense.
Its also extraordinarily challenging, translating. But even though Im not writing as much in this phase, I know that the translation is feeding my creative work. Right now, I feel like my creative project is translation. Its just constant reading and rereading, on such a deep level.
If youre reading anything at that depth, it brings this deep nourishment, linguistically and technically. When I see how Domenico deals with somethingsay, indirect discourse. Or, How does he deal with time How does he deal with description To plow through this new territoryits very invigorating for me.

Tragedy at Horana factory
H.K Ariyapala had joined the rubber factory in Balapitiya, Horana, only two months previously, when five people, including him, died following inhalation of ammonia gas last Thursday (19). According to his co-workers, when they were going for lunch that day, the supervisor had asked him to close the pipe that released factory waste to the tank. And this is what Ariyapala thought he was going to do when he fell into the tank of ammonia which took his life.
The police reported that the tank into which Ariyapala fell collected ammonia waste from the rubber factory. A group of villagers, residents of the area, and a few factory workers who went to witness the scene, became unconscious, and the police revealed that it was due to breathing the toxic gas.
Ammonia is used in the rubber industry for stabilisation of raw latex to prevent coagulation during transportation and storage.
Four more lives lost in rescue
Along with Ariyapala, his wife Malkanthi, Dodampage Rani (46) and Karunawathi Kusumalatha (47) had joined the factory. Rani said Ariyapala went to close the pipe after the garment factory adjoining theirs had complained about the bad odour.
We all went to have lunch and the supervisor called Ariyapala to come and close the pipe that releases wastewater to the tank, she said. He left his lunch packet and went to close that. After a while we heard screams, we rushed to the tank. And I fainted after that.
Rani said there were no trained people to handle such situations and whoever the supervisor called, had to carry out these jobs.
Four people, one of the co-workers of Ariyapala and four other residents of Horana who had also jumped into the tank to rescue him, died and 18 others who collapsed unconscious were admitted to the Horana Base Hospital which said that one of the rescuers who was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was not critical anymore.
Police information revealed that the factory had been established in 1993 and, according to the workers, there are two sections in the factory. In one section, the production of latex takes place, where 18 are employed, and in the other, footwear is produced where around 40 are employed.
Balage Samanthi (45) has been working for about a year in the factory in the footwear section and said that they do not often go to the other section.
We heard people screaming, she said. When I went near the tank, I saw Ariyapala and Varuna who had fallen into the tank. When some young guys tried to jump, I stopped them from doing so, but in a few seconds I too fainted.
Area residents step up
Nishan Kumara is one of the persons who rescued the ones who fell; he had gone to the scene after receiving a call for help. He said that when he went there, the factory staff had already fled and there was nobody to help them rescue the workers in the tank.
As soon as I understood that that it was a toxic gas, I removed my T-shirt and tied it around my nose, he said.
He claimed that it was the residents who informed the police and the fire brigade and said that the management was responsible for everything.
Knowing that the tank was contaminated with ammonium, the management fled leaving four people to die trying to rescue one person, he said.
Sanjeewa Vithanage (39) was the only one who was saved among the ones who jumped into the tank in the rescue attempt.
I was just walking on the road and the women shouted for help, he said. I climbed down to the tank on a ladder and suddenly I fainted and fell in. I was in hospital when I regained consciousness. 
Vithanage was rescued by the residents and sent to hospital.
He claimed that the management was not there to caution the rescuers to close their noses or not to jump when they were all struggling to save the lives of the people who had fallen.
Chaminda Kumara (34) said that two people were alive when he rescued them, but died after being admitted to hospital.
Something that I could not bear was that I could not even save one life. They all could have been saved if the management had acted in a responsible manner, he said.
Factory failed in safety
Medical Officer of Health (MoH) Maduruwela Dr Erandhi Kularathne said that at a place where the workers are exposed to highly concentrated gases, they should be aware of proper protection measures and the factory administration was responsible for it.
If the factory had followed proper procedures, these lives could have been saved, she said. The residents also jumped into the tank without thinking about their own safety.
Kusumalatha said that there are about seven tanks and the tank into which Ariyapala fell was the last, the one in which wastewater is collected.
There were instances where I had to clean one of the tanks in which rubber latex was collected, said Rani.
Kusumalatha explained that when a little wastewater collects, they draw the water with a bucket, adding that they were never exposed to highly concentrated gas before.
When questioned about the safety measures, both Rani and Kusumalatha were not aware of any. They revealed that they were not even provided with any safety equipment before they were assigned to do any work that exposed them to toxic chemicals.
We were never told that it was dangerous to get exposed to these chemicals, she said. The workers as well as the residents did not know that it was so dangerous and would kill them. Everyone thought it was just a wastewater tank.
However, Kusumalatha said that only Varuna (the factory employee who jumped into the tank to save Ariyapala) was wearing boots and Ariyapala was not wearing any safety equipment.
The police also revealed that when they rushed to the scene, none of the workers had any safety equipment to protect themselves from exposure to toxic fumes.
One of the IPs at the Horana Police Station said that they were no signboards warning the workers of potential hazards of toxic gases either.
The police said investigations were in progress, but there was enough evidence to prove that the management failed to provide necessary safety equipment to the employees.
When we went there, some people were trying to rescue Ariyapala, the other factory worker, and the three residents who jumped to rescue them, said one of the policemen who went to the scene. Unfortunately, there wasnt any equipment or any rescue measures to immediately use to save them.
In the meantime, Kularathne said that officers attached to the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) did an inspection five hours after the incident occurred, on the possibility of health hazards in the area and they informed that there was no problem.
She said that they are yet to confirm whether it was ammonia, adding that the tank was not contaminated with the gas, but they suspect that a toxic gas was released through the pipe that he was trying to close.
Public objection to factory
It was revealed that there had been public objection to this factory for numerous reasons, such as releasing wastewater into the river and bad odour emanating from it. However, the Horana Police said even though there was an objection, they had not received any complaints against the factory owner.
The police noted that there were many such factories in their police division, and they had informed the relevant authorities about the matter.
Amidst public objections, the factory has continued to function, and the management ignored the concerns that were raised, they said. However, the investigation has probed this matter.
Saranga Chandralal, a resident of Balapitiya, however added that a case had indeed been filed against the factory.
He denied the police statement that no complaints were made against the management of the factory.
Chandralal disclosed that they release wastewater to the river during the rainy season, and fish and some buffaloes had died as a result.
The public has been protesting against the management for years now, he said. But we were unable to do anything and today we lost five lives.
The Daily News learnt that the rubber factory in Bulathsinhala, Kobawaka, against which Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma staged a protest, along with the residents last December, is part of this rubber factory in Horana too.
The protest in Bulathsinhala was launched as the factory had not stopped its operations even after the decision taken at the Bulathsinhala Divisional Development Committee to close down the factory temporarily, and the protest followed after a complaint was filed by residents that the factory was letting out wastewater into the environment without proper waste management procedures.
Legal action against factory
However, soon after the incident occurred, the Horana Police arrested the factory manager on suspicion of negligence. Police, Army and STF were deployed near the factory after people nearby protested against the suspected unsafe handling of chemicals, with some residents even demanded that the factory be closed.
The owner of the factory was summoned to the police to give a statement in this regard on Friday (20), but the owner had informed the police that he had been admitted to the hospital with complaints of being exposed to the toxic gas.
The Central Environment Authority (CEA) in the meantime decided to temporarily suspend the environment permit granted to the factory.
Director of the waste management unit, Ajith Weerasundara said that the permit would be suspended until investigations into the matter ended.
The Horana Magistrate has ordered that the manager of the factory be remanded until April 25.
Horana not alone
The number of reported fatal accidents in factories has been on the rise in the country, but is the Labour Department doing enough to protect the welfare of the workers Horana is just one incident. According to the Labour Departments Industrial Safety Division, in the 12 years between 20042015, an average of 66 fatal incidents has been reported per year. This, however, is just the number that is reported; it is believed that many more go unreported.
In 2006, when the highest annual rate of fatal accidents (84) was reported, the Department only filed two cases against factories that year. They had received 114 complaints and investigated 97.
The Commissioner General of Labour R.P.A Wimalaweera who spun into action after the incident, said legal action would be taken against the management of the rubber factory with regard to unsafe working conditions.
The management will be prosecuted for negligence; they have failed to provide the employees a safe and healthy working environment, he said.
He added that according to the Factories Ordinance, the employer should ensure the safety and protection of the employee and the Labour Commission could prosecute the management for failing to do so.
Wimalaweera said that he was informed by the factory engineers attached to the Occupation and Safety section of the Commission that this factory was previously warned with regard to not maintaining appropriate safety measures.
The biggest mistake is that they have allowed the employee to do all kinds of work without consideration for their safety. The management should be punished for their negligence.
He said that for issues like not maintaining safety measures, the management is usually warned, and the responsibility of the Commission included prosecution, prevention and promotion.
Given the seriousness of the issue and the widespread prevalence of such issues in factories around the country, simple warnings seem inadequate, but according to Wimalaweera, they only have 40 Assistant Labour Commissioners and 10 factory engineers and he claimed that even they had issues in inspecting every factory with such a small staff.
We are preparing to begin training programmes for labour inspectors on Occupational Safety and Health, he said.
They will not be able to go into depth into the related matter, but will be able to direct it to the relevant officer if they find anything serious. This is the remedial measure that the commission is intending to take. He noted that as they could not increase their cadre, they were planning to seek the support of other government officers, such as the divisional secretary and public health officers (PHI), to report to the Commission on related issues.
Occupational Health and Safety is not a sector widely covered by the Factories Ordinance and further the Ordinance does not cover every sector, said Wimalaweera. This means that necessary steps should be taken to amend this age-old Ordinance, so that we have the necessary authority to take action.
Whether they are doing enough with what they have however is the question.

War on glyphosate
The trouble l have against scribes who use the prefix Dr. is that they do not disclose, for what and from where, they have obtained their doctorate. It can be a doctorate in theology from some small College for the blind or a doctorate in demonology from a small College for dropouts. But the prefix even though worthless, is often used to bamboozle, beguile, mislead and betray and at times as a mask to hide behind by a card carrying member of a political party to spread its poison or a sleeper in a cell of spies to spread confusion.
Recently there was an article by a scribe using the prefix Dr. claiming that glyphosate is linked with kidney disease among farmers in the dry zone. No evidence was furnished. Only a bald statement. The white coats who have nothing to do these days except walk the streets shouting slogans and drag their once admired Association into the gutter, also joined the war against glyphosate.
Agricultural crops
Those against glyphosate are duty bound to suggest an alternative. Otherwise the country will suffer the fate the ancients suffered with frequent famines. Just for the argument what is the fertilizer other countries use where agricultural crops are a major export Do they use glyphosate or some other fertilizer How many citizens - where glyphosate is used - are suffering from kidney disease If dug deep you will discover more citizens die of traffic accidents than kidney disease.
Harmful to health
Glyphosate by volume is one of the most widely used fertilizer in the US agricultural sector. Its valency formula which I have in front of me boggles the mind each bar of the diagram representing a pair of electrons with spins opposite doing a covalent bond dance. I learnt my Chemistry at the feet of Prof. T. Kandiah who often warned his students that he is only laying the foundation and it is for us to build upon it. His qualifications will easily scroll out of this page but never flaunted his numerous Doctorates. He died at an early age and until his death he simply described himself as Dean, Faculty of Science, University of Ceylon.
The fertilizer was discovered by Monsanto chemist John Franz, a true genius, who like a Grandmaster moving the pieces in a chess board moved the radicals and atoms to discover a formula to checkmate the pests and deliver an abundance, the way the hydrogen atom was moved in butter to produce margarine at an affordable price which some nutritionists believe is harmful to health, because it is something unnatural. It is relevant here to add that the patent Mosantano had in the US, which brought the product to the market under the trade name Roundup, expired in 2000.With that countries that do not care a damn for human health have jumped in to produce cheap formulations of glyphosate which are not within the US standard.
It is wise not to rely on competitive bidding but pay an extra dime and procure glyphosate from the US under the trade name Roundup, than go for a product from third world copycats who are devils incarnate who care tuppence for standards. The devil you know is better than the devil you don't, to save not only our bodies but also our souls.
After the No-Confidence Motion was defeated, Mahinda Rajapaksa, a man for all seasons, who knows which fertilizer to use on which toady, described the defeat as a victory. Then how do you describe a victory Scholastics, the medieval philosophers will argue that Mahinda Rajapaksa not only lost a futile challenge, even the beatific vision.

WB forecasts 4.5 percent growth in Sri Lanka
In its latest report on South Asia, the World Bank highlighted that growth rates across the region should remain relatively stable, with growth in India projected to accelerate to 7.3% in 2018 and 7.5% in 2019-20 due to stronger private spending and export growth.
Sri Lankas GDP growth is forecasted to average around 4.5% over the medium term, reflecting a recovery from the effects of last years adverse weather-related disruptions and more robust consumption and investment growth.
The WB added that the outlook for Sri Lanka remains favorable provided the government is committed to the reform agenda of improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management as these reforms together with the IMF program should add to confidence and support fiscal consolidation efforts.
The Bank estimates that inflation will stabilize at mid-single digits as the impact of natural disasters wanes, but higher global oil prices exert some upward pressure.
The external sector meanwhile is expected to continue benefiting from the GSP+ preferential access to the EU and tourism receipts, even though a deceleration of remittances is likely.
External buffers meanwhile are expected to improve, due to the purchasing of foreign exchange, the maintenance of a more market-determined exchange rate, and increased FDI. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to fall in the medium term, supported by the ongoing implementation of revenue measures. The Bank noted however that a further slowdown in reform implementation, in a challenging political environment, remains the key risk to the Groups baseline estimate.

When Kathy Acker interviewed the Spice Girls
In 1997, The Guardian invited noted experimental writer Kathy Acker to interview the Spice Girls, just as they were at the cusp of mega-stardom (and also their subsequent dissolution) in the US. In fact, on the day of the interview, they were rehearsing for their very first live television appearanceon Saturday Night Live.
At first glance, it may seem a little strange that some editor sent a boundary-pushing postmodern feminist, a writer and performance artist whose work borders on the pornographic, to interview these peddlers of bubblegum-flavored Girl Power. But on the other hand, it actually makes perfect sense.
As Hayley Campbell pointed out, Kathy Acker was always obsessed with girl gangs, returning to the trope repeatedly in her work. If you squinted a bit, maybe the manufactured Spice Girls were the quintessential girl gang: working class women projecting individualism and spreading the word of some kind of feminism that was palatable to their teenage fans.
Theres something quite alluring about the idea of these two different kinds of feminismone underground, the other mainstream, one hard-won, one brand newcoming together. (Though for all this talk of new and old, from my current vantage point, the Spice Girls feminism seems more outdated than Ackers.)
Acker herself had some hesitations about the interview. According to the Campbells BBC show Unpopped, theres quite a bit of unpublished material around the interview; in what was presumably an earlier draft of the introduction, Acker wrote: When The Guardian asked me to interview the Spice Girls, whose music I had not yet heard, I looked down at their pictures and the jacket of their album and thought, in my far too rapid fashion, what is this nonsense And then I thought, I support women, and felt the prick of curiosity.
In fact, she wound up loving them. There is a refusal among Americas music critics to take the Spice Girls seriously, Acker writes in the Guardian piece.
The Rolling Stone review of Spice, their first album, refers to them as attractive young things  brought together by a manager with a marketing concept. The main complaint, or explanation for disregard, is that they are a manufactured band. What can this mean in a society of McDonalds, Coca-Cola and En Vogue However, an email from a Spice fan mentions that, even though he loves the girls, he detects a couple of stereotypes surrounding women in the bands general image.
The brunette is the woman every man wants to date. Perfect for an adventure on a midnight train, or to hire as your mistress-secretary. The blonde is the woman you take home to mother, whereas the redhead is the wild woman, the woman-with-lots-of-evil-powers. So who are these Girls And how political is their notorious Girl Power
Even though I have seen many of their videos and photos, as soon as Im in front of these women, I am struck by how they look far more remarkable than I had expected, even though Mel C is trying not to look as lovely as she is. I had intended to say something else, but instead I find myself asking them: If paradise existed, what would it look like
If that seems strange as an opening question, Geris response is even stranger: Money makes the world what it is today . . . a world infested with evil. All sorts of wars are going on at the moment. Everyones kind of bickering, wanting to better themselves because their next-door neighbours got a better lawn. That kind of thing.
Rather political, then. Acker finds herself awed by the Spice Girlsvisually (she keeps returning to their clothes, their beauty), sonically (they keep talking over one another; at times she cant discern who says what), and, it seems to me, emotionally. They surprise her. I cant keep up with these Girls, she writes. - Lit Hub

Wolves seal Championship title as Sunderland are relegated
LONDON, Saturday - Wolverhampton Wanderers sealed the second-tier Championship title in style by routing relegation-threatened Bolton Wanderers 4-0 at Molineux on Saturday.
On a day when the goals rattled in, Wolves won the division for the second time in 10 years, but there was misery for Sunderland who were relegated for the second straight season.
Cardiff City took a big step towards promotion with a 2-1 home win over Nottingham Forest that moved them a point clear of Fulham in second place.
The playoff fight looks likely to go down to the wire with seven teams scrapping for the two remaining slots alongside Aston Villa, who beat managerless Ipswich Town 4-0, and whichever of Fulham and Cardiff do not go up automatically.
Middlesbroughs 2-1 win over rivals Derby County means they need just four points from their final two games to secure a playoff slot but Bristol Citys chances were not helped by an extraordinary 5-5 draw with Hull City, a game they twice led by two goals but required a stoppage time strike to salvage a point.
Brentford are well-placed to grab the final playoff slot after beating west London rivals Queens Park Rangers 2-1, a game in which they also missed a penalty.
At the other end, Sunderland were relegated for the second consecutive season after Liam Boyce gave Burton Albion a late 2-1 victory that boosted their own survival hopes.
Birmingham City were also lifted by a 2-1 comeback win over Sheffield United, a result that probably ended the Blades playoff hopes.

New Local Government Act, a white elephant
It is a crime that the number of councillors of local bodies countrywide, had increased unnecessarily by the recently-introduced Local Government Act. The Act is no doubt a white elephant, Ajith Wijewardena, a UNP councillor attached to the Polgahawela Pradeshiya Sabha of the Kurunegala district said.
He was addressing the pradehsiya sabha's inaugural meeting, recently.
A large sum of public funds are required to maintain these councillors. The government should take immediate steps to rectify this blunder as the country is already facing other hindrances such as the ones experienced with the economy. All politicians, government officials and party leaders are answerable for this plight, he added.
"Councillors, parliamentarians and ministers enjoy their large salaries and privileges at the expense of the public people; it is a burden especially to low-income families," Wijewardena said, adding that the population of the country is around 20 million, but that there are more than 8,000 councillors for local bodies alone.

Protecting consumer rights, CAAs prime responsibility
Promotion and protection of consumer rights would be the prime responsibility of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Southern Provincial CAA Assistant Director S. Nandasiri said.
He made these sentiments addressing an awareness workshop on consumer rights for G. C. E. Advanced Level students and teachers at the Matara Maha Vidyalaya, recently.
He said that CAA officials would always be prepared to initiate immediate action for any complaints lodged against errant vendors. If consumers were not satisfied with goods they had bought, they had the right to exchange them for quality goods or request a refund.
Assistant Director Nandasiri said that it would be the responsibility of traders to issue warranty cards with a duration of at least six months to all consumers who buy electrical items. Prices should be displayed on every item for sale and any alteration of set prices on labels would be a punishable offence. Batch numbers and manufacture and expiry dates should be clearly indicated on every consumer item on sale.
On the instructions of the Industries and Commerce Ministry and under the guidance of the Consumer Affairs Authority, sudden raids and mobile inspections against errant traders had been increased island-wide, he further added.

My father Reggie Ranatunga was a great peoples leader who sacrificed his life for the SLFP, said Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, at Reggie Ranatungas 81st birthday remembrance at Udugampola, yesterday.
He condemned the use of his fathers birthday for political benefit.
Mahinda Rajapaksa did not care about my father when he was living. Rajapaksa left him to die as a Parliamentarian. Im happy that at least hes paying tribute to my fathers body.
A journalist queried whether Rajapaksa was trying to divide the Ranatunga family.
Reggie Ranatunga saved the SLFP continuing with the principles of Bandaranaike, Minister Ranatunga said. But the Rajapaksas are trying to ruin our brotherhood.
My father never allowed my family to be divided. Some politicians are doing it after his death. Their politics depend on selling some characters. They are trying to ruin our brotherhood. In the Gampaha district, our family is the political family after the Bandaranaike family.
Its good that my father has died. If not he would have died after seeing this situation. My father never tried to divide the party or leave the party. He was not a corrupt politician and we can be proud of him as sons. There is no disharmony in my family.
We are just following different political paths. Prasanna has a different political path and Ruwan is with the SLFP continuing with the principles of Bandaranaike. We will take one path together at the right time.

Age is just a number
A teenage boy said it was love at first sight when he saw a grandmother 53 years older than him.
Almeda, then 71, and Gary Hardwick, then 17, briefly met two summers ago at her son Roberts funeral after he tragically died of a seizure aged 45. But the couple didnt get together properly until two months later when Roberts widow Lisa invited them both along to a family meal at a nearby Chuck E Cheeses pizza restaurant.
Gary had just broken up with another woman aged 77, and admits he knew Almeda was the one as soon as he locked eyes with the grandmother of six.
Two weeks into their whirlwind romance, Gary popped the question and they tied the knot just six days later in a ceremony which he arranged for just 137.
Two years on, the couple are aged 72 and 19 and live in Maryville, Tennessee - and are happier than ever.
Almeda said: If you love somebody, age is just a number. Ive now been happily married going on two years with my true soul mate. We met at Chuck E Cheese, there was a birthday party there. I looked into his eyes and I just fell in love. I knew he was the one I wanted to spend my life with. I was never intimidated by the age at all.
And luckily for her, Gary felt the exact same.
He said: The first thing that attracted me to Almeda was her beautiful, gorgeous blue eyes. And her personality. Shes always full of laughter and we just connected so well. The chemistry was great. Everything about her has just captured my heart since day one.
Despite the staggering difference in their age, Gary and Almeda have similar interests and hobbies.
I never feel as though Im missing out on anything by being married to Almeda, Gary said. Im really mature for my age, I do not fit into the young age bracket at all. Ive never been attracted to younger women. Even when I was 13 or 14, Ive always had an attraction for older women and when I told my grandmother, who raised me, I didnt know how she would take it. But she accepted us. A lot of people wait years to get married and everyone has different opinions on getting married quickly. But we knew we were in love, so I jumped on that.
He adds, The first time we made love was on our wedding night. It was an amazing experience. There was such a deep connection there. Shes a wonderful lover.
The happy couple are more than aware that a lot of people disagree with the nature of their relationship. And that includes Almedas son, who hasnt spoken to her since the day she met Gary.
Aaron and Indiana Elliott, Almedas Grandchildren, also found it difficult to accept their relationship in the early stages  particularly 22-year-old Aaron, who is three years older than his step-grandfather.
Aaron, said: I only called him Grandfather once and it was when I was drunk. In my head, I see him as a friend more than a Grandfather. But you know, our Grandmother is happy.
Indiana, 17, added: And how can you not be supportive about that For me personally, whenever they first got together it was a little bit weird. But I mean, we live in the 21st century and those things really shouldnt matter. My mom on the other hand is very outspoken, because you know theres an age difference between him and my mom too so its a little weird to see your mother walking around with someone the same age as your own kids.
One of Gary and Almedas passion points is YouTube. They run their very own channel with 49,000 subscribers, with their love being the focus of most videos. And more recently, they have introduced merchandise to sell to their fans with pens and mugs that have their faces on.
Gary said: One of the things we love to do together is film videos for our YouTube channel. We do vlogs, reaction videos and pranks. And as far as I know, we are the biggest age gap couple that are YouTubers.
Almeda is confident that she will be with Gary for the rest of her life  whilst her hubby wants to continue to spread the message that age is just a number.
Gary said: What does the future hold for Gary and Almeda I believe amazing things. We want to pursue our dreams on YouTube and be able to inspire more and more people every day that age is just a number  it should not matter. As long as youre in love with that person, you should follow your heart and be happy and be yourself.

H. V. Perera
Legal genius
H. V. Perera was born to a middle-class family in Moratuwa. His father was a licensed surveyor. Perera received his primary education at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa and was said to be a backward and mischievous child. Later, he was transferred to Royal College, Colombo, where he received his secondary education.
One day, a teacher was on sick leave and the then College Principal Hartley, took the class. He questioned the children as to why they attended school, to which a student had said: to learn English, while another said; to learn arithmetic. In response, Principal Hartley had said that one comes to school in order to learn how to think; words that inspired young the H. V. It was the turning point in his school career, leading him to win many prizes at the college. Mathematics was his specialty.
He later commenced his higher education at the University of London. However, after his final examination, he had walked out of the examination hall a dejected student as he had only managed to answer one question, whilst his peers had answered three to four. However, there was pindrop silence at the prize-giving when it was announced that the gold medal for mathematics was awarded to H.V. Perera.
The mathematics professor had announced that the prize was awarded to Perera as he had solved the complex mathematical problem using a new method, whilst the others had simply mimicked their textbooks. The professor had said that he had been on the lookout for such an individual.
Upon his return to Ceylon, he provided private tuition classes in mathematics to students. At that time, the principal's post at Ananda College fell vacant and subsequently, was offered to him. However, he declined the offer as it would have been a purely academic career thereafter. At the time, his father had insisted that he should become a civil servant (a career highly regarded at that time). However, young H. V. had disagreed with his father, saying he would take to law as his profession; a decision which led H. V. to leave his home.
During his career in law, he had an analytical approach to problems. I would like to mention the Bracegirdle case in particular, where Englishman Mark Anthony Bracegirdle with leftist ideas, came to Ceylon and agitated the plantation workers who were living under poor conditions. The British Governor at that time, had obtained a deportation order for Bracegirdle, to which Bracegirdle appealed against with H. V.'s assistance and won. In another case, H. V. had highlighted the importance of the independence of the judiciary, executive and the legislature, which are the three pillars on which a government rests. However, we have had instances where the executive interfered with the judiciary.
H. V.s day always commenced with a 15-minute exercise before entering his office room and attending to routine correspondence.
He also used to advise junior lawyers who consulted him during his free time at courts. On returning home from Hulftsdorp, he always relaxed in his armchair and read newspapers whilst having tea. At 7.00 pm, he would go to his consultation room in order to meet clients and at 9.00 pm, he would have dinner with his wife and two sons, while listening to classical music on his radiogram. At times, he used to meet his mathematics professor to solve complex mathematical problems.
H. V.s intellect was of high calibre, such that the then Prime Minister, Governor General and others used to consult him regarding matters of the state. One day, late D. S. Senanayake had visited H. V.s residence at Torrington Place, Colombo 7. The purpose was to invite him to join his Cabinet as the Justice Minister. However, H. V. had declined the offer. He once confided in me and said, Politics is a dirty game, I will have no part in it.
H. V. was appointed Commissioner of Currency (1944 to 1950) and was a founder director of the Bank of Ceylon. Later, he became the chairman of the bank. His annual report of the bank, which was looked forward to, gave a resum of the state of the country's economy, which at that time, depended solely on the export of tea, rubber and coconuts. The Ceylon Rupee at that time, was valued at Rs. 13.36 to the Sterling Pound. During his tenure at the bank as its chairman, the post of General Mananger fell vacant. The post was advertised and prospective candidates were interviewed. H. V.s choice was C. Logonathan. The other directors, however, had other ideas. Then H. V. had explained that a persons ethnicity should be no bar to selection and the person whose curriculum vitae was the best, should be selected. They subsequently caved in and Loganathan was selected.
H. V.s 50 years at the bar, was celebrated at the Taprobane Hotel in 1966. Prominent lawyers of the day had attended the function. It was mentioned that H. V. Perera would be an adornment to any bar in any country, in any age. The maestro of Hulftsdorp, a phenomenon of legal firmament H. W. Jayawardene said about him. Ceylons Greatest legal genius, Sir Lalitha Rajapakse said, while G. G. Ponanbalam called him a grand master and an undisputed leader. Ceylon has had great lawyers, but H. V. is the greatest of them all, Dr. Colvin R. De Silva said. It would be impertinence for an ordinary mortal to attempt a reasoned assessment of H. V.s qualities as a lawyer and an advocate, E. F. N. Grantien had added.
Dr. P. R. Anthoniz was by H. V.s bedside during his last moments. Even though he was semiconscious at that time, he was heard arguing a case.
I could do no better than quote the inscription on the tombstone of H. V. Perera which stands at the Borella Cemetery: Herbert Victor Perera. Born 31/10/1890. Died 16/4/1969. But though the voice is still, the echoes still remain. May he rest in peace.

Dr. Ariyasena U. Gamage
Doctor par excellence
My dear friend Ari is no more. He breathed his last recently, following his battle with cancer. His passing away revealed to all of us, the impermanence of our lives and everything within this world. He was a compassionate and decent human being, a loving family man and above all else, a sincere friend. Ari was 65 years old when he met his demise.
Dr. Ariyasena U.Gamage was a general practitioner, a consultant in community medicine and an outstanding communicator. He was a writer who had penned books mainly on medical topics and was also a participant in television programmes. In fact, the popular TV programme Yatharupa aired last Thursday, featuring scientists and rationalists including icon of modern western medicine Prof. Carlo Fonseka. Prof. Carlo remembered Ari and his wife Manel when they were medical students at the Colombo Medical Faculty. Ari too, had been a rationalist and taken part in a few of its programmes. I was honoured by him when he requested me to write the foreword for his book Mata Diyawadiyawa Dan Hondai.
It had been said that a doctor should be able, available and approachable. Ari possessed all these and more and used his inherent communication skills when dealing with patients. He listened to them and showed empathy and kindness, which drew thousands of patients of all communities towards him. He never treated serious patients on his own and always used to get a second opinion from a consultant.
The news of his death was first conveyed to me by a Muslim patient of mine from Mawanella. In present times of ethnic turmoil, Ari was a shining light to all. When minor ethnic riots erupted in Mawanella a few years ago, he was able to quell the conflict to some extent with the assistance of a group of Buddhist monks.
He had a short stint at the Community Medicine Department of the Peradeniya University Medical Faculty. He utilised his skills in community medicine and conveyed messages on preventive medicine to society. Dr. Gamage was also an office-bearer of the Sri Lanka Diabetes Association (Kandy branch) and organised several programmes in Mawanella.
He was connected to leading politicians, but never used their influence. He used to talk at length about his life, family and future plans when I accompanied him to participate in TV programmes. He used to visit his ageing parents residing down South, regularly, at least once a week. When I visited him at the hospital a few months ago, I noticed that he had lost all his hair following chemotherapy. Ari, despite his illness, was his usual jovial self and when I inquired whether he had planned any future TV programmes, he jested saying why not when he regained his hair.
He used his suffering and experience to educate people on how to cope with cancer. This was the basis of his other book Rajek Unath Ledek Nam. Someone who wrote on late Prof. Stephen Hawking said, "Those who live in the shadow of death are often those who live the most." Even though Ari did not live that long, he certainly lived the most.Ari leaves behind his loving wife, Manel and two daughters and sons-in-law.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

It was with profound sorrow that I came to know of the passing away of one of my mango friends for over half a century.
The situation was made worse, as true to his beliefs and character, there had not been any funeral as such since he had decided to donate his remains to the Jayawardenepura Medical Faculty. I came to know of his passing away after all these formalities were complete.
I initially came to know Nihal in 1962 when both of us were enrolled at Aquinas University College for the B.Sc(Econ) Degree programme of the University of London. At that time, I was employed at the Peoples Bank.
However in 1964, I was transferred to its Talawakelle Branch as its Assistant Manager, thereby compelling me to relinquish my study programme. By this time, the University of Peradeniya commenced its own external degree programme and my friend moved over to this newly established study programme and eventually passed out as one of its graduates.
Upon passing the Government Clerical Service Examination, Nihal commenced his career with the Land Settlement Department.
After a brief spell there and after having passed the London A/L Examination, he joined a Education Department as an Assistant Teacher, which gave him time to concentrate on his degree programmes. Upon successful completion of his degree, he joined the academic staff of the Junior University Colleges of Polgolla and Dehiwala.
Around 1975, he proceeded to France to pursue his MBA studies with the Universite des Sciences Sociales, in Toulouse and upon its completion, returned to the country and was absorbed by the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) as a Lecturer. After a brief spell there, he joined the Bank of Ceylon as a Consultant and was a member of the team formed for the setting up of the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL); the first merchant bank to be set up in the country.
From 1981 to 1991, he was employed by the MBSL as a Consultant until the first unit trust company was formed in 1992 which was National Asset Management Ltd., popularly known as NAMAL.
He became its first Marketing Manager and shortly thereafter, its CEO; a position he held until his retirement in December, 1997.
During his career life, he remained a conformist and a perfectionist. Due to this reason, he found it quite easy to get along with his peers as well as subordinates. There is no doubt that he acquired a unique combination of experiences which was demonstrated during his career's progression.
He was a clerk, teacher, lecturer, marketing consultant, trainer, merchant banker, CEO, researcher, editor of a business journal and finally, an author. It is due to this reason that I call him a man for all seasons.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

M. H. Mohamed Careem
A pillar of strength
The demise of Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed Careem of Ehuthar Hajiar street, Kinniya, occurred on the April 4, 2018 and the janasa took place at the Kinniya burial ground on the same day, around 8.00 pm.
He was born on December 28, 1936 and was educated at the Batticaloa Shivananda Vidyalaya. He was a self-motivated, proactive and enthusiastic person who performed his duties with utmost care and attention. He was known as a kind and friendly gentlemen with a large heart among the public.
He was boarded at the Kamalalayam Hall of the Shivananda Vidyalaya hostel. I had the privilege of associating with him for well over 20 years. I had always seen him calm and composed during any crises or unexpected situation.
He was a pillar of strength to his family and during the final stage of his life, while knowing full well of his deteriorating condition, he never lost his composure and passed away peacefully.
He was a special-trained teacher of the Palaly Teacher College of Education from 1959 to 1960, having passed the G. C. E. (O/L) and G. C. E. (A/L) examinations creditably well. He was a sportsman who won several prizes at the Annual Sports Meet at the Shivananda Vidyalaya.
Late Careem possessed a great sense of humour and was never without a smile; even during the darkest of hours, his presence shone a light upon everyone who knew him. He had brought much prestige to his college with his excellent work. His death is a great loss to all of us, particularly to Shivananda Vidyalaya.
Although he has parted from us, his name will be engraved in the hearts of all who knew him and in the institutions at which he worked.
He secured a BA degree and a Diploma in Education at the University of Peradaniya. His spared no pains in working for the betterment of the underprivileged people of the area. He took interest in the reorganisation of his alma mater's Past Students' Association.
Having passed the Sri Lanka Educational Service Examination, he was appointed the Deputy Education Director for the Mutur, Thampalakam I and Tincomalee areas from 1987 to 1994. He was also the Kinniya Pradheshiya Sabha Chairmen from 1994 to 2000 and was later appointed Quazi Judge for the area from 2007 to 2010 by the Judicial Service Commission.
Careem was an admirer of Swami Vipulanantha and Swami Nadaraja Anandaji. He was responsible for organising the death anniversary of Swami Nadaraja Anandaji at Shivananda Vidyalaya.
My deepest sympathies go to the bereaved members of his family. May he rest in peace.
AL. Ibralabbe, Rtd. SLAS Divisional Secretary, Addalaichenai.

Army to erect Vesak pandal in Malaysia
Arrangements are underway to put up the first-ever Vesak pandal erected by the Army, in Malaysia, for the forthcoming Vesak season, in an attempt to show the significance of the Vesak festival to Malaysians.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake who paid a visit to the Brickfield Buddhist temple in Kuala Lumpur while he was in Malaysia to attend the 16th edition of the Defence Services Asia (DSA) Exhibition  2018 and its conference during April 16 to 19, inquired into the progress of the project.
The Brickfield temple chief incumbent, in his anusasana to the Commander, extolled the supply of Army expertise and the manpower for the erection of this 60-ft tall Vesak pandal with thousands of multicoloured illuminations which would further stimulate Buddhist devotion and its sacred spirit. The monk also appreciated the support of the Army for a mega responsibility of this nature in a foreign land which is largely occupied by non-Buddhists.
Troops from the Corps of Engineer Services (CES), as per directions of the Army Commander, are to begin the erection of this structure in Kuala Lumpur shortly.
Lieutenant General Senanayake also paid a visit to the Sentul Buddhist Temple and met its incumbent of the temple. During his stay at both these temples, the Commander paid his obeisance to both resident Sri Lankan monks and made inquiries into their well-being and ongoing missionary work in the temples.

Bangladesh arrests female cricketer with methamphetamine
CHITTAGONG, Sunday: One of Bangladeshs top female cricketers could be jailed for life after being caught with 14,000 methamphetamine pills, police said Sunday.
Nazreen Khan Mukta, who plays first-grade cricket in the Dhaka Premier League, was returning from a match in the southeastern city of Coxs Bazar when police stopped and searched the team bus at Chittagong.
During our search, we caught her with 14,000 yaba pills she had kept in packets, local police chief Pronob Chowdhury told AFP, using the local name for tablets of methamphetamine mixed with caffeine.
Chowdhury said the Ansar VDP star would be charged with drug trafficking, an offence that can carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Coxs Bazar borders Myanmars conflict-plagued Rakhine state, where authorities say methamphetamine labs produce tens of millions of yaba pills that are shipped to Bangladesh.Officials this month said drug traffickers had been more active since August, when nearly 700,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar began pouring into Bangladesh.
Gangs have been using the Rohingya refugees as mules and hiding drugs in fishing boats used for ferrying the persecuted Muslims to safety.
Authorities said last month that nine million yaba pills were seized in less than three months as the refugee influx reached its peak. Nearly two million were discovered in a single haul.
Dhaka has been planning to introduce the death penalty for yaba trafficking to try to curb the drugs popularity and use.
Bangladesh in 2017 seized more than 40 million pills, double the previous years haul.  AFP

Barbie has had a surname for the last 60 years!
Some people dont need a surname. Cher, Seal, Prince, Madonna, Kylie, McLovin, Kajol - none of these famous faces need any further introduction.
Barbie , while not technically speaking a person, has also always been counted amongst this illustrious company for the past 59 years. Unfortunately for her however, her place on the one-name-wonder roll-call isnt in fact merited. Because Barbie has had a surname all along.
And no, its not Doll. The iconic dolls Twitter account revealed that Barbie officially goes by the name of Barbie Roberts. Her parents (yes, she has those too) are called George and Margaret.
While some mega-fans may have already known this, an overwhelming and huge majority were taken aback. Its also her maiden name, as Kens surname is Carson, apparently.
Thats not the only name-related bombshell. According to Barbie folklore, Barbie is in fact her nickname. Her full name is Barbara Barbie Millicent Roberts.
The fact she has three sisters seemed to catch people off-guard too. Research into her siblings gets a little confusing and murky - because shes had quite a few and, of these, a couple have quietly disappeared.
She had a sister called Kristine who was discontinued in 2001, and her sister Kelly was replaced with Chelsea in 2010. You see, every family has its problems, even Barbies. Mirror

Barcelona thrash Sevilla to win Kings Cup again
MADRID, Saturday - Unstoppable duo Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi helped Barcelona thrash Sevilla 5-0 to win the Kings Cup final for the fourth consecutive season on Saturday as they close in on a likely domestic double.
Luis Suarez struck twice in the first half for the Catalans as they won the competition for a record 30th time. However, it was Iniesta and Messi who pulled all the strings as the La Liga leaders blew away Vincenzo Montellas stunned side.
Philippe Coutinho set up Suarez for the opening goal in the 14th minute and Barcelona dominated the rest of the game. The result goes some way to make up for their humiliating Champions League quarter-final elimination by AS Roma earlier in April.
Messi slammed home the second after good work from Jordi Alba with Suarez adding another, before Iniesta netted from a tight angle. Coutinho added a fifth from the penalty spot to complete the rout.
This doesnt cover up what happened in Rome but its an important title, said Suarez.
At the start of the season we would have taken this, theres huge merit to it.
Its strange to be knocked out of the Champions League, we gave the impression that we could go far in it.
Both Barcelona and Sevilla fans sang Iniestas name when he was substituted in the final stages, with the chants echoing around the Wanda Metropolitano stadium until after the final whistle.
The veteran midfielder is considering a move to the Chinese Super League and this could be his last cup final for Barcelona - and he made sure it was one to remember.
Barcelona had a formidable game and when they are like that its hard to stop them, said Montella.
They have formidable players like Iniesta, Messi, Suarez.
Im very sorry to the fans who were fantastic today. We are not in our best form, we have to react.
With Iniesta leading the way, Barca came flying out of the blocks and moved ahead after a long ball from goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen found Coutinho deep in opposition territory and he set up Suarez.
Sevilla rallied but after a couple of half-chances Barcelona doubled their lead when Iniesta sent Alba flying down the left. The Spaniard backheeled the ball into Messis path and the Argentine fired in.
Messi then created the third for Suarez with a sublime through-ball and the fourth for Iniesta, whose goal will be a special moment to take with him if he does depart.
Coutinhos penalty after Clement Lenglet handled the ball in the area helped Ernesto Valverdes side finish emphatically and they were soon able to celebrate with the cup which had their name on it from the start - and recently always seems to.

Beyond Words
If Geoffrey Chaucer lived today and wrote The Canterbury Tales on his smartphone how would he have written, Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote... No doubt with pictures of rain clouds, trees, and birds. And his readers would have reacted to his work with a heart, a laughing face, a thumbs up sign, a face with the mouth turned into the shape of the letter O to mean wow or one thats red and frowning (the reaction of those who would not have understood what he is talking about).
But Chaucer is not here today. So his Canterbury Tales remain as obscure as the riddle of the Sphinx whereas if he had written his poems using those instantly recognizable cartoons called emoji which can be understood even across linguistic barriers, readers all over the world would have grasped he is talking about the joys of April showers  the kind thats falling outside my window right now.
Even if you are not using a smartphone or Twitter, Instagram or Facebook you would still be familiar with emoji. These days they appear on t-shirts, billboards, and even in official rulings issued by High Court judges. Three years ago emoji gained celebrity status when the Oxford Dictionary named the Face with Tears of Joy emoji the Word of the Year. Someone has already put together a song-length emoji translation of Beyonces Drunk in love while someone else, believe it or not, translated all of Moby-Dick (titled, inevitably, Emoji Dick). Then there is the website emojianalysis that will track your recent emoji use to analyze your emotional well-being.
And thats just a glimpse of the power of emoji. If we count all emoji Smiling Face, Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes, Grinning Face, Winking Face, Smiling Face With Heart-Shaped Eyes, Kissing Face and Kissing Face With Closed Eyes, Face With Stuck-Out Tongue With Tightly Closed Eyes, not to mention House With Garden and sunny day and Ghost and Money and Hamburger we will end up with 722 symbols  symbols that might at first seem ridiculous. After all, they are a small invasive cartoon army of faces and vehicles and flags and food trying to topple the millennial-long reign of words.
Yet, they are fast becoming a powerful form of communication. Emoji is now the official language of the country called the Internet. But lets get this straight, emoji (born in a true eureka moment, from the mind of a single man: Shigetaka Kurita of Japan), simply are not relevant for long-form written communication: complex prose, scientific journals, literature (and probably not good for Chaucer, either). Emojis relevance lies in the abbreviated digital messages of daily life  social-media quips, texted jokes and chat messages.
It is not easy, explains Tyler Schnoebelen, a linguistics Ph.D. from Stanford, to express our emotions through electronic devices. If you are talking to someone face-to-face, you dont need an additional word or symbol to express, Im smiling because you would, presumably, be smiling. The psychologist Albert Mehrabian, in an oft-cited study, determined in the 1950s that only 7 percent of communication is verbal (what we say), while 38 percent is vocal (how we say it) and 55 percent is nonverbal (what we do and how we look while were saying it). This is well and good for face-to-face communication, but when we are texting, 93 percent of our communicative tools are negated.
Enter emoji.
According to Vyvyan Evans, the author of The Emoji Code, these icons help to reproduce in the digital environment almost all the characteristics of human communication in the real world. The symbols work in a manner similar to non-verbal cues in face-to-face interactions (body language, intonation, and facial expressions) and communicate the nuances of mood and emotion between people who cannot see the gestures of their interlocutor. The emoji can make up for the useful cues that are often missing from digital chit-chatting: the raise of an eyebrow, the shrug of the shoulders, the rolling of an eye.
Things, however, can get lost in translation and create chaos extremely quickly. For example, just what does a wink meanflirting, joking, conspiring, agreeing, or lying Some emoji can also mean different things to different groups of people. If someone sends you a picture of pizza or cheese, for instance, it might not have anything to do with food. In the new lexicon, pictures of pizza popping up on a smartphone might mean I love you.
Love and laughter, it appears are the best emotions that can be conveyed through emoji. Emoji are not well designed to convey hatred. There really are no negative or mean emoji, says Lindsey Weber, who co-curated the Emoji art show. Theres no violent or aggressive emoji. Even the angry faces are hilarious or silly. Sure, theres a gun emoji. But its a harmless water pistol. Imagine sending a death threat using a water pistol and a blushing face. If its possible to soften a death threat, emoji would do it.
No doubt, then, in spite of the naysayers who see doom in this new form of communication, we have stumbled on the best possible way to connect with each other through these tiny pictures. We have been given a whole new vocabulary to say Im laughing, or happy, or Well done. Thanks to the emoji we blow each other kisses, we smile with hearts in our eyes. We cry tears of joy. Emoji language is simple, and silly but it works and thats what matters.
So why waste words. Imagine I sent you a pizza and a line of smiley faces.

The Commonwealth Heads of States adopted the Trade Connectivity Agenda to serve its 2.4 billion people of which 60% of are less than 30 years of age.

Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen led the Sri Lankan delegation and was a panellist at the SME Trade Forum. SMEs have the potential to make a significant contribution, but its interests are overlooked at times. Therefore, Commonwealth can be useful in addressing these challenges faced by SMEs by building the required connectivity among the members. More interactions among the business community, sharing of best practices and information will certainly assist to facilitate trade and overcome other non-tariff barriers he said. Being the largest business delegation to the CBF Sri Lanka participants played a significant role in sharing knowledge and networked promoting intra commonwealth trade and Investment between Sri Lanka and other member states thus providing a positive contribution to the Commonwealth Themes 2018: Towards a Common Future. The CBF gave the member countries a unique opportunity to build on the already existing intra commonwealth trade which is 19% cheaper than the global average.
Director General of Commerce Sonali Wijerathna, Chairperson EDB Indira Malwatta, Deputy Director of Commerce Alexi Gunasekera and Commercial Counseller in London Senuja Samaraweera were among the officials of the delegation.

Boults jaw-dropping IPL catch leaves cricket world in awe
NEW DELHI, Sunday - Trent Boult left the cricket world stunned with his fielding brilliance after taking a sensational catch hailed as the greatest ever during an Indian Premier League match.
New Zealands Boult, playing for Delhi Daredevils in the lucrative Twenty20 tournament, leapt airborne on the deep square leg boundary to pouch one-handed a shot by Virat Kohli, skipper of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, that appeared to be heading for six.
The wrong-handed diving effort by the left-arm paceman -- completed just millimetres inside the boundary rope -- left Kohli in disbelief and sent social media into a frenzy.
I was stunned when he took it, thats a brilliant catch. It happens in the IPL especially, Kohli said after his team went on to win the match on Saturday night.
Good to see. Thats a catch when you look back, you dont feel bad about getting out, Kohli added of his dismissal that came off the bowling of Harshal Patel.
I think we could quite easily have just seen the Greatest EVER catch, tweeted the former England captain Michael Vaughan.
Commentator and former England Test batsman David Lloyd termed it a moment of magic while England and Rajasthan Royals all-rounder Ben Stokes wrote on Twitter: Dont think you can even describe that as a catch... thats something different.
The match will also be remembered for AB de Villiers unbeaten 90 off 39 balls that led Bangalore to a six-wicket win at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
The South African batsman hit 10 fours and five sixes to pulverise the Delhi bowlers, for whom Boult returned figures of 1-33.
The IPL is now in its 11th season with 60 matches over 51 days. There is $8 million in prize money at stake including $4 million for the winning team. The final takes place on May 27 in Mumbai.  AFP

Despite this weeks overall sluggishness, investor confidence (as gauged through the movement of market indices) over the start of Q218 has begun to show a gradual improvement with the ASPI returning 1% (or 64 points) and the S&P 20 Index returning 0.9% ( 32 points) since 29th March. Markets in the week ahead are likely to be active as investors return to markets post the Traditional New Year holidays, but political instability and delayed policy reforms will continue to remain major investor concerns.

Bugs in your gut cause joint pain
Junk food exacerbates arthritis and joint pain, new research has found. The study shows that bacteria in the gut appears to be the driving force behind inflammation that leads to painful wear and tear of the bones in overweight people.
Osteoarthritis was long assumed to simply be a consequence of undue stress on the joints, and that losing weight could prevent the condition.
But the new study, published today by the University of Rochester Medical Center, suggests that balancing gut bacteria with a prebiotic supplement reversed the symptoms in mice - even if their weight stayed the same.
Study leader Associate Professor Michael Zuscik said: Cartilage is both a cushion and lubricant, supporting friction-free joint movements. When you lose that, it is bone on bone, rock on rock. Its the end of the line and you have to replace the whole joint. Preventing that from happening is what we, as osteoarthritis researchers, strive to do - to keep that cartilage.
The researchers fed mice a high fat diet akin to a Western cheeseburger and milkshake diet.
Just 12 weeks of the high fat diet made mice obese and diabetic, nearly doubling their body fat percentage compared to mice fed a low fat, healthy diet.
Their colons were dominated by pro-inflammatory bacteria, and almost completely lacked certain beneficial, probiotic bacteria, such as the common yogurt additive Bifidobateria.
The changes in the gut microbiomes of the mice coincided with signs of body-wide inflammation, including in their knees where the researchers induced osteoarthritis with a meniscal tear, a common athletic injury known to cause osteoarthritis.
Compared to lean mice, the findings showed that osteoarthritis progressed much more quickly in the obese mice, with nearly all of their cartilage disappearing within 12 weeks of the tear. Surprisingly, the researchers found that the effects of obesity on gut bacteria, inflammation, and osteoarthritis were completely prevented when the high fat diet of obese mice was supplemented with a common prebiotic, called oligofructose.
The knee cartilage of obese mice who ate the oligofructose supplement was indistinguishable from that of the lean mice. Prebiotics, such as oligofructose, cannot be digested by rodents or humans, but they are welcome treats for certain types of beneficial gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria. Colonies of those bacteria chowed down and grew, taking over the guts of obese mice and crowding out bad actors, such as pro-inflammatory bacteria.
That, in turn, decreased systemic inflammation and slowed cartilage breakdown in the mices osteoarthritic knees.
Oligofructose even made the obese mice less diabetic, but there was one thing the dietary supplement didnt change: body weight.
Obese mice given oligofructose remained obese, bearing the same load on their joints, yet their joints were healthier.
Just reducing inflammation was enough to protect joint cartilage from degeneration, supporting the idea that inflammation - not biomechanical forces - drive osteoarthritis and joint degeneration.
Now they plan to continue the research in humans. The team hopes to compare older people who have obesity-related osteoarthritis to those who dont to further identify the connections between gut microbes and joints.

CBK takes JO to task
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been conspiring to break up the government and cause division between the President and Prime Minister for the last three years, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
The group of 16 SLFP Parliamentarians who voted in favour of the No Confidence Motion (NCM) was part of that conspiracy launched by Rajapaksas agents, Kumaratunga said.
Attending a New Year festival held in Attanagalla on April 21, she said the SLFP had still not discussed the 20th Amendment to the contribution relating to the abolition of the Executive Presidency. This had to be decided in Parliament, she said.
The names of other SLFP Parliamentarians crossing over to the Opposition in addition to the 16 members should be asked from Dilan Perera, Kumaratunga said.
She said Dilan Perera was a person who did not obtain a peoples mandate, but entered Parliament from the National List even during her time after much begging.
Today, he is dancing to the tune of outsiders after entering Parliament on the National List. It was an irony to see Dilan Perera who almost worshipped her by proclaiming her as the best politician in the world, is now dubbing her as an expired packet of noodles. The whole world could be turned topsy turvy if 10 such persons dubbed as expired packets of noodles teamed up, the former President said.
Former President Kumaratunga said as for her, she would always punish fraudsters. But, she could not talk about others.
The Yahapalana Government would last its full term without a hitch despite the cross over of 16 MPs, she said.
According to Kumaratungas information, there was no move by UNP backbenchers to bring an impeachment motion against the President.
The President had done no wrong to face such a scenario. The President was too good and lenient, former President Kumaratunga said.

Celtic blow chance to clinch Scottish title
GLASGOW, Saturday - Celtic wasted a chance to clinch the Scottish Premiership title as they crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat away to Hibernian on Saturday.
The runaway leaders were rocked by Jamie Maclarens first-half opener for Hibs at Easter Road.
Vykintas Slivka headed in Hibernians second goal in the closing stages and, although Celtic substitute Odsonne Edouard reduced the deficit with four minutes remaining, the Hoops were unable to claim the win that would have wrapped up the title. Brendan Rodgers side could still be crowned champions this weekend depending on results elsewhere, if not, they can clinch the trophy against Glasgow rivals Rangers at Parkhead next week.
The build-up to the match was dominated by speculation over whether Celtic manager Rodgers would be heading south to Arsenal as a replacement for Arsene Wenger after the veteran French boss announced Friday his intention to stand down at the end of the season. - AFP

Engineering hope for diabetes
Arya Keerthi Kumarasena has done society a great and invaluable service in writing his book - An Engineers Experience of and views on Diabetes.
Diabetes is a very serious disease due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. Therefore it must be treated as early as possible after detection.
During the past 38 years of his life, Arya Keerthi Kumarasena says he has been a severe diabetic. However Kumarasena is an engineer of great repute. Therefore his book An Engineers Experience of and views on Diabetes is one of great value, providing his key insights into this medical condition.
This prolific writer has written many books on Buddhism, including techniques of meditation, and experienced and observed a major disease  Diabetes.
He is an Old Boy of Ananda College and a Graduate from the University of Peradeniya in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He later obtained his Masters of Science Degree from the State University of New York, in the same field.
He is a chartered IT professional and a chartered engineer and holds two patents to his name for multi input fast adder and word processor for combined character languages.
Having started his professional career as an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Peradeniya, he was also a Radar Engineer at the Katunayake International Airport, until he moved into engineering research at the National Engineering Research Institute.
He has served as a Director in Several Private Sector Organizations and currently he serves as Consultant Group Director of the Metropolitan Group of companies.
He has contributed to the drafting of Sinhala Unicode designed and developed the first Sinhala Word Processor, represented Sinhala Language Computing at the United Nations forum on local language computing and developed the extension of the radar range from 140 nautical miles to 180 nautical miles.
He is a disciplined practitioner of Buddhism conducting Dhamma discussions in England and Australia.
He has authored many books on Buddhist philosophies, social welfare, management practices, and values such as meditation in practice, path to happiness through merit, practicable guide to managing emotions and towards organizational improvement.
This is the authors 60th publication.
Kumarasena has suffered from many complications of this major non- communicable disease. Complications of his diabetes have required coronary bypass surgery and various kinds of eye surgery. Calcium deposits in a major artery of a leg necessitated insertion of a stent. However he has pursued a highly productive, creative and successful professional career.
Retired Professor of Physiology, Carlo Fonsekaneeds no introduction. Fonseka who was the Chief Guest, shared his knowledge of Diabetes, relating its history and its discovery.
I am a retired Professor of Physiology and I have a Phd in Neuroendocrinology and have a doctorate in philosophy. In this audience there are very experienced people who know more than I do about Diabetes Mellitus. I studied at the University of Edinburgh where even Charles Darwin attended. Kumarasena is of course by any reckoning a remarkable man. Apart from being gifted genetically excelling at Ananda College from his school days, I am told by his contemporaries he was really brilliant. He finally became a Chartered Engineer in electronics and a Chartered Professional in IT. In other words he turned out to be a very creative person, said Fonseka.
Fonseka described Kumarasena as more intelligent and observant than most people who suffer from diabetes. Due to his training as an engineer he has not simply taken the doctors advice as the gospel truth.
He has a critical mind of his own. He has processed the information better than what most medical people can do. He has been trained to work towards specific objectives and achieve them by precise operations. Kumarasena has to be taken seriously and having browsed through this book I find it very interesting, stated Fonseka.
Having had the pleasure of meeting Kumarasena personally, Fonseka believes that Kumarasena is stepped in Buddhist philosophy. However he is properly cautious about his views and shows proper respect to the doctors.
However Kumarasena is not willing to simply accept without examination when it comes to advise given to him, added Fonseka.
Fonseka then enlightened the audience about this condition called Diabetes.
In the 19th century a man called Oskar Minkowski removed the pancreas of a dog just to see if the animal can live without a pancreas. However he noticed the urine the dog passed attracted flies and when he tested the urine, he found that there was sugar in it. So the idea arose in his mind that the pancreas must play some role in the regulation of sugar in the body, said Fonseka.
There was then no doubt that the pancreas has something to do with diabetes. The Pancreas produces digestive juices which help to digest proteins, carbohydrates, fats and all manner of things.
So everyone assumed that the anti-diabetic factor must be in the pancreatic juice. But all attempts to extract that substance failed. The pancreas produces the juices they come through a tube and open out into the small intestine. What they did then was that they tied the tube. So the juices no longer reached the gut. But the dogs did not get diabetes. They did not get sugar in their urine. There is then no doubt that the pancreas has something to do with diabetes. And there is no doubt that the substance is not in the pancreatic juices. Then where is it At this time Histologists found that apart from the cells that produce digestive juices there are other little islands of cells in the pancreas. They do not open into the tube which opens into the gut. Everyone thought the anti-diabetic factor must be in those little islands of cells, explained Fonseka.
So what scientists then did was that they extracted the pancreas, took those cells  raw fresh cells and got a filtrate but alas no Anti-Diabetic factors.
Then came this young man Frederick Banting who had what turned out to be a brilliant idea. He said the stuff that is preventing diabetes must be in those islands. But because we are taking the organ fresh from the dog  what is produced in those islands must be mixing with the juice and the juice must be destroying that stuff. You cant get the real anti diabetic factor because it is being destroyed by mixing with the pancreatic juices. Then again he hit on another idea. You take the dog. Tie the pancreatic tube. In six weeks all the cells producing pancreatic juice will disappear and shrivel up. In that shriveled up stage, take the pancreas and try to extract and that worked, elucidated Fonseka.
In 1923 Banting and John James Rickard Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery of Insulin. Banting shared the award money with his colleague Dr. Charles Best who also played a role in the discovery of Insulin. Best subsequently wrote an article in the Readers Digest called  How we discovered Insulin relating everything.
Finally Fonseka commented on Kumarasena himself, saying that Kumarasena has a certain sense of serenity about him that no doubt comes from the practice of Buddhism.
In his book Kumarasena says I felt information acquired by me will be useful to many readers and I considered publishing it. However I wish to reiterate that opinions expressed may have engineering and IT flavor and in some instances deviate from the current thinking of an average medical professional. I was diagnosed has having Type 2 Diabetes 38 years ago. Since then I faced several known complications of the disease which included retinopathy, bilateral cataract, coronary artery disease with triple vessel involvement and severe peripheral vascular disease with multiple near complete blocks with calcium deposition.

The President was accompanied by the Presidents wife, the Presidents official doctor, Minister Tilak Marapana and his wife, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Language Interpreter and two officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Apart from them, print and electronic media personnel of the Presidents Media Division and journalists representing private media institutions and few officers of Presidents Security Division, who do not belong to the official delegation participated in this tour.
Despite that no person was included in the delegation under the expense of the Presidential Secretariat or attended the CHOGM or any meeting held simultaneously.
Reports stating that expenses inured by Minister of Industries and Trade Rishard Badurdeen and Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera or any otherparties who attended the Business Forumwere not met by the Presidential Secretariat, the PMD added.
Thus, we reject certain media reports that alleged that more than hundred delegates accompanied the President in this tour.

For many people, fantasy is a formative genre: it slots a numinous filter between the eye and the mind through which the world is viewed for the rest of their lives. Ursula Le Guins Earthsea cycle, Alan Garners oeuvre  The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, The Owl Service, Elidor  and Susan Coopers The Dark is Rising Sequence, interweaving Arthurian legend with a Manichaean battle between the Dark and the Light, have shaped the work of many notable writers, including Robert Macfarlane and S. F. Said.
Transformative fantasy of this kind is seldom purely escapist; rather than transport the discontented reader to the imagined position of a high-fantasy king or hero, it evokes the menace and the magic underlying the everyday, hiding in interstitial spaces, or imbued in the stone, grass and rubble of specific landscapes.
Like Emily Dickinsons certain Slant of light, it inflicts a Heavenly hurt, working revelatory internal change on the mind that encounters it at the seminal moment. The first part of 2018 has been distinguished by fantasy, both for children and for young adults, with this kind of transformative feel, through which a vein of Irish folklore runs bright as mica.
Underlying war drum
The Wren Hunt (Bloomsbury), Mary Watsons first novel for teenagers, has a dreamy folk-horror sense about it from the outset: the drubbing of an underlying war drum, more sinister still for its setting in a contemporary, down-at-heel Ireland. In Kilshamble, a village built, ominously, around an open-air slaughterhouse, the traditional Wren Day song begins as usual: The wran, the wran, the king of all birds. / On St Stephens Day was caught in the furze.
Rather than celebrating the birds great honour and small size, however, the Kilshamble version continues: Her clothes were all torn, her shoes all worn, / We chased her all night, right through until dawn.
In the story, instantly, as in the song, the heraldic bird is replaced with a perturbingly vulnerable, human victim: a girl called Wren who is hunted every December 26 through village, forest and lakeside, until the wren-boys catch her and take a trophy. But there is more underlying the hunt than malicious habit or lust; the boys are draoithe (druids) of the tribe called Judges, and Wren, unknown to them, is an Augur, the Judges sworn enemy.
Vital information
To David, well-bred, sadistic pack-leader, she is oil to his water . . . salt to his wound, fascinatingly wrong and ripe for torment, like her namesake bird, still hunted for its long-ago treachery. When Wren undertakes an internship at the Harkness Foundation, the stronghold of the Judges, intending to bring back vital information to her family of Augurs, she places herself in the way of harm, revelation, betrayal and the fulfilment of a still greater ritual, in a story that unfurls and peels apart like a flower-human hybrid, bleeding as it blooms.
Beauty and terror join hands with more liminal magic in The Hazel Wood (Penguin), a debut young adult novel by Melissa Albert, deriving its title from Yeatss Song of Wandering Aengus. Throughout her childhood, Alice has moved across America with her mother Ella, leaving one place for another when their luck changes. After they receive the news that Ellas mother is dead, Ella marries affluent, unimaginative Harold, and attempts to root Alice in a Fifth Avenue, college-application version of normality.
Alices grandmother, however, was the reclusive Althea Proserpine, the author of Tales from the Hinterland (a book of terrifying fairy tales with a cult following and a habit of vanishing from shelves, which Alice has never been allowed to read), and normality for Altheas descendants is a more than ordinarily elusive state. Albert intertwines laconic, pitch-perfect evocations of contemporary American minutiae, such as the jalopys smell of plasticky strawberries, from the day I fed my Tinkerbell lipstick into the slats of the heater vent, with understated fairy-tale horror (Her limbs were frail as a frogs, but her eyes were still a defiant black. It was decided, then: she would live . . . ), in sinuous, twining prose, full of jam-sweetness and poisoned thorns.
As she plunges her heroine, fuelled both by love and by the rage permanently slumbering under a pretty little house cat exterior, first into the Halfway Wood, and then into the Hinterland itself, Albert plays elegantly with the concepts of the changeling, belonging, nature versus nurture and the perils of the permeable border between invention and reality, in a frightening, allusive and fiercely intelligent work of fantasy.
Unsettling duology
Painful transformations, sliding all the way into the pure grotesque, are instantly to the fore in Peadar OGuilins The Invasion (David Fickling), the concluding half of the unsettling duology begun in last years The Call.
In OGuilins Ireland, cut off from its surroundings by an invisible, impermeable wall, children are an endangered species; at some time during their adolescence, they will hear the inescapable Call that pulls them into the Grey Land, the hostile world of the banished Aes Sdhe (the People of the Mounds, equivalent to elves or fairies).
Here they must endure for an entire day  three minutes in the world they have left behind  without being caught by the Sdhe, who take a casual, laughing revenge for the theft of their homeland by twisting their captives into new and terrible shapes (flippers for hands and blank skin where once he had a face; I made a trellis of him and kissed you to the music of his tears).
Nessa, though hampered by her disability, survived her Call, as did Anto, her beloved; but now, branded a traitor, she is forced back into the Grey Land, with no prospect, this time, of ever escaping it. OGuilins marriage of cruelty and bloodshed, heroic formulae and the power of promises kept and broken is Homeric in its scope and tragedy; as a metaphor for the excruciating metamorphosis of adolescence, too, it seems fitting that Nothing is more painful than the moulding touch of the Sdhe.
Contiguous otherworld
For readers aged eight to twelve, Nigel Quinlans The Cloak of Feathers (Hachette), set in the remote Irish town of Knockmealldown, features another contiguous otherworld, this one also filled with creatures remote, eldritch and cruel, but comic and comely too; a more customary portrayal of the Good Folk than OGuilins.
Knockmealldown, once magical, is now a miserable place, with a notoriously dreadful annual festival and a deserted estate filled with the squealing of ghost pigs. Before a pig factory poisoned the places beloved of the Folk, the centennial Great Festival united human and fae in raucous, gorgeous celebration; now, however, rather than rejoicing, Brian and his friends must outwit a villainous jester and free a metamorphosed princess to prevent the whole Knockmealldown population spending the rest of their lives as birds.
Mordant (Bob was always hugely encouraging when other people offered to do things), evocative (a tall, unearthly girl with skin the green of a sunlit field and . . . teeth that seemed sharp) and fast-paced, featuring banshees on bicycles, festival bread baked of peat and oil and a charismatic, frolicking sense of absurdity, it dances precariously along a rope-bridge woven of folklore, comedy, danger and delight, beckoning the beguiled reader to follow.

HelpAge celebrates New Year with elders
Elders celebrated Avurudu with HelpAge at Dehiwala S. D. S. Jayasinghe Grounds recently. The event began around 9am with the participation of about 25 male and female elders. They were between the age group of 60 to 92 years from the H.P. Gooneratne HelpAge Day Centre, Ratmalana.
The elders were very keen to participate in traditional games such as marking the eye on elephant, breaking the pot by blind folded person, tug- of- war, bursting the balloon competition, passing the hat and the musical chair competition.
The festival was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in par with its flagship programme of performing free cataract surgeries for underprivileged Senior Citizens at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta.
HelpAge, Chairman Tilak de Zoysa and Council Member Nishantha Gooneratne were present on the occasion at the invitation of HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge. HelpAge official Buddhika Nanayakkara organized the event.
