Lankans fight back to force a draw
Batting prowess of both teams that dominated the ball throughout the match forced a tame draw in the first 4-day Youth-Test between England U19s and Sri Lanka U19s that concluded at FP Fenner's Ground, Cambridge on Friday. England opener, Olly Westburys blistering 196 kick-started a run-fest that produced 1017 runs at the expense of just 22 wickets told the story of the batsmens dominance in this inaugural Test of the two-match series.
After England decided to take the first lease of the wicket Lahiru Kumara and Sammu Ashan reduced them to 85 for two by the 30th over before opener, Olly Westbury and George Bartlett sharing an enormous 231 stand for the third wicket set the tone for England towards a big first innings total. Bartlett was the third man to go after a well accomplished 152-ball 131 with 13 fours and two sixes.
Then there was another good partnership between Olly and wicket-keeper Ollie Pope for the fifth wicket that saw England go past 450. Olly Westbury who was fashioning England innings with a well-composed marathon innings finally missed out on a well deserving double ton when he was caught at first slip by Avishka Fernando from a slow Damitha Silva delivery for an elegant 196 whilst Pope was out for a patient 78. England U19 declared their first innings with the score at 500 for nine in 131 overs. Two medium-pacers, Jehan Daniel and Lahiru Kumara sharing five wickets took most wickets for Sri Lanka.
Lankans reply innings too started in the same fashion as hosts did losing the wickets of Pathum Nissanka for 5 and Dilan Jayalath for 22. Then there were a few partnerships among skipper Charith Asalanka, Avishka Fernando and Sammu Ashan, but neither of them developed to a height that could match the feats of their England counterparts. Charith and Avishka missed out on two different milestones, former fell 19 runs short of his century whilst latter 5 runs short of his fifty.
However, Shammu somehow managed to complete his fifty but fell soon after. After Ashen Bandara lost his wicket for 21, Jehan Daniel and Damitha Silva added useful 90 runs for the eighth wicket, but Lankans final total of 335 was not sufficient to make England bat again. Amar Virdi Completed a five-for becoming pick of England attack.
Sri Lanka followed on with a first innings deficit of 165 and they wiped out the deficit without much terror and earned a lead of 17 runs with seven wickets remaining before the match came to an end on the final day a few overs before the scheduled close as the match was heading for a an inevitable draw. Dilan Jayalath whose unbeaten 77 and Charith Asalankas second half ton in the match with a brisk 70 from just 76 balls including 13 fours headlined in Lankans well-resisted innings after follow on.
England U19 : 500/9 dec. in 131 overs (O E Westbury 196, George Bartlett 131, Ollie Pope 78, Jehan Daniel 3/90, Lahiru Kumara 2/104, Sammu Ashan 1/21)
Sri Lanka U19 : 335 in 104 overs (Charith Asalanka 81, Jehan Daniel 62, Sammu Ashan 51, Avishka Fernando 45, Amar Virdi 5/77, Josh Coughlin 2/45) & F/O 182/3 in 39 overs (Dilan Jayalath 77*,Charith Asalanka 70, George Panayi 2/62, Aaron Beard 1/12)

Sri Lanka kings of Asian U20 rugby
Sri Lanka proved their superiority at the Asian Under 20 Sevens rugby tournament by beating one of the Asian giants Korea 38 points to nil to runaway with the Cup championship in the final at Johor, Malaysia yesterday.
Incidentally Korea had beaten Asian heavyweights Japan 24-19 in the semi-finals to reach the final. Sri Lanka ousted hosts Malaysia 29/14 in the other semi-final.
In the final the Junior Tuskers carried out an excellent performance both in attack and defence which laid the foundation for this historic victory.
Sri Lanka opened scoring when Omalka Gunaratne picked up a loose ball and scampered his way to score the first try in the very first minute of play. Skipper Kevin Dixon made the conversion and Sri Lanka led 7-0.
Sri Lanka went further ahead when centre Nishon Perera touched down after a superb 60 metre sprint. Dixon put over the conversion and they went into a 14-nil lead.
Just before half time former D.S. Senanayake schoolboy Buddhima Priyaratne who played as winger darted down for a brilliant try and Dixon slotted the conversion to take Sri Lanka to a 21-nil at half time.
Soon after the interval Piyaratne scored another try but Dixon missed the difficult conversion and Tuskers led 26-nil.
Dixon then dummied his way over for a spectacular try but fly half Shamry Burah missed the conversion and the score read 31-nil.
The junior Tuskers sealed an empathic victory when replacement scrum half Vimukthi Rahula burst his way to score a try under the post. Burah made the conversion and Sri Lanka had recorded an emphatic 38-0 win.
It was the first time in the history of Sri Lankan rugby that the country had won a Cup championship final.
Sri Lanka suffered only one loss to Japan 14-19 on their way to the final. They had wins over Philippines 22-5, Thailand 31-5 and UAE 45-5.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera in his message of congratulations said, I am really happy for the entire team for bringing this honour to the country for the first time in rugbys one hundred year history.
We are a talented side and we only have to believe in ourselves that we can do it by beating big teams like Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. The boys executed the plans which we laid out with Inthi. The end result is we are the proud Cup champions for the first time in our rugby history, said head coach Sudath Sampath.
Director Coaching (Strength and Conditioning) Inthi Marikar said, I am really happy for the entire squad of players and the officials but the mission is not over for us till we win the second leg in mid-August. After that we will celebrate. Till then we have to be really committed and focussed on what we have to achieve,. The Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) didnt support us and we sent the entire squad and officials on SLRFU funds.
The Sports Minister was a source of inspiration to us and he told a couple of days ago for the SLSRFA to work with us, SLRFU president Asanga Seneviratne said.

Mathews credits young Mendis for team turn around
PALLEKELE: Skipper Angelo Mathews credited 21-year-old Kusal Mendis for Sri Lankas change of fortunes when they came out of a poor rut in international cricket to pull off a stunning 106-run win over the world no. 1 ranked Test team Australia in the first Test which ended at Pallekele International Stadium on Saturday.
After a rough, tough six to eight months we needed that victory which will give us a lot of confidence going forward, said Mathews at the post-match press conference. As a young team it was a great performance, especially after the first day of play we were disappointing with our batting but credit should go to the young man Kusal Mends who batted brilliantly to get his maiden Test century against a very strong Australian team.
The Test looked like following the same pattern as the series in England when Sri Lanka batting first after winning the toss were bundled out for a miserly 117. Australia took a handy first innings lead of 86 runs and Sri Lanka were again in trouble at six for two wickets when Mendis walked in.
For the next five hours and 19 minutes the Australians who were on top at that stage had to simply watch helplessly as Mendis slowly but surely took the game away from them by piecing out a classic innings of 176.
Especially playing his first Test against Australia, he showed a lot of class and a lot of temperament, said Mathews. It was not easy to bat on that wicket. It was turning rapidly and their bowlers were bowling well and fast as well. The way he played, he made it look so easy. Most of us were struggling to get runs. The way he batted, Im very excited for the future.
Sri Lanka rode on Mendis brilliant knock to score 353 in their second innings. No one made more than 42 in the innings. But Sri Lanka had a total to bowl at the Aussies who required 268 to chase on a wearing pitch that was not easy for batting. The strong Australian batting line up crumbled for 161 to hand out to Sri Lanka a 107-run win.
It was a collective effort. We had to rally around Kusal. He was batting the best out of the lot. We needed a 200+ lead on that wicket, which was assisting the spinners, said Mathews. Rangana Herath once again proved his brilliance. (Lakshan) Sandakan coming into his first game  it was a brilliant effort by him. Overall it was a very pleasing effort but still a long way to go in the series.
I was just told that we have beaten Australia after 17 years. Thats very pleasing. Credit should go to the whole team the way they fought and showed their character. Whether its at home or away we had to play our best cricket to beat the Aussies, and we did. Especially after the first day we had to come back hard and strong and we did that.
However victory didnt come on a platter to the Lankans as they were made to fight hard and earn it. The game seemed as good as over when Australia slumped to 157-8, but for the next one and a half hours Sri Lanka could not separate their ninth wicket pair Peter Nevill and Steve OKeefe who put up staunch resistance not by way of runs but by consuming valuable time adding a mere four runs for the ninth wicket off 178 balls. They had a reason for not running the singles and twos because OKeefe came to bat with a hamstring injury and was unable to run.
O Keefe and Nevill made us work extremely hard for the wicket. We had to keep bowling and be patient, said Mathews. Obviously we were a bit worried about the weather as well. Fortunately the weather gods didnt prevent us from winning. We just had to do our basics right. Rangana was bowling brilliantly right throughout the match, and Sandakan also. We were very hungry to take those couple of wickets and we eventually did.
The stand was eventually ended not by Herath or Sandakan but by another debutant Dhananjaya de Silva who had Nevill caught behind.
Reflecting back on the win Mathews said that the injury to fast bowler Suranga Lakmal was a blessing in disguise because had he got through a fitness test on the morning of the match there was a great likelihood of Sandakan being left out.

Mathews thanks fans for sticking with team
PALLEKELE: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews thanked the fans for sticking by his team through thick and thin and dedicated the win over Australia at Pallekele on Saturday to them.
In the last 6-8 months, there was a situation where fans were turning away from us. As cricketers we feel that, because when we play well everyone loves you, said Mathews.
Even when you lose, they may love you, but they are also disappointed. The best thing was to win this match for the fans. We try to win every game, but it doesnt always work out.
This is a good experience for us and the fans. Its a great win for those who stayed with us, and we thank them because that support means a lot. Mathews said the last six to eight months was disappointing from a teams point of view.
We as a team got a lot of stick. But thats part and parcel of the game. When we do well we get praised. When we do badly we get a bit of stick. I think we as players need to understand that. Also weve prepared extremely well. We should also be thankful to the ground staff for preparing a good wicket, said Mathews.
The atmosphere in the dressing room has changed a lot. Even though we lost in the recent past, weve not given up. We always had hopes. We always helped each other. Every team goes through this transition period, and once you click, you can go a long way. Thats what we believed. We kept helping the youngsters and even the youngsters threw in their ideas and it was a collective effort from the whole team, he said.
We brought a lot of talented young players into the team recently. We lost a lot, but going forward, well have more confidence. Kusal Mendis would have got a lot of confidence from playing that kind of innings against Australia. Sandakan took seven and hell have that confidence as well. Even if we lose a couple of matches, we need to stick by them and move forward.  ST

Lankan contingent leaves for Rio
Sri Lankas ten-member contingent for the XXX1st summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was scheduled to leave for Brazil in the early hours of today (1) with veteran marathon runner Anuradha Indrajith Cooray as the overall captain.
The 38-year-old long distance specialist, who erased Asian Games gold medallist S.L.B.Rosas 40-year-old Sri Lanka marathon record earlier this year, came to Colombo last week after a month-long stint in Kenya. Cooray, who will be competing in his third Olympic Games after 2004 Athens and 2012 London, is confident that he could better his Sri Lanka mark.
My target is to finish the race in two hours and 12 to 13 seconds, if everything goes fine.
If I could achieve that target, I should be able to finish within the first ten runners, the UK-based Lankan athlete said.
I think we have a strong contingent and all of them should be able to make their presence felt and at least renew their respective Sri Lanka records. Four of our members have achieved qualifying standards and they could improve further in Rio, he said. The Lankan contingent is scheduled to travel to the latest Olympic city of Rio de Janeiro via Dubai and Sao Paulo. After their arrival in Sao Paulo, Brazils GuarulhosGovernador Andr Franco Montoro International Airport, popularly known locally as Cumbica Airport, they will take an-hour long domestic flight to Rio de Janeiro.
The Lankan Olympians are taking a long 36-hour journey with two transit points, but will get ample time to settle down before the 206-nation Games begin on Friday with a spectacular opening ceremony. But the first event for a Lankans will be on Sunday (7) when five-time South Asian Games gold medallist Kimiko Raheem competes in womens 100m backstroke qualifying round heats.
However, winning an Olympic medal will be a distant goal for Sri Lanka which has won only two medals in the 120-year-old Olympic Games history  a silver each by Duncan White in London 1948 and Susanthiya Jayasinghe in Sydney 2000. Nevertheless, they will make every endeavour to make it at least to semi-finals or finals of their respective disciplines.
From Sri Lankas point of view, they have two notable achievements even before the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. For the first time in the 12-decade long Games history, a Sri Lankan swimmer has achieved qualifying standards to compete in Rio (Mattew Abeysinghe) while Chamila Nuwan Darmawardana will become the first ever Lankan judoka to compete in Olympic Games.
All athletic events, other than the mens and womens marathon at which Sri Lanka will be fielding Cooray and Niluka Geethani Rajasekara, will be worked off at the Rio Olympic Stadium, originally built for the 2007 Pan American Games. Seating capacity has been temporarily expanded for the mega event but its track has been completely relayed. Unlike at most other Olympic Games, the opening and closing ceremonies of the Rio 2016 Games will not be staged at the official athletic venue.
Instead, the two ceremonies scheduled for August 5 and 21 respectively will take place at legendary Maracana Stadium, the iconic venue which was modernised when Brazil hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Maracana Stadium will also host certain key matches of the Olympic mens and womens football tournaments, including semi-finals and the two finals.

Kusal took the game away from us  Smith
PALLEKELE: Australian captain while being critical of his teams batting performance said that young Kusal Mendis innings of176 took the game away from them when they lost the first Test by 106 runs to Sri Lanka at the Pallekele Stadium on Saturday.
We bowled pretty well in the first innings to get them out for 117 that was a pretty good effort. In our batting we lacked a little bit of discipline in the first innings, we were in a position to get a much bigger lead that 86, said Smith at post-match press conference.
The third innings of the match we didnt do a great deal wrong but Kusal Mendis played an exceptional innings of 176 that sort of took the game away from us.
From our point of view it was disappointing to lose Steve OKeefe in the 49th over he was looking very ominous out there.
At every stage we thought he was going to take a lot of wickets from that aspect it was tough losing him. We tried other ways to get the team out but we werent able to do that and 267 obviously on a day four or five wicket against quality spinners was going to be a tough task and we werent upto it, he said.
Smith said that he was proud the way Phil Nevill and OKeefe stuck it out for one and a half hours in tough conditions.
It wasnt easy some balls were skidding and some were spinning, it was difficult but they found a way to get through. If Steven was able to run we could have scored a few runs as well, said Smith. From the batters point of view its about finding a way to get used to these conditions. We let the spinners into the game a lot more than we probably should have. Rangana (Herath) got the majority of his wickets on the inside of our bats for the right-handers and outside of the left-handers bat so we have to find a way to play that a lot better in Galle.
Galle is traditionally the biggest spinning place in Sri Lanka Ive been told. Spin is going to play a big part again. I am pretty shattered losing a bowler like OKeefe he is the sort of perfect bowler for these conditions. He was doing an exceptional job and he actually bowls quite similar to Rangana Herath hits the stumps, bowls with a sort of cross seam - balls skids and balls spin so he was doing a tricky job, he said.
Victorias left-arm spinner Jon Holland has been named as replacement for OKeefe and Smith who has gone to the same academy as him said, Holland is a class bowler he has done pretty well in first-class cricket.
Having a left-arm orthodox bowler in these conditions is a must. If he hits good areas hopefully we can see some from what we saw from Steve and Rangana some balls spinning and some balls skidding, which incredibly hard to play against. We know each other reasonably well and I am sure he will fit well around this group.
Smiths team came with the intention of improving their record in the subcontinent and the defeat at Pallekele was not the result they would have wanted.
I said before the game we havent played pretty well in subcontinent conditions for a while now something that under my captaincy I want to change. There were glimpses throughout this game that we improved in some aspects but we just let ourselves down, Smith said.

Herath returns to the top 10, Mendis just outside the top 20
Rangana Herath and Kusal Mendis have charged up the ICC Test Player Rankings after steering Sri Lanka to a 106-run victory over number-one ranked Australia in the first Test in Pallekele on Saturday.
Herath, who took four for 49 and five for 54, has returned to the top 10 in ninth position after rising four places in the bowling chart, while Mendis, who won the player of the match award for his 176 in the second innings, has vaulted 27 places to 21st position in the batting table.
Heraths rise means he has opened up a nine-position gap on his nearest team-mate Dhammika Prasad, who is nursing a shoulder injury. The Sri Lanka left-arm spinner is also the fourth spinner inside the top 10 after number-one ranked Ravichandaran Ashwin of India, Pakistans fifth-ranked Yasir Shah and sixth-ranked Ravindra Jadeja of India.
Mendiss rise means he is now the second highest-ranked Sri Lanka batsman after Angelo Mathews (12th after dropping two places). Dimuth Karunaratne 36th (after slipping two places) and Kaushal Silva 43rd (after falling seven places).
The batting list is headed by Australia captain Steve Smith, although his 24-point gap with Englands second-ranked Joe Root has been trimmed to 20 points.
