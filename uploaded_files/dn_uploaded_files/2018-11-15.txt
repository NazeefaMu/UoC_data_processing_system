Coca-Coca initiates Give Back Life PET plastic collection
Further expanding the scope of its Give Back Life PET plastic collection and recycling campaign, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka, with its recycling partner Eco Spindles joined hands with LAUGFS Petroleum, to place Give Back Life PET plastic collection bins at the Koswatte service station to enable customers to dispose their PET plastic bottles responsibly when visiting the area.
Management from Coca-Cola and LAUGFS Petroleum gathered together with volunteers to educate customers as they drove through the service station during the launch.
Customers entering the service station will be prompted by the educational signage to bring in their PET plastic bottles to be disposed appropriately for recycling purposes. All collected PET plastic bottles will be given new life by being converted into brushes, brooms, shoes and clothing. The symbol 1 inside a triangle in a plastic bottle indicates PET which is Polyethylene Terephthalate. This symbol is normally found in packaging containing soft drinks, juices, cooking oil, water, personal care and cosmetic products.
LAUGFS Koswatte has one of the highest footfalls of 6,000  7,000 vehicles per day. At the launch, the management teams and volunteers distributed educational leaflets to customers whilst giving them awareness on how the simple action of choosing to dispose of their PET plastics in a Give Back Life bin could translate to many long-term benefits. Coca-Cola conducted training programmes for the two staff shifts which operate the station throughout the week whom wholeheartedly endorsed the campaign to spread this valuable message to recycle PET plastic bottles and thereby not only provide alternative livelihoods to people but improve the beautiful environment in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the occasion Mahesh Weerasena CEO, LAUGFS Petroleum said, We are delighted to partner with Coca-Colas Give Back Life PET plastic collection and recycling program which is very much in line with our company values. As a company that is mindful of its responsibility to the future generation, we are looking to see how we can collaborate further on this great initiative, especially with our recently launched model solar powered fuel station in Pepiliyana.

Correct cleansing!
Cleansing has come a long way. With many types of foaming face washes, cleansing milks and gels in the market you need to select the right cleanser for your skin. Whatever the texture or type of your skin, it requires thorough cleansing. Give your face the right kind of cleansing treatment by following these guidelines.
Non-comedogenic products
The word comedo, or plural comedones, refers to a type of imperfection that forms on the skin. These blemishes are a result of clogged pores and are considered one of the milder forms of acne.
Non-comedogenic indicates that a product has been formulated to avoid causing clogged pores. Generally non-comedogenic products will be oil-free. It is important to note however that while these products do not claim to cure or treat acne-prone skin, they make sure the formulations wont block your pores which can be one of the main causes of spots, making it an ideal formulation in the quest to prevent spots occurring in the first place
Day creams
Day creams are generally multitasking products that moisturize skin, wear well under makeup, and sometimes contain SPF. Since youre more exposed to the sun during the day, day creams also tend to exclude active ingredients like retinol, glycolic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids, which can all irritate the skin when exposed to the sun.
Night creams
Night creams typically have a heavier texture to deeply moisturize skin while you sleep. Your skin repairs itself the most at night, so night creams often feature active ingredients like acids and retinol to promote skin cell turnover.
Pat or rub your face dry
The skin on your face is delicate. Similar to using your ring finger to dab product onto the eye instead of rubbing it on, the same goes for the use of a towel on your face. Thats because when you wipe excess water away, youre tugging at the skin. The likelihood for wrinkles and wear and tear increases, and youre removing all of the moisture your skin needs prior to product application. A best practice to get used to is to pat your face dry with a clean towel.
Using a peeling producton your skin
Although different skin types require different face-peel regimens, in general, a series of three to six peels two to four weeks apart should result in a noticeable difference in skin quality.
For some patients, peel pads with low concentrations of acid, which allow patients to continue treatment at home daily or weekly.

CSSL commences  awareness program  for IT students
Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has started an awareness program to educate IT Students which are studying at government and private high educational institutions for build up their professional path through joining the professional IT body and network in Sri Lanka.
CSSL is the body that represents all Information Technology (IT) professionals in Sri Lanka. Under the this awareness program CSSL recently conducted seminar and workshop for IT students of University of Colombo-School of Computing, SLIIT, ESOFT, University of Moratuwa, University of Kelaniya, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, NIBM and KDU.
As someone starts to study IT, they create an interest as well as a need to be part of the IT community, therefore CSSLs belief is that one of the most important segments of its membership are the student members. In early part of 2017, the CSSL Executive Council took a strong decision considering this background that all IT students in Sri Lanka should be student members of CSSL.
This way, all future IT professionals will come under CSSL umbrella early on, and grow with CSSL and one day become associate members and then professional members, getting the value of being part of the IT professional network in Sri Lanka.
Students are studying at government and private educational institutions, and that is the source for student members. As the implementation strategy for the above strategic direction, CSSL started to work directly with universities to register student members in bulk. This usually involves CSSL council members and staff visiting universities directly, conducting workshops to educate them about the value of being part of the national professional network and also insights about the IT industry, its opportunities and trends.
At certain institutions, the CSSL has also registered all staff as associate/professional members during the same program.
As a result, in 2017, CSSL on boarded 1287 student members, and in 2018 over 1100 students. Most of these students are 3rd year or 4th year students, who are getting ready to come to the industry and this process also facilitates their natural progression to CSSL Associate membership in a couple of years.
CSSL President Yasas V. Abeywickrama wishes to thank the academia for their support in successfully executing this strategy. In particular he thanks University of Colombo - School of Computing, SLIIT, ESOFT, University of Moratuwa, University of Kelaniya, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, NIBM and KDU.

Boosts England total in last wicket stand of 60 with Anderson:
Curran cashes in on poor Lankan strategy
PALLEKELE, Wednesday: Sam Curran whose decisive batting helped England to win the five-match Test series against India 4-1 once again displayed his value to the side with an important half century that lifted England from an ordinary 225-9 to a challenging first innings total of 285 on a turning Pallekele International Stadium pitch.
By the end of the first day Sri Lanka had lost the wicket of Kaushal Silva for six to left-arm spinner Jack Leach to finish on 26-1 and face a testing day today against England spinners Leach, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid.
Sri Lanka trail England by 259 runs and need to put up a strong first innings total before the pitch deteriorates further and makes batting a much difficult proposition than it has been on day one.
The Sri Lankan spinners had done an excellent job to reduce England to 225-9 and should have finished off the innings quickly but for some poor thinking strategy on the part of the captain Suranga Lakmal that allowed them to forge a 60-run last wicket stand between Curran and last man James Anderson.
It was agonising to see Sri Lanka allowing Curran to take a single off the last few deliveries off an over and retain the strike shielding Anderson from the spinners. Where the Lankans missed the trick was by not bringing the field in during the last few balls of the over to prevent Curran from taking a single. This happened time and time and again and Curran cashed in on these luxuries offered to him by smashing six sixes in scoring a superb counter-attacking knock of 64 off 119 balls.
Curran brought up his third Test fifty in style by smashing Akila Dananjaya for a flat six over square leg. If Currans previous two Test match defining half centuries against India are anything to go by then England should emerge winners here. For each time he scored or took wickets England had won and the only Test he was dropped in the series they lost.
How much those runs will be costly to Sri Lanka will depend on how their batsmen perform today. Sri Lanka should take a leaf out of Jos Buttlers half century and stay positive on this spiteful pitch that has turn, bounce, bite and dip if they are to get anywhere close to Englands total. It is imperative that Sri Lanka gain a big first innings lead and forge ahead instead of being behind England as they had been at Galle.
It was Buttler who kept England in the game with a superlative knock of 63 off 67 balls (7 fours) that largely comprised of sweeps and reverse sweeps against spin that worked for him well. He eventually got out playing the reverse sweep hitting a catch to backward point.
Opener Rory Burns solid innings of 43 off 81 balls was the only other noteworthy contribution to the England total.
Malinda Pushpakumara who has been given the big task of filling the shoes of legendary left-arm spinner Rangana Herath ended up with figures of 3 for 89 that included a marathon first spell of 22 overs during which period he picked up the crucial wickets of Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Buttler.
Root who won his seventh successive toss got out to a left-arm spinner for the third successive time in the series. He was dismissed twice by Herath at Galle.
Dilruwan Perera was once more the main strike bowler taking over the mantle as the leader of the spinners pack after Herath to finish with four wickets thus taking his tally in the series to 11.
The third spinner Akila Dananjaya showed that the reporting of his bowling action had no adverse effect in his confidence to take two wickets for 80.
He came in for some heavy punishment from Curran during the last wicket partnership and saw Pushpakumara put down a simple chance off him at long-on offered at 53.
The England first innings has followed in similar pattern as at Galle where they lost five wickets for 113 by lunch on the first day and recovered to score 342. Yesterday they were four down for 120 at lunch and ended up scoring 285 which on this pitch could prove to be significant one.

Cyclonic GAJA to bring strong winds, showers to Northern Province
The Meteorology Department yesterday predicted that very strong winds between 60-80kmph can be expected in the Northern Province particularly over the Jaffna peninsula today due to the Cyclonic Storm GAJA.
Duty Meteorologist Kasun Pasqual told the Daily News that the Cyclonic storm GAJA over the Central Bay of Bengal is now located approximately 590km away from Kankasanturai to the northeast of Sri Lanka and under the influence of this system showery and windy conditions will enhance over the Northern Province from today evening.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times over the Northern Province. Heavy rain fall above 150mm can be expected in the Jaffna peninsula while other areas in the Northen Province could receive about 100mm of rain.
The Anuradhapura and Puttalam districts will also experience heavy rain fall while fair weather will prevail elsewhere.
Issuing an Amber Colour Special Advisory for strong winds, heavy rains and rough seas, the Meteorology Department said that the cyclonic storm GAJA over the Central Bay of Bengal is very likely to move west-southwestwards and further intensify into a Severe Cyclonic storm. The system is expected to cross the Southern Tamil Nadu coast and is very likely to move closer to the northern coast of Sri Lanka today.
High winds packing wind speeds between 80 and 100kmph can be expected over the Jaffna Peninsula from today. Winds between 60- 8okmph can be expected over the Mannar, Puttalam, Tfincomalee, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Killinochchi, Mullaitivu and Vauniva districts too. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Mannar via Trincomalee and Kankasantulai while the fishermen in the deep sea of the South-west Bay of Bengal are advised to move to safer areas.
Coastal residents along the Northern coastal areas are advised to move to safer places,remain indoors and beware of falling trees,power lines and avoid using wired telephones and connected electric appliances during thunderstorms.

Debt repayments will be honoured - Governor
Sri Lanka is well on track to settle all debt repayment obligations in 2018 and 2019 and the present political climate would not have a negative impact towards this, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
He said that the first obligation would be the repayment of the US$1.5 billion international sovereign bond payment scheduled for January 15, 2019.
The Peoples Bank, Bank of Ceylon and the National Savings Bank held talks recently with several Middle Eastern Banks to raise US$ 750 million to US$ 1 billion by the end of the year and this has been successfully concluded.
In addition, the Central Bank has US$ 675 million by way of the Hambantota Port lease agreement and this too would be diverted to settle the Sovereign bond.
Sri Lankas second obligation would be to settle the US$ 500 million dollar bond maturing in April. We will come to an agreement with the China Development Bank to repay this.
Commenting on the Foreign Reserves, he said Sri Lanka is also comfortably placed with foreign reserves increasing to US$ 7.2 billion. We expect this to increase to US$ 7.8 billion by the end of 2018.
The Governor however said that as per the available economic indicators, real GDP growth is likely to remain subdued and below the envisaged levels in 2018 due to drought and various other issues.
The significant growth in imports as well as recent capital outflows amidst the broad based strengthening of the US dollar exerted pressure on the exchange rate. Although the pace of depreciation has moderated recently, the Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated by 12.9 per cent against the US Dollar during 2018 up to November 13.
Headline inflation, based on both the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), decelerated below the desired mid single digit levels, largely driven by the decline in volatile food prices.

Drama in House as Speaker takes Voice Vote
Parliament, which was prorogued by the President on November 4, commenced sittings at 10 a.m. yesterday after the prorogation.
The Stay Order issued by the Supreme Court on the dissolution of Parliament paved the way for parliament to sit yesterday.
Parliament was adjourned until 10 a.m. today after a Voice Vote on a No Confidence Motion against the PM and the Cabinet was taken up by the Speaker.
The much-awaited first sitting of third session of Eighth Parliament was held yesterday amidst high tension and excitement.
Free seating in the main Chamber had been arranged with the Prime Ministers seat given to Mahinda Rajapaksa, Chief Government Whips seat to Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and the seat of Leader of the House to Minister S.B.Dissanayake.
At the commencement of sittings, Speaker Jayasuriya urged members of both sides to act with restraint to uphold the dignity of the House, reminding them that they were being watched by the entire world.
Representatives of Diplomatic missions and foreign media personnel were present in the gallery to witness proceedings. Former Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe sat on the fourth row of the Opposition side. Several UNP MPs sat on the last row of the Government side as the Opposition benches were overflowing. The UNF MPs were wearing a black sataka which read For Democracy and carried a number to show their majority.
Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake read out President Maithripala Sirisenas Gazette Extraordinary on the prorogation of Parliament as per tradition. While the SG read out the Gazette, MPs Piyasena Gamage and Manusha Nanayakkara crossed the floor from the Government to the Opposition. Opposition MPs welcomed them by thumping on their desks. UPFA MP A. H. M. Fowzie was seen seated in the Opposition aligning himself with the UNF MPs.
After the SGs announcement, TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran moved a motion calling for the suspension of the Standing Orders (SO) of Parliament for yesterdays sitting as per the section 135 of the SO. He also proposed to adopt the motion by going for a division in the House. JVP MP Vijitha Herath seconded it.
Chief Government Whip Dinesh Gunawardena strongly opposed the move and demanded the House be adjourned immediately as no items have been listed in the agenda for yesterday. He stressed that it was the Parliamentary tradition and that it must not be flouted. He added that proceeding to other business on the inaugural day of a new session was against the Constitution. The members in the Opposition shouted in disagreement.
The Speaker said that he allows the House to decide as it was a special occasion. At this point, MP Vijitha Herath walked to the chair of the SG and handed over a No-Confidence Motion against the new Government, receiving the applause of the Opposition members. JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake then called on the Speaker to move MP Sumanthirans motion to suspend the SO for a vote. All Opposition MPs raised hands in favour of the motion while the UPFA MPs agitated against.
At this point, Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the Mace to his custody and held it close to the Speakers chair to prevent any MPs from grabbing it. The UPFA MPs said the vote could not be taken without the Mace in the bracket. However, the Speaker said that he recognises that the Mace was properly held near his Chair as per the Standing O.
The Speaker, going by the majority will of the House, let the JVP Leader to move the NCM in the House. Minister Wimal Weerawansa objected saying that the NCM could not be taken up on the same day that it was submitted. The Speaker replied that he was going by the majority decision.
The UPFA MPs stood from seats in protest while MP Anura Dissanayake read out the NCM. While confusion reigned in the House, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa left the main Chamber escorted by MP Namal Rajapaksa. JVP MP Vijitha Herath seconded the NCM.
Over 30 UPFA MPs led by Udaya Padma Shantha, Prasanna Ranaweera, Sanath Nishantha, S.B. Dissanayake and Mahindananda Aluthgamage stormed the well of the House, some pointing fingers at the Speaker.
The Opposition MPs remained in their seats and the Speaker said that he would move the NCM for a vote as per the majority will. However, the UPFA MPs did not allow a floor vote and remained in the middle of the floor shouting slogans against the Speaker. As the Speakers repeated requests to the MPs to take their seats to conduct the vote went unheeded, the Speaker decided to go by the Voice Vote.
When the Speaker asked aloud as to who are in favour of the motion, the Opposition MPs stood up and shouted aye, but when the Speaker asked as to who are against the motion, the UPFA MPs who were in the middle of the floor did not react. Therefore the Speaker ruled that the NCM was passed as per the Voice Vote. Then he announced that the prevailing Government does not command the majority in the House.
The Speaker then adjourned sittings till 10 a.m. today. The UNP MPs were jubilant after the sittings concluded and were seen congratulating each other and clicking photos inside the Chamber. Many MPs were also seen congratulating former PM Wickremesinghe. UPFA MPs left the chamber immediately after the adjournment.
UPFA Minister Duminda Dissanayake was a notable absentee during the yesterdays sitting. Immediately after sittings, Ministers Vadivel Suresh and Wasantha Senanayake switched allegiance back to the UNF and said that they would resign from their portfolios with immediate effect.

Empowering future writers
The Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop has become a regular item in the Fairway Holdings event calendar. It was conducted successfully for the third consecutive year recently with a large gathering of enthusiastic participants. The two day workshop saw a collection of very resourceful persons sharing their knowledge and experience in areas of novel writing, short story writing,poetry, script writing, editing and publishing. Some of the participants were eager to share their thoughts on the workshop.

Dilara Almeida, 
Student, St. Bridgets Convent 
The workshop organised by Fairway Holdings gave us the opportunity to be exposed to the different perspectives of the very distinguished resource panel on the creative writing process and that made it an excellent workshop. The experiences they shared with us were also very inspiring and definitely helped me to further my endeavours in this field.





Amanda Dalupotha, 
Student, Anula Vidyalaya
This was the first time I participated in a workshop of this nature and I found it to be truly life - changing. The real life experiences the panelists shared with us were inspiring and motivating, specially to an aspiring writer like me.





Aqila Fiaz, 
Student, Asian International School
This Workshop gave me all the knowledge and advice I needed to become a more skilful English student. It was an honour to hear the experiences of successful Sri Lankan writers and what they went through to become who they are today, and that gave me hope and strengthened my dreams of becoming a writer. Thank you Fairway!





Veena Lalvani 
- English Literature and Language teacher, S. Thomas Preparatory School 
I found the 2 day workshop far more useful, relevant, entertaining and memorable than I expected. I loved the interaction and hands-on approach used by the panelists which was very effective. The presenters were extremely informative, patient and considerate, and the advice and experiences they shared with us inspired me to continue writing.





Dimithri Wijesinghe, 
Legal Apprentice and Journalist
It was a fantastic workshop, specially since we were allowed the opportunity to have an interactive session with all of the speakers, who were all "experts" in their own right. Arun Welandawe's session on Script writing was a special treat considering that I personally had never actually had an opportunity to learn about that medium in such a practical context.





Medhya Samarasinghe, 
Attorney - at - Law
I found the sessions to be both instructive and inspiring, as the resource panel shared a wealth of information with us. I also thank Fairway for including a young author in the resource panel as the knowledge she shared was invaluable for aspiring writers. I hope they have the strength and foresight to continue this noble endeavour to uplift our nation's literary talents.





Ishara Nouman, 
Programme Officer, World Vision Lanka 
The workshop organized by Fairway Holdings is a perfect way for writers like myself to grow and learn as it was extremely instrumental and brought out many components from writing poems to getting our work published in a very fun manner. Each speaker brought out insightful elements I could use to improve my writing and they were very effective in delivering these elements. Fairway did a wonderful job in facilitating and organizing this workshop and I look forward to attending many more events as such, as this was an enriching experience in my journey as a writer.

Sangakkara played an important role in his development at Surrey:
England all-rounder Sam Curran surprised by Lankas field settings
PALLEKELE, Wednesday  Englands 20-year-old all-rounder Sam Curran who scored a fighting half-century and figured in a last wicket stand of 60 with James Anderson said that he was surprised by the fields set by the Lankans which enabled them to build up the partnership.
I was a little bit surprised and I gave myself a chance to take a few more balls because I found it was an easier option to take a single towards the end of the over as they werent really bringing in the field, said Curran at the end of the day.
Jimmy and me were pretty happy taking the score as deep as possible and getting the extra single. They (Sri Lanka) came into the game with one seamer we thought they probably panicked, but they showed why because this wicket has started to take some turn. The next couple of days is going to be exciting for spin lovers and the batsmen are going to be on their toes.
Curran said that the last wicket stand was crucial especially the way the pitch was playing.
It was crucial, you saw in the evening how much it spun. Getting close to 300 was massive for us from 225-9.
Rash (Rashid) played beautifully before tea and I tried to take over where he left off. Jimmy hung around .We got a nice score on the board. Great positive for Leachy to bowl a beautiful ball to get rid of the opener this evening. The spinners have got to play a huge role tomorrow.
Curran said that he had benefitted a lot playing alongside former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara for Surrey.
We had with him for a few years and it was great. Any batter in the world will want to try and copy the way he plays and the way he deals with situations, more having him around the dressing room has been great, said Curran.
He is a great man he is always a man you can talk to when you need and to be with. We made great friends when he was at Surrey. We saw him score hundreds day in and day out we just try to ask the odd question in the dressing room a bit. I try to play my natural way. Kumar was a great help for all of us Surrey players. All in all, a great man.
Coming on a few tours with England Lions to the subcontinent had also helped Curran to adapt to the conditions and the pitches.
I came on a few Lions tours to the subcontinent and I came here with the Lions last March. I played against spin and faced a lot of seam back in England. I try to play to my natural style and natural mindset. Lucky enough it came off today. I play my best cricket when I am keeping an open mind, said Curran.
Left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara stated that the Lankan batsmen will have to score the runs which Sri Lanka conceded in a last wicket partnership between Curran and Anderson.
We thought we could restrict them to 200. But the last pair as you see added 60 runs and thats a big bonus for them. It will be tough for us. Our batsmen need to score all those runs, said Pushpakumara. We had our plans. We missed an opportunity today.
Pushpakumara said that their plans is to target a first innings total of 350 plus and that opening bat Dimuth Karunaratne had a big role to play in enabling Sri Lanka achieve that score. Dimuth if you take he was our best batsmen in the last series. We expect other batsmen to contribute too but Dimuth is the guy in form, said Pushpakumara.

EXPLORING CREATIVE FREEDOM
Sensuality, beauty, intimacy, freedom, courtship, women and village scenery were some of the themes featured at Sri Lankan Art the annual exhibition of the George Keyt Foundation held recently at the J. D. A. Perera Gallery, University of Visual and Performing Arts.
The works of art captured the diverse moods of the artists who used a combination of brilliant hues along with contours of the human body to create artwork that had depth and meaning to it. Some paintings captured the beauty and vastness of the ocean, another touched on architecture. The majesty of the feline was depicted in one painting. The crowd gathered witnessed something special that day as they saw works that were both personal and inspired by society. There was a sense of freedom in the paintings depicting sensuality, as these artists did not adhere to convention.
George Keyt Foundation, Chairman and Board of Trustees, Michael Anthonisz said the importance of art in any society cannot be stressed enough and it must be acknowledged. The interest in art is always appreciated by the George Keyt Foundation.
The Chief Guest Bangladesh High Commissioner, M. Riaz Hamidullah is very much involved with the arts. He follows and promotes arts and shows great interest and keenness in this field. We have been having discussions with him to have a joint show of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh art because people in Sri Lanka need to see Bangladeshi Art. He is very keen on this. I am sure the High Commissioner will like what he sees and will appreciate it, said Anthonisz.
Bangladesh High Commissioner, M. Riaz Hamidullah, pointed out that art connects Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankans will be pleased to know that last September around four Sri Lankan artists were in Bangladesh for a whole month for the Asian Art Biennale. This event has been happening for quite some time and Sri Lankan artists have been going to Bangladesh. In art we have so much in common. So we must really take this connection seriously because Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have a lot to share in art. Art is something that liberates the artists mind and that is how it should be viewed. That is the power of art, said Hamidullah.
NTB, Head of Cards, Niluka Gunatilakecommented that art is a discipline that defines a society and that Nations Trust Bank is proud to sponsor this years exhibition once more.
We are old friends with the foundation and we greatly value their service to Art in Sri Lanka. This is platform for local artists to develop themselves and get valuable exposure. George Keyt Foundation is doing something commendable promoting our local artists. The exhibitions have all been of high standard. NTB is always willing to sponsor arts in Sri Lanka and has done so by getting involved in a number of art events in Sri Lanka over the years. We are always willing to enrich the field of arts in Sri Lanka. Through events like this we are able to play a role in shaping our country, said Gunatilake.
George Keyt Foundation Trustee, Nihal Rodrigo, called George Keyt a man who attracted much interest due to his interesting personality. Rodrigo pointed out that this exhibition is a gold mine.
We were friends of old to each other. He was a talented painter and this is his legacy. This event is very commendable because of the advantages it gives to the local artists. The younger artists get much experience and are able to sell their paintings. It is encouraging and they are able to join prestigious companies. They can have an excellent future. They get a better appreciation of people and how to conduct themselves. At the end of the day they have a positive experience. Some pictures depict life in Sri Lanka, and foreign dignitaries and foreigners love to purchase these pictures. It is important that people see these events, said Rodrigo.
Artist Feroza Rafeeksabstract painting, oil on Canvas features three layers of work that took her three weeks. Here I portray a busy life. You can see the people are very busy on the street. The meaning is hidden and you have to think a lot when contemplating what it is. I hope people will like this. I am a huge fan of abstract and oil paintings. You can sense the emotions here, said Rafeek.
Artist Charita Lays, beautiful painting was of her daughter. Lay feels that the painting has been done really well due to the fact that so many people are giving her positive feedback.
People really love it and I am so happy about it. My daughter is coming here to know what other people think of the painting. She is really keen on hearing what other people think. I dressed her up because I have done bridal dressing and I was a hair dresser. I have experience in dressing the bride and dressing a woman and I can do it on the canvas. The place where I created it was in my house, I know how to make the light and shade work for me, said Lay.
The eyes are the gateway between your soul and creation. They capture creation and remember it. They draw creation deep into you where it mingles with the soul and what comes out is Art  the offspring of the soul and creation. The George Keyt Foundation are worshippers of this ancient form of expression.

Facebook, the matrimonial killer
With the rapid development of science and technology, humans are granted with the opportunity to connect from one end of the world to the other. Humans are granted with the privilege to engage and maintain relations with each other irrespective of the time or place they live across. Among these amazing technological miracles is Facebook which has been able to connect people more closely creating a revolutionary platform to strengthen ties with their loved ones and also to establish new ties irrespective of boundaries created by land or sea. But it is justifiable to state that Facebook which is considered as the God-given messenger in the contemporary world has become the Achilles heel in matrimonial relations paving the path to its ultimate destroyer; the divorce.
As per Sri Lankan law under Section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance 1907, it has recognized three main grounds for divorce; namely, adultery, malicious desertion and sexual impotency. In simple terms, adultery is considered as engaging in extramarital intimate relations subsequent to marriage by one spouse with another who is not his/her spouse and it is important to be borne in mind that the exact time, date and place must be provided to the court when relying on this ground for divorce which projects that adultery as a ground for divorce has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Malicious desertion is exercised under the limelight of two counts; either malicious desertion which is simply leaving the matrimonial house or constructive malicious desertion which is leaving the house by one spouse upon the acts of the other spouse with the intention to never return back to the matrimonial house. Whereas when relying on the ground of sexual impotency, it is important that it is subsequent to the marriage and that it is medically incurable.
Social media platforms
Among many common social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Tinder, Facebook and Facebook Messenger which is the messaging platform of Facebook have been able to create havoc in matrimonial relations in contemporary society. For instance, one spouse approaching or attempting to approach another person he/she is attracted to by way of messages and pictures through Facebook Messenger in secret to his/her spouse is a common occurrence in the modern world. Whilst citing the writer John G. Browning on Guide to Social Networking, he states that Social networking sites do not make people have affairs. Relationship experts have observed that relationships tend to develop was quickly online because of lower inhibitions and the fact technology helps them to find ex-loves from the past. The most common reason to be having sexual chats with people they were not supposed to.
Moreover, the notion of exchanging passwords of each others Facebook account is considered as a sign of trust and loyalty nowadays and couples who do not do so is constantly drowned in the oceans of great and malicious suspicion ultimately, leaving to occurrences such as desertion.
But how do we bring an encoding in a digital platform as evidence to the court and how to make such evidence admissible in courts In the case of Abubakar v Queen 54 NLR 566, it was observed that mechanical records such as tape recordings are admissible as evidence in courts. Lately with the advancement of science and technology, Evidence (Special Provision) Act No. 14 of 1995 provided several provisions that electronic communications such as videos, computer printouts and photographs are admissible in courts as evidence (By virtue of Section 4) provided under the condition that notice must be given to the opposing party 45 days before the date fixed for trial (Section 7 (a)). It must be noticed and appreciated that the courts in this country have been making effort to recognize electronic communications as admissible evidence in courts as per Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance and this was clearly established in the case of re S.A. Wickramasinghe 55NLR 511.
Facebook messages
In the recent judgment in the Commercial High Court case H.C.(Civil) 181-2007(MR) MR, Judge Chitrasiri has observed that in his opinion, an SMS which is received on the screen of a mobile phone that has been typed by another person from a different point and sent with the assistance of technology could be admitted in evidence. In the circumstances, he has decided that the original message received by a mobile phone should be considered as admissible in evidence in terms of the provisions in the Evidence Ordinance 1985 which helps us to draw an inference that the same grounds are applicable in terms of Facebook messages.
Can explicit pictures shared upon consent and explicit conversations by way of messages on Facebook be used as admissible evidence in proving adultery in courts Adultery, which is considered to be the most serious ground among the other two grounds to dissolve the marriage, has received such onus of burden of proof due to its necessity of strictly being proved beyond reasonable doubt as established in the case of Jayasinghe v Jayasinghe. Thus it can be seen that the degree of proving adultery is equal to that of a crime i.e. 100% accuracy giving the date and the place of the adultery committed.
Hence it is important to bear in mind that such evidence can only be used to corroborate the act of adultery as this evidence do not establish the act of adultery beyond reasonable grounds. Therefore, having uploaded a picture on Facebook with a loved one will only amount to more pictures and the contents of the photographs will only establish certain facts about events and whether they are admissible or not as evidence is yet to be decided in court within the framework of the Evidence Ordinance (Special Provisions) Act No.14 and concurrently with the Electronic Transactions Act of 2006.
Even though evidence retrieved through Facebook has not yet been submitted as admissible evidence in the Sri Lankan courts, we can infer that there is a great likelihood that Sri Lankan courts will allow such evidence under the notion that it conforms with the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance (Special Provisions) Act No.14 of 1995 and if it is also in conformity with the Electronic Transactions Act 2006 by being based on the basic principle of law of evidence. Hence, it would be justifiable to conclude that the possibility of the above-mentioned information received through Facebook and other social media being admissible in courts would be a fair choice.

Four  natural methods to  get soft palms
Some women are always taking care of their face and other parts of their body leaving their palms and feet to look older than they really are.
It is equally important to spend more time pampering your palms and feet because they are very obvious part of your body.
Women, involved in house chores always have their hands looking discolored, wrinkly and rough due to the soaps and other cleaning products that use to make their homes sparkle.
Having hard palms can directly affect your love and social life very much. If you want soft palms close to that of a new baby, follow these steps.
Olive oil and sugarMethod
Mix 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp olive oil in a bowl. Fetch some of the scrubs into your palm and rub your palm together.
Massage your fingers and hands with gentle squeezing and circular motions for about 30 seconds.
Then relax your palms and let the scrub sink in for another 30 seconds.
Wash out your hands with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel.
Baking soda, lemon and honeyMethod
In a small container, mix 2 teaspoons each of lemon, honey and baking soda together all the ingredients evenly.
Now apply this mixture onto your hands, rubbing it through and massaging your hands for a minute.
Allow the mixture to sit on your hands for five to 10 minutes.
Wash your hands in warm water.
Do not use soap directly afterward. Repeat this process at least twice a week to remove discoloration and promote soft healthy-looking hands.
Vaseline
Petroleum jelly is a staple of many bathroom cabinets and one of the widely used moisturizers for newborn, youth and oldies.
Method
Wash your hands with lukewarm water and coat your hands with Vaseline every night before you go to bed.

Egg Yolk, Honey, and Almonds
Egg yolk contains high amounts of Vitamin A, while almonds boost the Vitamin E content in your skin. This mixture exfoliates, moisturizes and nourishes your hands, giving you those supple hands you deserve.
Method
Add 1 tsp of honey,  tsp of crushed almonds and a hint of rose water to an egg yolk. Work them into a paste.
Massage your hands with this mixture for 10 minutes and let it stay for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.

Godfather  of Marvel  comics dies
Stan Lee, the godfather of Marvel Comics most memorable characters and stories, died on November 12, People magazine has confirmed. He was 95 years old.
The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Doctor Strange - name any classic Marvel character (except Captain America) and theres a good chance that Lee, with the help of fellow Marvel legends like Jack Kirby, Bill Everett, and Steve Ditko, had a hand in their creation.
Marvel as we know it today would not exist without Lee - and at first, Lee never thought he would have anything to do with Marvel. Stan Lee was actually a pen name for Stanley Martin Lieber, who wanted to preserve his real name for more serious stuff than comics for kids; while serving in WWII, his listed occupation was playwright.
Id never really thought of doing comics for a living, Lee told the Guardian in 2015. One day I heard about an opening in a publishing company. I found out the company, among other things, published comics, and thats where the opening was.
Lees origin story goes like this: In 1961, publisher Martin Goodman had played a round of golf with rival DC Comics publisher Jack Liebowitz, and was told that DC was going to smash its most popular superheroes together into a team called the Justice League. Marvel, then known as Atlas Comics, was failing. So Goodman asked Lee and Kirby to come up with a superhero team that could rival the Justice League.
The two came up with the Fantastic Four, which went on to become a massive hit, and Marvel Comics was born. Heroes like Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Doctor Strange, and the X-Men would follow.
But the crown jewel of Lees career has to be Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, whom he created with artist Steve Ditko. Parker was the first teenage superhero whose anxieties, fears, joys, successes, and failures were treated with respect. Parker reflected the feelings of a generation of readers but also helped teach those same readers life lessons, like his now-famous credo (in its original wording), with great power there must also come great responsibility!
Lee stopped writing monthly issues in 1972, when he assumed the role of publisher at Marvel. What followed at the end of his career was a fraught and frayed relationship with the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 1996 - the company ultimately sold some its characters film rights, including Spider-Man and the X-Men, to stay afloat.
Lee split with Marvel in 1998, but nevertheless became the companys mascot as the characters he created began finding their way on the big screen. His cameos in Marvel Studios movies, as well as X-Men and Spider-Man movies (Marvel Studios does not own the rights to those characters), have become their own phenomenon. He was last seen in Foxs Venom.

IMFs Lagarde says central banks could issue digital money
International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said central banks around the world should consider issuing digital currency.
Speaking in Singapore, Lagarde said this could make digital currency transactions safer. Non-cash payments have increased over the years, raising challenges for governments and central banks. Regulators have voiced concerns with digital currencies and called for greater oversight.
I believe we should consider the possibility to issue digital currency, Lagarde said in a speech at a conference in Singapore. There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy.
The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap and potentially semi-anonymous... And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments.
Lagarde said central banks in Canada, China, Sweden and Uruguay were all seriously considering digital currency proposals.
A virtual currency issued by a central bank would be a liability of the state - as cash is - not of a private firm.
This would help consumers by making transactions safer and more common, and as a result cheaper.
The more people you serve, the cheaper and more useful the service, Ms Lagarde said. Private firms may under-invest in security to the extent they do not measure the full cost to society of a payment failure.
She added that while the case for digital currency is not universal it should be investigated seriously, carefully and creatively.
Although the technology underlying digital assets has been praised for speeding up financial transactions and reducing costs, the anonymity behind cryptocurrency trading has prompted concern among regulators.
Ms Lagarde previously said the anonymity of currencies such as Bitcoin means they are used by criminals and terrorists.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has also said cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin should be regulated to crack down on illegal activities and protect the financial system. (BBC)

## Title: An independent Judiciary

An independent Judiciary
Yesterdays verdict of the countrys Apex Court that went against the Government, as things stand for the moment, is a clear demonstration of the independence of the Judiciary post January 2015. For this, all independent minded citizens, no doubt, would salute President Maithripala Sirisena. He never sought to interfere in the affairs of the judiciary since his election as President, not even when his own tenure was circumscribed by a Supreme Court ruling which held that his term will be confined to five years under the 19th Amendment and not six as was originally thought.
Legal analysts expressing their opinion, as reported in our front page yesterday, was emphatic that the President never influenced the work of the judiciary in anyway after he came to power in January 2015. They all appreciated the Presidents stance of non- interference in the affairs of the judiciary regarding a decision that he has made. The Presidents upholding of the supremacy of the people should be admired by all, they say.
There was not even a whiff of scandal so far during his tenure where the rulings of the Supreme Court have been called into question. Even the Bar Association of Sri Lanka which normally is at loggerheads with the incumbent Head of State over alleged interference in the affairs of the Judiciary has had no issue with President Sirisena in this regard. On the contrary, relations between all arms of the judiciary and the President have never been so good. No judge has been accused of belonging to any one of the political camps as in the past.
In fact, even the appointments to the Supreme Court were done by the President in terms of seniority. He did not consider factors such as political affiliation and ethnicity in this process. There was not even a hint of threat or intimidation directed at members of the Judiciary even when the rulings in certain cases- particularly those referred to the Supreme Court for determination by Parliament- were not favourable to the Government.
This was a far cry from the days when the homes of Supreme Court Judges were stoned by goons unleashed by the UNP Government for delivering an unfavourable verdict. Not only that, there were instances when Judges were summoned before the countrys leaders for briefings on the way certain judgments have to be delivered. One Chief Justice, a handpicked appointee of JRJ, who, nevertheless acted independently, stepped down on his own accord before being summoned before Parliament for an inquisition.
As one of the three pillars upholding the peoples sovereignty- the others being the Executive and the Legislature- it goes without saying that the Judiciary is an organ that has to function independently and any leader seeking to trifle with this independence will only take the country downhill. Judges are a special breed and should be treated as such. On no account should the Executive is seen to be at odds with the judiciary.
Equally the judiciary should not appear to be doing the bidding of the State. Rightly or wrongly this has been the ingrained impression among the public at large beginning from around the 1970s when Felix Dias Bandaranaike who it was said made it a habit to be present in courts when important judgements involving the State were delivered. Many Governments that followed tried to intimidate the Judiciary when it sought to act independently. While some judges succumbed there were others who stood their ground and refused to be intimidated even though this harmed their prospects of promotion to the next tier.
Such a state of affairs would not only lead to a breakdown of confidence in the whole justice system but also belittle the crucial role of the Judiciary. Therefore, it is important that members of the Judiciary assert themselves and play the role the public expect of them. Thankfully, President Sirisena has prepared the necessary climate for this by his non-interference in the judicial process.
Equally the members of the Judiciary should also conduct themselves as befitting the exalted status attached to them. We have seen in the past how some of our judges have compromised themselves by the lure of various carrots dangled before them. We are not saying that their successors to the Bench were influenced by similar prospects awaiting them and delivered judgements in favour of the State. But it is important that they do not leave behind even a smidgen of suspicion as to their motives. This is more so because the Judiciary is the last bastion where those aggrieved by injustice by the State can turn to for justice.
It is hoped that Tuesdays Supreme Court ruling will serve as a calming effect on three weeks of political turmoil that brought the State to a standstill and had a numbing effect on the populace. The warring factions should end the stalemate and set the wheels of State back in motion. Leaders of all political parties should act responsibly and restore order out of the present chaos. The people expect nothing less from their representatives in Parliament.

JVP to present 20A in Parliament again
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that his party would present the 20th Amendment to abolish the Executive Presidency, to Parliament again.
Speaking at a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday soon after the adjournment of the House, the MP said the events that took place in the country in the last few days amply illustrated that too much power concentrated in the hands of one person was dangerous and detrimental to democracy.
The UPFA, UNF and JVP convened back-to-back press conferences in the committee rooms in Parliament following the tensed sitting of Parliament yesterday. The JVP Leader, speaking to the media, called on President Maithripala Sirisena to take appropriate action as per the Constitution, adding that the MaithriMahinda conspiracy has been defeated.
What we experienced in the past two weeks can be considered as one of the greatest lessons about the Sri Lankan political arena ever.
We have to learn some lessons practically, not by reading books and this is it. Now we know what can happen when governing powers of fundamental importance become centred on a single person.
I think this is the most suitable time for moving the 20th Amendment to the Constitution again and we will do it soon, the MP said.
Dissanayake further said the JVP does not hold the view that President Sirisena should be impeached at this moment. He still can act according to the Constitution and bring the current political turmoil to an end. We hope he would look back and realise what he did to the stability of the country.
Therefore, at this moment we do not think that he should be impeached, although there is an opportunity to move an impeachment against him for bluntly violating the Constitution, he said.
He said that President Sirisena now has a duty to appoint a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet.
Today (14), the majority of members of Parliament decided that they do not have confidence in Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the newly appointed Cabinet. It means there is no government in the country right now.
The President should make arrangements to appoint a PM and a Cabinet according to the Constitution now, Dissanayake said.
He also stressed that yesterdays business of Parliament was legal and correct, adding that due process was followed in passing the no-confidence motion by suspending the Standing Orders of Parliament.
He pointed out that the UPFA did not try to defeat the motion to suspend the Standing Orders and also the NCM because they knew they lack the majority.

A man was hacked to death with an axe at Hingurupanagala in Kotapola during a heated argument on felling trees.
The deceased was identified as D. Gamage Jeewan Kumara, 31, of Aluthwala, Baddegama. He was a father of one child.
The victim and several others had been felling Attonia trees in the Diyadawa estate. However, someone had allegedly carried a tale to the estate management to stall the felling of trees.
Two factions in the group had initiated a fight over the matter and a woman, 38, had allegedly assaulted the victim with the axe.
Kosmodara Police arrested a 55-year-old mother, 60-year-old father and 38-year-old daughter of Nawa Gammanaya, Hingurupanagala, Kotapola over the crime. Those injured in the brawl were admitted to Deniyaya hospital for treatment.
Police said the 48-year-old mother of the victim had also been admitted to Deniyaya Hospital for treatment.

McLarens Group joined  Mega Beach Clean Up
The McLarens Group joined the Mega Beach Clean Up organized by Caritas Sri Lanka SEDEC in being a part cleaning 34km of beach stretch along the island from Palliyawatte to Poruthota.
Keeping in line with the UN Development goals, Life under water is one of the five key pillars the McLarens Groups CSR framework is built upon. With Shipping being one of our key business areas, protecting the coastal areas and reducing ambient pollution became a main focus for us. The clean-up effort of the volunteers across the McLarens Group was focused on the beach stretch along the Uswetakeiyawa area. The Group assisted with a corporate sponsorship for the beach cleanup and contributed through volunteer efforts.
The McLarens Group is a diversified conglomerate with shipping marine and logistics at the heart of its operations. Over the course of over 70 years, the company has ventured into other sectors such as bunkering, oil & gas services, manufacturing, lubricants trading/distribution, property development, hotel and leisure services and other strategic investments. With the development and the expansion of the company, the corporate social responsibility it has towards communities expand, together with the level of influence and monumental impact the company has in peoples lives. Reaching out and actively playing a part in enriching their lives matters enormously to the Group.
Unclean beaches not only affect rural populations around the area but has a significant impact on life below water too. One of the biggest reasons for the loss of marine ecosystems is land based human influenced industrial, agricultural and urban pollution. WithCaritas spearheading the initiative and the constant support provided by communities and corporates, we believe steady progress will be made at cleaning up the coastal lines.

Merkel calls for European Army
FRANCE: German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Tuesday for an integrated European Union military, echoing language used by French President Emmanuel Macron last week that infuriated U.S. President Donald Trump.
Merkel told the European Parliament such an army would not undermine the U.S.-led military alliance NATO but would be complementary to it, remarks that were met with loud applause in the legislature though also with boos from nationalist members.
The times when we could rely on others are over. This means we Europeans have to take our fate fully into our own hands, Merkel said. We should work on a vision of one day establishing a real European army.
Macrons call, which reflected a broad trend of EU thinking but is not universally accepted, was meant to show European willingness to meet U.S. demands that Europe do more for its own security and rely less on Americas security umbrella. However, on Twitter on November 9, Trump accused Macron of seeking to develop the EUs own military to defend itself from the United States, which EU and French officials said was a misunderstanding. On Tuesday Trump took aim at Macron again, blasting France over its near-defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and Macrons approval ratings.
In his remarks on November 6, Macron had been referring to computer hackers who could attack Europe from anywhere, including from inside the United States, officials said.
First proposed in the 1950s and taken up four years ago by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as a response to fraying EU unity, an EU armed forces is seen as strengthening the global power of the bloc, which is an economic giant but a geopolitical minnow.
With Britains pending departure from the EU, there may be more momentum for remaining member states to find common ground on defense, although there remain divisions. Supporters of a European defense union say the EU has struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and Africa, and that it was caught off guard by Russias annexation of Crimea. Merkels address comes at a time when the EU is searching for answers to a U.S. president who views the EU with contempt, to the rise of illiberal democracies and nationalist parties within its borders, and to Britains vote to leave the bloc.
She made appeals for tolerance and solidarity, saying nationalism and egotism should no longer have a place in Europe to a sustained applause. As a deadline looms for Italys euroskeptic government to re-submit budget plans to the European Union, Merkel said the euro zone would only work if all member states meet their treaty responsibilities.
Our common currency can only function if every individual member fulfils their responsibility for sustainable finances, Merkel said, adding that otherwise the strength and the stability of the euro zone were at risk.
We want to extend a hand to Italy, she later said. But Italy also agreed to all sorts of rules and it cant just tear them up.
Merkel dominated European politics for over a decade, but she is now a diminished force, weakened by the fragility of her coalition and the rise of the far-right in Germany. She announced in late October that she would step down as leader of her party, though remain chancellor.
Her foot-dragging over far-reaching reforms to the eurozone has frustrated the energetic Macron. In the summer, they agreed to a budget for the single currency area but failed to deliver any big-bang reforms. Few concrete steps have been taken since.
On Tuesday, she kept her vision for deeper monetary cooperation vague: We need to develop our monetary policy better. Were working on a banking union, she said. We have to look at responsibility and control, a banking union and then later a European insurance system.
Merkel also trained her sights on Poland and Hungary, two countries whose leaders other member states worry are undercutting democratic institutions. The European Parliament in September voted to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption, while concerns have grown in the EU over Warsaws accelerated judicial overhaul.
Solidarity is always linked to commitments of the community, and the principles based on rule of law, Merkel said. - VOA

More theatrics on the political stage
The political turmoil following the dismissal of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the subsequent appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as his replacement continues, as Sri Lanka grapples with a constitutional crisis of epic proportions.
The drama began with the October 26 dismissal of Wickremesinghe, who was informed by letter by President Sirisena that he was being relieved of his duties. Rajapaksa was sworn in as Premier shortly afterwards because, it was President Sirisenas opinion that he commanded the confidence of a majority of MPs in Parliament.
Thereafter, there was a scramble to demonstrate a majority in Parliament with both Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa confident that they commanded the support of the House. In that exercise, there were a few crossovers from the United National Party (UNP), the most notable among them being Wijayedasa Rajapakshe and Vasantha Senanayake who were sworn in as ministers.
New Cabinet
A new Cabinet was also sworn in. Accommodated in the new Cabinet were stalwarts of the Joint Opposition (JO). It was the first time President Sirisena accommodated the JO in his government and signalled a rapprochement between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Meanwhile, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya met with parliamentarians. Jayasuriya stated that a majority of MPs submitted a letter stating their request to convene Parliament. Based on this, Jayasuriya issued a statement to the effect that nothing had eventuated to change the status quo in Parliament.
Significantly, among the political parties that opposed the removal of Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister were the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). However, these parties went to great lengths to emphasize that while they were not offering an endorsement of Wickremesinghe as Premier, they vehemently opposed the manner in which he was removed.
I wish to emphasize that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that the new political alliance prove their majority in Parliament, Jayasuriya said in his statement but stopped short of recalling Parliament for which the authority lies with the President.
However, it was evident that not all in Parliament shared Speaker Jayasuriyas views. Senior parliamentary staff speaking to media indicated that as far as they were concerned, they would abide by the gazette notifications issued by the government.
As the guessing game as to who commanded the majority support in Parliament continued, more ministers were sworn in. Among them were some high-profile JO politicians: Chamal Rajapaksa (Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine), Dinesh Gunawardena (Megapolis and Western Development), Vasudeva Nanayakkara (National Integration, Reconciliation and Official languages), Bandula Gunawardane (International Trade and Investment Promotion), Wimal Weerawansa (Housing and Social Welfare) and Udaya Gammanpila (Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs).
Gazette notification
When the stage was being set for Parliament to be reconvened on November 14 (yesterday), the drama took another turn. Last Friday, in a gazette notification that was not entirely unexpected, President Sirisena dissolved Parliament. The gazette notification set the period of nominations for the general elections from November 19 to 26 and scheduled the general election for January 5, 2019.
It is noteworthy that the gazette notification cited Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution, read with Article 70(5) and Article 62(2) of the Constitution as the basis for the dissolution, the key clause being the first.
Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution states that In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.
Legal experts for the government argued that the powers derived by the President under Article 33(2) were over and above Article 70(1) which stated that The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament, provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.
There has been much debate about this issue. Government loyalists argue that the words in addition to the powersassigned to the President implies that the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament is over and above the restrictions placed on the President under Article 70(1), which precludes him from dissolving Parliament for four and a half years that would take the life of this Parliament well beyond the next presidential election.
The dissolution caught the UNP and other opposition parties such as the JVP and the TNA by surprise. Their MPs who were gearing themselves for a tussle for supremacy in Parliament where they would be called upon to show a majority suddenly found themselves as ordinary citizens, as Parliament was dissolved.
Intense discussion between the UNP, JVP and the TNA followed, leading to the parties deciding to collectively and separately challenge the dissolution of Parliament in the Supreme Court. This occurred on Monday, with ten petitions challenging the dissolution being heard in the highest court in the land. Among the petitioners was S. Ratnajeevan Hoole, a member of the Elections Commission. The bench constituted for the purpose comprised of Chief Justice Nalin Perera and Supreme Court Justices Prasanna Jayawardena and Priyantha Jayawardena.
Even as the countrys top legal eagles were stating their case in the Supreme Court on Monday, there were other political developments. Most notably, many parliamentarians from the UPFA obtained membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), relinquishing their membership with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Among them was the newly appointed Prime Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Both the SLFP and the SLPP insist that this is not an indication of parting of ways between the two parties but a move to establish their own identities in preparation for the general election. The modalities of how they will accommodate each other has not yet been finalised.
Dissolution of Parliament
At the end of Monday, petitioners against the dissolution of Parliament had concluded their submissions. The Supreme Court took up the matter again on Tuesday, when it heard submissions from the Attorney General. Although the decision of the court was expected at 5 oclock, it was past 6 oclock when it was finally announced to a courtroom packed with politicians and the media.
The three-judge bench of the Supreme Court issued an interim order temporarily suspending the gazette notification issued by the President on the dissolution of Parliament. The Supreme Court also issued an interim order on the Elections Commission preventing the holding of a general election. The stay orders have been issued effective until December 7. The petitions have been fixed for argument on December 4, 5 and 6.
This meant that the general election has effectively been put on hold. Political parties were evaluating their strategies on Tuesday night in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. While the opposition hailed the decision as a victory for democracy, the government maintains that what has been delivered is only a stay order and not a final decision.
At the time of writing, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had announced that Parliament would reconvene as per the Presidents proclamation. That would undoubtedly create potential for more theatrics on the political stage. What is certain though is that this drama is far from over.
At the time of writing, Parliament has just concluded a stormy session where a vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has been adopted, with 122 voting for the motion.
In addition, three MPs loyal to the government- veteran A.H. M. Fowzie, Piyasena Gamage and Manusha Nanayakkara have joined the opposition while Minister Vasantha Senanayake has resigned his portfolio. State Minister Vadivel Suresh has also signalled his intentions to resign.
In the aftermath of the vote of no-confidence, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has announced that Parliament has passed the vote of no confidence against the government although the government disputes this. Parliament is scheduled to reconvene today (Thursday). That would undoubtedly create potential for more theatrics on the political stage. What is certain though is that this drama is far from over.

NCM procedure not followed properly  Cabinet Spokesmen
President Maithripala Sirisena has power to run the country for three months using the funds of the Consolidated Fund according to the Constitution, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday evening he said this power is granted to the President under Section 150 of the Constitution but President Sirisena will make decisions quickly without any delay and there will be no need to use the funds of the Consolidated Fund to run the country.
According to Minister Jayasekara, both the UNP and the Government did not have the majority seats of the Parliament which is 113. There were several lists of names. Nobody knows what was written inside the piece of paper handed over to the Parliament Secretary General by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He did not hand it over to the Speaker. We attended the session because we respect the Parliament.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that there were names in handwriting in the list and all saw how some MPs signed the list inside a room of the Parliament after handing it over to the Parliament Secretary General.
There is a proper and accepted way of bringing in a no confidence motion in Parliament. If a no confidence motion is handed over to the Parliament Secretary General with the required signatures, it should be put in the Order Paper. Then it should be taken up during the Party Leaders meeting and a date fixed for inclusion in the Order Paper. A debate and a vote will follow. A date should be given as early as possible. This is very clearly mentioned in the Standing Orders. But none of those steps were followed, he said.

NMSJ praises SC ruling
The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) yesterday urged the public to participate in todays protest rally in Colombo against the removal of the former Prime Minister and other recent events.
Addressing a news briefing, Co-Convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organization Gamini Viyangoda said that under the previous Government the independent bodies were not appointed to approve any decision taken by the President but, to act independently for the sake of the country. He said that they were satisfied to have a very fair verdict from the Supreme Court.
Co-Convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organization Saman Rathnapriya said the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should now be accepted as the legal Prime Minister of the country as the present Government has no majority in Parliament.
He said the President was unable to protect the Constitution of the country. It was up to the public representatives in the Parliament to decide on further action in this regard, he added.
Ven. Dambara Amila and Attorney-at-Law Ravi Jayawardhane also expressed their views on this occasion.

No faith motion invalid  Leader of the House
The so-called no confidence motion of the Opposition in Parliament was not valid as no such motion had been moved during the time Parliament sittings were in progress, Leader of the House Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Gunawardena made these observations addressing a press conference held at the Parliamentary complex.
As per the Order Paper of the day, there were only two items. The announcing of the proclamation of the President summoning Parliament and the next was to adjourn the House.
I adjourned the House in accordance with the powers vested in me. Nothing that happened after the adjournment of the House could be counted as official, Gunawardena pointed out.
Gunawardena said that the Mace was removed by the Serjeant at arms and nothing that happened afterwards is official or legal.
The Mace is the symbol which gives official status for business in Parliament. It is only after the Mace is brought to the House and placed in the bracket, the Speaker could come to his seat and commence sittings. After I adjourn the House, the Mace is removed by the Serjeant-at-Arms and it marks the end of sittings officially. What happens inside the Chamber thereafter is not considered official. The so-called motion and its process was nothing but an illegal move enacted by the Speaker, Gunawardena observed.
Gunawardena vehemently criticised Speaker Karu Jayasuriya alleging that he acted partially and made it a joke. It is so unfortunate and regrettable that Karu Jayasuriya resorted to such low levels and had no shame in exposing his partiality to his party bringing the office of Speaker into disrepute. Whether the Government has a majority or minority is not the question here. There had been many minority governments in our Parliamentary history but the Speakers on none of those occasions had acted in this sorry manner. For example in 1960, there was Dudley Senanayakes minority government which could have been overturned by others with the help of the Speaker. But the then Speaker remained unbiased and impartial. Today we have witnessed the undoing of all such norms by the incumbent holder of the Speakers office, Gunawardena said.
Speaker Jayasuriya first recognised the new Prime Minister and the Cabinet. He also gave seats and offices to those positions. Suddenly, there was a change and he resorted to all means including undemocratic ones and measures which contravened Parliamentary traditions and standing orders to help his party. Now it is clear that Speakers intention was to lead parliament to chaos and the country to anarchy, Gunawardena said.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said those who so far stated that the new Government was not official or illegal thereafter would not be able to say so as Parliament had accepted the removal of the former Prime Minister and the appointment of the new one.
De Silva also pointed out that, those documents had been tabled and read out in Parliament and that means this Parliament recognises those two moves. None could say that the appointments made by the President were illegal.
Leaders of the parties in government ranks including Sarath Amunugama, Dallas Alahapperuma, Chamal Rajapaksa, S.B. Dissanayake, Wimal Weerawansa and Susil Premajayanatha were present at the media conference.

The Flying Squad officers said the house had several CCTV cameras and electric fences around the house with a notice stating trespassers would be electrocuted.
When the Flying Squad raided the house, a son of the suspect, allegedly a soldier, objected to them entering the house. Later, Police raided the house.

Sri Lankas 100% local dairy manufacturer, Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited (PDIL), has for years been instrumental in driving Sri Lanka towards being self-sufficient in milk. A part of the companys approach has also been to uplift the lives of those involved in the dairy and related industries in the areas it operates in. The company as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives recently donated milk powder to under privileged children in the Badulla area.
Upon a request made by the Uva Socio and Community Development Centre, which is the social action arm of the Catholic Church in Badulla, PDIL contributed to an educations assistance program for Grade 5 students.
Hailing from the rural areas and estate sector, these children have been identified as less privileged and marginalized. A total of 113 students from eight schools have been chosen under the program and were given evening extra classestargeting for the Grade V scholarship Exams.
Fr. Raveen Perera, the Director of the USCOD Centre in Badulla said, Unfortunately we realized that the children in the program are under-nourished for lackof food.
Their parents are mostly farmers and labourers and cannot afford to giveextra food for their children. After discussions with the Parents and TeachersCommittees, we decided to give some nourishing food with the support of well-wishers. The most important thing we decided to give the children is milk powder and are very thankful to Pelwatte Dairy for coming forward to support this worthy cause. Pelwatte has two main goals as an organization. The first is to promote macro and micro scale Dairy Farming to increase production of raw milk as it drives its goals of reaching self-suffiency of the Dairy Sector in Sri Lanka. 
Our second goal is to provide high nutrition products at an affordable rate for all.Further more we also focus all our efforts on using 100% locally collected milk and do not add colours, flavours or preservatives to our products, ensuring the highest quality, Akmal Wickramanayake, Managing Director of PDIL said.
Apart from providing the milk powder, PDIL also hopes to promote dairy farming as an additional source of income for these families. PDIL will help them start small scale farms and will purchase raw milk from these farms at a fair price which will in turn uplift their socio economic standards.

Management from Coca-Cola and LAUGFS Petroleum gathered together with volunteers to educate customers as they drove through the service station during the launch.
Customers entering the service station will be prompted by the educational signage to bring in their PET plastic bottles to be disposed appropriately for recycling purposes. All collected PET plastic bottles will be given new life by being converted into brushes, brooms, shoes and clothing. The symbol 1 inside a triangle in a plastic bottle indicates PET which is Polyethylene Terephthalate. This symbol is normally found in packaging containing soft drinks, juices, cooking oil, water, personal care and cosmetic products.

Speaker has flouted Constitution, Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions:
President rejects No Confidence Motion
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday rejected the document pertaining to the no confidence motion on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, sent to him by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The President in a letter to the Speaker said, he had acted under the powers vested in him by the Constitution when issuing the Gazette which the Speaker was referring to.
The President stated that although it was clearly mentioned in the Constitution and Standing Orders the steps to be taken when presented with a No-Confidence Motion against the Government, the Speaker seems to have ignored the Constitution, Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions.
Moreover, the President pointed out that this could infringe on the legal proceedings regarding issues connected to the Parliament which are now underway.
The President said that although he had powers under provisions to appoint a Prime Minister who could garner the confidence of parliament members there was no need or parliamentary tradition to prove either the Prime Minister or the Government had a majority.
The President expressed his regret about the action taken by Speaker to submit to him a letter consisting of signatures from MPs which the President describes as not compliant with the due process.
President Sirisena recalled that although the Prime Minister on January 09, 2015 D.M.Jayaratne had the support of 163 members in Parliament he had taken steps to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Premier although he had only 41 seats due to a request made by the political party represented by Jayasuriya then.
The President stated that the Speaker has failed to refer to the Constitution when delivering his verdict.
The President stated that he completely rejects the notion that he had not acted in accordance with the Constitution and said he acted under the powers vested in him by the constitution when taking the decision regarding the appointment of the Prime Minister.
The President stressed that under the Constitution he was vested with powers of appointing a Prime Minister.

President's gazette notifications not challenged in SC - Minister Samarasinghe
Two gazette notifications issued by President Maithripala Sirisena to remove the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge and to appoint the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa have not been challenged in the Supreme Court and they are still valid, Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday evening, he said that therefore the removal and appointment made by the President is valid and in accordance with the Constitution. Only a Stay Order has been issued by the Supreme Court on the gazette issued to dissolve Parliament.
According to Minister Samarasinghe, there is a system in Parliament to consider voice when taking a vote but the Speaker has added a new method to this by considering the visual figure, size etc. This is unacceptable. President Maithripala Sirisena had not received the Speaker's documents as at 2.00 pm yesterday (November 14, Wednesday).
Skills Development and Vocational Training and Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the people in question whether the MPs crossed over because they received money.

Promising creativity
An exhibition by Jagath Weerasinghe opens to the public on November 15, and will remain open daily until December 6 at the Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41 Horton Place, Colombo 7, from 10am to 6pm.
In his latest exhibition of multidisciplinary works Jagath Weerasinghe discusses social calamities and personal pains. An artist often known for his politically conceptual painting on canvas, Weerasinghe first released a series from his diaries in 2012 for a two man show in London with Chandraguptha Thenuwara. Following a solo show in Delhi this year of a similar series, the artist has recently begun to expose an intimate side of his oeuvre, one which deals with sensitive and personal subject matter. Taking these thoughts and themes into a global perspective the artist expands the narrative to relate to the subjects of migration and displacement. Weerasinghe states, Currently the world is experiencing a major civilizational crisis played out as mass migration - millions of people are forced to leave behind their lives and memories. These works are trying to take an intimate engagement with the suffering - ontological anxieties - of the individual caught in a crisis that is global and local at the same time. Foreveryone that has left a place, there are so many others who are left behind.
Jagath Weerasinghe holds a Master of Fine Arts from the American University in Washington DC. As a co-founder of the Theertha Collective and the moving force behind collaborations such as the Colombo Art Biennale, Weerasinghe has lectured on the local contemporary art scene internationally alongside his work as the Head of the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology. The combination of his work as an artist and archaeologist is evident in his works on paper. While he is more often identified by his dominantly black politically expressive canvases, his multitude of diaries with drawings, often completed on his travels for lack of space, expose a more intimate and romantic side to his political nature.

## Title: Reserves reach US$ 7.9 bn

Reserves reach US$ 7.9 bn
Though there is political distress in the country the Central Bank has no adverse effect from it said Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy. For Central Bank business is as usual, he said addressing the CBSL Monetary Policy review of meeting.
Supported by the receipt of the foreign currency term financing facility of US dollars 1 billion by the government, gross official reserves amounted to US dollars 7.9 billion as at end October 2018, providing an import cover of 4.2 months.
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank, at its meeting held on 13 November 2018, decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent.
In order to neutralise the impact of this reduction and maintain its neutral monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board decided to increase the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) of the Central Bank by 75 basis points to 8.00 per cent and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 50 basis points to 9.00 per cent.
The large and persistent shortage in rupee liquidity required the Central Bank to conduct open market operations (OMOs) on a short- and long-term basis in addition to overnight operations.
Year-on-year growth of broad money (M2b) continued its deceleration in September 2018.
Nevertheless, there was a possibly short-lived acceleration in credit obtained by the private sector from commercial banks as the businesses advanced their borrowing in anticipation of measures to curb excessive spending on imports. Based on the data up to the third quarter of 2018, credit to all major sectors of the economy recorded an expansion with personal loans and advances showing a notable acceleration.It is expected that the growth of credit to the private sector would return to the expected path as measures taken by the government and the Central Bank gain traction.
Headline inflation, based on both the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), decelerated below the desired mid single digit levels, largely driven by the decline in volatile food prices. Core inflation has also remained subdued reflecting well anchored inflation expectations due to the tight monetary policy stance maintained in the past.
With these developments, headline inflation is projected to remain in low single digit levels during the remainder of the year and is expected to be maintained in the targeted range of 4  6 per cent during 2019 and thereafter with appropriate policy adjustments.
The expansion in import expenditure continued to outpace the growth in export earnings during the first nine months of 2018 leading to a wider trade deficit than in the corresponding period in the previous year. However, a slowdown in import expenditure is expected in the period ahead in response to the recent measures adopted as well as the depreciation of the rupee against major currencies.
The moderation in tourism related inflows and workers remittances remained a concern in terms of the performance of the external current account. In the financial account, both the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange experienced net outflows of foreign investment, particularly in the context of rising global interest rates and elevated political uncertainty.
The significant growth in imports as well as recent capital outflows amidst the broad based strengthening of the US dollar exerted pressure on the exchange rate. Although the pace of depreciation has moderated recently, the Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated by 12.9% against the US dollar during 2018 up to 13 November.
As per the available economic indicators, real GDP growth is likely to remain subdued and below the envisaged levels in 2018.
Considering the current and expected developments in relation to inflation and economic growth, as well as the current conditions in the domestic money market and the foreign exchange market, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, at its meeting held on 13 November 2018, was of the view that the continuation of the current neutral monetary policy stance is appropriate.
The reduction in SRR is expected to release a substantial amount of rupee liquidity to the banking system, thus reducing the cost of funds of banks.
Accordingly, the Monetary Board raised the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) by 75 basis points to 8.00 per cent and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 50 basis points to 9.00 per cent, thereby narrowing the policy rate corridor to 100 basis points.

SMS alert to prevent elephanttrain collisions
The committee appointed recently to prevent elephanttrain collisions has submitted a proposal to introduce an SMS alert network to get public help to prevent such accidents.
There is also another proposal to run night mail trains during the daytime, a committee member, Project Director - Elephant Collisions, Railways Department, Irosh Perera said.
Under the SMS alert system, anyone who spots an elephant roaming near a railway line can immediately text the Railway control room and inform them of the situation. The Railway Department will also formulate a system to inform an engine driver immediately if a member of public informs the Control room via text message of a wild elephant nearby.
The Railway Department will soon introduce a hotline for the SMS service, Perera said.
There were several reports in the recent past of collisions of elephants with trains. It is reported that around 12 elephants have died within a very short period of time due to elephanttrain collisions. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the public to provide the correct information on wild elephants to prevent further occurrence of such accidents, he said.
The committee has also paid attention on running night mail and freight trains in the daytime without disrupting the service of daytime passenger trains, he said.

Softlogic to launch Global Modern Trade Retail experience in Sri Lanka
Softlogic Holdings PLC is to announce its foray into FMCG Modern Trade Retail, with the launch of a truly global market experience in Delkanda, a rapidly expanding suburb of Colombo.
Softlogic Holdings PLC has already established its pioneering leadership as a retail giant, leading the consumer electronics and apparel segments and innovating in the restaurant and food business, through partnering with global brands. It is now expanding its footprint in modern trade to tap into the strong potential this segment holds.
This launch will herald a new chapter in the history of the retail industry in Sri Lanka. Customers can expect a truly global experience which was not available in the country thus far.
Commenting on the exciting launch, the Chairman and Managing Director of Softlogic Holdings PLC, Ashok Pathirage said, Rising disposable incomes and the effects of globalization are resulting in customers holding high aspirations and expectations from their retail experience and our newest offering will offer just that an activity many consumers delight in when they travel abroad. Customers can look forward to a comprehensive array of products under each category such as bakery, meats, dairy, grocery, home-ware, lifestyle etc., to ensure they can shop for all their daily and household needs, under one roof. Over the last few years, modern trade has demonstrated strident growth.
Softlogic is well poised to ride to the forefront of this wave by presenting a global offering that surpasses any such place in the market presently. In true Softlogic tradition, we expect to set new benchmarks in modern trade as we have in retail, by bringing the best of the best and top of the line products for discerning consumers in Sri Lanka, he said.
We believe this expansion is a natural progression which will complement the Groups other consumer driven businesses, allowing it to be present across and visible in all key consumer value chains. The influx of tourists into Colombo also gives rise to the need for an international global experience that we will now offer. We are excited about bringing a truly innovative and technology-backed modern trade experience to enhance the landscape in the country and elevate consumer tastes, lifestyles and overall shopping experience.
Sri Lankas modern grocery retail sector has also seen robust growth supported by improving incomes, rising urbanisation and changing lifestyles, which has attracted more customers from traditional grocery channels.
Penetration, however, remains low with only 15%-18% of FMCG sales generated by modern grocery retail, relatively low in comparison with regional peers as per Fitch (2017).
This global market offering is being launched by Softlogic Supermarkets Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Softlogic Retail PLC, under the ultimate parent group, Softlogic Holdings PLC. As a consumer-focused business, it has over 100 international brands marketed through one of the countrys strongest distribution channels.

Speaker criticised for breakneck NCM voice vote
Intellectuals, political analysts, former Speakers and deputy Speakers, senior politicians and civil society organizations and clergy yesterday, expressed their concern and questioned the ingenuity and proficiency of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for taking and passing something as important as a motion of no confidence against a Prime Minister and a Cabinet of an incumbent government in posthaste.
He carried out all this at a breakneck speed causing unprecedented chaos in the country, they said, He was in a super hurry to pass this no-confidence motion which actually concerns a whole generation of people.
Civilians said they were surprised at the voice vote that was taken inside the House regarding the motion.
Former parliamentarian, minister and political analyst Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha said, Taking a voice vote over something as important as a motion of No-Confidence against a government is highly inappropriate and unacceptable, he told the Daily News yesterday.
Asked about the instance of taking a vote for suspension of Standing Orders following a motion moved by TNA MP Sumanthiran, Prof. Wijesinha said , I did not closely follow any of these. But it must be mentioned taking a voice vote on a no confidence motion against a government and passing the same on mere audible and visual observation, is simply out of order.

Stay Order has no effect on PM, Cabinet
The Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court with regard to the dissolution of Parliament has no effect whatsoever on the appointment of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, it was stressed on Tuesday at a news conference convened by several leading members of the Government.
The stay order does not pose any challenge to the appointment and authority of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and other ministers, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said. He said this was only a temporary injunction and the Supreme Court would only deliver the final verdict on the dissolution on December 7 after hearing further submissions from December 4 to 6. This was the usual practice for this type of petition, he pointed out.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said they would explore the possibility of seeking a full Bench of the Supreme Court for further hearings. The Stay Order was issued by a three-Judge Bench headed by the Chief Justice.
Housing and Construction Minister Wimal Weerawansa said only the President has the power to reconvene Parliament, although Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has made statements to the contrary.
Thus he has no power to reconvene Parliament today (14), he said. Moreover, the power of appointing the Prime Minister and the Ministers lies with the President, not with the Speaker.
This is the first time in global history that an opposition party is rejecting elections and going before the Courts. They have already proved that the people are not with them. Showing a majority in Parliament does not equate to having a popular mandate. Attempts are being made with the help of certain countries to show that there is anarchy in Sri Lanka. Minister Gunawardena clarified that the Stay Order has not nullified the General Election as wrongly believed by many.
There is only a Stay Order on the election given until the final ruling is delivered on December 7.
Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa would strive to obtain a bigger mandate from the people at the forthcoming election, he added.

Steps ahead
Life has been a series of unexpected twists and turns for this dancer-turned-choreographer and dance instructor. While some people learn to dance, Akila Palipana, it seems, was born to dance. He instinctively moves to the beat, letting the song guide his hands and feet into a series of expressions emerging from within himself.
His flair and passion for the art has made the 29 year old into one of the countrys most sought after choreographers in on stage, on TV and now stage plays too, all in a relatively short period of time. His most recent venture was choreographing a play directed by Namel Weeramuni and penned by Weeramuni and Professor J B Disanayaka. Titled Ravana Seethabilashaya the play went on board the Punchi Theater last month.
A good dancer needs to grasp whatever a choreographer tells him or her in an instance. Be it about the timing, expressions or body language, the dancer should realize what the choreographer expects of him or her. This is one of the greatest hurdles that a dancer needs to overcome during each and every performance. He or she also needs a lot of control to hold an action or expression intact, Akila opined adding that being able to jump or twirl well alone will not make one an exceptional dancer.
Akilas first big break came when he clinched the Best Creative Dancer award at Kavitha Talent Show 2013. The event saw university students from across the country taking to the stage to unleash their talents in a variety of fields like dancing, literature, stage drama, music, art, still photography etc. The event was organized by the Sports and Talents Development Division of the Higher Education Ministry. Akila had choreographed all the eight dance items he presented for the event. He presented a dance portraying King Maniakkitha of the Naga clan at the finals.
The following year he choreographed and presented a group dance which won the award for the Best Folk dance. The team presented a lotus dance at the finals.
I did a lot of research before choreographing the lotus dance. We had to compose dance items using the Kandyan, Southern and Sabaragamuwa dance styles for the event. I also choreographed another dance item for female dancers based on the concept of finger millet. That won third place at the event, he expressed.
Later at the awards ceremony Professor Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi invited him to choreograph a dance production by engaging the students of the dance teams which won first, second and third place. Kulasiri Budawattas wife coordinated the project. He had choreographed a dance based on cashew for them.
Recalling how he got into the art, Akila says he and his siblings and their friends used to frequent a dance class which was held near their home. Back at home he would imitate the movements of the dancers he had seen training in the class. Noting his flair for dancing Akilas parents decided to send him for classes with his brother and peers. Though the rest of the group dropped out Akila continued taking part in the classes which were conducted by a teacher named Nilmini. He was in grade three then.
At Madamulla de Mel Navodya School he was trained by Senadeera. Later he came under the guidance of Wijesooriya. After finishing his G C E Ordinary Level examination he joined Ibbagamuwa Madya Maha Vidyalaya. He was trained by three teachers there and he managed to top the all island dance competitions for two consecutive years. He also learnt Kathak dancing under Duleeka Wickramasinghe for around four years.
Though he has mastered Kandyan dancing Akila first learnt Southern and Sabaragamuwa dancing from his dance guru, Padmini, while he was studying at Kelaniya University. He was also guided by several other experts in dance at the university including Professor Mudiyanse Dissanayake.
Akila has completed his BA in Fine Arts in 2013. He also did his Masters in the subject. He followed the choreography diploma at the Foundation Institute. Around 30 people followed the course and five were selected to make a production at the end of the event. Akila was among the selected five. He was the youngest in the group. The team made a production based on emotions and Akila had to choreograph an item based on sadness. His choreography which was a fusion of Kathak and Kandyan dancing was appreciated by many.
All these experiences helped me enhance my skills. Each and every one of my gurus have inspired me in my productions, he said adding that he also admires Indias lionized classical dance company Nrityagrams work.
They did a production titled Samhara with the Chitrasena dancers. Their movements are quite natural and they are very dedicated to the art, he noted.
During Kavitha 2014 Akila encountered Nuwan Ranjith Priyanga who was attached to the Chitrasena Dance Ensemble. He encouraged him to join the Chitrasena dance team. Akila still holds the record of being the dancer who had made it to their dance troupe in the shortest span. Two months after joining in he was chosen to be one of the three dancers in the Ganapathi Wannama which was choreographed Heshma Wignaraja based on a work by originally choreographed by Vajira Chitrasena.
He has taken part in many projects spearheaded by the Chitrasena Dance Ensemble. He even choreographed the childrens dance items titled Polpithi Haraka and Eluwan Keema which were part of The Guru Gedara Festival.
All the seniors in the Chitrasena Dance Ensemble gave valuable advice which came in handy when I choreographed the dance items, he said.
Akila has gotten many offers to teach dancing at schools but he does not believe in teaching the theory based subject. He believes that as an individual he has the scope to do more to enrich the local dance scene. He holds a dance session once per week in his home town. He is also a university visiting lecturer.
Speaking about the dance styles he had mastered he noted that going in depth in any dance style is challenging.
There are so many things to learn. The movements are all interconnected. One person may be able to master one movement while another who is a more senior dancer might not be able to manage the movement as well as his or her partner, Akila mused adding that his ambition is to excel in the field as a dancer and choreographer.
Make wishes. Do not chase after trends. I believe in the power of the mind so if you are really determined about a certain aspect, an opportunity will open up for you, he advised.

Thenuwara's 'Executive Demon' Feels Like a Mistake
Entering the main exhibition space of Chandraguptha Thenuwaras Executive Demon at Saskia Fernando Gallery feels like accidentally walking in on someone getting dressed or seeing an upscale bar with the lights turned on. It is an attack on highbrow gallery standards in the form of a large, gold-coated, nude figure, fallen on the floor.
Forcing the viewer look down and grapple with the discomfort of this massive interruption in the exhibition space, Thenuwaras Excecutive Demon thwarts the notion that art is to be elevated and deified. The gold-clad figure-- with its lifted arms and spread legs-- insists you step around it, like a piece of garbage, rather than the carefully crafted statue that it is. Violating the credo of the modern gallery, it feels like a mistake.
On the one hand, the sculpture could have been knocked over by a boisterous child moments before , for, surely, the cur could not have remained in pristine gallery space in such condition for long. But, on the other hand, the figure stubbornly retains its standing posturearms raised, feet flat, not a broken bone in its golden body-suggesting it could not have fallen, and its placement must be intentional. Without a frenzied gallery assistant trying to pick up the statue, the unsettling silence of its demise reverberates through the sterile room.
Executive Demon is a six-armed, naked man, gripping a symbol in each hand-- from the politically-charged lion tail representing nationalism and mace representing parliament, to the Blue lotus (Nil Manel), Sri Lankas national flower, and Themis, the goddess of divine law. Thenuwara does not shy away from darker themes-- figures of copulation represent sex and gambling and a pistol and a knife represent organized crime. Snakes stretch voraciously from the figures head, an allusion to Medusa, a Grecian mythological creature infamous for her serpentine hair and ability to turn everything she looked at to stone.
Thenuwara calls the work a commentary on the executive presidency, how, one day, [it] must fall, but the work is as much a commentary on the presidency as it is a commentary on institutions and the gallery as a space that operates under certain rules and expectations.
The curator describes Executive Demon as a monster, and Thenuwara calls it a warning, but, slithering hair aside, the fallen figure hardly arouses the sense of fear its name or description suggests. While vertiginous and even unnerving to look at, the figure has a placid, innocuous face, evoking images of a theater mask rather than a demon.
Perhaps, that is precisely Thenuwaras point.
Such is the nature of Thenuwaras political demon-- superficially harmless, grotesque only in its ostentation, and furtive in guarding the secrets of its power. Thenuwaras piece embodies the demonic qualities of a political office with staying power, despite being fraught with controversy.
What is truly terrifying, in the conventional sense, is the complusion to pick up the figure--akin to looking at a frame hung crooked on a wall. But here, the urge to correct, to restore dignity to the figure, has symbolic repercussions.
The sculpture is on the ground intentionally, implying that it should not be lifted upright, emphasizing the absence of someone to venerate it, states Thenuwara. When a viewer enters the room, they fill the absence and become the person to venerate it.
Thenuwara creates an emotional simulation of our allegiance to established institutions and calls attention to the widespread belief that something large, gold, and heavy with the weight of the establishment, deserves respect.
While Thenuwara says his work is a representation of how the executive presidency must fall, central to the piece is the persistence of the position. The demon retains its standing posture so defiantly, so resolutely; one cannot help but cock ones head to the side and impose on the fallen figure the image of what it would look like upright.
The rigidity represents the oft sedentary, immovable nature of the institution. In Thenuwaras piece, the executive presidency, even when defunct, becomes the elephant in the room that wont budge.
A series of preparatory drawings line the wall above Executive Demon. There, fluid pen strokes contrast the rigid mass in the center of the room. In one image, lotuses grow into the form of a swastika, and in another, they metamorphosize into snakes. A visual rhyme with greater political and cultural undertones, these pieces emphasize how easily one thing becomes another. From roughly rendered barrels to what looks like machine-generated camouflage, Thenuwaras creations vary stylistically, and across the exhibition a cohesive narrative-- apart from political undertones-- is difficult to find.
A commentary on construction in Colombo during the civil war, his barrelist works highlight the contradictory way in which construction can obstruct. His camouflage works camouflage internallya close look at one reveals anthropomorphic forms and legs. But, on the wall, these pieces stand out-- the opposite of what camouflage should do. In the final room, a new series called Glitch features pixelated human forms peering out of abstract grids. It alludes to the malfunction of contemporary politics and, perhaps, technologys role exacerbating the problem.
A sense of brokenness, of objects in disrepair unites the stylistically disparate works, and Executive Demon is no exception.
A gold statues very function is to be ostentatious, to be looked upon with reverence. Here, the malfunction is not within the piece but outside of it. The gold figure is not inherently dysfunctional, rather, its lack of proper positioning defies the rules of the gallery.
Executive Demon stands apart from the other works in the show because there is a sense we can and should correct this malfunction, but the inclination to fix it may just say more about the viewer than the piece.
Executive Demon and Other Works is on view at the Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41 Horton Pl, Colombo 7, until August 14, 2018.

Traditions, brighter prospects and relentless demands
History will record that Sri Lanka rugby kicked off a spanking season 2018/19 in spite of speculative rumblings.
Plenty of experts and pundits on the expat players platform...is required Should Sri invest And what next to get us the respect and ranking we deserve in Asia
We have to blood newer skill and pathway players into the club system ... so that our DNA pool is full of solid quality and able to match the likes Japan, Hong Kong, Korea etc...
We must aspire to the top and enough rhetoric ...skills and discipline the best way to stamp our class.
Many seasons have half marched past us and not much to brag about the depth of quality or encouraging results.
Time to leave our old baggage in the parking lot and calculated risks to become contenders.
If indeed the club format has the plan in hand covered, then our prospects to match Japan ... lunge forward knowing and able to tap our resources as demanded.
Do hesitate before you pace up to brand me a purveyor of gloom...
Understand the prospects and player environment, compared to 10 years ago.... are admirably better.
But that does not give us more clout to outplay them or match them.
Our reality stops dead here...and ...comparisons generally are pretty on paper... reality its own unforgiving self.
The Sri Japan divide is huge and for us players... massively intimidating.
Japans RWC was magical and carefully Eddie Jones structured to perfection.
Full credit beating the South Africans and giving Ireland a run for their money....
Now realistically translate that exact match up ...to Sri Lanka.
Ask yourself and consider us vs SA or Ireland
The mind boggles....as the boys amble to a short line out just outside the Irish 22m....
The dream saps the reserve and more energy to contemplate such a fab day for our glorious rugby
Asia awaits that grand metamorphosis...
Reality on the deck is far from such speculation as the club season kicked off last weekend... Kandy the defending champs played and nudged past a gutsy Air Force under Fijian coach Ferretti... pleasing start upfront at the turbo arena in Ratmalana.
Navy huffed and puffed against a new look Police at their running park, surviving the battle to sneak home and plenty for coach Jayatilake to analyse and deliberate.
The traditional Colombo 7 grudge match ..Longden Place vs Maitland Crescent was a real test for fans and harder upfront than anticipated.
A Ratwatte inspired kick settled in the last 5mins of play and a famous big W for CR to celebrate and CH to contemplate the power of thinking under pressure.
Team effort has no name on it ...and CH will start to understand the value of commitment and skills under pressure.
National rep players need to stand apart at most times and display the sharp potential that makes them proud Sri islanders.... especially for young school kids on their inspiration trail.
As the weeks line up ...we will begin to understand the demands on clubs, management, leadership and all players.
The secret is defined by the depth of your reserve bench and the 23 listed for the game each weekend.
Injury and damage control to key players ...the vital oxygen for a consistent season.
I anticipate a big challenge for Kandy to defend their title... and the decent prospect of CR, Navy, Havies or CH stepping up to carve some new history for their faithful.
Bula bula the fantastic skills that will shape this season beyond words and heartache .
Cheers islanders for fairplay and respect.

Villagers in landslide-prone areas living in fear
The villagers of Pallepola in Matale are living in fear as they were issued red notice several years ago to evacuate from their residences as the Rusigama hill is a landslide-prone area.
Twenty five houses below the hill were issued red notices by the Disaster Management Centre and the Divisional Secretariat. However, they were not granted alternative land to settle in, compensation or any other facility.
Villagers said they had been living in the area for over 20 years. They said over the past few years, they had to move to the temple during the rainy season and return to their houses in the dry season.
They said every year trees and boulders fall along mountain slopes but no officer comes to solve their issue. They added that only the Gramaseva Niladari visits them during the rainy season to instruct them to evacuate from their houses.

We showed the majority, says Ranil
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, convening a press conference along with party representatives minus JVP who voted in favour of the no confidence motion, stated that they will take steps to ensure that the Government in place before October 26 will continue. Wickremesinghe also stated that 122 MPs who voted in favour of the no confidence motion have signed and handed over a memo to the Speaker.
He also informed that Government servants and police cannot carry out illegal orders from the purported government that has failed to demonstrate the confidence of the House or the people.
Wickremesinghe made these observations before media and the majority of the MPs who signed in favour of the no confidence motion. He was accompanied by R.Sampanthan, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Sajith Premadasa, Rajitha Senaratne, Mano Ganesan, P. Digambaram, Ravi Karunanayake, Rishad Bathiudeen and the recent crossovers Piyasena Gamage, Vadivel Suresh and Manusha Nanayakkara. Wickremesinghe observed that Parliament in a historic move voted against Mahinda Rajapaksas Government and proved that it does not have the confidence in the House. He also said that the historic decision taken by the Supreme Court also confirmed the superiority of the Constitution while Parliament has now shown that it has a majority.
Wickremesinghe while observing that 122 MPs have informed the Speaker in writing that they voted in favour of the no confidence motion, said that, If anyone wants to challenge the voice vote, they can move a resolution challenging the Speakers decision and we can put it to vote and I can assure you it would be defeated. If necessary we can pass another resolution saying the Speakers ruling is correct, he said.
To report that no decision of the House was made today is a breach of Parliament powers and privileges. The political arm has acted and no one in the purported administration can show a majority. When Parliament has taken a decision it should be recorded. This is another victory for people. One by one we are confirming that the Constitution is main law of the land.The Constitution should be applied and now we have proven that there is a purported government that does not enjoy the support of Parliament and therefore is illegal, he added.
Wickremesinghe also observed that some MPs including certain SLFP representatives, who do not belong to the main three parties but voted in favour of the no confidence motion, have voted as independent MPs.
Some of the people who took office have also returned, he added. When a reporter questioned if he is the Prime Minister now, Wickremesinghe held up a board with number one printed on it.

Why cleanse the Augean stables
Whilst speaking to a gathering in Mahara, President Maithripala Sirisena had wanted to know how many politicians dare to come up on stage and say they are clean and that they do not plunder the wealth of the people and charged that such politicians were scarce these days.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the executive authority of this country, also stated that top officials in the government sector too were prone to following in the footsteps of politicians these days. He had further stated that graft was well entrenched in the political culture of Sri Lanka and people were voting for the same set of politicians at successive elections despite being aware that they were thieves.
Significantly, the President had also observed, If we can prevent the loss of revenue due to corruption and fraudulent activities in this country bridging the budget deficit would not be a difficult task.
The President in his wisdom has in this short assessment of the state of corruption in the country hit the nail on the head. He has succinctly summarized the core causes of the Nations woes:
 Clean politicians that do not plunder the wealth of the people are scarce.
 Top officials are following the footsteps of the politicians
 Graft is well entrenched in the political culture of Sri Lanka.
 People were voting for the same set of MPs over and over again.
We need to be thankful to the President for making this frank and forthright statement that in fact deserved a banner headline.
Gone are the days when people like Dudley Senanayake, H.B. Wanninayake, Pieter Keuneman, N.M. Perera, Phillip Gunawardena, Colvin R de Silva, Gamini Jayasuriya and Felix Dias Bandaranaike held the reins of power. Such men and many more of their times stamped their era with the golden seals of honour, integrity and dignity. The speeches they made in Parliament both by the sea and by the Diyawanna loaded with studied substance, wit and repartee always held the House and the galleries spellbound. An unparliamentary expression was on exceptional rarity.
The President is right. Looking for a clean politician today is akin to the search for a needle in a haystack!
In the days of honourable politics, top officials did not follow the ways of politicians Ministers were guided by their Secretaries, the AG, Government Agents and Heads of Departments. In matters involving finance Ministers invariably took the advice of their Secretaries who are the Chief Accounting Officers of Ministries. The breakdown in this Cardinal principle of Financial Administration has been the main reason for the galloping corruption in the State Sector.
Accountability and responsibility
Regrettably, politically appointed Ministry Secretaries today are no respecters of accountability and responsibility.
Within living memory, successful heads of state and Ministers had Secretaries and Senior State Officers of the calibre of Gunasena de Soyza, N.Q. Dias, W.T. Jayasinghe, G.V.P. Samarasinghe, Bradman Weerakoon, D.B.I.P. Siriwardena, M.D.D. Pieris, Eric de Silva, Jolly Somasundaram, Gen. Sepala Attygalle, Chandi Chanmugam, A.R.M. Jayewardene, David Loos, Francis Pietersz, Elmo de Silva, K. H. J. Wijedasa, Chula Unamboove and Asoka de Soyza to name a few all men of knowledge, experience, integrity and enviable rectitude to advice them.
Blinded by political power Ministers as well as officials care less for the laws, Statutes, Financial Regulations and the Establishments Code, the main pillars that prop up the countrys administrative structure.
Ministers the lesser Ministers, politically appointed top officials and half-baked officials even if clean, lacking in the required knowledge, training and experience cannot be expected to make unblemished vital decisions. Many are the heads of State Corporations and Statutory bodies today who have not read or even seen the Acts of Parliament that created such bodies. Such men and women can even unwittingly fall prey to corruption or make expensive blunders. The partially concluded and ongoing proceedings of Presidential Commissions of Inquiry reveal the extent to which senior officials have acted with gross irresponsibility.
To my knowledge, the Presidents statement at Mahara has generated much discussion in discerning social circles. Many believe that this Presidential utterance is an understatement. For several decades this country had one politician who was often referred to as Mr. Clean. Regrettably, his crown appears to have been buried in a mountain of dung that rolled out of the loysians tables! Sri Lanka cannot even dream of a Hercules who found a way of cleaning the Augean stables.
I strongly believe that National leaders, as well as leaders of political parties who ignore the wrongdoings of their respective flocks, cannot claim to be clean. National leaders empowered by the electors are morally bound to ensure that officials and more importantly politicians holding office are clean and above corruption.
There are two recent cases of shameless corruption and unconscionable waste of public funds respectively; the former by three Parliamentarians and the latter by the Western Provincial Council.
Members of Parliament
In spite of the wide publicity and the impact on the public conscience the above two acts, it is lamentable that even the spiritual leaders of the country have not voiced their concerns. The first case referred to above is the instance where three Members of Parliament admitted having received cash cheques to the tune of millions from none other than the first suspect in the notorious CBSL bond scam. To make matters more heinous, assuming that the people were fools these MPs churned out the excuse that the filthy lucre was for election purposes.
Harping on the second case, the much publicized near million rupees super comfy chairs for the Western Provincial Councillors, the most unconscionable waste of public funds, fortunately, aborted by an honourable Governor is indeed nauseating. This Provincial Council is now hell-bent on making their abode smell sweet spending millions on perfumes. These upstarts who in their days of yore sat on mats and gunny sacks do not realize that all the perfumes of Arabia will not be able to overpower the horrible stench that emanates from their office on Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha.
Our leaders have not in anyway, publicly admonished, condemned and shamed these somebodies and nobodies in the world of politics who by their obnoxious behaviour have established landmarks in the history of corruption in this country. The voter cannot be blamed. He or she has no choice, but compelled to vote for a thief among thieves nominated by party leaders.
Parties repeatedly nominate unsavoury characters because it is the latter that have black money to spend on elections without burdening the party coffers. Furthermore, they have catchers comprising thugs, rowdies, murderers, drug addicts, kasippu dealers and rapists who can be unleashed to scare and intimidate opponents and voters.

Only socialist government could save country
Although the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) considered the dissolution of Parliament as an anti-democratic measure, it also believed that the act was warranted by the Speakers partisan attitude, FSP National Organiser Kumara Gunaratnam said.
He was addressing the Il Maha Viru Samaruwa commemoration ceremony organised by the Frontline Socialist Party at the Kandy Postal Department complex auditorium on November 13.
Gunaratnam alleged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was instrumental in implementing the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement through the backdoor, without submitting it for Parliamentary approval.
The former PM had failed to grant relief packages to the people as he had promised, Gunaratnam said, adding that Wickremesinghe had issued other false promises to the people as well.
Late President J.R. Jayawardene implemented a neo-liberial economic programme and introduced the free-market economy to the country. This caused irreparable damage to the economy. Nearly 60,000 youths lost their lives during his regime, which even attempted to privatise health and other public welfare services, the FSP national organiser said.
The dharmishta (righteous) rule he promised was restricted to mere words and the Communist Party, as well as the Peoples Liberation Front (PLF), were banned during his rule, Gunaratnam said; only a socialist government could save the country from its present plight. He said that the country was today in peril due to the tug-o-war between two political groups. India, the US, and the UK, which demanded the re-convening of Parliament, had no right to do so because they themselves had broken Parliamentary and democratic traditions.
Today the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had been disgraced. The PLF and the United National Party were instrumental in bringing President Maithripala Sirisena to power, he said, adding that the country could never attain economic development under a capitalist system.
Gunaratnam said that although the 100-day government introduced a relief budget, the expenditure involved had been added to the normal budget introduced later, placing an excessive burden on the people.

President dissolved Parliament as Speaker was partial
There are other ways of testing the opinion of the public who have sovereign rights, if one cannot hold an election to do so, Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa said, speaking to staff of the Samurdhi Development Department in Sethsiripaya on Tuesday.
The Minister said a cyclone swept across the political field of this country several weeks ago. A new administration headed by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was set up replacing the former regime. Subsequently the President appointed a new Cabinet of Ministers and a group of new State and Deputy Ministers.
Since the Speaker shelved his independent stand and became a loyalist of his political party and the foreign embassies during the crisis between the Executive and the Legislature, the President had to dissolve Parliament and enable the people who had the sovereignty to elect a government of their choice to overcome the crisis, Minister Weerawansa said.
Now certain parties had gone to courts challenging the Presidents order dissolving Parliament. They expected the Judiciary to issue a fair and reasonable order on the decision taken by the President to dissolve Parliament. The government did not wish to settle this problem in Parliament by bribing members, he said.
No one can oppose the governments decision to seek public opinion at a general election. The government had never tied to cheat people by seeking a referendum to extend the life of Parliament. There was no better democracy than testing the peoples opinion at a general election, he said.
Minister Weerawansa said he considered the Samurdhi or Divi Neguma movement as an army dedicated to eliminating poverty among people belonging to all communities in towns and villages. This movement had strived to improve the living standards of nearly 1.4 million families living in this country.
The Minister said an army would perform its duties meticulously if it was provided with all necessary facilities. As such, the officers in the Samurdhi movement should be first made to feel contented to be perform an efficient service to the Samurdhi families. Their problems, challenges and difficulties should be looked into if they are to provide efficient service to poverty-stricken families.
The Minister said he did not treat this matter as an insurmountable challenge. An inauspicious time when all services would cease would come during the general election. He hoped to resolve the problems encountered by Samurdhi officials before the advent of that work cessation period, Minister Weerawasna said.
He requested all officials in the Ministry from the Secretary to the lowest officials to extend their unstinted support and cooperation to him to achieve his targets in the Samurdhi movement. He would also request trade unions too to extend their fullest cooperation.
Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe, Samurdhi Development Department acting Director General Nimal Kotawalagedera and other officials were also present on the occasion.

Former MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said President Maithripala Sirisena has protected the supremacy of the people by dissolving Parliament and declaring a general election without letting the country slide into anarchy.
Now the people have a real opportunityto democratically elect their representatives to Parliament and those who respect democracy will never reject the Presidents decision, he said.
There would have been an instability in the country had Parliament convened due to the partiality of the Speaker. The Speaker cannot engage in politics. But, in this instance, the Speaker was directed by Sirikotha, Abeygunawardena said.
The President who knew this situation well dissolved Parliament and gave the people an opportunity to elect a new Parliament. I like to ask UNP MPs who always pretend that they protect democracy, if they want an election or not. If they have worked for the people, they can go before the people without any fear, he said.

Unbecoming of the West to interfere in our internal affairs
It is very unbecoming of Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. It is the countrys good fortune to see the sale of local assets to foreign nations halted with a change of government, the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera said.
The Chief Prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an anusasana when Buddasasna Minister Udaya Gammanpila called on him and received his blessings after assuming duties in his new Ministry on Tuesday afternoon.
Earlier the Minister visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa and worshipped the Sacred Tooth Relic and called on the Malwatte Prelate at his temple and received his blessing too.
Ven. Anamaduwe Sri Dharmmadassi Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said a state of political instability was witnessed in the country recently.
The ability to save the countrys assets from sale to foreigners was a most welcome move.
But it would take some time for the country to earn benefits accruing from that move.
Minister Gammanpila said some foreign countries had been enraged over the political changes which occurred in Sri Lanka recently.
Foreign countries were very powerful and as such we should not try to clash with them. We should settle our internal problems in a peaceful and amicable manner without leaving room for external inference.
He said the recent political change was effected in a very secretive manner evading the hawk eye of foreign agents operating in this country.
It was so secretive that even Shiranthi Rajapaksa was unaware that Mahinda Rajapaksa was being sworn in as the new Prime Minister, as she was attending a wedding reception at that moment.
Minister Gammanpila said the UNP received only 29.65 per cent of total votes at the recent Local Government Elections. Its opponent parties received 70 per cent of the total votes. Holding an election is the most democratic move taken by any country. An opposition should agitate only if elections were not being held.

Powerful, talented, beautiful, strong. The best of the best, each in one in their own field. They are an inspiration for millions of women all over the world, not only for their talent and personality, but also for their style. We celebrate 5 among the worlds most influential fashion icons. -Vogue
Solange Knowles:In Solanges artistic life fashion and music are equally important. And we can see that from the streetstyle looks showing that the star enjoys experimenting with flamboyant silhouettes and vibrant hues. And this is also proved by the videos from her third album, A Seat At The Table flaunting designs  from big names like Fendi, Acne Studios, Tibi, Chlo and so on, but also from emerging talents   that become a means of communication, just like her music and lyrics.
Rihanna: One thing is for sure, she never ceases to amaze on the red carpet. From the dramatic and voluminous pink gown from Giambattista Valli, to the precious yellow cape-gown by Guo Pei, to the Comme des Garons design, a fabric sculpture more than a gown, to the sheer long dress from Adam Selman. And also off-duty RiRi likes to amaze: she loves sporty ensembles mixed with other styles and is never afraid to flaunt new trends, also very eccentric ones.
Beyonc: while she is perfect on the red carpet dressed by the biggest designers, in real life she never disappoints. Also with her maternity wear. And last time she was expecting she truly offered her best style-wise, proving that her mommy curves should not be hidden but enhanced with contemporary and sensuous looks.
Naomi Campbell: What can we say about this super top model other than her perfect figure can make the simplest of dresses look totally magical From her beginnings to present day, the black Venus with her stunning looks and strong personality has interpreted outfits of all shapes and styles, both on the catwalk and the red carpet. She looks gorgeous when clad in luminous long dresses with super-high slits but also when she wears minidresses playing up her amazing legs.

Michelle Obama: Mother, wife, former First Lady. Michelle Obama is the power woman par excellence and with her classic yet modern style she has inspired women all over the world during her husbands two presidential terms. Michelle favors Aline or circle skirt cocktail dresses and her elegance was best expresses at official events, clad in custom refined long dresses by the greatest designers.

Air Force SC hoping to fly high
Sri Lanka Air Force who now go as Air Force Sports Club are all-out to enjoy success this season. Their rugby has targeted some top players , and these players determined to keep the Airmens rugby at its best. They played Kandy Sports Club in the opening game on Saturday and their next game is against Navy SC.
It was in 1961 Air Force SC, Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and University were permitted to play in the B division alongside A division clubs, Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club (CR & FC), Colombo Hockey and Football Club (CH & FC), Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition, which was changed whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1972 Airmen were promoted to Division A, and by 1975, led by Kandy school product Shanthi U. Mendis, Air Force SC, were victorious in 12 out of 16 games at the end of the league season. In the knockouts they entered the Clifford Cup final by beating Kandy SC led Iswan Omar in the semis, in extra time and lost to Army SC in a close final 3-4. Two years later led by scrum half Ronald Rodrigo; they once again made the final, this time they lost to Havelock SC. Then in 1986 Air Force SC, captained by Lakshman Caldera, won the Clifford Cup, defeating Police SC in the final 10-8. In 1990, the Air Force SC had to withdraw from the game due to the north-east war.
The clubs rugby revival took place in 1995, coming back under the coaching of A. Tennakoon, after an absence of four years they won the Plate championship for three consecutive years in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The club were runners up in the Rugby Sevens championship three times in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
It was A.V.M. Harry Goonatilake who was a top sporting Commander who took Air Force rugby to a high level. Later others too followed in his footsteps to promote rugby, Goonetillekes son Roshan Goonatilake who too was a Commander also gave a big hand for rugby.
Air Force are famous for their hard brand of rugby and if they can blend it with some rugby skills they could get the better off the more fancied teams.
This season they are hoping to give their best under the captaincy of H.M.L. Udayanga. M.M.G. Iddamalgoda is the vice captain and the rest of the players in the squad are D.N.S. Weeraratna, N.M.T.Y. Sarathchandra, Frankk Kaadd, R.M.N. Rajanayake, H.R. Wasantha, W.M.S. Banda, Y.U.G.C.P. Abeyaratne, W.A.M. Kasun, J.H.P. Madushanka, J.A.D. Nilantha, U.V.P.N.S. Weralla, G.K.G.S.M. Samarakoon, K.G.C.B. Seneviratne, H.M.MN.L. Perera, K.A.S. Udayakumar, R.P. Mahagedera, R.M. Jayaratne, J.A.D.I.S. Krishan, R.A.K. Manupriya, W.A.K.N. Perera, J.P.I. Madushan, K.G.T.R Bandara, T.I.

This years rugby committee is well supported by the Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy. Rugby Chairman is Group Captain DCI Weerasooriya a keen follower of the game who played for CH & FC, CR & FC, Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka. He said this time they have a formidable team. He is well backed by secretary Group Captain BWDNM Samarakoon, Team Manager Wing Commander ADR Liyanaarachchi, Coach Ferrati Verebula and Assistant Coach Nishal Meepage.
They are blessed with a top rugby ground at Ratmalana which was opened on 29 March 2012, by Commander Air Vice Marshal Harsha Abeyawickrema.

Aitken Spence Net Assets Increases to Rs. 112.30 Per Share
Leading conglomerate Aitken Spence PLCs financial results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange revealed quarterly revenue increasing year-on-year(YoY) to Rs. 12.41 billion from Rs. 12.28 billion while revenue for the six months was Rs. 22.98 billion. The Group also recorded an improved net assets per share value of Rs. 112.30.
Profits-before-tax (PBT) for the six months ended September 30, was Rs. 1.45 bn while the quarterly PBT was recorded as Rs. 971 million, both recording decreases over the previous year. After discounting the exceptional gain on disposal of Hotel Hilltop Kandy in September 2017, the Group has recorded a PBT growth of 19% year on year in the second quarter and registered a significant improvement over the performance of the first quarter of the current financial year.
The tourism sector reported a decrease inprofits-before-tax YoY. This was mainly owing to the significant gain from divesting in Hotel Hill Top that amounted toRs. 307.6 million Last year. The devaluation of the rupee had a negative impact on the translation adjustment of foreign currency loans taken by the tourism sector, which also witnessed a drop in the contribution from Meedhuparu resort in Maldives due to its investment made in the new resort Aarah. However, the revenue of the tourism sector was up 8.4% YoY to Rs. 12.06 billion from Rs. 11.12 billion.
There were significant improvements in the maritime & logistics and services sectors. The turnaround of cargo sector and improved performance of the ship agency operation resulted in an increase in profit-before-tax for themaritime & logistics sector.
The sector revenue increased by 10.2% to Rs. 5.62 billion from Rs. 5.10 billion. The quarterly profit-after-tax of the sector increased by 24.9 percent to Rs. 711 million from Rs. 569 million, over the previous year.
Capital expenditure incurred on the construction of Aarah resort in the Maldives and the waste-to-energy power plantin the north of Colombo resulted in an increase in property plant and equipment of the Group by approximately Rs 3.5 billion.

Alibaba Singles day smashes $25 bn sales record
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd smashed the 2017 record for its Singles Day sales event on Sunday, surpassing 168 billion RMB ($24.15 billion) sales in under sixteen hours.
Singles Day, also called Double 11 is the worlds biggest online sales event, outstripping US shopping holiday Black Friday.
The Chinese event was originally a novelty student holiday to celebrate being single, countering Valentines Day, but has since grown into a month-long online shopping festival that peaks with a 24-hour sales frenzy on November 11.
A disproportionately large number of sales are recorded in the first minutes of the 24-hour spending spree, when transactions are recorded for items that have been put on hold. The company settled roughly 69 billion RMB ($9.92 billion) in the first hour of Singles Day on Sunday, up roughly 21% from last years early haul of 57 billion RMB.
Items selling well included smartphones and other electronics, but also staples such as milk powder and diapers.
While the company surpassed last years sales just before 4pm, the rate is slower than last year when it broke the 2016 record around four hours earlier at midday.
Analysts say that despite continued strong growth, sales are likely to be hit by economic headwinds and new competition from competing sales events.
With an increasing number of promotion events a year, consumers no longer feel that Double 11 is the only opportunity to get good bargains, said Pedro Yip, partner at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
Having said that, there are more consumers who still enjoy shopping at double 11 than those that dont, he said.
Alibaba kicked off this years sales with a gala event that featured US singer Mariah Carey, a Japanese Beyonce impersonator and a shoe-shopping-themed Cirque du Soleil performance. Its expected to be the companys final November sale event with founder and chairman Jack Ma at the helm. Current chief executive Daniel Zhang will take over as chairman next year, the company said in September. While sales growth remains steady, Alibabas stock has dropped 16% this year amid economic uncertainties linked to brewing trade tensions between China and the United States. (Dhaka Tribune)

Blunt  would pay  to play Mary  Poppins again
Emily Blunt has teased that more Mary Poppins movies are in the pipeline. Chatting to American Vogue, the British actress - who takes over the role of the iconic nanny from Dame Julie Andrews 54 years after the first movie - has said there are more stories to tell and that shed be more than open to another film.
Oh, I would pay Rob [Marshall, director] to do it again with me, she gushed.
Yeah, I would. Definitely. More stories left to tell.
Also in conversation with the magazine, director Marshall said, I do know that theres a lot of material there and its very rich with all kinds of adventures and ideas. Its certainly ripe for the picking.
Mary Poppins originates from a series of books by P L Travers, whom Emma Thompson portrayed in the 2013 film Saving Mr Banks, about the authors concerns about selling the movie rights of the stories to Disney.
There were eight books in the series, published between 1934 and 1988. Mary Poppins the movie - released in 1964 - was based on books 1-4, while the forthcoming Mary Poppins Returns is said to be an amalgamation of books 2-8, expanding the story beyond Travers original stories.
Of the role of Mary herself, Blunt, 35, added, Shes a superhero. You could say shes some sort of angel. She recognizes what people need, and she gives it to them. Yet they discover something about themselves in the process. dont think she concerns herself with what she is. Theres nobody else like her - which she quite likes.
Set in 1935 London, 25 years after the events of the original film, the movie features Mary returning to visits a now-grown up Jane and Michael Banks, who have recently suffered a family tragedy.
The movie is scheduled for release on December 19. Daily Mail

## Title: Building resilience among the people

Sri Lanka Red Cross :
Building resilience among the people
International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), Under Secretary General Jagan Chapagain who visited Sri Lanka last week for the opening of the new Sri Lanka Red Cross building at Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo, spoke to the Daily News of the challenges and opportunities for the Red Cross in Sri Lanka and how building resilience was key when dealing with a world increasingly prone to natural disasters.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Why has the Red Cross decided to construct this building Is it is a sign that you are expanding your presence here
A: The old structure was not optimal; it needed to be renovated anyway. It was also very important that the office premises meet the new standards of the country and be a modern office space. The second aspect was utilising the location of the premises to the maximum: this is prime Colombo area and all these years it was not being utilised to its maximum potential. With this project, we want to capitalise on that. With this new building, a part can be rented out to generate a regular income for the Sri Lanka Red Cross. The Red Cross is based on voluntary donations; it is very important that it generates a regular income. At this stage, this is not a direct link to our presence here. Our presence goes up and down depending on the need of the country. At this stage, we dont believe there needs to be an expansion of our presence in the country. The country is making progress. If there is a need, we can expand, and having this facility will help.
Q: You have said that the success of organisations such as yours is measured by reducing the number of people that need help. Have you been successful here
A. It is very easy to measure the number of people affected and how we help, because it after a disaster. But it is very difficult to measure what has not happened yet, that is, when people are not affected by a disaster. And to be honest, we have not figured out how to measure that. For example, Bangladesh is often affected by cyclones, and in the late 80s, a cyclone killed almost 72,000 people. So after that the Red Cross and the Bangladeshi government invested heavily in a cyclone preparedness programme in the coastal areas, building coastal shelters, educating people, and building dykes. A similar cyclone occurred in the same area in 2008 and the death toll reduced from 72,000 to around 17,000. So there is a statistic here. Last year, another similar cyclone occurred and the number of people dead was 14. We also provided people with cash before the cyclone (US$ 50), so they could use that and move out of the area for a few days and then return.
Resilience saves lives. That is where the focus should be in Sri Lanka. In all the work we did after the tsunami, in the building of houses in the North and East, the mindset was to reduce the impact of the disaster.
The Sri Lanka Red Cross is launching its new strategic plan and that is the emphasis: building resilience, preparedness and educating people.
The number of studies we have done show that one dollar invested in preparing and building resilience can save up to US$ 32 in disaster response. So by investing before, you save lives and you save money.
Q: The Sri Lanka Red Cross has mostly been seen in war responses. In the next strategic plan, would you be dealing more with natural disasters Disaster risk reduction
A. Yes. First, there will be resilience building, and second, we want to invest much more in promoting principles and values which promote people coming together and working together. We have a programme for youth as agents of behavioural change. That is about changing the behaviour among young people.
A lot of conflict occurs because of misunderstanding, and in lots of instances, the values, tolerance, and ability to work with people of all backgrounds is what is important. The training gives you knowledge, but it may not change behaviour. But our focus is on working with young people to change their behaviour. It has been a success in many countries. We have to understand people who come from different backgrounds, religions, and when we understand that, differences can be addressed in a mature manner.
Differences will always exist, but are we dealing with that through dialogue to find solutions The other way of dealing with it is through conflict.
The new Strategic Plan says two things: saving lives and changing minds. Saving lives is important, but changing minds is much harder and probably more important.
Q: The Sri Lanka Red Cross more than any other INGO has managed to remain impartial even during the conflict in the country. Moreover, you also work closely with the government on many projects. How do you maintain your impartiality and balance
A. This is not easy, and this is where our major focus is on our seven fundamental principles. Three of them focus on neutrality, impartiality and independence. And these are not easy principles to follow. This is where a lot of investment in training and educating our people is important. This is also important in winning the confidence of people; when dealing with two warring sides, the importance of sticking to those principles and not taking sides which is the meaning of neutrality. Being impartial means providing assistance to whoever needs it; the only partiality is deciding who needs it the most. The third is independence which is not easy, especially in a political environment. But it is very important to maintain the independence of our actions, which is purely based on our need to serve and nothing else. The strategy is to have the global leadership and messaging which constantly emphasises this. The other important aspect is constantly educating the people, not only within, but also the various parties and the government. The importance of working closely with the government is to ensure that we can work independently. That relationship helps. Once they realise that this organisation is focused on humanitarian issues and nothing else, they dont interfere. In a conflict environment, engagement with other actors is important. So we need to maintain that transparency.
Finally, it is important to have confidentiality. We are not an organisation that talks publicly about issues. Even when we were discussing difficult issues, we dont go public. Then they know that there is trust on both sides. And they know we will not politicise any issue or take advantage of it. So when we have discussions with the government, it is open and honest. And if they want any international advice, we give that to them in confidence, not in public. This is not easy, but this is the only way in which we can continue to do our work.
Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge for your organisation in this area
A. This area continues to be very disaster-prone. And with climate change getting worse every year, disasters are becoming more frequent, and this is seen even in Sri Lanka. We have three Ds that we follow here. One D is disaster; this is increasing because of climate change and unplanned human development. The second D is disease; chances of epidemics and pandemics exist. The third D is displacement; people moving because of conflict and also for economic opportunities, but when they move, they fall prey to human smugglers. These are the three big factors for us.
On the positive side, what I have seen is that in Asia, whilst the problems exist, the capacities are also increasing, government capacities are growing and they are showing more responsibility to their people.
Democracy and pressure from the people to hold them more accountable is also increasing. Local Red Cross organisations are becoming stronger. They are raising money in their own countries so that they dont have to ask for international donations. From Geneva, I see that Asia is the region that is growing very, very fast in its capacity to deal with situations. Incomes are rising, education rates are higher, and the awareness is increasing. Asians are becoming very dynamic and entrepreneurial.
There is a hunger for success and people want to be successful and when you have that critical mass of people who work very hard to be successful, it brings in a dynamism in society, economy and politics.
I see that very much in Asia.

Cargills bank announces 10 year  fixed rate for home loans
In response to a prevailing demand of long term consumer borrowings, Cargills Bank has newly introduced a 10-Year Fixed Interest Rate option for its housing loan product.
This product was offered with the intension of providing customers the convenience of having an option to fix their monthly instalment throughout the borrowing period. This also avoids any future impact to monthly commitments that may occur due to interest volatility in the market. In addition to offering an affordable interest rate with a 10 year fixed option, the loans are granted for a period up to 20 years and up to 80% of BOQ or property value.
Cargills Bank Deputy General Manager Retail Banking Darshana Ratnayake.
Cargills Bank Deputy General Manager  Retail Banking Mr.Darshana Ratnayake said, our aim is to provide affordable, tailor-made and hassle free financial solutions to our customers across all income groups. Building a house or buying a property marks a key milestone in life, thus housing loans have become an essential product in the banking industry. It is vital that we direct our customers towards right financial solutions with affordable fees and charges that would support their investment decisions. We are steered by a dedicated sales force equipped with skills and expertise to provide our customers an unmatchable service from the initial application filling to disbursement of the loan. We have also streamlined our internal processes to create a hassle free environment to our customers.
The bank saw an opportunity for long term asset growth with the prevailing economic conditions. Our strong capital structure and funding we receive through Fixed Term Deposits have enabled us to competitively grant this fixed rate option. Our rationale is to initiate products and services that add true value to our customers, whereby reinforcing the ethos of banking on the human spirit, he further added.
In addition to the aforesaid benefits, the bank also provides a grace period at the start of the facility enabling customers to repay a lower instalment initially and gradually fixing it to their income levels as income grows in time. This flexibility in payment schemes supports consumers who seek a suitable bank to build their home.
Cargills is a brand that has been faithfully serving Sri Lankans for 174 years, built on a foundation of values and ethics. True to this heritage and the ethos of Banking on the Human Spirit, Cargills Bank is taking banking to the masses by being inclusive and accessible.

CBSL requests public to be attentive  to financial scams/phishing emails
The attention of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been drawn to recent grievances received from the general public regarding financial scams spreading through phishing emails/ social media messages. CBSL has noticed that the image of the Head Office building, the Logo of CBSL, names of senior officials of CBSL, are being used by scammers and fraudsters to solicit money from the public by disguising such scams as being sent from a trustworthy entity.
Fake email addresses such as [emailprotected], [emailprotected], [emailprotected] etc. are used to send these emails. Recipients of these emails are informed of having won a large cash prize in foreign currency through a mobile number draw or through a certain well-known international brand promotional campaign and are persuaded to deposit certain amount of funds to claim the prize. Further these emails deceive the email recipients, by attempting to obtain personal information including passport/ national identity card numbers, bank account details etc. for authentication purposes, to send cash prizes.
In this regard, the Central Bank wishes to inform the general public that the CBSL has no involvement with such reward schemes. CBSL has already reported this matter to relevant Law enforcement authorities for necessary action.
Hence, the general public is requested not to be victims of such financial scams and to respond to such promises of monetary giveaways by first contacting respective institution/ company that the suspicious email claims to be from to confirm the authenticity of such emails and if found to be a scam, to inform the nearest Police Station for investigations immediately.

CDB Sisudiri Scholarships adds more scholars
Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) has presented a total of 509 scholarships since 2008 to high achievers with financial difficulties who excel in Grade Five and GCE O/Level examinations.
During the last ten years, this CSR initiative by CDB, which has now invested Rs 21.7 million since the inception of this Sisudiri scholarship program, has etched a pathway for marginalized and financially disadvantaged students continue their education devoid of interruption.
This year, the number of scholarships were increased to 100 grants from the fifty presented annually for the last ten years, with sixty Grade Five scholars and forty students excelling at their O/Levels gaining financial empowerment to sustain their educational ambitions and career goals.
Reasoning that every nation must maximise on the immense potential that younger generations can contribute towards economic, social and environmental targets that are most often ambitious, CDBs MD and CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara says that it is young people who are single minded to meet the countrys vision. This is why with the right knowledge, competencies and mindset, the nation can set for itself ambitious goals and be confident enough to meet them. We can do this only if we equip our young people with these fundamentals. By financially empowering them, we are assisting them to drive their personal goals, tagging these to industry objectives and pushing productivity levels to meet national ambitions.
Selection criteria and the process remains very transparent as CDB ensures that these high achievers excel in their Grade Five and GCE O/Level examinations and come from a financially disadvantaged background. These students are encouraged to become CDB Ranketi savings accounts holders, but the scholarship is open to any student who may or may not have a CDB Rankati savings account. By encouraging these young people to consider opening a savings account that offers a high interest rate and an attractive gift scheme, we have expanded the scope of our community investment in education into inculcating a savings habit in our younger people, a trait that must be promoted and encouraged if the entire nation is to develop and prosper, says Deputy General Manager Marketing CDB Darshana Jayasinghe.

Citizens' Mail
The path to political consensus
This refers to D. Wijetungas letter appearing in Daily News of November 14. He offers reasons for former Prime Ministers failure.
President Maithripala Sirisena came to power after contesting the Presidential Elections as an independent candidate, pledging to implement Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Theras proposals. After his assumption as President his desire was to implement SLFP policies.
As the UNP had a majority, with the support of other parties, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as Prime Minister. The conflict started with implementation of UNP, SLFP policies and Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Theras proposals. Under the circumstances, the wisest move for the President was to discuss with the UNP and the SLFP and come to an understanding as to how best the government could work to mesh these pledges.
The President wanted a pure SLFP government, thus giving Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa the opportunity to form another political party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna [SLPP] which gained popularity.
With dissolution of Parliament, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa joined the SLPP as its leader and announced he would contest under the party.
