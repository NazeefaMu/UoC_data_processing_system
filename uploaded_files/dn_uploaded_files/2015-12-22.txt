Bajirao Mastani : Visual masterpiece with stellar performances
A wise man once said that the secret to attraction is locked up in our unique imperfections, flaws and frailties. Art is almost never perfect. Yet, its always beautiful and enchanting. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is an artist and Bajirao Mastani is his labour of love. Its replete with flaws, it depicts its own version of history but it does so with masterful finesse. You will rarely see a more stunning compilation of visuals in a film. The poetic images in Bajirao Mastani can leave you spellbound. The narrative though is a mixed bag. Its selling the same-old love triangle formula, but it has some fascinating progressive themes ticking under the hood.
This is the story of Peshwa Bajirao. Hes an important historical figure in India, so much so that his tales are a part of school curriculum. But this film is not just about a man and his political conquests. Rather its about that man and his longing for love. On one of his famous battle missions Bajirao encounters the beautiful Mastani. Shes the daughter of a Rajput King, but her mother is Persian. They instantly fall in love. The problem is Bajirao is a married man, not to mention hes the political leader of a Hindu sect. So when Mastani declares her love to the Peshwas family and kingdom its opposed vehemently. It strains political as well as personal relations in the war heros life. The focus here though is firm on the three central characters  Bajirao, Mastani and Bajiraos wife Kashibai.
Historical inaccuracies are the main bone of contention in Bajirao Mastani. There is also song and dance regime which doesnt lend itself to a Maratha warrior. The song Malhari in particular sticks out like a nail waiting to be hammered. But these are cinematic liberties, ones that add to the commercial allure of a film. They are jarring but theyre also seamlessly incorporated into the narrative. One of the biggest strengths Bajirao Mastani though is its dialogue. Some of the lines, especially those given to Deepika Padukones Mastani and Priyanka Chopras Kashibai are spellbinding.
In essence, the women in Bajirao Mastani are its pillars. Their characters are set in a feudal age in the 18th century when blind religious practices were rampant, yet the women display progressive thoughts and feelings. Even the main protagonist, Bajirao has been depicted as a pragmatic man. Hes shown willing to tweak societal rituals so as to honour the higher cause of compassion and love. He instructs Hindu religious leaders to accept and honour his half Muslim son. Upon their opposition, he even offers a logical hack to the system. Nonetheless, the stand out scene in the movie happens between Kashibai and Mastani. Their ice-breaking moment kicks off with unpleasant words and graceless digs. But it soon settles into an accord of respect and adulation. Two women are unhappy at the idea of sharing the same man, but they somehow reach an unspoken treaty where they accept the situation. Its a fabulous piece of writing. One that really adds a spark to Bajirao Mastani.
Out of all antagonist characters in the film, the one that stands out is Bajiraos mother Radhabai played by Tanvi Azmi. Shes the voice of the orthodox and the establishment. She refuses to accept Bajiraos and Mastanis relationship even when its become inevitable. Shes the chief troublemaker, but even her grey shades have a rooted meaning. Theres no black and white here. And that is the beauty of the characters designed by SLB.
Living up to every character are the actors. Ranveer Singh is the larger-than-life moustache twirling Maratha warrior. And he looks his part. On occasions he does take the chest thrusting, arm flailing and butt flexing swagger a bit too far, but the spot on Marathi accentuation and the energy he infuses into Bajirao are stellar.
His stand-out scenes are in the court of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj (played by Mahesh Manjrekar) and his confrontations with younger brother Chimaji (Vaibhav Tatwawdi). Deepika Padukone as the tormented lover looking for solace is on Madhubala in Mughl-E-Azam levels of tragedy.
Her portrayal of Mastani is the perfect balance of allure and misfortune. And a slew of superlatives will not be enough for Priyanka Chopra in the role of Kashibai. Shes the one with a broken heart and stoic demeanor. Shes phenomenal to say the least. Together, the trio fills the Bajirao Mastani screen with verve and subtlety. Their performances are top notch. Bajirao Mastani will also be remembered for its production design and costumes.
The level of detailing in the films visuals is awe-inspiring.
The camerawork and SLBs vision for grandeur create a mirage of excellence on screen. SLBs music is not only influential its emotional and touching. Rarely do Hindi movies look like they belong on a world stage. Bajirao Mastani is definitely a strong contender for that spot. Its definitely one of the years best.

Harrison Ford made 76 times more from Force Awakens than his co-stars
US: We all knew legendary actors Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford would be paid a bit more than newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but now we know by just how much.
According to the Mail on Sunday, Ford has reportedly been paid 16.7 million for reprising the role of Han Solo and will also get 0.5 per cent of the films gross earnings, estimated to be 1.3 billion.
Hes also already been handed 1 million in compensation after breaking his leg during shooting at Pinewood studios.
That means, in total, the Indiana Jones actor could earn 23 million, 76 times what British newcomer Daisy Ridley and John Boyega will take from the film.
Both leading stars will receive a pay check of 300,000 while also taking a cut of the box-office earnings once it inevitably makes over $1 billion (671 million).
A Disney source told the Sunday paper: Harrison is the key to making this movie work. Hes the link between the old generation and the new. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were good to get, but the film could have lived without them. You couldnt make it without Harrison Ford. Of course, it should also be noted that for the original 1977 Star Wars film, Ford was only paid 7,000 as he was a relatively unknown at the time. Daisys a virtual unknown, and this is a career-making role, so shed probably have been willing to take it for free  and Disney knew it, the insider continued.
She has been signed to a multi-picture deal with pre-set bumps in her salary that rise substantially with each movie. That doesnt guarantee shell be in subsequent films, but it gives the studio peace of mind to know shes contractually obliged if they want her again.
It was also revealed that director JJ Abrams was paid 3.3 million to direct the film and will take a two per cent share of the films gross, while Carrie Fisher  reprising her role as General Leia  was paid 1 million.

I would still pick flowers and china in White House, says Hillary Clinton
US: Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton on Saturday said that as president she would probably still pick out the dinnerware and flowers for state occasions and send her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on special missions.
When asked during a Democratic candidates debate whether it was time to change the role of the president's spouse, the former first lady suggested the roles of both primary residents of the White House might be adjusted should she win the November 2016 election.
"With respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that," said Clinton, the front-runner for her party's nomination.
"But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice," she added.
Former First Lady Hillary Clinton suggested the roles of both primary residents of the White House might be adjusted should she win theNovember 2016 election.
Hillary Clinton played a major role in helping shape policy during her husband's 1993-2001 presidency, including an attempted overhaul of the nation's healthcare system.
The "flowers and china" moment drew wide attention on social media - including criticism of the moderators for moving away from foreign and domestic policy issues to ask the question.
"They definitely wouldn't have had the gall to ask about flowers and china patterns if the leading candidate on stage was a man," tweeted. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton today slammed Donald Trump's recent comments about banning Muslim immigrants, saying the Republican frontrunner was "becoming ISIS's best recruiter".
"He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists," she said.
She said that "it was not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry."
Trump, 69, was among the top issue being debated at the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Other Republican candidates hardly figured in the debate, thus reflecting that all of them consider him as their main rival.
"I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the US and literally around the world that there is a 'clash of civilisations,' that there is some kind of Western plot or even 'war against Islam,' which then I believe fans the flames of radicalisation," she alleged.
Slamming the billionaire presidential hopeful for his anti-Muslim rhetoric including his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US, Mrs Clinton said the first line of defence against radicalisation is in Muslim-American community.
"Donald Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions," she said.
"We need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear. Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalised at the very moment when we need their help," she said.
Mrs Clinton asserted that the Muslim community needs to be befriended not demonised.
"We must work more closely with Muslim-American communities. I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalisation. They will be our early warning signal. That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing," Mrs Clinton said.

Kiriella tells plantation companies
Increase wages or hand over estate management to Govt.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday told plantation companies to either increase the wages of their workers as proposed or hand over the management of the estates, back to the government.
Speaking at the District Development Committee meeting in Kandy, the minister said if the companies cannot develop the plantations under them, earn profits and increase the wages of workers, it was feasible for them to hand over the relevant functions back to the government.
The minister said some companies were managing estates with 20,000 plus hectares in extent.
Even when plantations were managed by the British, it was only about 5,000 hectares in extent each. Now, it is 20,000 hectares, he added.
These companies should hand the plantations over if they cannot increase the wages in line with the government policy, he said.The government through the recent budget proposed to increase the daily wages of the plantation workers.

The Tourist
JOLIE AND DEPP create magic!
It is oblivious that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's 'The Tourist' worked mainly because of the two big names behind the production rather than a strong storyline. The movie stars two of the biggest crowd-pullers in Hollywood: Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, and would have been a sure winner had it not been for the lack of logic and enthusiasm in the tale.
'The Tourist' opens to mysterious circumstances. Elise, an English woman who is closely watched by thugs and cops to entrap her embezzler boyfriend, Alexander Pearce, is on her way from Paris to Venice for a reunion. On the way she seduces a stranger on the train and shares an unusual conversation with him over dinner. Dinner and drinks lead to complications like a hail of bullets and boat chasing scenes across the lagoon. Frank Tupelo, an American math teacher, is made to impersonate Pearce to fool the cops but ends up being hunted by vicious gangster Reginald Shaw and his goons.
The movie is also designed in a manner so that it unnecessarily flaunts Angelina Jolie's looks. From the moment she takes to the street, stuttering around like a model in gorgeous outfits with a smug smile plastered on her face, she reminds us of a haughty princess looking down upon lesser mortals. She practically glows with self-love but despite being a feast for the eyes, this fact does not make her character likable. Elise seems to be more of an immortal than a flesh and blood woman.
This is in contrast to the character Jolie played in Salt.
Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie
Though you would expect violence to be at the fore in an action thriller, 'The Tourist' wins brownie points for camouflaging this aspect. It is sans bloodshed and even the most tense scenes seem to be interrupted by unexpected comic episodes. One fine example of this is in how the detectives watching the screen realize that the figure clinging to the walls is actually the man whom they had handcuffed behind them!
Aerial shots of Italy heighten the beauty of the background where the action takes place. Yet Von Donnersmarck does not dwell on this feature on the long run. At times it is even underplayed so that you almost wonder why the team wished to shoot a bulk of the movies in Venice but not make ample use of its mystic surroundings.
The chemistry is surprisingly lacking between the star couple and both seem to be a bit uptight with each other. Depp still seems lost in his legendary Captain Jack Sparrow role and resembles just that when he sprints across the rooftops in his pajamas.
Though he rarely fails to disappoint, his performance this time round does not come effortlessly as the world's least likely math teacher.
Being a brilliant character actor, the meek and mild portrait of the math teacher does not sit well on him till the twist of events sheds new light on his role.
The plot is clearly influenced by the 2005 French film 'Anthony Zimmer', in which an ordinary man is drawn into extraordinary circumstances.Von Donnersmarck seems to have lost out on the opportunity of making a movie of a lifetime with the seductive screen pairing of two of Hollywood's top names by dallying in clichs and a plot that had been used on screen over and over for more than a decade.

Notes on a steadfast LOVE
The Notebook" cuts between the same couple at two seasons in their lives. We see them in the urgency of young romance, and then we see them as old people, she disappearing into the shadows of Alzheimer's, he steadfast in his love. It is his custom every day to read to her from a notebook that tells the story of how they met and fell in love and faced obstacles to their happiness. Sometimes, he says, if only for a few minutes, the clouds part and she is able to remember who he is and who the story is about.
We all wish Alzheimer's could permit such moments. For a time, in the earlier stages of the disease, it does. But when the curtain comes down, there is never another act and the play is over. "The Notebook" is a sentimental fantasy, but such fantasies are not harmful; we tell ourselves stories every day, to make life more bearable. The reason we cried during "Terms of Endearment" was not because the mother was dying, but because she was given the opportunity for a dignified and lucid parting with her children. In life it is more likely to be pain, drugs, regret and despair.
The lovers are named Allie Nelson and Noah Calhoun, known as Duke. As old people they're played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner. As young people, by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. The performances are suited to the material, respecting the passion at the beginning and the sentiment at the end, but not pushing too hard; there is even a time when young Noah tells Allie, "I don't see how it's gonna work," and means it, and a time when Allie gets engaged to another man.
She's a rich kid, summering at the family's mansion in North Carolina. He's a local kid who works at the sawmill but is smart and poetic. Her parents are snobs. His father (Sam Shepard) is centered and supportive. Noah loves her the moment he sees her, and actually hangs by his hands from a bar on a Ferris wheel until she agrees to go out with him. Her parents are direct: "He's trash. He's not for you." One day her mother (Joan Allen) shows her a local working man, who looks hard-used by life, and tells Allie that 25 years ago she was in love with him. Allie thinks her parents do not love each other, but her mother insists they do; still, Allen is such a precise actress that she is able to introduce the quietest note of regret into the scene.
The movie is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, whose books inspired "Message in a Bottle" (1999), unloved by me, and "A Walk to Remember" (2002), which was so sweet and positive it persuaded me (as did Mandy Moore as its star). Now here is a story that could have been a tearjerker, but -- no, wait, it is a tearjerker, it's just that it's a good one.
The director is Nick Cassavetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, and perhaps his instinctive feeling for his mother helped him find the way past soap opera in the direction of truth. Ryan Gosling has already been identified as one of the best actors of his generation, although usually in more hard-edged material. Rachel McAdams, who just a few months ago was the bitchy high school queen in "Mean Girls," here shows such beauty and clarity that we realize once again how actors are blessed by good material. As for Gena Rowlands and James Garner: They are completely at ease in their roles, never striving for effect, never wanting us to be sure we get the message. Garner is an actor so confident and sure that he makes the difficult look easy, and loses credit for his skill. Consider how simply and sincerely he tells their children: "Look, guys, that's my sweetheart in there." Rowlands, best-known for high-strung, even manic characters, especially in films by her late husband, here finds a quiet vulnerability that is luminous.
The photography by Robert Fraisse is striking in its rich, saturated effects, from sea birds at sunset to a dilapidated mansion by candlelight to the texture of Southern summer streets. It makes the story seem more idealized; certainly the retirement home at the end seems more of heaven than of earth.
And the old mansion is underlined, too, first in its decay and then in its rebirth; young Noah is convinced that if he makes good on his promise to rebuild it for Allie, she will come to live in it with him, and paint in the studio he has made for her. ("Noah had gone a little mad," the notebook says.) That she is engaged to marry another shakes him but doesn't discourage him.
We have recently read much about Alzheimer's because of the death of Ronald Reagan. His daughter Patti Davis reported that just before he died, the former president opened his eyes and gazed steadily into those of Nancy, and there was no doubt that he recognized her.
Well, it's nice to think so. Nice to believe the window can open once more before closing forever.

PARIS ATTACKS suspect got past three police checks
FRANCE: Wanted fugitive Salah Abdeslam, suspected of involvement in last month's Paris attacks, got past three police checks in France as he fled to Belgium just hours after the terror assaults, a source close to the Belgian investigation said Sunday.
Confirming a report in the French daily Le Parisien, the source quoted Hamza Attou, suspected along with Mohammed Amri of driving Abdeslam to Brussels the day after the coordinated November 13 attacks in which 130 people died.
At the first checkpoint Attou and Amri admitted to police that they had just smoked marijuana, but were let go, the source said.
All three are from the gritty Brussels suburb of Molenbeek.
The news came as Belgian police on Sunday arrested two people in connection with the probe into the Paris attacks following a raid in Brussels.
Abdeslam sent a text message asking Attou and Amri to come for him, and they found him "agitated... uneasy... unwell", the source said.
Then came a threat: "He told us to take him back to Brussels or he would blow up the car," Attou said, according to the source.
To underscore the threat, Abdeslam bragged about killing people with a Kalashnikov, adding that his brother Brahim had blown himself up.
Seven attackers blew themselves up or were killed by police in the course of the evening on November 13. Five of them have been identified.
To avoid police checks, Abdeslam asked Attou and Amri to take minor roads, but they got lost and wound up on a motorway, Attou said.
At the first checkpoint they were asked if they had "consumed" any substances.
Abdeslam was in the back seat and said nothing, while Amri and Attou replied "yes" because they had just smoked marijuana.
"The policeman said that was not good, but it was not the priority today," Attou said, according to the source.
They were not asked for their papers, but they were at the second and third police checkpoints.
At the third stop, near Cambrai in the far north of France, Abdeslam even gave his address in Molenbeek.
They stopped for petrol and Abdeslam went to the toilet, walking back with his jacket open, revealing that he was not carrying the explosives which Attou and Amri had been led to believe he had on him, the source told AFP.
Abdeslam had told them he left his brother's ID card in a car -- he did not say which car -- "so that he would be known the world over like Coulibaly".
He was referring to Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman in Paris on January 8 as part of the series of attacks that began with the massacre at the offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.
The following day Coulibaly took hostages at a kosher supermarket, killing four before being gunned down in a police operation.
The three days of horror in January left 17 people dead.
The investigation into the November gun and suicide attacks, claimed by the Islamic State group, is being conducted in both France and Belgium, the home country of several of the attackers.
A French source close to the investigation confirmed Le Parisien's report that one of the attackers at the Bataclan concert hall where 90 people were massacred sent a text message to a Belgian number saying "It's on, we've started".
Two men are in detention in France on suspicion of providing lodging to the presumed mastermind of the attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Abaaoud was killed in a police raid a few days after the attacks.
In Belgium, eight men have been jailed including four accused of helping Abdeslam get away in the hours after the attacks.
Belgian police on Sunday searched a home in the centre of Brussels and made two arrests in connection with the probe, federal prosecutors said.
Special forces and federal police were involved in the raid, which lasted around five hours and took place close to the city's popular tourist centre.
Suspected accomplices have also been arrested in Austria.
Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French national, remains at large.

In rapidly ageing Japan, dying is big business
JAPAN: In Japan, death is an opportunity for growth. Business growth, that is.
In a country with many more deaths than births each year, Japanese companies are looking to maximize the amount of money people spend on shuffling off their mortal coil, from preparing ending notes and choosing coffins to arranging to have their ashes blasted into space or turned into diamonds.
I want to promote our products because we have almost 1.2 million people dying each year but we sell only 60,000 of these mats, said Koichi Fujita, a representative of a company selling tatami liners and pillows for coffins. He was using slightly outdated death figures: Japan said goodbye to 1.3 million citizens last year but hello to only 1 million new babies.
Fujita's was one of the scores of companies touting their wares at Endex, an expo devoted to planning for the end of one's life, held at a huge exhibition centre in Tokyo.
A range of photo-illustrated coffins is on display in Tokyo at Endex, an expo devoted toplanning for the end of life -- and getting people to spend plenty on their preparations.
Japanese people spend their lives on tatami mats, Fujita said, referring to the straw flooring in traditional Japanese rooms. And there's a saying that they want to die on a tatami mat, meaning die at home. But so many people die in the hospital, so at least they can have a tatami mat in their coffin when they are sent off.
Japan has the fastest-aging population in the world. Slightly more than one-quarter of the population is 65 or older, and the health ministry forecasts that the proportion will hit 40 percent by 2060.
Many aspects of Japanese life are now geared toward senior citizens. Go into any drugstore and you will find shelves of diapers and sippy cups - for the elderly. Banks and post offices have reading glasses on the counters for customers with failing eyesight, while big pedestrian crossings have buttons to push for those who need extra time to get across the road.
Panasonic has a line of easier-to-use household appliances - including washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers - targeted at the elderly, while convenience stores sell packaged food in smaller portions for seniors. But the business of actually dying is a whole other opportunity. There is even a term for it here: shukatsu, or preparing for death. It is a play on a more common homophone for job-hunting. The government estimates that in 2038, 1.68 million people will die, said Midori Kotani, a social scientist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, part of a major insurance company. Because there are so many more people dying, people see business opportunities there.
At the first Endex, or Life Ending Industry Expo, more than 200 companies were trying to get a bigger chunk of the industry, which the expo's organizing committee said was now valued at a whopping $41 billion.
There were the usual coffins and tombstones, plus the latest-model hearses. But there were also Buddhist monks touting for business - people are not keeping up with the annual rituals these days - and coffee retailers hoping to sell their products as gifts for funeral attendees, which is a custom here.

Splintered Spanish vote heralds arduous coalition talks
SPAIN: A historically fragmented vote in Spanish elections on Sunday heralded weeks of talks to form a coalition government, with neither Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservatives nor left-wing parties winning a clear mandate to govern.
Despite garnering the most votes, the center-right People's Party (PP) had its worst result ever in a general election as Spaniards angered by high-level corruption cases and soaring unemployment turned away from the party in droves.
The outcome was reminiscent of a similar situation in neighbouring Portugal, where the incumbent conservatives won an October election but a socialist government backed by far left parties was ultimately sworn in.
An unexpected surge from upstart anti-austerity party Podemos, which now partly holds the key to power, is the latest example of rising populist forces in Europe at the expense of mainstream center-right and center-left parties.
In Spain, the fragmented vote heralded a new era of pact-making, shattering a two-party system that has dominated Spain since the 1970s and casting a pall over an economic reform programme that has helped pull the country out of recession.
We're starting a period that will not be easy, Rajoy told cheering supporters from the balcony of the party headquarters in central Madrid. It will be necessary to reach pacts and agreements and I will try to do this.
However, the likelihood of a PP-led coalition faded with the robust showing of Podemos who roared into third place, outpacing fellow newcomer Ciudadanos whose market-friendly policies had been seen as a natural fit for the PP.
A tie-up between the PP and Ciudadanos would yield 163 seats, far short of the 176 needed for a majority administration.
The strong results of Podemos tipped the balance to the left of the political spectrum with five left-wing parties led by the opposition Socialists and Podemos together winning 172 seats.
Such a left-wing alliance will be hard to form, however, as groups differ on economic policy and the degree of autonomy that should be awarded to the wealthy northeastern region Catalonia, home to an entrenched independence movement. This result confirms Spain has entered an era of political fragmentation, said Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso. The key question is whether there will be a coalition of parties against Rajoy.

Taliban treated alongside angry soldiers in Afghan hospital
AFGHANISTAN: The injured Taliban fighter stands shackled, with his face covered by a ski mask and wearing a helmet to block out noise so that, for security reasons, he cannot tell where he is.
The insurgent was wounded while battling the Afghan army and is now flanked by soldiers throughout his medical treatment at the nations largest military hospital.
He is cared for alongside the very men whose comrades he once faced in battle, and the troops are furious about the arrangement at Kabuls Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan hospital.
We are treated in the same place, its very strange but there is nothing I can do, says Mohammed, a soldier with a bullet wound to the leg who is just two rooms away from his enemy.
Senior people make these decisions for us. Its appalling, he added. The Taliban have no dignity... they dont have enough courage to be soldiers so they destroy our country and kill.
The policy to treat Taliban fighters who have waged a decade-long insurgency in Afghanistan is a sore point at a time when casualties among security forces are soaring.
More than 4,000 Afghan soldiers and police were killed and over 8,000 wounded in the first half of the year, compared to 5,000 who lost their lives in the whole of 2014, and the loss of life continues.
The issue was brought sharply into the spotlight in October, when 30 people were killed in a US air strike on a hospital run by French charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the northern city of Kunduz.
Afghan authorities have long criticised the charity for treating Taliban fighters as well as soldiers inside its walls.
The US military put the bombing down to human error, while MSF has branded it a war crime and demanded an independent probe into the strike.
With some 400 beds, the Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan facility is the jewel in the crown of the Afghan health service and it receives dozens of soldiers every day who have been wounded fighting the Taliban, as well as insurgents.
Where does it hurt one doctor asks the wounded militant, a prisoner at the military jail in Bagram, north of Kabul.
Here and there, replies the man, pointing to his chest. A senior hospital official said he has only been brought to the hospital for a few hours, the time it takes for a consultation.
Kabul has played down the thorny subject, only quietly admitting that Taliban fighters are indeed treated.
Its true, but we dont talk publicly about it, said a government source on condition of anonymity.
The American head of the NATO mission in Afghanistan declined to speak about the practice, despite repeated requests for comment by AFP. That US funds could be paying to treat Taliban fighters is potentially embarrassing for Washington, which spent at least $185 million on Afghanistans military health system between 2002 and 2011. Officials at the hospital say they are abiding by laws enshrined in the Geneva conventions, which says those involved in conflict should not be left without medical treatment regardless of race, political opinion, religion or gender.
We respect international law and we want that, when the Taliban are released, they tell the other fighters that we acted like good Muslims, said a senior hospital official who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivities surrounding the issue.
The more violent the fighting, the more patients we receive, said hospital doctor Nasruddin Amin.
But that care has not yet extended to Islamic State fighters, who control swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq under their own brutal interpretation of Sharia law and have been gaining ground in Afghanistan.
For now, the official said there are no Islamic State fighters in the Mohammed Daoud Khan military hospital. But, when the time comes, Dr Amin said he would treat them like any other who enters his care.
I am a doctor, I am not a state prosecutor, he said.
