Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha speaking about the Parliament debate on the bond issue said it is good if the debate is scheduled before February 7.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, he said the Elections Commission has also raised concerns as the special Parliament session falls during the period of silence. The minister agreed that it can have an impact on the elections and added that it is a matter of electoral sensitivity.
"It is good to have a Parliament debate on it. But then, people are now well aware of what happened, he said. Minister Premajayantha further said President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Commission to probe the bond issue but the UNP is speaking of it as if it was their plan and added that the UNP is trying to take credits for it.

Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA credit  positive for both sovereigns
Last Tuesday, Singapore (Aaa stable) and Sri Lanka (B1 negative) signed a free trade agreement.
Although the countries have not yet publicized the full details of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), Moodys Credit Outlook expects that the pact will enhance the cross-border trade of goods and services and promote foreign direct investment (FDI) between the two countries, a credit positive for both.
The SLSFTA will have a larger effect on Sri Lankas credit quality because the potential increase in current account inflows and inward investments would help reduce its elevated external vulnerability. The SLSFTA liberalizes bilateral trade in goods. Sri Lanka will eliminate tariffs on 80% of products over 15 years. Singapores Ministry of Trade and Industry estimates that the agreement will result in approximately SGD10 million in annual tariff savings.
Because Singapore does not impose import duties on 99% of tariff lines, the agreements trade benefits for Sri Lanka will materialize through the opening of access to the broader Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market and other large economies given Singapores existing preferential trade arrangements with Australia, Japan, Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia.
In 2017, Sri Lanka was Singapores 37th-largest trading partner, while Singapore was Sri Lankas eighth-largest trading partner; total bilateral trade amounted to about 0.5% of Singapores GDP and 2.5% of Sri Lankas GDP. We expect that the SLSFTA will support growth in bilateral trade.
The extent to which the SLSFTA reduces Sri Lankas external vulnerability will depend on its effectiveness at bolstering services and investment flows.
Sri Lankas current account has a structural deficit because a large merchandise trade deficit more than offsets a surplus in services and remittance inflows.
Moreover, FDI inflows only partially finance the current account shortfall, resulting in a persistent basic balance (FDI inflows plus current account balance) deficit.
The SLSFTA is likely to boost Sri Lankas services receipts, particularly in tourism. Using travel and passenger transport by air as a proxy, tourism accounts for about three-quarters of the services surplus. Although Singapore comprised less than 1% of Sri Lankas total tourist arrivals in 2017, the SLSFTA may allow Sri Lanka to leverage Singapores transportation hub to attract more tourists. Additionally, there are provisions on the cross-border transfers of information by electronic means and data flows, which could aid Sri Lankas burgeoning IT services sector.
The agreement also will promote direct investment in Sri Lanka by Singaporean companies.
According to the Sri Lankan government, FDI from Singapore totaled $658 million (less than 1% of GDP) during 2006-17 in sectors such as food manufacturing and real estate.
By easing regulation in the services sector, the SLSFTA will broaden the scope of investment to other areas such as infrastructure, logistics, education and healthcare.
The agreement also protects against expropriation, improves transparency through safeguards against discriminatory treatment and provides for a dispute resolution mechanism, all of which create a better investment climate to attract FDI.
The free trade agreement continues Sri Lankas move toward greater openness of trade and investment. In particular, as part of its International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility program structural reform objectives, the government is reviewing its trade regime to boost trade and private-sector development, focusing on reducing costs and bolstering competitiveness through reform of para-tariffs and other nontariff barriers that have hampered exports. As part of this effort, Sri Lanka also has started negotiations on other free trade agreements, including with China.
The SLSFTA is Singapores 21st trade agreement with 32 trading partners, and reiterates Singapores commitment to free and open markets. Particularly within the region, the agreement promotes the growth of outward Singaporean investment, helps maintain its strong positive net international investment position (224% of 2016 GDP), and solidifies its strength as a hub for global trade, finance, and logistics.

The sole intention of the women who contest the forthcoming local government elections is to create a free and just society without corruption and malpractice.
The Minister said Tissamaharama electorate is one of the fastest developing areas under his leadership.

Miami: Fernando Alonso believes he has gained vital experience for a future crack at the Le Mans 24 Hours after finishing 38th in the Daytona endurance race on Sunday.
The Spanish former Formula One world champions campaign in Florida was derailed by mechanical problems that included two brake failures in his United Autosports Ligier JS P217.
The 36-year-old admitted however he had been unnerved by the experience.
Youre scared a little bit, no doubt, Alonso said. It happened two times in the first corner - youre right there at 300-310 kilometres an hour then you hit the brakes and theres no brakes.
At night, you dont see clearly the tire wall or the escape road, so there was even a little more of a scare.
The McLaren driver took to the track in Florida this weekend to gain experience for racing Le Mans.
Alonso has spoken of his desire to take a crack at the Triple Crown of motor-racing - winning the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix, the Indianapolis 500 and Le Mans. AFP

Premnath Moraes
Versatile man, gentle dad
Film, music, journalistic and sports personality Premnath Moraes would have celebrated his 95th birth anniversary on January 31. We reproduce an article from the 150th year commemorative publication of St. Benedict College.
Singer, songwriter, lyricist.
Actor, film director, scriptwriter, producer.
Weightlifter, wrestler, footballer, cricketer, athlete, gymnast
journalist, sports editor, creative head and copywriter.
Commentator and silver-tongued orator,
Believe me, the list goes on.
Renaissance man Bohemian artist Yes to both, but to me, most importantly, the gentlest human being one could hope to meet, and the most loving father my sister Rehani or I could ever have hoped to have. Premnath Joseph Moraes  born Joseph Peter Moraes Fernando on January 31, 1923, was of solid middle class stock, who carried his simple and devout Catholic faith right through life.
In many ways he epitomized the essence of the very best of the Benedictine trademark, with traits and talents that wove a rich tapestry of arts, sports, humanity, simplicity and a Christianity that was lived rather than preached. Joining the Police force soon after school, he was seconded to the CID and later advised to leave by a senior Police Officer after having spoken openly at the funeral of a colleague who had been gunned down when leading an unarmed raid on a den of vice.
Thereafter he secured a position as a reporter with the Times of Ceylon after an interview with its Editor, Frank Moraes (father of the poet Dom), who reminded him that the coincidence of our surnames will remain just that!
Leaving the Times of Ceylon building, Premnath was almost knocked down by a vehicle driven by his friend Sangare Sellamuttu (later Mayor of Colombo) with whom he then got chatting and informed him of the job he had just landed. What nonsense, said Sellamuttu. With your looks you should be in films. Let me introduce you to Sir Chittampalam Gardiner.Sir Chittampalam (also an old Ben) was too busy to see my father that day and instead told him meet me in Madras on Monday morning (this was Friday) leaving the young applicant to fend for his fare  perhaps a test of mettle.
Young Premnath (a name he then assumed) was signed on as an actor and thus started a romance with the film industry which lasted over 50 years (from 1947 to 1998, from starring in Kadawanu Poronduwa (also known as 'Broken Promise') the second Sinhala film to be produced, to 'Demodara Palama', circa 1997. 'Warada Kageda' and 'Kapati Arakshakaya' in the late '40s were followed by several others. This was followed by a stint at Shanthiniketan, the centre of arts north of Calcutta. On his return to Ceylon, Premnath took up singing, was contracted to the HMV label (His Masters Voice), recorded solo as well as with Latha (Walpola) and Chitra (Somapala). Of the many recordings, perhaps the most famed are 'Sri Lanka Rani Meniye' (the de facto Catholic anthem of Sri Lanka) and 'Lak Deepe'.
On to 1953. Production Assistant (titles were not grandiose in those days) and second unit director for 'Elephant Walk', directed by William De Telle, son-in-law of the legendary Cecil B. De Mille.
Two short stints as second unit director for United Artists' 'Captains Table' and 'Purple Plains' which starred Gregory Peck, on to India where he was Production Manager at Gemini Studios in Madras, where most of the Sinhala Films at the time were edited, dubbed and produced.
Wide, varied and versatile though was my fathers exposure to the celluloid world, in my opinion his single-most significant contribution to the Sinhala cinema was his unremitting efforts to get Gamini Fonseka into it, culminating in a successful introduction to Lester James Peiris, who brought Gamini into 'Rekawa' in a non-starring role. The rest  to use a clich  is history!
Now onto that integral part of Premnaths being that merited his inclusion in this journal, Premnath Moraes the Benedictine. He was very active in both sports and the arts, representing St. Benedicts at cricket, soccer and athletics. Involved in film and music and living in Kotahena, there came to be formed at my fathers home, a sports club, circa 1948  euphemistically referred to as the MCC. This humble grouping of kindred and sporting spirits at the MCC was the beginnings and foundation of the Old Bens Sports Club which was formally inaugurated in 1958.
My Father was the first Gen. Secretary of the Old Bens Sports. Premnath worked tirelessly to support and build the fledgling club and is credited with the initiation of the still vibrant Quadrangular Cricket Tournament. History has been kind to him in that his love for the school and his commitment and contribution towards it are still remembered. Journalism next and the nom de plume SEAROM (MORAES in reverse), is still remembered. His turn of phrase was fluent, lyrical and polished, and the rapier wit and thrust invariably found its mark in his - relished by many, dreaded by some column - Petals and Pellets.
What about Premnath the man Impish in humour, gullible, ever willing to help, and never holding a grudge or remembering an injustice. I am a rare animal  a fourth generation Benedictine, yet in College and all College-related for a, I have no individual identity, I am still simply referred to as Premnaths son and for that I am ever so proud!

Art for every wall
Sulochana Vajirakantha is a state award winning artist who has a passion towards reproducing twwemple paintings. A graduate from the University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo, Sulochana currently works as the teacher of Arts at the Ibbagamuwa Central School in her hometown and mentors her students on becoming creative and innovative artistes.
With the ambition of taking the art of Sri Lankan temple paintings to the world, Sulochana works on experimentation and innovation.
Why did you pursue Sri Lankan temple painting techniques
That is my passion. I loved to look at temple paintings from my early childhood. Paintings drawn on the walls of ancient temples fascinated me. As a child I tried to reproduce them. My parents, elders and teachers appreciated my work and encouraged me to master this art.
My reproductions of temple paintings won accolades and awards in competitions and I was motivated to indulge more on the subject.
I learnt the finer points in reproducing traditional paintings while I was at university.
You won the state award in the temple paintings category in 2007.
Winning the state award was an encouragement to me. It enhanced my reputation as a credible artist.
I would prefer if artistes of my caliber are offered the opportunity to hold exhibitions in other countries too. Temple paintings in Sri Lanka are unique to our country and we should take it to the macro level. I respect the late maestro Majusri who did yeomen service to conserve ancient Sri Lankan traditional paintings depicting Jataka stories.
As a school teacher how do you groom your students to become fine artists
I am determined to provide them with sound guidance. Art is a vast subject and as teachers we cannot restrict our students on their creativity.
Creativity sheds light on them becoming sensible individuals. In addition to Art I teach them about our history, heritage, values, attitudes and appreciation of art and also about the society as a whole and Marketing. They must be provided with this exposure and knowledge to create new things.
I teach them to think out-of-the-box because thats what I do.
Some people representing themselves as artists copy, cut and paste others works to earn a quick buck.
Ethics play a vital role here. It is alright to study methods used by others but one should find his/her unique way of creation.
I am working on finding my own way of producing temple paintings.
Once your work is accepted by the world, finances will fall in line.
You are doing in fabric painting too.
Yes. Once I did fabric painting on a Saree and wore it myself. Surprisingly my peers liked that design and began to place orders with me for more designs. Then it looked like a lucrative avenue for me.
Recently the SLRC Nuga Sevana program featured me as a Saree designer. Fabric painting has become my second profession now.
What are your other talents
Any artiste has diverse talents. I can sing and I worked as a draftswoman some time back.
However we must position ourselves in the society by doing the most passionate thing we could do.
I want to position myself as an innovative temple painting artist.
I look forward to keep this distinctive style of art on a global platform.

Ban on Glyphosate, use of MCPA weedicide affects Tea Industry
The ban of imports and usage of the Glyphosate weedicide has affected the Sri Lankan tea plantations and exports particularly to Japan, which is a major market for tea.
Glyphosate is a weedicide that was widely used by most tea plantations for the control of undergrowth weeds, in order to ensure that fertilizing and harvesting was carried out successfully.
With the ban on imports and usage of Glyphosate, undergrowth and weeds have grown beyond any control making it dangerous to walk through the tea bushes in plantations due to the breeding of poisonous reptiles and other insects.
Japan being a major importer of quality Ceylon Tea for many decades accepted the residue levels of Glyphosate at reasonable levels. Japan being a very health conscious country has placed the acceptable residue level of Glyphosate in made tea at 0.15ppm. These have been arrived at after extensive research and testing by the Japanese health authorities.
In the absence of Glyphosate weedicide, the tea plantations are using another weedicide, namely MCPA - 2-Methyl-4-Chloro Phenoxyacetic Acid.
This weedicide is far more harmful to human health with the Japanese authorities having placed the acceptable residue levels of MCPA in made black tea at 0.01ppm.
Most of the teas produced in Sri Lanka, except for a few plantations, produce teas which have MCPA residue levels far in excess of the limits placed by Japan.
In fact, majority of our teas produced do not meet the maximum residue levels (MRL) for MCPA by European countries which is at 0.05ppm.
The short sighted decision made by the authorities in banning Glyphosate weedicide in Sri Lanka will result in the loss of another major market for Ceylon Tea in Japan.
Tea exporters who have invested large sums of funds in the promotion of Ceylon Tea in Japan, are now helpless and cannot export the tea, unless authorities take immediate and long-term solutions to this national crisis.
The Tea Industry in Sri Lanka employs over a 1 million citizens directly and indirectly.
The loss of a premiere market like Japan will not only affect the tea producers and exporters but also have far reaching repercussions on support industries such as Packaging and printing industry, sea freight and air freight (transportation industry) and many others.
The authorities must also understand the long term effects, Sri Lanka will face in such a situation and if immediate action is not taken, the country will lose another opportunity of gaining much needed foreign exchange to the country.

Oh, its nothing! said the Indian leader with the white beard hastily, trying to hide the bulge on the carpet.
Yes, I can see it! agreed the Malaysian head, I can see little children in a school bus being threatened by hooligans!
Just look at that beautiful float of Unity in the midst of Diversity! said white beard trying to get the other leaders from looking too closely at the carpet.
Whats that asked the President of Laos.
Thats our Rajput Regiment! said the pleased Indian boss.
No that! shouted the same leader from Laos, not interested in the Rajput soldiers but looking closely below at the carpet, It looks like state governments encouraging rioters to break laws to stop a film being screened!
And that! whispered the leader from Vietnam. Theres blood from underneath seeping onto the carpet. Its the blood of a woman journalist I see dead!
Lets concentrate on the pageants and parade! said the Indian Prime Minister a tad sharply, Ive spent millions putting all this together.
I can hear the motorbike killers fleeing! Where they caught asked the President of Vietnam.
I dont know and I dont care! said the leader with the white beard, My parade is more important than all thats happening beneath the red carpet!
Oh my god, theres a mob lynching a man for eating beef! screamed the President of the Philippines, stopping and peering hard at the carpet, Why dont you stop him sir!
The Indian leader with the white beard cursed the decorators who had not laid a thicker carpet. The tanks rumbled, the soldiers marched, the fighter planes flew impressively in formation above but the Guests of Honour and slowly the rest of the world only saw communal killings, mob attacks, journalist murders, fake news circulated, all beneath the red carpet.
The man with the white beard growled, turned to the world and pointed to the impressive display he was putting up, Look! he screamed, Look at our might! Look at what I have done!
We are looking! shouted the world, We are looking and we are shocked! What use your guns, missiles, soldiers and military might when you cant protect your own people What use of pretty cultural floats when you cant protect the women once they step off
The tanks rumbled, the military boots echoed, the planes broke the sound barrier, but the world stared with horrified silence at what was happening beneath the red carpet..!

Bond, PRECIFAC offenders will be tried
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday informed those who were present at the Party Leaders Meeting convened by the President that he would go ahead in filing cases against the offenders revealed in the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report. A special Party Leaders Meeting was summoned by President Maithripala Sirisena to brief on the follow up action with regard to the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report and respond to the claims on missing pages of the copies sent to Parliament.
However, both the Joint Opposition and the JVP did not take part in the meeting.
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena had informed the Secretary to the President that they were unable to participate in the meeting.
Former MP and Communist Party General Secretary D.E.W. Gunasekara, who took part in the meeting, said Secretary to the President Austin Fernando showed the original report signed by the Bond Commission members to the Party Leaders while explaining that the same was sent to Parliament.
The Secretary pointed out that there were many annexures to the report. He said the Commission has recommended that certain information should be kept confidential until cases are filed against the relevant parties as they should not get into the hands of accused, Gunasekara said. He said a general discussion ensued thereafter and the AG gave a brief account of the steps taken by his Department with regards to the reports. The head of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had emphasised the need for new Amendments to the Bribery Commission Act.
He pointed out the Act has not been updated since 1994 and Sri Lanka could be the only country where the anti-graft legislation has not been brought up-to-date, added Gunasekara.
Asked on the Parliamentary debate on the two reports, the former MP said nothing on the topic was discussed as it has to be decided collectively by the Party Leaders. The Head of CID and several lawyers too attended the meeting. State Ministers Eran Wickramaratne took part representing the UNP, while Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Deputy Minsiter Karunarathna Paranavithana, representatives from Ceylon Workers Congress, EPDP and Democratic Left Front were also present. The meeting extended for about one hour.

Corruption case: Revision petition filed by Keheliya dismissed
A revision petition filed by former Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others challenging Magistrates Court decision to proceed with a corruption case was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo High Court.

Slow pitches produce dreary ODI cricket in tri-series
Drought ends for Sri Lanka in Bangladesh
It would have come like a great relief to Sri Lanka Cricket, its cricketers and cricket fans in the country when Sri Lanka finally broke the string of defeats they had undergone for the past 13 months to win the one-day tri-nation series hosted by Bangladesh.
The team didnt commence the tournament well losing the opening two matches to Zimbabwe and to Bangladesh before regrouping to reel off three consecutive wins that included victory in the final against Bangladesh.
No doubt Bangladesh were the favourites at the start of the tournament having home advantage and also their track record at home in the last two years being imposing  13 wins out of 18 ODIs.
The manner in which Bangladesh started suggested they meant business and were keen to win their first-ever tri-nation title at home. Sri Lanka on the other hand had lost so often and reached the bottom of the pit that the only way for them was up.
Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal leading run scorer
This they did in style as they beat Zimbabwe in the return game and then accounted for Bangladesh twice in back to back contests to eventually win the tournament and break the curse that had been haunting them for the past one year or so.
The win meant a lot to the players and the supporting staff who have been working their butts off trying to turn the mounting losses into wins but with little success.
To some extent Bangladesh were somewhat unlucky that their super-star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan suffered a finger injury while fielding and could not bat when his team was chasing 222 to win in the final. Bangladesh were eventually bowled out for 142 in the 42nd over to hand to Sri Lanka a 79-run win.
There wasnt any outstanding batting performances because except for the first three matches of the tournament the rest of the pitches prepared were very much on the slower side and more bowler oriented making life difficult for the batsmen. The average run rate achieved for the tournament by the three teams was 4.28 runs per over  hardly a figure to arouse excitement when scoring 300 plus in an innings in todays context is the common norm.
By preparing such pitches the host country only deprived their spectators from witnessing a good contest between bat and ball. One-day cricket is all about batting and hitting boundaries and sixes but the pitches didnt encourage that sort of contest and for most part of the innings the batsmen struggled to get the ball off the square.
The scores in the second half of the tournament i.e. the last four matches give a clear indication of the battle the batsmen had with the pitch - the highest total achieved was 221 by Sri Lanka in the final.
Perhaps the pitches were prepared to favour the home side, but if that was the case it certainly backfired on them for Sri Lanka out thought Bangladesh to pull off a heist with the help of course from their new coach Chandika Hathurusingha who had been the brains behind Bangladeshs rise to fame in cricket over the past three years.
Playing 22-year-old rookie fast bowler Shehan Madushanka in a match as big as the final was a master stroke by Hathurusingha who has identified the potential of this cricketer and is targeting him for the 2019 World Cup in England. Madushanka didnt disappoint but covered himself with glory by becoming only the fourth bowler in ODI history to perform the hat-trick on debut.
Sri Lankas success was not attributed to just one player but it was an excellent team effort. However the stand out player from Sri Lankas view point was Thisara Perera who was named Player of the Series for his 134 runs and 11 wickets in the tournament.
An outstandingly talented cricketer with bat and ball Perera has failed to fulfill that rare talent of his consistently on the international stage and has been in and out of the national team. However in this tournament he seems to have sorted out his shortcomings and proved a match winner for his team with his powerful hitting and fast-medium bowling which he has improved vastly to turn out to be a match-winner for his side. Perera named Man of the Series gave credit to fast bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake for his improvement as a wicket-taking bowler.
Pereras 11 wickets were the most taken by any bowler in the series.
Tamim Iqbal the Bangladesh opener stood head and shoulders above the rest of the batting being the only batsman to top 200 runs and score three half-centuries. All-rounder Sikander Raza was Zimbabwes leading run scorer with 181 runs while for Sri Lanka Upul Tharanga and Dinesh Chandimal scored 140 plus apiece.
The state of the pitches prepared didnt allow a batsman to get into three-figures the highest effort coming from Tamim who twice reached 84 against Zimbabwe as well as Sri Lanka.
On the bowling front Bangladesh had four bowlers capturing five wickets or more, the best effort coming from pacer Rubel Hossain and Shakib Al Hasan with nine wickets apiece.
Although Zimbabwe began with a 12-run win over Sri Lanka they could not sustain that pace and it was not surprising they lost their next three games failing to come to terms with the slow subcontinent surfaces as well as letting the game slip away at crucial phases.
With three other cricket series taking place around the world at the same time  India v South Africa, England v Australia and Pakistan v New Zealand in addition to the Under 19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand, there was little interest in the Bangladesh tri-series that featured the 7th (Bangladesh), 8th (Sri Lanka) and 10th (Zimbabwe) ranked teams.
However it was good enough for Sri Lanka to turn their fortunes in one-day cricket into winning ways after going through a horrendous 2017.

Economic growth accelerated during last three years - Akila
The countrys economic growth rate has accelerated and state revenue source has increased during the last three years due to the pragmatic steps taken by the government in keeping with accepted principles.
This is clearly proved by the World Bank, IMF and the Central Bank reports said UNP Deputy General Secretary Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam in a statement issued yesterday.
Minister Kariyawasam who debunked Opposition allegations that state revenue had decreased under the governments stewardships said that state revenue had recorded an excess of Rs 22 billion for the first time in 63 years under the governments stewardship.
In this light the allegation that state revenue had plummeted, made by the Opposition seems to be politically motivated targeting the forthcoming local government election, he said.
He also stressed that not a single income generating state venture had been privatised by the government either.
The statement said. When the present government assumed office the state revenue sector had faced a plethora of challenges. Among them were the increase in interest rates, increased expenditure on obtaining loans increase in recurrent expenditure due to public sector salaries and pension payments, unstable revenue collection and the global economic situation. Inspite of this the government had been able to increase state revenue which was 13.3 percent in 2015 to 14.02 percent in 2016. The non tax revenue which was 0.9 percent of GNP in 2015 increased by 1.9 percent of the GNP in 2016. Profits and earnings from profits paid to the government by state owned enterprises helped to increase non tax revenue.
State revenue which was Rs 1454.9 billion in 2015 increased to Rs. 1686.1 Billion in 2016 registering a 15.9 percent increase. Revenue from taxes which was Rs. 1355.8 billion in 2015 increased by 8 percent to Rs. 1463.7 billion in 2016.
Non tax revenue which was Rs. 99.01 billion in 2015 increased to Rs. 222.4 Billion in 2016 this was a 124.4 percent increase.
Income earned through the P.A.Y.E. Tax which was Rs. 26.02 billion in 2015 increased by 7.5 percent to Rs. 28.02 billion in 2016. Income from Economic and service charges increased to Rs. 219.7 billion in 2016, registering a significant 232.8 percent increase over 2015.
Revenue form value added tax which was Rs. 219.7 billion in 2015 increased by 29 percent to Rs. 283.5 billion in 2016. This accounted for 16.2 percent of total tax revenue in 2015 and it increased to 19.4 percent in 2016.
Value Added Tax on imports which was Rs. 89.2 billion in 2015 increased by 29.3 percent to Rs. 115.3 billion in 2016.
The value added tax revenue on local activities which was Rs. 131.7 billion in 2015 increased to Rs. 168.8 billion in 2016 registering a percentage increase of 28.2. The Central Bank which incurred a loss of Rs. 24 billion in 2013 increased its losses to Rs. 32 billion in 2014. But by 2016 the Central Bank had registered a profit of Rs. 22 billion, according to its records. An investigation into State Banks also showed an increase in state revenue.
The government had not privatised any income earning state venture. Results of the steps taken by the government to increase state revenue by following accepted principles will accrue to the country from 2018 onwards.
The government, while managing the enormous debt trap without causing unbearable burdens on the people had also minimised obtaining of state loans.
It has also taken several steps towards catering to the welfare of the people. The maintaining of fuel prices, announced in 2015, when the government assumed power, continuously for the past three years, clearly proved this.
While emphasising the fact that the government had not privatised any income generating state venture, what the government had been able to do was to create an excess of Rs. 22 billion in state revenue.
In the light of the excess of Rs. 22 billion in state revenue the allegation that the government had denied the state of its revenue seemed to be a political stunt aimed at the forthcoming Local Government election. According to World Bank reports the country had attained an economic growth rate of 5.5 percent by January 2017 due to its Pragmatic economic vision.
According to the IMF and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the countrys economic growth rate had accelerated despite the natural disasters faced last year. This growth rate recorded despite natural disasters proves that Sri Lankas economy had progressed towards acceleration.
In this background the pessimistic political views expressed about the Sri Lanka economy had been clearly vetoed by approved economic reviews and data.

Estate workers problems will be solved: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said he instructed that the late CWC Leader Savumiamoorthy Thondamans name to be re-exhibited in buildings from which it was recently removed.
He was speaking at a local government election rally, organised by the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) at Talawakelle on Sunday.
The late leader Savumiamoorthy Thondaman fought for the liberation of the forefathers of the hill country Tamils. Therefore, removing his name from institutions is wrong, said the President.
He added: Ceylon tea is famous the world over for its quality. In the past, it fetched much foreign income but it is now being ruined due to various factors. One is that in many estates, the fields have been neglected for the last 20 to 25 years and have become a jungle. In addition, tea is mixed with low-quality exports, thereby degrading our tea which affects our income drastically. This is also the case in pepper. This fraud carried out by certain traders must be stopped. Therefore, I have decided to appoint a committee to investigate and draw a future plan to revamp tea production.
The President said the government was gradually looking into the problems of the estate community. The late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, he said, solved the citizenship issue by entering into the Sirimavo-Shastri Pact. The President himself, as the Health Minister at the time, was able to get the Dickoya Glencairn hospital as a donation by the Indian government.
But you still have more problems. Land allocation for houses alone is not enough. Minister S. B. Dissanayake in his speech touched on the drug menace in the hill country, especially in Hatton. I carried out national level programs to abolish narcotics and this would be further strengthened, he stressed.
The President said the SLFP and CWC are contesting together under the betel leaf and the hand symbol in some districts and under the cockerel in other areas. Voters of all communities should vote for their respective symbol and elect their representatives. I will personally allocate them money for their area development work, he said.
CPC Minister M. Rameshwaran, UPC Minister Senthil Thondaman and former parliamentarian Prabha Ganeshan also addressed the gathering.
CWC General Secretary Arumugan Thondaman, CWC President Muthu Sivalingam, Ministers S. B. Dissanayake, Susil Premajayantha, CPC Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Provincial Councillors and members of the SLFP and CWC also participated.

The fight for the right
No one ever entertains any doubt when singing Happy Birthday To You. Only a few knew that it was a song protected by copyrights.
Daily Telegraph of 2016 lays down an interesting account:
On June 27, 1859, teacher Mildred Hill was born. You may not know her name but you will almost certainly have sung the song she helped write. Hill was the co-composer of Happy Birthday To You, originally called Good Morning To All, which is the song millions of people sing around a candlelit cake. It was first published in a songbook 90 years ago, on March 4. Although by 1924 the recognisable melody had been sung in American primary schools for nearly three decades, the publication was to trigger almost a century of legal wranglings which would result in Happy Birthday To You being one of the most lucrative songs of all time.
So to say, a few years ago we have sung the song without being aware of its copyright disclaimer. The copyright in Sri Lanka has been a subject of debate in relation to art which is also known as intellectual property. The assembly gathered at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) recently had a discussion on how to rectify the copyright fallacies.
According to the six-month-old Chairperson of SLFI Sarath Kongahage, the oldest copyright claim belongs to a poor man who posted his lyrics to himself before anyone else would have a chance to claim it.
Though bestowed with natural greenery, Sri Lanka has undergone many battleships. During that period, the song kept the nation alive. For decades it is what kept the nation on sustenance, Kongahage added.
Nadeeka Guruge, an influential musician who represents the younger generation, challenged the traditional view of the song as a sacrosanct object. The song, Guruge emphasised, has become a commodity. Following the industrial revolution, the art had to be reconstructed. The art segregated the people. The poor had to be content with folk music, while the elite had the opportunity to pay for art. The gramophone emerged as an offshoot of that phenomenon. If the music and the related art was a possibility only outdoors, now it could be enjoyed indoors as stored art. The stored music has evolved into iCloud.
And today, we have two layers to deal with: finance and ethics. With ethics, we have the problem of ownership. A song belongs to three people but on a prioritised order of merit. The first owner is the lyricist. The musician and the singer come to be the second and third owners. An author writes down what roams in his mind. The musician makes it deliverable. The singer is the medium who takes it to the masses, Guruge emphasised.
The musician noted that the copying is the new trend and that should not be viewed in negative light. The ballads, for instance, have turned into rock music. The Sound of Silence of Simon and Garfunkel was recreated recently.
The traditional claim for a song is that it has ownership for about 70 years. The artistic perspective of the song is challenged by the intervention of the capital, Guruge added.
In his speech, lyricist Lucien Bulathsinhala elaborated how Sri Lanka has chosen to ignore the copyright claim.
Claiming your copyrights is not a big deal. It is already happening in other countries such as Singapore, Australia and Italy. The artists get their due. Singapore was a country with lower standards than us a few decades back. But what has happened now We are still struggling with the copyright issues, whereas that is no issue at all for them.
National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) Director General Geethanjali Ranawaka offered the legal picture of the copyright claim.
Every time a song is played, the copyright holder is entitled to a royalty. How much to be paid is subject to negotiation. The CMOs can monitor the songs through a certain system. Other creative artistes such as authors and filmmakers can appoint CMOs too. If that happens properly, then the copyright wont be a hassle anymore.
The National Intellectual Property Office registers about 9000 applications for trademarks on an annual basis. The young inventors approach the NIPO to obtain patents for their innovations.
We cannot ignore the patent licence because innovations matter much. For example, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, it opened up new avenues to more trendy innovations, and today we live in a wireless society thanks to those initial innovations.
Whoever sings a song of someone else for the second or third consecutive time, Geethanjani emphasised, they should respect the primary copyright holders. Simply speaking, all the three copyright holders are entitled to a payment of royalty if their song is sung by a different party.
But in Sri Lanka, that remains too good to be true.
I know, it rarely happens. We are trying to streamline this matter. In the global scene, this is usually handled by Collective Management Organisations (CMO).
A collective management organisation is generally formed or appointed by copyright holders to manage the rights in their copyright works. These organisations are appointed primarily to administer the licensing of rights, the collection of royalties and enforcement of rights on their behalf. If you have a plan to use a work protected by copyright - music or sound recording, for instance - you are required to seek permission, which is normally granted through a licence granted by copyright owners or collective management organisations.
This mechanism will save time for the artistes who can in turn use that time constructively to their next work of art. Geethanjani Ranawaka admitted that Sri Lanka does not have this mechanism in proper operation.
There are two CMOs registered under us. We are trying to make use of the CMO to a certain extent. Then the musicians, lyricists and vocalists will be able to earn some money as a royalty.
A violator needs to pay a penalty, according to the provisions of the Act. Rights have to be honoured and respected according to law. That however does not happen in music and other fields. Ranawaka cited the lack of recognition of law as the possible reason.

Fitch downgrades HDFC
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lankas (HDFC Bank) National Long-Term Rating to BBB-(lka) from BBB(lka).
HDFC Banks senior secured and senior unsecured debentures have also been downgraded to BBB-(lka) from BBB(lka). The ratings are maintained on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).
The one-notch downgrade reflects Fitchs assessment of the weakening of support from the Sri Lanka sovereign (B+/Stable) to HDFC Bank. This is after the state failed to provide capital to the bank in timely manner for it to meet the minimum Rs 5 billion regulatory capital requirement by January 1, 2018. However, Fitch believes that it is still likely that the authorities would provide adequate support to meet the shortfall within an extended deadline.
The RWN reflects the risk that the state, as major shareholder, would not raise the banks capital to meet the minimum capital requirement, in which case Fitch will downgrade the rating to reflect the banks weaker intrinsic strength.

GMOA to launch islandwide token strike today
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide token strike on today (January 30, Tuesday) at 8.00 am, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that emergency treatment will not be affected by the strike and the doctors will carry out all emergency care as usual. The strike will not take place at all children's, maternity, cancer, kidney and army hospitals in the country.
If the health authorities, especially the Health Secretary, does not respond positively to the demands of the GMOA during the past one and half years, before February 05th, there will be tougher trade union action, thereafter. The decision will be made during the the emergency meeting of the GMOA Central Committee, he said.
The corrupt politicians who lied and health authorities who take revenge from doctors for no reason should take the sole responsibility for the hardships that will be undergone by the public due to the strike. Purposely discriminating against doctors, when it comes to granting and revising allowances and other payments and violating the National Wages Policy are among the ten reasons behind launching the strike, he added.

Indian GDP growth at 7-7.5% next year
The Indian economy should grow between 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent in the next fiscal year starting April 1, 2018, with exports and private investment set to rebound, the Economic Survey says.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tabled the survey, the annual report card of the country's financial health, in Parliament on Monday as the Budget session began.
The Economic Survey sees GDP growth at 6.75 per cent in the current fiscal year, ending March 31, 2018. It says a series of major reforms undertaken over the past year will allow real GDP growth to rise to between 7.0 per cent and 7.5 per cent in 2018-19, thereby reinstating India as the world's fastest growing major economy.
Stock markets remained strong in afternoon trade with Sensex and Nifty rising to record highs. The Sensex was up over 350 points while Nifty traded above 11,150.
Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, who has prepared the Economic Survey, said in a tweet that growth is reviving after temporary decoupling. There are robust and broad-based signs of revival in economic activity, he added.
The economic survey says the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), resolution of long-festering bad loans under the Bankruptcy Code, the implementation of a bank recapitalisation package for public sector banks and further liberalisation of the foreign direct investment regime will lift GDP growth, which began to accelerate from the second half of the current fiscal year.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the Indian economy to grow at 7.4 per cent in 2018, which will make it the fastest growing country among emerging economies. The IMF has also projected a growth rate of 7.8 per cent for India in 2019.
The economic survey has flagged risks from rising oil prices. "Some of the factors could have dampening effect on GDP growth in the coming year viz. the possibility of an increase in crude oil prices in the international market," it says.
It has also said that concerns have been expressed about growing protectionist tendencies in some countries but it remains to be seen as to how the situation unfolds.

Intellectual seat of inspiration
The Ludowyk Memorial Lecture delivered by Tissa Jayatilaka at the University of Peradeniya on January 17.

This beautiful and moving elegy, I consider a fitting prelude to my words and thoughts in memory of the magister magistrorum, Evelyn Frederick Charles Ludowyk, Professor of English of the Ceylon University College and the University of Ceylon from 1936  1956. I did not have the good fortune of being a student of the great man but nearly all of my teachers at school and University and several of my close senior friends are those who directly benefited from him during what is now nostalgically looked upon as the heyday of our alma mater. Hence I could claim to be a product of the Ludowyk legacy.
Prof. E. F. C. Ludowyk
During the next several minutes I propose to piece together a sketch of the life and career of Professor Ludowyk on the basis of all that I have learnt from some of his students and colleagues, and then explore the impact of Professor Ludowyk on the country as a whole besides nourishing the University of Ceylon and the fortunate few there. In conclusion, this being soon after the 75th anniversary of our University founded by his colleague Sir Ivor Jennings, in the building up of which institution, they both played such invaluable roles, I shall give you an overview of the promise and performance of the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, this . . . dear perpetual place, that was designed to breed debate and poetry to use Ashley Halpes apt and expressive words to describe the beloved institution.
Professor Ludowyk was an outstanding product of Richmond College, Galle, where he acquired most of his primary and secondary education. He spent two years at Wesley College, Colombo, prior to entering the Ceylon University College. As my wish is to not let this moment pass without basking in a little bit of reflected glory, I note for the record that I had the better part of my own secondary education at Kingswood College, Kandy, which together with Richmond and Wesley are the three premier boys schools in the island established by the Wesleyan Mission.
First Ceylonese Professor of English
Professor Ludowyk entered the Ceylon University College having, as he himself put it in his reminiscences of The English Department, 1921- 1956, had the good fortune of working with the Rev. H. Highfield, a Wordsworthian if ever there was one. Rev. Highfield known to Wesleyites as The Saint of Karlshrue was the legendary 7th principal of Wesley College for three decades (1895 -1925). To have been a student of Highfields, Ludowyk continues to tell us, was to have been conducted almost personally, into the literature of 18th century England which was Wordsworths true background. At University College the young Ludowyk came under the tutelage of Professors Leigh Smith and David Hussey. Having secured a first class from the University of London, he proceeded to Cambridge in 1929 to read for part 11 of the English Tripos, where he achieved a first in English and won the Oldham Prize for Shakespeare in 1931. This was a time of momentous change in English Studies at Cambridge introduced by three scholars of great originality, I.A. Richards, Mansfield Forbes and F.R. Leavis, which in turn had an impact on all university courses in English.
Having come under the influence of these notables, he returned home in 1932, taught briefly at Richmond College before taking up duties as lecturer in English at the University College, Colombo. With the departure of Leigh Smith, David Hussey was now Professor. Later on, having secured his Ph.D. from Cambridge, Ludowyk became, at thirty, the first Ceylonese Professor of English in 1936. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1940. Having served in the post of professor for 20 years, he resigned and left for England in 1956. It is interesting to remember that both Sir Ivor Jennings and Professor Ludowyk left Peradeniya almost around the same time.
Qualities as a teacher
His students have spoken glowingly of Lyn Ludowyk the teacher and the man. The material from his students is plentiful, and I was tempted to let them speak for themselves. I have tried not to resist the temptation. My Principal at Kingswood and later a member of the Council of our University, the late Kenneth de Lanerolle, one of Professor Ludowyks earliest students, tells us that,
The arrival of Lyn Ludowyk into this homely scene [of University College of the early 1930s] was an event. As you enter the Arts Block, on the right of the porch is a row of classrooms, whose partitions could be collapsed to make a sizeable hall. Here, you found it easy to get a friend to answer to your name at roll-call. Here J.L.C Rodrigo traced the outlines of Roman History and when this proved dull (as it often did) we would turn our attention to the flocks of sparrows on the window sills and wonder at their unashamed amours. And here it was that Ludowyk made his debut.
David Hussey was good and Hector Pass was correct, but we found Lyn Ludowyk an altogether new experience. When he spoke that day, and on subsequent days to us, Inter-Arts and B.A students, whether it was on Chaucer or Shakespeare, we found his message winged with meaning. He put us on our mettle and gave us undergrads a sense of dignity.
Ashley Halp has spoken eloquently of the modesty, generosity and civility of the man and testified to Professor Ludowyks wonderful qualities as a teacher, who was at one and the same time, the most demanding and the most appreciative of tutors.
Ian Goonetileke, in his Preface to Ludowyks Those Long Afternoons. Childhood in Colonial Ceylon, tells us of his honesty, compassion, and an attractive, often mischievous, sense of humourvirtues he possessed in abundant measure [that] shine through these pages. Ludowyks sense of humour is aptly demonstrated in two anecdotes that Fred Abeyesekere shares with us. Abeyesekere writes:
Ludo had set us one of his weekly tutorials and we were left to our own devices, to do or perish! A colleague of mine had gone to town, snaring up volume after volume of Scrutiny to the consternation of Librarian Enright! His, had then to be a very comprehensive answer.
There was no doubt about it. A day or two later Ludo, in characteristic style, read out our grades - most of us oscillating between Cs and Bs with a dramatically announced solitary A+! There was much excitement as an A from Ludo meant that one was almost of the calibre of F.R. Leavis! Loaded with drama, he went onto explain that this was truly great, a very excellent effort and continued, as at the climactic point in a play, that he was not aware until then that Mr. Allen Tate was a member of his class! Mr. Allen Tate had scored an A+, and my colleague (the Scrutiny man), naught. (Not even a D-, which usually put us in the dog house).
On one occasion when the dashing Gregory Peck was at the Royal Botanical Gardens, taking part in a film which was being shot there, some feminine admirers decked in their Sunday best had dared to cut Ludostute class at 8.00 am. They returned around 8.45 am and gingerly tiptoed their way to the back of Ludos class, mercifully unseen by him as he was scribbling something on the blackboard. Suddenly he twirled his spectacles, faced the class, smiled a most benevolent smile and merely pronounced: Ladies! One must choose between Lyn and Peck.
Godfrey Gunatilleke tells us more about Prof. Ludowyks particular style of teaching in which reading out some passage of poetry or creative prose was a crucial part. They were, Gunatilleke tells us, as it were, moments in and out of time. . . . Listening to him, adds Gunatilleke, we participated in the primal sorrow in Hardys The Voice, the irreparable loss of the loved one, heard no more again far or near, the infinite sadness at the transience of beauty and self in Hopkins Spring and Fall; the tragic self-realization of Lear bound upon a wheel of fire; the mature comedy in a passage from Chaucers Canterbury Tales, restoring us to a wholesome sanity, giving us the emotional resilience to face life. . . Through his reading we became intuitively aware that good literature chastened and purified the inner self, that it was life-giving and brought us closer to the well-springs of human experience. It is indeed a great pity that we have no recording of Ludowyks readings. Having listened to many readings by world-renowned actors and famous literary personalities whether they be of Shakespeare or T. S. Eliot or other poets  I still recall Ludowyks readings as unrivalled in their capacity to unfold the intricate pattern of meaning and the inner drama of a poem or piece of creative writing.
As fulsome as is the praise of his students, the beneficiaries of Lyn Ludowyk were not just the fortunate few who read English at the time. His influence and reach were University-wide and spilt over to the wider community outside as well. Bernard Soysa, a close associate of his and a notable politician of an earlier period in our country when our parliament was not so full of mediocrities and dishonest men and women as today, has written warmly of Ludowyks contribution to the national politics of the day. Ludowyk was too scrupulous and sufficiently fastidious as to not seek membership of any political party but, on available evidence, one could conclude that he contributed to political causes he believed in from his particular vantage point.
South East and South Asian societies
Interesting as this political diversion is, I wish to focus on Ludowyks significant contribution to the nourishment of Sinhala Studies in our country, especially to Sinhala literary criticism and Sinhala drama. His contribution to the department of English, English Studies and English drama is too well known and does not require re-telling here. The popular or, more accurately perhaps, the prejudiced view of ill-formed critics of the time was that Professor Ludowyk and those of his background lacked roots in the native soil and that they were aloof from anything outside the department of English. This misperceived and undeserved criticism needs to be corrected by situating it in its context.
During the last phase of British colonialism beginning in the 20th century, a militant nationalism was discernible in India in particular and in certain other South East and South Asian societies including our own. Whilst this hostility of the militant nationalists of Ceylon to colonialism was understandable, their inability to distinguish between the different categories of the English educated Ceylonese of the day is lamentable. From all that can be gleaned, some of the English-educated intelligentsia displayed a degree of aloofness. The best of them, however, as exemplified by Professor Ludowyk himself and those of his more sensitively intelligent students  Godfrey Gunatilleke, C. R. (Dick) Hensman, Douglas Walatara, R.C.L. Attygalle, Izeth Hussein, Reggie Siriwardene, Gananath Obeyesekere, Ranjini Ellepola Obeyesekere, Ashley Halp, Yasmine Gooneratne, G.K. Haththotuwegama, Saratchandra Wickramasuriya and Thiru Kandiah to name but a few show us that such aloofness was by no means the norm. As to the stimulus given by Ludowyk and some of his products directly or indirectly to writers and critics in Sinhalese, let me first let the great man speak for himself. Here is what Professor Ludowyk tells us in an essay titled The East West Problem in Sinhalese Literature:
It has often been said of English in Ceylon, that despite the hundred-odd years of its use in schools and by that small class known as the English educated, it has produced hardly anything which could be dignified by the name of literature. This criticism is, however, mistaken. The fruitful results of English have to be sought elsewhere  in the effect it has had on writing in Sinhalese. Within a limited scope it has influenced both the Sinhalese language and its literature. It has done something to create a group of professional writers in Sinhalese, a group which hardly existed before. Imperceptibly, yet none the less definitely, English has made a considerable difference to writing in Sinhalese.
In the cross fertilization of Sinhalese and English Literature, Ludowyk played a pivotal role. As stated above, being at Cambridge at a time of momentous change, he was influenced by the fresh winds then blowing through English Studies at that ancient seat of learning. Modern methods of evaluating literary writing with their emphasis on practical criticism associated with I.A. Richards and the close reading and understanding of a poem, play or novel (criticism as the scrutiny of words on the page) set in motion by F.R. Leavis and his colleagues replaced the earlier approach with its emphasis on philology, grammar and the socio-economic and historical background of a literary creation. In the decades of the 1930s, 1940s and until the mid- 1950s under the leadership of Robert Marrs at the University College and Doctor (later Sir) Ivor Jennings at the University of Ceylon, our higher education had begun to flourish and move in new directions setting high intellectual standards in the process. This was the period when men like Lyn Ludowyk, Gunapala Malalasekere, Hector Pass, Doric de Souza, Cuthbert Amerasinghe, M.D. Ratnasuriya, O.H. de A. Wijesekere, Ediriwira Sarachchandra, D.E. Hettiarachchi, Ian Goonetileke, K.W. Goonewardene et al made their formidable intellectual presence felt, both in and outside of the university.
Their products began carrying the new knowledge thus acquired, and through it the new ways of seeing the world, into the wider society as teachers in secondary schools spread across the country. Consequently there came into being a new generation of formally educated citizens who began to question existing values and ideas based on conventional wisdom. This was also the period when a segment of our citizens notably Ananda Samarakone, Sunil Shantha, Makaloluwa, Chitrasena and Amaradeva were making an impact on the cultural renaissance of our country having benefited from Rabindranath Tagore and the congenial learning environment he had created at Shanthiniketan and from other Indian institutions of advanced training in Dance and Music. Although on a different plane, this era also saw the emergence of artists like Lionel Wendt, Harry Peiris, George Claessen, Justin Deraniyagala, George Keyt, Manjusri and Richard Gabriel of the 43 Group. Their work, too, was suffused with a fresh vigour combining meaningfully, as it did, the idioms of the East and West.
Young professors of English and Sinhala
It is in the above-delineated environment that we see the fruitful academic collaboration of the young professors of English and Sinhala, the first Ceylonese to hold these positions, Lyn Ludowyk and Dharmasiri Ratnasuriya, of the University of Ceylon. They both had lived and studied in England in their formative years. Ratnasuriya like Ludowyk, Amaradasa Virasinha tells us, was an unassuming and modest personality who shunned the limelight.
His untimely death before he could make his mark as fully as Ludowyk was able to, may also account for why very few know of the pioneering role Ratnasuriya played in the founding of a modern Sinhala literary critical tradition in Sri Lanka, an enterprise in which both Ludowyk and Ratnasuriya combined so effectively. Their own close academic partnership led to the formation of creative partnerships among their students. Of them, the joint effort of Dharmasiri Ekanayaka, Amaradasa Virasinha and S.G. Samarasinghe who read for Honours degrees in Sinhala, is significant. Of these three Dharmasiri Ekanayake, who read Sinhala (1947-1950) with English as his subsidiary subject stands out.
These were the three students who founded the literary journal Samskriti in 1953 in memory of Professor Dharmasiri Ratnasuriya. Ekanayaka had by now entered the Ceylon Civil Service. Despite his manifold labours as a civil servant, his contribution to Samskriti and to the establishment of a modern Sinhala literary critical tradition was immense. From its founding in 1953, Samskriti had a seminal influence on the local literary scene until about the early 1970s, as Scrutiny founded by F.R. Leavis had in the English-speaking world from 1932-1953 in particular and thereafter as well. Samskriti was a boon to senior school students and undergraduates of the bilingual intelligentsia of our country. Professor K.N.O. Dharmadasa in an essay written in 2004 (cited by Chinataka Ranasinghe in a special issue of Samskriti in April 2011), writes on the significance of Samskriti and its kinship to Scrutiny.
Dharmasiri Ekanayakas familiarity with both the Sinhala and English literary critical traditions in combination with Amaradasa Virasinhas extensive familiarity with the indigenous tradition enabled them to feed off each others specialized knowledge as Virasinha tells us in the April 2011 issue of Samskriti. The splendid results of this intellectual bond between Ekanayaka and Virasinha are to be seen in their offerings in Samskriti and in the formers posthumous book, Sahithyaya Ha Vichara Kalawa (2012).
With the departure of Amaradasa Virasinha to the United States in 1970, Samskriti lost its guiding spirit. After nearly three decades, Virasinha returned to Sri Lanka and sought to revive the journal. Although Ekanayaka gave every possible encouragement to Virasinha and was enthusiastic about a fresh involvement with Samskriti, his ill-health did not permit him to do so. An incurable stomach ailment yet dogged him which, in addition to his own disillusionment with the public service, had compelled him to take leave of his civil service career prematurely in 1979, at the age of 51.
By 2000, Virasinhas own health had begun to deteriorate. It was at this stage that Dr. G. Usvatte-Aratchi and Susil Sirivardana stepped into the breach and together with a younger group of academics and aficionados of literature came to Virasinhas assistance. In addition to reviving Samskriti, a key project these revivalists devoutly wished to accomplish was the publication of a book containing all of Dharmasiri Ekanayakas most valuable contributions to Samskriti beginning in 1953. Sadly, however, before the publication could see the light of day, Dharmasiri Ekanayaka passed on, on September 22, 2010, aged 82.
Sahithiyaya Ha Vichara Kalawa which finally came off the press in 2012, is a collection of Dharmasiri Ekanayakas excellent essays in literary criticism. It contains, among other writings, his reviews of A.P. Gunaratnes translation of Leonard Woolfs The Village in the Jungle, titled, Beddegama, Martin Wickramasinghes short stories, W.A. Silvas Avichara Samaya, Siri Gunasinghes Hevanella, Ediriwira Sarachchandras Malagiya Aththo and Anton Chekovs The Cherry Orchard that has been rendered into Sinhala as Cherry Watte. In addition there is a notable and insightful essay written in 1963 titled Ingrisi Vichara Kalawa Ha Sinhala Sahithyaya in which Ekanayaka notes that universal human values cut across societies and cultures, and that it is perfectly valid to use English literary critical principles to judge Sinhala literature.

Irish abortion referendum: Vote to be held in May

The Irish government has agreed to hold a referendum at the end of May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion.
The vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations.
Currently abortion is only when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that he will campaign for reform.
The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment.
The amendment, which was approved by a 1983 referendum, "acknowledges the right to life of the unborn" - meaning the life of the woman and her unborn child are seen as equal.
Before the vote, the country's health minister will draft legislation proposing unrestricted abortion access be made available to women up to 12 weeks, and in exceptional circumstances after.
An exact date for the referendum will be decided after it is debated in the Irish parliament.
'Not black and white'
Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed,and last year a special cross-party parliamentary committee and citizens assembly both recommended repealing the amendment.
"I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make," Varadkar said.
Before the vote, the country's health minister will draft legislation proposing unrestricted abortion access be made available to women up to 12 weeks, and in exceptional circumstances after.
An exact date for the referendum will be decided after it is debated in the Irish parliament.
He said the current law meant that abortions in Ireland were "unsafe, unregulated and illegal".
"These journeys do not have to happen, and that can change, and that's now in our hands," he said.
In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales, according to UK Department of Health statistics.
The National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) welcomed Monday's announcement.
"Every pregnancy is different, every decision is deeply personal. Women and girls in Ireland deserve their dignity. They deserve the right to privacy, family and home," said the group's director Orla O'Connor.
Abortion in the Republic of Ireland
The Republic of Ireland currently has a near total ban on abortion.
Terminations are not permitted in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality and thousands of women travel abroad for a termination every year.
The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, "acknowledges the right to life of the unborn".
However, there have been significant challenges and changes to the law in recent years.
A campaign to liberalise abortion gathered momentum in 2012, after Indian woman Savita Halappanavardied in a Galway hospital after she was refused an abortion during a miscarriage.
The following year,legislation was passedto legalise abortion when doctors deem that a woman's life is at risk due to medical complications, or at risk of taking her life.
Twenty years before Halappanavar's death, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy.
It became known as the X Case, as the girl could not be named to protect her right to anonymity.
The 1992 ban on travel was later overturned by the Irish Supreme Court.
A referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state.

Journey from nobodies to somebodies
Human rights movement refers to a nongovernmental social movement engaged in activism related to the issues of human rights. Today some believe that HR issues should be kept outside of politics; mainly left politics. However the foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, apartheid, patriarchy, and oppression of indigenous peoples. Clearly these subjects are closely related to the struggle of Samasamajism locally and internationally.
A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to universality: the idea that all human beings should struggle in solidarity for a common security and human values. This is exactly the basic Samasamajist principle. Due to the rise of Stalinism and association of communism in Russia and China with regimes without political freedom, there came a split between Samasamajism and human rights.
The activities of the International Federation for Human Rights (originally the International Labour Organization)founded in France by the international labour movement in the 1920scan be seen as a precursor to the modern movements. This organisation was quickly embraced by the United States and European powers. They wanted to show; at that stage, that Liberal democracy is the counter to the dictatorial Communism. Hence for them human rights is a way to counteract the Stalinist call for global solidarity among workers.
Samasamajism
Today we are living in the era of Samasamajism of Bernie Saunders and Jeremy Corbin. Western bourgeoisie has turned to fascistic leaders in order to escape the pressure of modern human rights agitation. Women today are in the forefront of the fight against human rights violations. Since the 1970s the human rights movement has played an increasingly important role on the international scene. Although government support for human rights decreased, international organisations increased in strength and number.
The present regime in Lanka, in its present form was able start up the economy which was on a standstill and will end up stabilizing it by showing budget surpluses by 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said recently.
We did not take over a stable government but an economy which was on a standstill just like a power station with broken generators. Generator of the power station, which is called the economy, is development. This power station was on a standstill when we took over the government as the country was in a debt trap and as there were no investors. However we have managed to fuel this power plant with investments and by settling the debts. We will complete what we started and will end up showing a budget surplus by 2020, the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe is perhaps trying to follow the example set by Mahathir Mohamed of Malaysia. In Malaysia too there were nationality conflicts, basically between Malays and Chinese. The constitution grants freedom of religion and makes Malaysia an officially secular state, while establishing Islam as the religion of the Federation.
New economic policy
According to the Population and Housing Census 2010 figures, nationality and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. 0.7% declared no religion and the remaining 1.4% practiced other religions or did not provide any information. Sunni Islam of Shafi'i School of jurisprudence is the dominant branch of Islam in Malaysia, while 18% are nondenominational Muslims.
This strife culminated in the May 13 race riots in 1969. After the riots, the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, trying to increase the share of the economy held by the Bumiputera. However under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad this nationality problem was controlled by expanding the power of the federation and secular nature of the constitution.
After the conclusion of this process there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanization beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based more on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the PETRONAS Towers, the NorthSouth Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya. However, in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets. Federation brought heightened tensions including a conflict with Indonesia as well continuous conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula.
Malaysian model
Hence if PM Wickremesinghe wants to follow the Malaysian model he has to expedite the work of constituent council and create united nation in Lanka. Malaysians improved rapidly the basic knowledge of English and empowered the people. This should be done in Lanka too, with an island wide campaign.
The premier said the previous government borrowed funds and constructed a port without ships and an airport without planes. This is like mixing water with kerosene. However when we took over we managed to show an excess in primary accounts by making difficult decisions such as increasing VAT, he said.
In addition his corporation with trade unions has won the support of Western world workers movement. On the other hand countries such as China, India and Japan had come to assist Lanka after the government signed an agreement with IMF. All these countries will not help Lanka if the agreement with IMF is abolished. In addition, it is necessary to settle the HR issues which are fundamental to a democratic society.

Kataragama voters urge to end monkey menace
The residents of the Kataragama Pradeshiya Sabha have made a unique appeal to the candidates running for their local government.
They have asked that the future public representatives put an end to their struggles with the local monkey population. The monkeys in the area, numbered to be around 3,000 in population have become a menace in Kataragama. The people complain that the monkeys visit their homes daily to wreak havoc and even break the television antennas in many of their roofs.
The farmers complain that they cannot grow any produce, be it in their fields or home gardens as the monkeys have taken to destroying all their crops. Due to these problems, the farmers have stopped cultivating in Kataragama and Sella Kataragama.
The public have proposed that the monkeys be taken to another area or a sterilization programme similar to controlling the street dog population be carried out to control the rapid increase in monkey population.
The voters have promised to cast their vote to whichever candidate that solves their monkey problem.

As for which little one could be wearing a wig with the Duchess' hair We may never know!
"We like to thank everyone and send out little certificates to all our donors," Creese explained. "But lots of people don't fill in the paperwork and they don't feel the need to be acknowledged in that way, but we are always very grateful."

K.M. Nelson a veteran of yesteryear
I had the privilege of meeting K.M. Nelson, fondly called Nelly, and he indicated to me to address him by his pet name. From the word go, I got the impression that Nelly new his onions about cricket and was not averse to calling a spade a spade.
Nelly started with a bang and stated that the Matara Mauler, was initially discovered by him playing beach cricket on the scorching sands of Matara. All this originated when Nelly had a drink at the CCC Club with Sanath Jayasuriyas uncle who was an Assistant Superintendent of the Police Force, then, indicated to Nelly and that Sanaths mother had got caught to the Tsunami. As a result Nelly was given the task of putting Sanath on the straight and narrow! And what transpired from there is history now.
Nelly was full of praise for late Gamini Dissanayake for obtaining Test status for Sri Lanka in 1981 and specially mentioned that Raja Mahendran was the Vice President at that time. In 1984 the first tour of England by a Sri Lankan cricket team after obtaining Test status took place and Raja Mahendran was the chef de mission. Nelly was fortunate enough to go on that trip, courtesy of Raja Mahendran. This was the tour where Duleep Mendis took Ian Botham to the cleaners, he missed getting twin hundreds by a mere 6 runs. Nelson also stated that he has never seen an innings of such savage power thus far even by surpassing brutal hitters such as Sanath Jayasuriya and the great Aravinda de Silva.
Nelly was a brilliant bowler, bowling off cutters at a brisk pace, at club level and he was the best bowler for five years on the trot. He also represented the country in 1969 when the MCC team led by Mike Denness toured Sri Lanka.
He recalled that Stanley Jayasinghe requested him to bowl to him daily for half an hour and thereafter sat down for a beer and a chit-chat about the happenings in county cricket in England. Clive Inmans 50 runs in 8 balls came for special praise. Inman was a car salesman in Leicester who unfortunately went on the wrong track, stated Nelly.
He is of the opinion that Sri Lankan strength is their batting and our biggest drawback is the lack of genuine pace in our bowling armory. He stated that Lasith Malinga has seen better days and lacked genuine pace and bowled at military medium pace therefore as a result his time was up.
Nelsons T20 and ODI squads included the following; Dickwella, Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka (good fielder) Kusal Mendis (brilliant talent), they must be told to go positive from the word go Nelly insisted.
Mathews and Chandimal to steady the ship if early wickets fall, Dasun Shanaka (brilliant timer) and raw talent, and no. 8 Thisara Perera, no. 9 Siriwardene, no. 10 Akila Dhananjaya and no 11 Vandersay.
Nelly was also of the opinion that Dhananjaya de Silva has a lot of class in his batting and he plays in the V and should be persisted with for the future. He also stated that Hathurusingha was an okay coach.
When Jayantha Dharmadasa was heading Sri Lankan Cricket, Nelly was offered the chairmanship of selectors but he was gracious enough to refuse that offer because he has not played for the top eleven except once. In his very words he mentioned that he did not want to dilute the quality. He was of the firm opinion that politics should be separated from cricket and there should be a separate Sports Act. Immediate past cricketers should also get involved in the fray, stated Nelson.
Nelly questioned how a person like Gura who has been in hibernation for 21 years working for a publishing company overseas, could suddenly be sky dropped into a position with a lot of clout.
He was also of the view that Moody was a very good coach and was on the ball with the boys, Nelly categorically stated that the coaches come and go due to political interference. Nelson was of the view that some of the young talent that we have are behaving like spoilt brats, simply because if they play for two years at national level with a Test match fee of USD-8000/Test and USD 5000/ODI, they can well afford to buy good houses and posh cars. The issue here is how to handle fame and fortune. By and large our young bucks are not level headed; swollen heads are the order of the day.
Nelson concluded by stating that Dinesh Chandimal should be the captain of the Sri Lankan team in all three formats. The reason given was that Chandi was the more exuberant of the lot and was fit as a fiddle.
The highly rated Mathews is unfortunately an always breakdown case. The muscle bound Kusal Perera was trying to go pell-mell in our latest ODI against Zimbabwe against a tightly set field, he succumbed to a side strain in the end going for a sharp single. There is something wrong somewhere, as regards to our trainers and physios, just imagine missing out players in the caliber of Mathews and Kusal Perera who are potential match winners on their day, in the mid-stream of a series!

Lalith Weeratunga refused permission to go abroad
The Colombo High Court yesterday rejected a request made by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge that he be allowed to go abroad.
Weeratunga who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had sought the Colombo High Courts permission to travel to Doha, Qatar and Australia in the months of March and April.
While rejecting the application, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga observed there is no legal basis to consider this application since a person convicted of an offence has no the right to be presumed innocent.
However, surprisingly the Attorney General did not raise objections to the request made by the defence.
Senior State Counsel Yuvan Abeywickrema appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that he has received instructions not to object to the request if the accused returned his passport after concluding his visit.
Meanwhile, the High Court Judge observed that the accuseds request cannot be considered as an urgent requirement since his request was not based on a medical requirement.
The accused highlighted his medical requirements when he was requesting for bail following the conviction. Now it is different. His present requirement cannot be considered as an urgent matter. There is no legal basis to consider this application, the High Court Judge added.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC in connection with the controversial Sil Redi (Fabrics used by devotees to observe Sil) distribution case.
They were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
They had filed appeal petitions in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgment of the Colombo High Court. They are currently out on bail.
While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accuseds guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election.
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of two million rupees and in default of the payment of fine they will have to serve additional one year imprisonment.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign. They were found guilty of all charges.
Counsel Janaka Ranatunga with Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for Lalith Weeratunga. Senior State Counsel Yuvan Abeywicrema appeared for the Attorney General.

Life in the limelight
Symphony Orchestra  Life & Life Composer and Conductor Maestro, Vajira Indika Karunasena did not speak a word on stage. Not a word. Not for him is the limelight. He is completely immersed in his music. Music is his life, it is his calling. It gives his life such powerful meaning. For him, music is his way of understanding the universe. Music is his way of communicating the wordless knowledge within his soul. Music is his language.
He is a man with many achievements. Yet not a word of it! He wanted music to be the center of attention. Not him.
How do I know this You can tell a lot about a man by just listening to the music he makes. And the most wondrous thing is every single person in that audience interpreted the evening differently. That is how thought provoking the evening was. What I understood may not have been what the person next to me understood. That is the mystery and the pleasure of music. It morphs into many things in our minds.
Of course apart from what it meant to all of us, one has to credit the musicians on stage with him. It was a well- greased machine. And in the midst of it all was Karunasena on stage, frantically waving his hands, a wiry, short individual looking intently at his fellow musicians. No doubt they knew their business.
The music was pulsating and had a hypnotic influence on us. Images flickered through my mind as the music spoke to my heart, as if I was on the couch next to a practitioner of hypnosis. It was as if an invisible hand delved into my mind and perused my thoughts.
All in all it was an enjoyable evening. No surprises as such. Not a concert which was very different from other concerts or exceptional. It was a nice concert and a pleasant evening. It was in the end a celebration of music by a talented maestro. With a flick of his wrists he made such beautiful music.
Symphony Orchestra  Life & Life was held on January 20 at the Lionel Wendt.

Enigmatic fashion icon Coco Chanel once said that fashion changes but style endures, and she was right. Over the millennia of human existence fashion trends have evolved with times and seasons, but style has never gone out of fashion.
This is one founding principle of L.I.F.T, Sri Lankas premier fashion campus. Since its inception in the year 2000 the school has been recognized as one that leads the way in quality fashion design education in Sri Lanka.
In another pioneering venture L.I.F.T will launch Sri Lankas very first online fashion exhibition titled Fashion Nouveau in conjunction with the schools graduation ceremony to be held later this month. The digital exhibition will be a real-time walk-through of an upscale, concise mix of carefully curated collections put together by outstanding students, and will range from haute couture to high street fashion. The project uses state-of-the-art technology to allow viewers to explore fashion and discover the stories behind the clothes designed by students who have been nurtured by L.I.F.T.
To kick-off the initiative, the online exhibition will feature selected garments, a diversity of footwear and accessories and much more designed by students of L.I.F.T and ModArt International Sri Lanka. For the first time ever the exhibition will also feature a photography series of students from ModArt International Paris.
We are constantly exploring how new technologies can help bring the unrivalled fashion collection of our students to life online. Online visitors can now see the incredible detail of highlights from the campus collection, while discovering the tantalizing stories behind them in ways never experienced before. Through this revelatory online experience, we hope viewers will gain a greater understanding of the craftsmanship and design expertise that transforms fashionable clothing into pieces of art by our students, said L.I.F.Ts Managing Director Niroshani Leanage.
The exhibition will be open to the public for viewing from January 18 to March 18. This will also be a great opportunity for potential students to view what L.I.F.T has to offer prior to applying for their first intake for the year which ends on January 31. The exhibition is also targeted at fashion industry professionals to gauge the skill levels of L.I.F.Ts internationally trained graduates. L.I.F.T encourages all potential students and interested parties to visit their brand new website www.lift.lk to view the online exhibition or walk in to the school at No 87 Horton Place, Colombo 7 for a touch and feel of the real thing.

Messi strikes late to down tough Alaves
Madrid, Sunday: Barcelona escaped a scare on Philippe Coutinhos first start as Lionel Messi struck with a trademark free-kick to drag the La Liga leaders back from a goal down to beat Alaves 2-1 and restore their 11-point lead at the top.
Messi whipped home a beautiful free-kick six minutes from the end to down resilient Alaves, who are just two points from the drop zone in 17th despite John Guidetti silencing the Camp Nou with a shock breakaway opener in the 23rd minute.
Luis Suarez had broken the away sides tough resistence with a sweet volley from Andres Iniestas cross 18 minutes from the end, setting the stage for Messis dramatic and stylish winner.
The Argentines strike ensures that Barca stay unbeaten in the league, and keeps Atletico Madrid 11 points back despite their 3-0 hammering of Las Palmas earlier.
Barca coach Ernesto Valverdes said he was happy with Coutinho who had started Thursdays Copa del Rey clash with Valencia on the bench before making a second-half appearance.
Players are not machines who can fit in at once, like a new part, said Valverde.
He did well, he wanted the ball. This is one more step for him. The other day, he played 25 minutes, this time a little more, he will integrate little by little.
With Diego Costa out injured, Atletico took a while to get going and had to wait until the 61st minute to open the scoring, Antoine Griezmann latching on to Juanfrans fine ball down the right flank before dinking neatly over Las Palmas stopper Leandro Chichizola.
The first half was not very good but the coach gave us a good talking to at half-time, and we responded well, said Griezmann, whose goal was just his seventh in the league this season but his fourth in league and cup since the turn of the year.
I feel good, Ive started the year well and I hope to continue the goals and assists.
Frenchman Griezmann started the move that led to Atleticos second, intercepting a loose pass and setting Angel Correa free to scamper down the pitch and feed Fernando Torres, who shifted the ball onto his right foot and lashed home just his second goal of the season, the 600th scored by Atletico in all competitions during Diego Simeones seven-year reign as coach.
An easy tap-in from Thomas Partey after great work from Yannick Carrasco two minutes from time completed the second-half rout of a desperate Las Palmas, who remain second from bottom and five points from safety.

Misusing of State vehicles: Court sends reminder to AG
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday sent a reminder to the Attorney General directing him to expedite legal advice regarding National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while he was functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a Rs. 91 million loss to the government.
When the case came up before the Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, Court was informed that the FCID was yet to receive Attorney Generals advice regarding two suspects.
The FCID has sought Attorney General's advice regarding future legal action against two suspects Wimal Weerawansa and Samantha Lokuhennadige under reference number CRS/14/17.
They are currently out on bail. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for July 9 and the prosecution was directed to report the progress of the inquiry on next hearing date.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences under Public Property Act and the Penal Code while he was functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court. The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given the vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while he was functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a Rs. 91 million loss to the state.

Montpellier go top with last-gasp try in Clermont
Paris, Sunday: Montpellier scored a converted try in the dying seconds to win 30-29 away to reigning champions Clermont on Sunday and retake first place in the Top 14.
Montpellier picked up four points to move a point ahead of La Rochelle and Racing 92, who both won on Saturday.
The defeat leaves Clermont 10th in the table after 16 rounds, 11 points away from the playoff places.
It was only Montpelliers third victory in eight away games in the league.
Montpellier won by a single point right at the death when Nemani Nadolo scored a 79th-minute try which Ruan Pienaar converted. Clermont gave us a few balls at the end of the game and we strung some playing time together and were able to use Nemani Nadolo, said Montpellier coach Vern Cotter, who was once in charge of Clermont.
The two heavyweights delivered a duel of great intensity as they traded blows and scores.
It was a very committed match, Cotter said.
Montpellier lock Louis Picamoles, dropped by France for the Six Nations, scored two tries in the first 20 minutes, separated by a home try scored by another lock, Paul Jedrasiak. AFP

MullenLowe attributes 2017 success to Pure Growth
MullenLowe Sri Lanka, the fully owned operation of the multibillion-dollar New York based Inter Public Group (IPG), completed 2017 on a record high. In a tough economic climate in 2017, where market trends were contrary to growth, the company saw its top-line revenues soar almost two-and-a-half times the accepted global average with a significant contribution coming from new business.
2017 saw the market being restricted by poor consumer spending due to inflationary pressures and devastating floods and droughts, which resulted in budget contractions across business categories, overshadowing an anticipated positive outlook earlier in the same year. However this did not deter the company coming up with a very strong performance.
MullenLowes significant growth in 2017 came despite the company not handling any lucrative government businesses, which many companies are very dependent on and secondly it operates as a single entity at present and does not have multiple sub-units to manage conflicting businesses.
Referring to the companys accelerated growth as pure growth, Thayalan Bartlett, Chief Executive Officer of MullenLowe Sri Lanka notes that MullenLowe is the single largest agency in the country today. He attributes the companys growth to doing creatively effective work across multiple platforms and making significant gains in new business.
The company produced an average of 1.9 commercials per week during 2017 making MullenLowe the single largest producer of commercial content in the country.
Commenting on the campaigns rolled out by the agency during 2017, Dilshara Jayamanna, Senior Vice President and Executive Creative Director, MullenLowe Sri Lanka said, Landmark work for Sunlight detergent, Clear shampoo, Rexona deodorant, Nations Trust Bank, Maliban Spicy Cracker, FriMi, Close Up toothpaste and Marmite saw us push conceptual and executional boundaries to create engaging work resulting in our clients brands receiving an unfair share of attention.
Collaborating more with the best local and global technical teams gave our creative an added dimension and polish, especially in the digital arena with 4 pieces of our branded content having reigned at No.1 on YouTube.
The outlook for 2018 looks extremely promising for the company but comes with its own sent of challenges. Finding quality talent to resource the agency as it expands and to have adequate external support to cope with the increased demand for TV productions remain our biggest challenge. In fact our 2017 growth was somewhat muted by this limitation or else we would have recorded much better figures than what we closed on, said Thayalan. Based on our projections we will end-up producing 125 commercials this year, he added.
Established as LDB Lintas in 1993, and thereafter referred to as Lowe LDB, the agency has a vibrant creative legacy. It came to be known as MullenLowe as a result of a merger with US based network Mullen in 2015.

No plan by President to form Govt. with 96 UPFA MPs - Susil
President Maithripala Sirisena does not plan to form a new government if the 96 UPFA MPs join him, insisted Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha yesterday as he explained that President Sirisena had merely spoken of the need to maintain unity among the parties. Addressing the media yesterday at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) Headquarters, the Minister said that the media had misunderstood the President when he said that he would form a SLFP government if all 96 UPFA MPs pledged their support to him.
It is true that the President wants all of the UPFA MPs to join hands with him. He emphasized that they need to maintain unity without being divided into several parties. He does not want to see them all going in different directions, he said.
He further said that the United National Party (UNP) often spoke of forming a new government even without realizing that they cannot do it without the support of two thirds in Parliament. They should make statements based on facts and need to understand the constitution better, he said.
He said that President Sirisena also made a statement that he will take charge of the economy and added that changes are vital to stabilize the national economy.
The National Economic Council was appointed by the President to take much needed decisions to strengthen the economy. I heard several politicians talking about making Sri Lanka like Singapore. They still talk about Singapore and how it was in the 1990s, they are living in a dream world. We need to focus on measures that are practical and suitable for the present era. Today, the development of a country is based on research and technology, he said.

Only 37 food sheet producers  SLSI certified - CEA
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) recently highlighted that out of over 500 food wrapping sheets and bag manufacturers in the country only 37 manufacturers have obtained the Sri Lanka Standard Institution (SLSI) certificate to produce standard compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.
According to the new law shopping bags are manufactured under the low density standard and both food wrapping sheets and bags which are environmentally friendly degrade in the environment after using 180 days.
Speaking to Daily News Business CEA, Director Ajith Weerasundara said that steps have already been taken to crack down food wrapping sheets and paper bags manufacturers who violate the law and were still manufacturing substandard products that were completely banned by the Government with effect from January 1 this year.
He said special CEA teams have been deployed to investigate manufacturers who defy the law and secretly go ahead with their usual productions in order to make profits without considering the future environment disasters.
He said the CEA authorized officials also visit traders, hoteliers, grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants who defy the law even by keeping polythene wrapping papers and bags in their possession.
Director Weerasundara appreciated the assistance given by flying squads, attached to island-wide local Government institutions to raid area manufacturers who defy the ban.
During the past few weeks authorized officers were able to raid over 100 manufacturing places and crack down 12 manufacturers who still defy the law and continuously engaged in the same old manufacturing process, he said.
He once again reiterated that food wrapping sheets and bag manufacturers should obtain the authorized certificate from the Sri Lanka Standard Institution and thereafter get the registration from the Central Environment Authority to go ahead with their productions uninterruptedly.
When contacted, Plastic Packaging , Chairman Dr. Mervyn Dias said his company welcomed the Governments decision and he has already obtained the CEA approval to manufacture food wrapping papers and bags to cater to both the local and overseas markets.
Our company has already supplied about six million standard bags to super markets in the country, adding that his company has manufactured only the UK approved EN 13432 standard compostable and biodegradable papers.

OPPO launches entry level A83 selfie expert phone
OPPO the Selfie expert unveiled its latest entry-level camera phone  The OPPO A83. The A83 is equipped with a full screen display, a feature rarely seen in products of this price range.
Together with OPPOs A.I. beauty recognition technology, A83 brings a more realistic and natural selfie experience to more young consumers, along with the 3GB RAM and 3180 mAh battery as a whole makes the A83 a versatile product.
The OPPO A83 is now available in black and gold colour variants across country through offline stores.
OPPO Lanka CEO Bob Li, said, The A.I technology has become popular with our young customers. They love being able to express their individuality. The OPPO A83 is our way of bringing the same technology to entry-level camera phone users at an affordable price to let them enjoy the same benefits and find joy in self-expression.
OPPO has planned to conduct a special promotion to encourage the customers who purchase OPPO A83 from selected stores island wide on 27th of January and chance to win valuable gifts.
The F-series and A-series products from OPPO, particularly the integrated beauty function, have proved to be especially popular among the young and trendy.
OPPO A83 is the new generation selfie expert. It comes with an 8 MP front lens + 13 MP rear lens, and uses the A.I.
In simple terms, the A.I. Beauty Recognition Technology is like a thinking photographer rather than a rigid software program. OPPO's A.I. beauty recognition technology employs a cloud database from premium suppliers that have sufficient power to support diversified facial recognition in smart terminals. For shots with moving subjects, issues such as structural and face deformation often occur.
A83 measures 5.7 inches, but the size of the screen is now 5 inches with the bezel ratio of the device being extremely narrow at 18:9, a major improvement over past models.
A83 is also equipped with face unlock. Just align the phone with your face to unlock the phone quickly. You no longer have to worry about aligning your finger or wet hands anymore.
OPPO A83 is tailored for outstanding performance and to where it matters most for young consumers. The super-large 3GB operating memory allows young people to enjoy their favorite games while three independent card slots (Double Nano-SIM cards with the TF slot) enable users to have 2 mobile numbers for phone calls, and also to extend the phone memory to 256GB.

Padmaavat: Stroke of visual brilliance
Formerly titled Padmavathi Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Padmaavat has been much hyped about mainly due to the controversy surrounding the movie. Movie buffs might have ventured to theaters mainly out of curiosity. However they will not be disappointed because the veteran filmmaker had created a spectacle of visual brilliance.
Based on a Sufi poem of the same name written in 1540 by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, Padmaavat has its own uniqueness. It is Bansalis interpretation of the tale. Another factor which might arouse interest among the Sri Lankan movie enthusiasts is that Padmavathi is actually of Sri Lankan origin. Maharawal Ratan Singh, the ruler of Mewar, encounters her as he visits Sri Lanka to get pearls from the isle to take back to his queen. When Padmavathi and Ratan fall in love with each other he marries her and takes her back to India. This fairytale like atmosphere is brought out brilliantly in the deer hunting scene when we encounter Padmavathi for the first time. She is like a nymph in her glowing white attire as she leaps over the shrubs in pursuit of her prey.
Deepika Padukone plays her character to a tee. She delivers what could probably be the best performance in her career so far as she uses her words, gestures and eyes to express her emotions. She manages to carry the weight of the movie on her shoulders with ease with her beauty, brains and valour.
Shahid Kapoor who has taken critics by surprise due to the recent display of his acting prowess in Haidern and Udta Punjab, further proves his mettle by getting into Ratans shoes. He is a vision of regal glory and Rajput pride. Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji is seen as a barbaric Sultan, is consumed with a ravenous libido for power and flesh. He is obsessed with Padmavathi to the point of madness. The scenes between him and Shahid are some of the most engrossing as there is a chilling quality of good vs evil in them. The trio together makes a package of commendable acting talent. Aditi Rao Hydari too stands her ground in the supporting role as the naive Mehrunissa who discovers her husbands true identity too late. Each and every member in the cast is spot on with their roles. The costumes are breath taking and the dialogues are effective. There is not a dull moment in this larger-than-life retelling.
The only minus point probably lies in the effects in the action/ war scenes. These do not meet the expectations raised by a film of this standard. The songs too could have been more infectious but provide visual delight.

Pathfinder Foundation hosts symposium on The Belt and Road Initiative in Singapore
The Pathfinder Foundation in collaboration with the National University of Singapore organised a one-day joint symposium on The Belt and Road Initiative: the Politics, Potentials & Partnerships in Singapore Orchard Hotel on Monday.
This is the address made by Chairman, Pathfinder Foundation Bernard Goonetilleke.
I was based in Beijing18 years ago. Like other diplomats, who were based there, I was amazed at the rapid pace of development. However, the Chinese leaders saw a serious contradiction in their development model. That was, Western China lagging behind the Eastern seaboard.
The remedy prescribed by the Chinese leaders was to Go West to provinces like Gansu, Yunnan, Qinghai and autonomous regions like Xinjiang, Tibet and Ningxia.
Over 13 years later in 2013, the Chinese President concluded that Chinese prosperity lies beyond its borders and China needs to spread its wings and move farther west. They realized that their planfor prosperity could be achieved by reviving the ancient silk roads, both land and sea, covering Asia, Africa and Europe.
The railroads laid since then across Central Asia and Levant, provided access to many cities in Western Europe, and investment made in ports and other infrastructure along the maritime silk roadmade it possible for Chinese companies to own, or co-own, numerous ports all the way to Europe.
Five years ago, it may still have been a distant dream, but not so, today. Recently, China invited south American countries to join BRI. It appears that BRI is now poised to circle the globe, and countries stand to gain by joining the Chinese caravan!
Politics
We are living in a world immersed in politics and politics permeates every aspect of our lives. So, it is not a surprise that BRI being politicised. I recall some years ago in a western capital, I was asked: Are you not afraid of China making inroads in to your country I did not think it was an expression of concern about the well-being of my country.
Being westerners, who had the world wrapped around their fingers for over five centuries, they were worried about reawakening of China. They were aware that as China advances, they should retreat. This is not a happy prospect for those who controlled vast regions ofland and equally vast stretches of oceans for centuries.
And there are others, who opposes BRI overbilateral issues.Non-participation at theBRI summit held last May by some major countries demonstrates how politics come to fore. On the other hand, what happened in Sri Lanka in 2015 is a good example, how political intrigues play critical roles, either in favour or against projects of this nature.
Potentials
The Silk Road Economic Belt, 21st century Maritime Silk Road and economic corridors connecting Chinas Xinjian with Pakistans Gwadar port, and Kunming with Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, are estimated to cost app. US$ 900billionto Chinese financial institutions, including the Silk Road Fund, AIIB etc.
Details of projects listed as deliverables under the BRI cover areas such as policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people to people connectivity.
Granted, all these projects may not see the light of day and some may even fail at some stage or other, as the case with any project. Yet, even if part of these projects eventually succeeds, we could witness transformation of economies of at least one third of the countries in the world, which will not be a mean achievement.
If we were to take ports of Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka and KyaukPyu in Myanmaras examples, associated with those ports, there will be massive special economic zones, which would bring large number of industries to those under-developed regions with resultant positive andnegative consequences. The situation in other countries will not be any different. Such is the potential of BRI.
Partnership building
Partnership building through BRI appears to be the expectation of China. Importance of BRI to China could be understood by the recent decision taken to amend the Constitution of CPC to include promotion of BRI as one of Chinas major future objectives.
The stated objective of China is to build a community of shared interest and achieve shared growth through discussion and collaboration.
It is quite clear that China is preparing itself to assume global leadership, economically as well as politically. Partnership building appears to be a priority to succeed in their quest.
In this context, what comes to my mind is whatthe Prime Minister of Singaporewrote on the Special ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit held in Delhi on January 25. He said,Major global trends are reshaping the strategic outlook, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The strategic balance is shifting.
Negotiators would confirm that the Chinese are hard bargainers. Myanmar was reportedly planning to have a 50/50 deal over the strategic KyaukPyuport.
However, reports indicate that eventually Yangon had to yield to Chinese demands for a 70% stake! Sri Lanka too, had to bargain hard and what they ended up with, may not be a bargain.
The morale of the story is that proponents should come up with projects that would provide a reasonable return on investment and seek to minimize negative consequences such as degradation of environment.
Above all, they should also learn to bargain hard and not fall victim to corruption, so that the Belt and Road Initiative will be a win-win situation for both China as well as the participating countries.
Pathfinder and future
In conclusion, I wish to say that the Pathfinder Foundation is happy tobe associated with the Instituteof South Asian Studies(ISAS) of the National University of Singapore,to take part in this symposium along with the historical Sichuan University.
Having seen the enthusiastic participation, I am confident that the participants would conclude the symposium served its purpose by connecting Singapore and Sri Lanka, two significant hubs of the Maritime Silk Road. Pathfinder Foundation looks forward for similar joint events with ISASin the future.

Philippine farmers defy volcano
THE PHILIPPINES: As blistering lava spews from the seething volcano nearby, Philippine farmer Jay Balindang leads his buffalo through the ash-strewn paddy fields of the no-go zone, creeping closer to danger in a desperate bid to support his family.
Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from around the erupting Mayon volcano, as a white-hot cocktail of gas and volcanic debris streaks down its flanks, threatening local communities who rely on the fertile land at its base.
Fearing a significant eruption that could engulf whole swathes of the nearby land in burning rock and lava flows, authorities have cordoned-off a nine kilometre (six mile) danger zone around Mayon.
But that has not stopped defiant farmers like Balindang from tending to crops and livestock that are a crucial part of their livelihoods.
Each day the father-of-eight leaves his children at a government evacuation centre, sneaking past police as he returns to his small farm at the foot of the volcano to feed his precious carabao water buffalo.
I am not afraid of the volcano. We are used to its activity, the 37-year-old told AFP, at the edge of his rain-lashed rice fields, a few kilometres inside the danger zone.
Farmers make up around 10,000 of the 84,000 people displaced by the eruption of Mayon in Albay province, some 330 kilometres southeast of Manila.
The lush region is famous for its chili peppers, as well as less fiery crops like rice, corn and vegetables.
All are threatened by the volatile volcano, which has gushed molten lava and belched giant clouds of superheated ash since it began erupting two weeks ago.
Local authorities say that beyond the immediate damage to crops caused by the coating of smoldering embers, there are concerns that heavy rainfall could combine with ash and rock to form deadly, fast-moving mudflows that could sweep away entire settlements and block vital rivers.
This is a new and daunting challenge to our agriculture workers who in the past had to cope with typhoons, landslides and floods, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said.
Farmers are among the most vulnerable to the meteorological miseries that afflict the Philippines, which is hit by an average of 20 typhoons a year and is in the earthquake-prone volcanic belt around the Pacific known as the Ring of Fire.
The 2,460-metre (8,070-foot) Mayon has been both a blessing and a curse to the farmers living near its slopes for generations.
Volcanic ash can kill vegetation immediately after an eruption, but as it seeps into the ground it can also enrich the soil with minerals that sustain future crops.
If the ash is thin, it would become a fertiliser but if the ash is thick it would mean farmers who had spent money a lot of money to plant the vegetables lose everything, Renato Solidum, head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told AFP.
Vegetable prices have already begun to soar in parts of Albay as the eruption hampers access to key crops.
We are very famous for these dishes wherein the (taro) leaves are being grown just at the foot of Mount Mayon, Elsa Maranan, chief of the agriculture departments local breeding station, told AFP.But many still make a daily hazardous dash back to their own land.
Balindang said the choice was clear -- if he ensures that his pigs, carabaos and cows are fed, then his family will also be assured of something to eat.
Its very difficult because I dont know if we will have any rice left to harvest. For now, we have nothing, he said. - AFP

Police instructed to act independently against election law violators
The Police are given 'professional freedom' to act independently and take action against election law violators, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said yesterday.
"If the Police fail to take action, that is a weakness on their part. I reiterate that the Police must take action against wrongdoers irrespective of their party affiliations," Minister Ratnayaka added, addressing a meeting in the Deniyaya district.
"The Police have been depoliticized. They don't have to take instructions from political authorities. We have resolved their salary issues and given better infrastructure. Therefore, the Police must now step up and deliver," the Law and Order Minister stressed.
He also stated that those who conduct election campaigns in accordance with election laws should not be harassed by others.
Commenting on the Gin-Nilwala project affecting the Matara district, Minister Ratnayaka said the project was launched by the previous government without a proper feasibility study.
"There were allegations in the past that there were some underhand deals behind the implementation of the project. After the current government came to power, we came to an agreement that the project should not be resumed without a proper feasibility study. If the feasibility study suggests that the negatives of the project outweigh the positives, I will certainly oppose the project," he added.
"There is no point in carrying out development projects jeopardizing the lives of the people in the area. At the same time, there should not be any room for bribery, corruption and underhand deals," the Minister said, adding that he would personally look into the developments with regard to the Gin-Nilwala project.
The Gin-Nilwala project was initiated by the previous government mainly to provide water for cultivation in the Hambantota district. There were allegations that Rs. 4 billion had been paid to a private contractor for the construction of the project, although the project is yet to be started. It was also alleged that the private contractor was selected bypassing standard tender procedures.

Presidents move to ban re-export of pepper, tea hailed
The Spices and Allied Products Producers and Traders Association yesterday expressed satisfaction over the decision taken by the government to ban the re-export of pepper from Sri Lanka with effect from February 10, 2018.
The Spices and Allied Products Producers and Traders Association organization said it was happy to learn from the media that President Maitripala Sirisena has directed that the re-export of pepper from Sri Lanka would be banned from February 10 2018.This step is in the right direction to protect Sri Lanka pepper.
In addition to pepper, President Sirisena also stated that the re-export of tea will also be stopped immediately. The President expressed these views at a public rally held in Badulla recently.
According to President Sirisena, the import and re-export of pepper amid low global prices has hurt the industry growth prospects to a great extent and has led to a collapse of the industry.
The President further noted that the import and re-export of tea has also negatively impacted the image of Ceylon Tea. The 50-percent concession given to farmers on seed potatoes would also be increased to 100 percent, the President noted. (IH)

Setting trends on the sax
Kumar Molligoda is an excellent Saxophonist. He is also a trendsetter when it come to the guitar and the Saxophone. Melodies features Molligoda whose success is all about hard work, dedicated practice and love for playing the Saxophone.
I did not start my musical career with the Saxophone. I started my career on a chromatic harmonica. I started my career with my own little jazz band in 1958. I did my first radio program with the chromatic harmonica. Then from that I got into singing rock and roll. Even when I started playing guitar I started a different trend. There were other guitarists in this country, and I started playing rock and roll guitar with a different style altogether. I was the first to start that.
I was playing the guitar and singing rock and roll, and then I was asked to join a big dance band, the Manhattans dance band as their guitarist. The band was then playing at the Galle Face Hotel for weddings, said Molligoda.
However it was the Saxophone that would really make his name. And he devoted his time to the perfection of playing the Saxophone.
While I was playing in the band, I had this liking to play a blowing instrument. A trombone or a Saxophone. So I thought I would settle on a Saxophone. I bought an old disused Saxophone for Rs. 50 which was lying under a bed.
I then started playing and practicing on that. Later in 1963, I bought another Saxophone for Rs. 830 and within one month of playing the Saxophone, I was good enough to play for a radio program. It was in July 1958. At that time to get a radio program was very rare. That was Radio Ceylon, stated Molligoda.
It was then that he joined a group called the Fireflies (1964). Mr. Earl Arnolda the manager of this band had heard about him playing the Saxophone and asked Molligoda to come and meet him.
I went and met him and then he asked me to join the band. At that time there were groups known as beat groups such as the Jetliners, Cosmonauts, Red Dragons and Hellions etc. Then everybody in Colombo heard a new sound. A guitar group with a Saxophone. I started playing what was popular in America at that time. I started playing that music with this band, said Molligoda.
Molligoda became famous for his particular sound and style of playing. On a Saxophone not everyone can get the same sound. It all depends on individual ability. You need a very good sound and a very good style to be a professional Sax player at international level.
I was the first Saxophonist on the pop music scene and other beat groups began to copy this trend and added a Saxophonist to their line- up such as Ivan Jayaratne, Randy Peiris and Derrick Stewart.
When you listen to me playing you cant make out the difference between me and a foreign Saxophonist, I would say very modestly. Before I entered the music scene no one cared much about the Saxophone. But when I started playing producing the sound produced by international players, then everyone started taking notice of this instrument the Saxophone, explained Molligoda.
Before him the dance bands had Saxophonists. In dance bands there were plenty of Saxophonists. But their tone and style were old fashioned and not exciting. Therefore people began to hear a different tone and style when Molligoda started playing the Saxophone.
With the first dance band I played I used to play guitar and not Saxophone. But I had to give up playing guitar when I started on Saxophone. After Fireflies I joined the Spitfires and then I started my own band in 1967, and later played at the Galle Face Hotel, Mascarilla night club. We were the youngest band in a night club in Sri Lanka in 1969. Our music was of a very high standard and some of the musicians in my band are now internationally famous such as drummer Junior Weerasinghe and guitarist Raja Jalaldeen, added Molligoda.
Passion for music started at an early age for Molligoda. It ran in the family.
My mother was a good singer of Sinhalese songs. So there was always music in our house. We always had a gramaphone in our house. And we always had a radio. That was very rare those days. That background made me passionate about music. I used to listen to the radio. My father liked Western Music and my mother liked Oriental music. We had a lot of Western records at home. I listened to the radio and they had all these jazz programs, said Molligoda.
Molligoda firmly believes that to be a successful musician you need to be above average. When he started playing the guitar in time he made a name for himself as a rock and roll singer, appearing on Malcolm Andrees stage shows.
So when I started playing the Saxophone I was already well known. But the biggest hurdle for me was when I got into the Western Music Scene, the majority of the musicians were from Colombo schools and they lived in Colombo while I was from Kotte having studied in Christian College, the second oldest school in the island. I felt a bit like an outsider because I came in to a field with veteran musicians with several decades of experience.
As a saxophonist I was only a beginner compared to the musicians in the dance bands of that time. I overcame that challenge by sheer perseverance and came to the top beating many of the established musicians, pointed out Molligoda.
Among his many tastes in music, Jazz takes pride of place. It is a way of expressing himself. He needs the freedom to express himself because jazz is all about improvisation.
If you dont have good taste and you are not an expert on your instrument you cant play Jazz. Then what you play will not be acceptable.
In America there was a racial problem. The black musicians were not allowed to come up for many years. But after some time with the emancipation Jazz played by the blacks became popular and ultimately the whites had to give them a place. Today black musicians are accepted around the world as the best jazz musicians, stated Molligoda.
However he still asserts that the bias is still there. Foreigners think he is miming.
They think that a Sri Lankan cannot play Saxophone the way I do and they come up to me and place their ears, to the bell of my saxophone to see whether I was really playing. My message to them is that though we are Sri Lankans we are equal to them! Today we have several outstanding musicians performing in the international arena such as pianist Mahesh Balasuriya, Dinuk Wijeratne, bass guitarist Jiffry Hussein and drummer Junior Weerasinghe, argues Molligoda.
Molligoda has made many sacrifices in his life. His devotion to the Saxophone has been physically and mentally demanding. Yet he still loves it.
I am a self- taught Saxophonist. To be a really good Saxophonist you need to be an expert on your instrument. You need to make a lot of sacrifices. I for one lost a lot of family time. I was hardly at home and I have also missed a lot of sleep. There is a lot of physical exertion when playing Sax, because the instrument is very heavy. You also need to blow powerfully with your lungs. I blow very hard because I have to produce a good tone. After 15 minutes you are spent, and you need to play for another three hours at least. Though I am tired I keep on playing as I am used to it. You lips also get cut, summed up Molligoda.
This year I will be completing 60 consecutive years of active performance in the music field with 59 consecutive New Years Eve performances which is a record for a Sri Lankan musician. I believe that record may never be equaled or broken by any other Sri Lanka musician.

Spin-heavy Bangladesh to face upbeat Sri Lanka in 1st Test
CHITTAGONG, Monday: Bangladesh are depending on their spin force led by veteran Abdur Razzaq to deliver the opening punch against Sri Lanka in the first of two Tests starting Wednesday.
Razzaq, 35, was the third spinner added to the squad for the match in Chittagong after skipper and star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out with a finger injury.
Uncapped left-arm orthodox spinner Sunzumul Islam and leg-spinner Tanbir Hayder are also part of the 16-man squad to be led by Mahmudullah Riyad.
Razzaq, who played the last of his 12 Tests against West Indies in 2014, is determined to prove that the selectors made the right call.
Shakib is the best player, not just in our team (but) he is also the best all-rounder in the world, Razzaq told reporters in Chittagong on Monday.
Its difficult to replace him because you need to pick a bowler and batsman in his place and still there is no guarantee that they will perform equally good.
I will try to play my normal game without trying anything extraordinary, the left-arm spinner said.
Bangladesh have been a dominant home side after registering memorable Test wins against England and Australia in the 2016-17 season.
But their only Test win against Sri Lanka came in their landmark 100th Test in Colombo, when the visitors drew the two-match series 1-1.
Sri Lanka, led by Dinesh Chandimal, are upbeat after their recent triumph in the tri-series one-day international tournament. They beat Bangladesh in Dhaka on Saturday.
They will also seek inspiration from their 2-0 Test triumph over Pakistan in the UAE last year.
However Sri Lanka also have a gap to fill after veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews was ruled out of the first game due to injury.
Manager Asanka Gurusinha confirmed that the team would not seek a replacement for Mathews. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have so far played 18 Tests against each other, with the islanders winning 15 of them.
Squads:
BANGLADESH: Mahmudullah Riyad (capt), Tamim Iqbal, Liton Das, Mushfiqur Rahim, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Mosaddek Hossain, Taijul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Kamrul Islam, Mehedi Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Naeem Hasan, Sunzamul Islam, Tanbir Hayder, Abdur Razzaq.
SRI LANKA: Dinesh Chandimal (capt), Dimuth Karunaratne, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Roshen Silva, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Dilruwan Perera, Dushmantha Chameera, Lakshan Sandakan, Akila Dananjaya, Lahiru Gamage, Lahiru Kumara. - AFP

Splash, splat an aqua balloon battle bash!
What I miss seeing most is screaming kids running around uninhibited, freely wheeling, causing chaos and raising cane which is how my generation grew up. We got the bumps and bruises to show for it. I call this thing active free play.
More than half a century may have passed since those adventuresome times of our own childhood but we boomers often revel in conjuring up those exciting images with an aching nostalgia. Sad really, because play time is in short supply for children these days and the lifelong consequences for growing children can be more serious than many people realise.
Unfortunately, children today are not given the freedom to frolic. Are their opportunities for free play the same as ours were Emphatically not! Spending hours riding a bike, climbing trees and exploring their environs are no longer part of everyday life for many kids. They are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children.
They are not enjoying the opportunities to play outdoors that our parents would have thought of as normal when we were growing up. I am not talking about regimented extra-curricular sports activities organised by most schools under the supervision of coaches. Organised sports are imperative, but so are spontaneous romps through mud puddles, climbing trees and catching fish in nearby streams. Flashbacks often pop up in our minds of we as children racing towards a large mango or other indigenous tree and hauling ourselves up on to the lower branches and then scrambling up as high as we could get.
We loved our contact sports, colliding with one another without safety gear or, for the most part, any structured set of rules about how and where one could smash an opponent. We called concussions Stunner Stars and stoically cajoled the injured party to walk it off, as if somehow walking would make your star-spangled head feel better. Sure, we may have diced with death and injury on a daily basis. We realise now that by todays safety standards, every baby boomer should have been dead by the time we were 12.
We defied danger on a daily basis. We never knew that we were doing risky things, of course. We just thought that we were having fun. Nonetheless, we spent our days immersed in activities that wed never for a second allow our children or grandchildren to do. Or even think about doing.
At a recent luncheon get-together I decided to give the kids a chance to enjoy the daring frolicking of my own childhood. But if you, like me, are the type who cares for a bit of asinine over-indulgence, then we seem to be on the same wavelength. You see, with a little imagination and temerity you can be assured of a memorable yahoo free-for-all fun with the kids and achieve near immortality as an incomparable avuncular hero. Observing the horde of kids languishing in boredom I was zapped by a burst or rather splash of inspiration.
Remember our childhood days when nothing constituted a scream like pulling out the garden hose and going a little bonkers in the yard while watering the grass Getting blasted with a stream of cold water on a hot dog-day afternoon is a thrill for any kid  or anyone attempting to escape the heat, for that matter. From water bazookas and Super Soaker water guns to buckets and garden hoses, I taught the brats to discover the wet and wild delights of a modern water fight. And its not for the faint hearted!
Another great way to beat the heat is a good old fashioned wet and wild day with a water balloon conflict.
The simplest ideas are often the greatest and with prevailing sanity came the thought of the most humble and effective ballistic ever invented: The water bomb. The formula for fashioning one is no big deal either. Simply fill a balloon with tap water and tie a knot at its mouth. And presto! You're ready for battle.
Water balloon battles could be considered one of the most exciting games imaginable. To tell the truth they are simply irresistible for both kids and bratty adults. Plan them with a group of adults, the next time you have a get-together, and see them getting all charged up, cheery and uncontrollable like kids. There was a moment's astonished silence as the water balloons burst on impact, showering their contents in a silvery cascade on opponents.
Yet, getting nailed over and over again with bursting balloons until the backs of their legs were red and their clothes were soaked would rank as one of the very best memories of their childhood. At the moment, however, it was a blast, even though it kind of hurt and seemed it would take them forever to come down off the adrenaline they worked up trying to dodge that sweet sting of bursting latex-encased liquid. The impromptu event was also the ultimate in imperfect science, while the adversaries had hardly the time or patience to figure out the amount of force necessary to soak the enemy.
Certainly, by epic Homeric battle tradition the gods appeared to have looked out over the fighters, making their legs swift with courage and their arms sharp with thrust. No individual faces could be seen in the haze of violent action. Neither were gender differences evident as the combatants gave no quarter in the confrontational fun. The girls around 11 were togged out in shorts and t-shirts - ideal battle gear to drench and be drenched.
In all, it took speed and strength and skill and courage as the contenders faced one another with shrieking battle cries that resounded across the lawn. It was full scale war where you might get sprinkled, sprayed, or saturated. But watch out, retaliation comes quickly!
Ryan, 6, the littlest warrior, like brave Odysseus before him, grabbed three water balloons and thrust them like daggers into oncoming enemies. He was targeting an older boy who he called Boogerface and his sole aim was to douse him to his Spiderman briefs. His older cousin, a pretty 11-year-old held her fire until she was certain she had her main male antagonist in the cross-hairs of her sights. But all was not daring and vigour. The worthless coward she pursued with grim determination, fled from the battlefield and dove frightened into a herbaceous hedge
And finally, fighters were discouraged from head shots and told to aim lower, which means a good many adolescent male warriors were constrained to cover their groins with their palms  not the most dignified nor practical method of retreat while fleeing for their lives. At the end of the monumental conflict the fighters, soaked and panting with exhaustion, noticed that all of the ammunition was gone. What remained of them were scattered shards of latex, strewn about the battlefield. Watching the kids revel in the battle was magnificently restorative to my jaded senses and one of life's sweetest moments.

SRI LANKA PARTICIPATES AT AMBASSADOR FORUM IN BAHRAIN
The high profile Ambassadors Forum on Entrepreneurship and SME Development  East Meets West in Bahrain was conducted and organized by Bahrain SMEs Society and Union of Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) Entrepreneurs under the patronage of Vision 2030 of the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain.
Each year, this Regional Forum selects two serving Ambassadors with extensive experience in the sphere of Entrepreneurship Development and SMEs to speak on the topic and to reflect insights and thoughts of their respective regions and the world at large.
This year Ambassador of Sri Lanka, Dr. A. Saj U. Mendis, and Ambassador of Germany, Alfred Simms-Portz, were invited to address the Forum respectively. Former Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, Ambassador Dr. Dhafer Alumran, moderated the Forum. A large number of select invitees were present including secretaries & senior officials of Ministries, senior bureaucrats and technocrats, ambassadors and diplomats based in Bahrain, corporate executives and leaders, presidents and board members of SME and entrepreneur associations in the region and academia, among others.
The moderator and both the speakers accentuated the vitality and seminality of the SME sector to any country, be it a developed nation or a developing nation.
Ambassador Dr. Mendis, in his address, stated that the Government of Sri Lanka is extending increasing degree of importance and significance to the SME sector and to entrepreneurship development. This is particularly because a vibrant and robust SME sector coupled with entrepreneurship development could fuel economic and commercial advancement.
Further, both the speakers added that the SME sector is often referred and defined as the backbone of any given economy. However, the critical role played by the SME sector has not been extended due prominence and significance opposed to Fortune 500 companies and other large multi-national corporates.
Dr. Mendis stressed that the development of SME sector could reduce unemployment & inequality and engender innovative ideas, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, thus unleashing the entrepreneurial capabilities and unlocking the potentials.
He also stated the Government Policy Framework fosters and nurtures micro-enterprises to become small enterprises to become mid-size enterprises to large enterprises to national players and regional players respectively.
The Ambassador of Germany stated that over 99% of enterprises and firms in the European Union are categorized as SMEs. He expounded in detail of the assistance and cooperation extended by the Government of Germany to uplift and to enhance the efficacy of SME sector. He also added that Germany, being the fourth largest economy in the world, the SME sector and entrepreneurial development play a critical and crucial role in advancement of the economy. The moderator and both the speakers stated that almost all Fortune 500  and listed companies in the world began as micro-enterprises (MSMEs), defined as less than 10 employees.
It was interesting to note that the largest money center banks, manufacturing companies and global technology behemoths such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Face-book and Google began not only as MSMEs but also in garages. Both the speakers enunciated the fact that these global companies and their respective founders had a well-defined vision to make them global players within a particular passage of time.
The key objectives of the Ambassador Forum were to exchange innovative ideas with different companies as well as with countries, to explore strategies to evolve and map-out entrepreneurship development in different countries with varying degrees of advancement, to find out challenges confronted by the global fraternity of SMEs and cross-fertilization of varied experiences of countries, among others.
Further, the SME Society and Union of GCC Entrepreneurs expressed keenness and eagerness to work and to nurture the SME Sector, particularly, with developing nations such as Sri Lanka.
For record, Ambassador of Germany, Alfred Simms-Protz, is one of the most senior career Foreign Service Officers of German Foreign Service and is a senior lawyer by profession.

Sri Lanka, Romania and Kenya leading frontier markets - Citi Bank
The Citi Bank Group in their rating model on leading frontier markets shows Sri Lanka, Romania and Kenya as the most attractive markets based on six key metrics: earnings momentum, price momentum, valuation, macro growth and imbalances and monetary policy.
Citi Banks rating model gives investors a macro view of prospects for 12 countries.
We thought Sri Lanka was cheap, but it turns out to be really cheap, Andrew Howell frontier markets strategist at Citi Bank noted. Its a market you probably want to look at closely, Howell, said. Frontier markets are in prime position to pioneer the use of block chain technologies and to lead in the use and development of crypto currencies, according to frontier-focused investment bank Exotix.
We may be at the beginning of another episode of technology leapfrogging as frontier economies move straight to block chain distributed ledgers and crypto currencies as alternatives for weak domestic institutions and capital controls, Paul Domjan, Exotixs global head of research, City Bank said.
In an interview with WSJ Frontiers, Domjan argued that block chains, which underlie cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, could be invaluable in recording contracts, enabling transactions and establishing ownership in countries where institutions are weak.
The cryptocurrencies themselves are already proving popular in countries such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela where faith in the conventional currency is low.
Exotix made its prediction in a report on the key themes that could provide new opportunities for investors in frontier markets. Among the other themes it identified were Chinas changing engagement with frontier markets from a predominantly extractive relationship to one based more on partnership, and the impact of mobile money, particularly the evolution of e-commerce businesses built around mobile money services.

Stokes team splashes out in IPL auction as England stars miss out
Bangalore, Sunday: Rising pace bowler Jaydev Unadkat joined Ben Stokes in the Rajasthan Royals for $1.8 million on Sunday but a host of foreign stars failed to get deals in the Indian Premier League auction.
The Royals made Unadkat the second most expensive player in the auction behind Englands Stokes who they bought for $1.96 million on the opening day.
Stokes -- still facing an assault criminal case in England -- and Unadkat will join Australian captain Steve Smith at the Royals as they return to the lucrative T20 league after a two-year illegal gambling ban.
The Royals were inaugural IPL champions in 2008 but were barred for two seasons with Chennai Super Kings in 2015 over an illegal gambling scandal.
The team also paid almost $1 million for uncapped Indian off-spinner Krishnappa Gowtham as they splashed out more than $10.3 million over the weekend. But they are certain it is money well spent.
Royals executive chairman Ranjit Borthakur shrugged off any doubts about Stokes legal troubles preventing him from playing in India.
We are prepared for legal consequences too. He will be a very important part of the team. We are like a start-up company. We are restarting, Borthakur said.
There was disappointment though as a host of England players failed to find bidders, including Test skipper Joe Root, one day captain Eoin Morgan and opener Alex Hales.
Root, along with South Africas Hashim Amla and Sri Lanka paceman Lasith Malinga did not attract bids in Saturdays first round and were not even called back for the second day.
South Africa quick Dale Steyn, Australia batsman Shaun Marsh, as well as New Zealands Corey Anderson and Martin Guptill were called back but did not attract an offer.
West Indies batsman Chris Gayle only found a place in the third round of bidding when Kings XI Punjab claimed him at the reserve price of $314,000.
Gayle is one of the T20 leagues most prolific scorers but disappointed last year with just 200 runs in nine games for Royal Challengers Bangalore.
The second day belonged to Indian and lesser-known talent with the 26-year-old Unadkat, who has played one Test and seven one-day internationals, drawing bigger bids than big home names.
Indian batsmen Manish Pandey and Lokesh Rahul both pocketed $1.7 million after being sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab respectively on Saturday.
Mumbai Indians on Sunday took West Indies left-handed opener Evin Lewis for $600,000.
Among other foreign players to draw bids was Australia all-rounder Dan Christian, who was sold to Delhi Daredevils for $238,000 and Englands Sam Billings went to Chennai for $158,000.
Teenage leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane became the first Nepalese to land an IPL deal. Delhi Daredevils paid $318,000 for him.
Lamichhane, 17, took 14 wickets in the under-19 World Cup last year when Nepal came eighth.
We will have some new fans for IPL. It will be good for the kid, I hope this will start a cricket revolution in Nepal, said Delhi Daredevils chief executive Hemant Dua said.
Some 581 players were up for auction ahead of the season which runs from April 7 to May 27. The IPL has been boosted by a new five year $2.5-billion media deal. AFP

## Title: STRUGGLE OF UP-COUNTRY ESTATE TAMILS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, January 30, 2018 - 01:00
STRUGGLE OF UP-COUNTRY ESTATE TAMILS
On a recent evening, Elizabeth Mary stood outside her line home on the Pedro Estate in Nuwara Eliya, occasionally batting flies from her hands and face.
She pointed out a drain running across from her house that was filled with stagnant water. It smells so bad, she said. Our surroundings are so unhygienic.
But she doesnt have the time to press the management who controls the land to fix it. Although she has no children, she takes care of her 73-year-old mother, and cannot work.
If I work 24 days a month I will get around 9,000 Rupees, she said. So I work 6 days a week.
Ever since being brought to Sri Lanka by the British in the 1800s to work in the plantations, the lives of the people in the up-country have largely been defined by struggle.
Up-Country Tamils, or Indian-origin Tamils, had their citizenship rights stripped from them in 1948. Successive governments have slowly granted citizenship to portions of the population through piece-meal political deals over the years, culminating in the Grant of Citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin Act of 2003, just 15 years ago.
MP M. Thilakarajah, Nuwara Eliya District.
Now, workers and community leaders say they are desperately trying to catch up to the rest of the country.
The government did not give any interest to these people. They were not citizens of Sri Lanka, said Mylvaganam Thilakarajah, an MP from the Nuwara Eliya district who grew up on an estate himself. So they have been neglected from education, health, roads and infrastructure, every area.
Those costs are physical: the tea estates have the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country and about 30 percent of children below 5 are underweight, according to the World Bank.
Now as the battle in the countrys central highlands has turned to the immediate issues of the day  wages, housing, health, plumbing and clean water  the legacy of those citizenship battles persist.
MP Thilakarajah said its hard to understand todays issues without remembering the fight for the most basic right: being recognized as a citizen in the eyes of your state.
He said the lives of the people in the up-country mirrors the lives of the plant they spend their lives tending.
A tea bush is actually a tree, he said. They only look like bushes because they have been kept like that. Its like this with the people.
Stripped of rights
The British colonizers began bringing labourers to Sri Lanka from South India in the 1820s to work on the islands coffee plantations. They were kept as captive labour, made to do the back-breaking work of clearing the jungles and starting Sri Lankas plantation economy from the ground.
This brutal history is reflected in the landscape: most of the islands cloud forests and upland jungles have been transformed by hand into neat, terraced estates. Theres a place near Haputale known in Tamil as Crying Hills, in memory of all the people who died there clearing the forests.
For about a century, the Tamil estate workers did not haveany organization, according to MP Thilakarajah. There was not any political or trade union or anything, he said in a recent interview.
But in the 1920s, inspired by Russian Revolution and political organising in India, Up-Country Tamils formed their first trade union, and began agitating for citizenship rights in the colonial state.
Just before independence the number of Indian-origin Tamils working in and around the estates was about 11 percent of the total population.
Soon after independence, though, Parliament passed two acts which would affect the lives of these communities for years to come: the Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Indian and Pakistani Residents Act of 1949.
Although these acts were ostensibly about clarifying who was a citizen of this new nation-state, they implicitly ensured that certain people, specifically Indian Tamils, would not become citizens, writes Daniel Bass, an anthropologist who has extensively studied the Up-Country Tamil Community.
Before these acts were passed Up-Country Tamils had rights almost equal to any other person in colonial Ceylon, he writes. These two (acts) effectively deprived over one million Up-Country Tamils of their legal and civil citizenship.
The sad irony of this maneuver  or as many historians argue, part of the reason for it in the first place  is that the year before, Up-Country Tamils had elected seven Indian-origin Tamil MPs to Parliament.
They had also helped to elect nine Marxist Sinhala MPs, which rattled the elitist political establishment.
Anti-Indian sentiments mingled with anti-communist feelings and made a combustive mix, according to Bass. Up-Country Tamils not only lost their political and civil citizenship, but also lost official recognition of their social and cultural citizenship.
For the first 100 years we have been kept, and within 30 years we rose up: the first trade union, then the State Council, then Parliamentarians, said MP Thilakarajah. And then in 1948: deprived.
It was a very pathetic period, 1948 he said.
The long road to citizenship
Nearly 20 years passed, and in 1964, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri tried to bring a political solution to the fact that nearly one million people of Indian origin were living in Sri Lankas highlands, unrecognized by any government.
The Agreement on Persons of Indian Origin in Ceylon, signed in October, said that 300,000 Up-Country Tamils would be granted citizenship, while more than 500,000 would be repatriated back to India.
The pact was widely criticized. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the prominent Tamil lawyer and politician, called it an unprecedented move in international relations for half a million people to be treated as pawns in the game of power politics.
MP Thilakarajah, then growing up on the Medacombara Estate near Watagoda, remembers friends and neighbors leaving for India.
After receiving an Indian passport from the high commission in Kandy, from my village, they got a ticket to Tiruchirappalli from the railway station, he said. It meant from here, all the way to there, they traveled with one ticket. But the agreement was implemented unevenly. Many Up-Country Tamils did not want to leave their livelihoods for homes they did not remember or never knew, and India was slow to repatriate the nearly half a million people.
When the ferry service between Sri Lanka and India was shut down during the civil war, the agreement effectively ceased.
By 2003, between 200,000 - 300,000 people of Indian origin were still stateless, according to a UN estimate. In that year Parliament passed the Grant of Citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin Act,which said that all stateless persons of Indian origin who had lived in Sri Lanka since October 1964, and their descendants, were eligible for citizenship.
But MP Thilakarajah said that even after 2003, and even after an additional act passed in 2009 to address war refugees, the citizenship battle is not over.
Being a citizen means not only voting, he said. There are other rights too, no
Still we dont have the public health sector to the estate plantation sector, which the other people are getting in the country, still the physical conditions are not the same on the estate schools, he added. So how can you say we are citizens of this country
Professor Bass agreed.
Those decades of neglect and indifference are hard to combat and take a long time to undo, he said in an interview.
Always Sri Lankan
Suppaya Rajasekaran is a 68-year-old teacher and local historian living in Watagoda. From his classroom one can hear the whistles of the train engines making their daily trips back and forth from Colombo to Badulla.
Even if you ask people around here about citizenship, they would say they do not know, he said in a recent interview. They think that they have always been Sri Lankan citizens.
That battle has been eclipsed by the urgent issues of the day, he said. The line homes where many people live do not have adequate plumbing or sewage, people dont feel they are paid enough for the heavy labour they do in the fields every day, and the schools on the estates do not have the same resources as on other parts of the island. On top of that, Rajasekaran said, people are losing faith in the trade unions who have traditionally represented them in Colombo.
The trade unions are very selfish; they will not let anything good happen for these people, he said. They are leading happy lives by pointing out the difficulties of this vulnerable group.
With the local elections approaching, Rajasekaran said he is urging people in his community to vote independently. I tell them: Vote for a person who you think will do something good for you. We need someone to represent us, he said.
At the Pedro Estate, Elizabeth Mary and her neighbours made their demands clear. They spoke of wages and sending their children to school so they might have a better life.
I will not let my children become tea pluckers, said Vasantha Rani, who has worked for 34 years in the fields. I want them to get good jobs and lead a better life. I do not want to see my children suffer.
But the question of citizenship appeared to be settled.
I dont know about this citizenship, Elizabeth Mary said. I am Sri Lankan, I have always been Sri Lankan.

Tea export earnings rise sharply in 2017
Sri Lanka customs data analysed by Siyaka Research confirms that the country earned a highest ever Rs. 233.3 billion from tea exports in 2017.
A massive 26% or Rs. 48 billion more than 2016 figure of Rs. 184 billion.
The previous rupee record was Rs. 212 billion in 2014 earned from an export quantity of 327 Mnkg compared with 288 Mnkg this year. The approximate Dollar value of all exports is $ 1.53 bln, the highest since 2014 value of $1.63 bln. In that year the country exported a highest ever 327 Mnkg, 12% more.
This makes 2017 FOB value a record $ 5.30 well above the previous record of $ 5 achieved in 2014 and much more than the FOB price of $ 4.39 achieved in 2016.
This years figure is the lowest since 2009 when 289.6 Mnkg was exported. The countries export quantities peaked at 327.4 Mnkg in 2014 but have been sharply lower since then. A review of the different segments have bulk tea shipments at 43% with Packets at 47%.

The things time finds hard to take away
A senior Army officer told me a story about recruitment once. He said he would ask any candidate for any job a few questions. Among them, he said, were the following two:
What was the first job your father did followed by What does he do now, or if he doesnt work now, what was his last job
Strange questions. He had his reasons, though.
"If a man begins life as a cleaner in a bus and ends also as a cleaner, then it means he is incapable of bettering his circumstances. In general, sons follow their fathers. I would be reluctant to hire such a man."
I assumed he was talking about parents and children and not fathers and sons. If it was a mere matter of material advancement then it would seem unfair. Not all wealthy people were born into wealthy families, after all.
The officer was talking of attitude. Even then, there are probably many examples of industrious men and women who were born to vagrant fathers and mothers.
He explained further: "People change very little in a lifetime. They may accumulate wealth and considerably improve their standing in society, but their core compulsions dont change much." By way of elaboration he said, "It may happen in the rare case, but in general, attitudes and values remain pretty much the same. If that were not the case, then the matter of entering the right path and achieving Enlightenment wouldnt take so long that we had to talk of the saaraa saankhya kalpa lakshaya."
Even for the Buddha, it is said, it took countless lifetimes before the final bhava in which he discovered the Four Noble Truths and eventually reached a place devoid of all the suffering associated with the birth-death-birth continuum.
The Army officer, perhaps, was working with a small margin for error. Everyone has recruitment theories, everyone who has to recruit has the challenge of picking among the equally qualified. Everyone has rules of thumb. The officer claimed that his was a time-tested method. The story reminded me of an incident that took place two years ago at Royal College. Old boys of the Group of '83 had planned a grand reunion one Saturday evening. It was to be grand because this was the year that the boys turned 50. What was even more special about this reunion was that some 30 boys who had studied in the Tamil medium and who, apart from one person, lived abroad, had planned to attend it.
This is how it happened. The Tamil medium old boys had been planning a reunion of their classes. Some, who lived in North America, wanted to have it in Canada.
Those who lived Down Under wanted to do it in Australia. A neutral venue was proposed. Bali. Then Raj Rajadurai, who although domiciled in Australia, has been visiting Sri Lanka almost every year, suggested the following: "Lets meet in the land of our birth." And so they came.
It was special. The Group, as the name suggests, is made of those who sat their A/Ls in 1983. There are many ways to describe 1983. The following would work as well: It is a year that fractured the nation or rather saw cinders hidden by hastily strewn ash of multiple histories suddenly burst out as flames.
Almost all those who had studied in the Tamil medium left the country and restarted lives in all parts of the world. The war, hurt, fear and for other reasons including bad timing, resulted in them not attending the annual stag. But this year, they had come.
And so, on the day before the event, someone sent out a message on a whim: "Lets meet Saturday morning under the tamarind trees and play cricket."
Almost 50 people turned up, including most of the Tamil medium boys. Some of them were visiting Sri Lanka for the first time in 32 years. Most of them were meeting their Sinhala and English Medium brethren after decades.
A lot has happened in the interim but friendships and familiarity surprisingly had not suffered one scratch.
Whats pertinent to our story, however, is the cricket match. Those who wanted to play were selected into two teams by two captains randomly appointed by the crowd that had gathered. Like always, some preferred to watch. Others preferred to ignore the cricket and indulge in other entertainment.
Out there in the middle, boys who were 50 were trying to be boys who were 15. The pace was just not there; the heart was though. And minds it seemed had neither evolved nor degenerated.
Those who loved to bat, tried to retain strike. Those who were bad fielders hadnt improved. Those who were too lazy to run after the ball, didnt. And that was not because of age.
Those who used to be competitive, remained so. Those who just didnt care about the result, were as uncaring. The quiet ones were quiet.
It was as though people, at 50, had turned into schoolboys, although with less hair and more belly. A lovely time, by all accounts.
Bottom line: people hadnt changed much. Really. The Army officer may have had a point. (Malinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer. He can be contacted at [emailprotected]. www.malindawords.blogspot.com)

Those separated from SLFP will not return for pure politics: President
President Maithripala Sirisena asserted yesterday that the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that set up another front to safeguard and free the thieves could not sit again with the SLFP for a pure political career.
He said he extended his invitation to all the 96 members of SLFP to join him for he surely knew they would not come to stand with him.
He was addressing a rally in Rikillagaskada yesterday.
The President said that despite the fact that some politicians attempt to achieve victory to continue with their corrupted career, he would drive his pure political campaign to victory.
He invited all the members in Parliament with clean political records to join him to build up a government devoid of corruption. President Sirisena stated that he had made arrangements for the SLFP to record a historic victory at the local government election although it suffered a loss at the 2015 Presidential Election and the General Election later.
He said that though 23 years had lapsed since the passage of the Commission To Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act in 1994, only four cases had been filed and convicted on corruption counts.
The President pointed out that the telephone calls taken to the Judiciary from Temple Trees during the previous regime had been reasons for the low number of convictions. Without eradicating corruptions, the country will not have a future, the President said.

Time to wield the big stick
After a somewhat decent lull, the GMOA has once again jumped back on it's hobby horse and is threatening strike action if the government fails to resolve the SAITM issue to its satisfaction. This latest beating of war drums, by the government doctors, comes on the eve of the local government elections, even after a fervent appeal from Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya to all trade unions to put on hold any agitation campaign, at least till February 15, by which time the dust may have settled on the local government elections.
As this is being written the doctors were meeting to decide if their strike, slated to begin on Wednesday, should be continued indefinitely, in which event the entire health sector, countrywide, would be thrown into a state of paralysis.
The doctors have accused the government of not honouring it's pledge to abolish SAITM, before December 31, last year, and, to provide a solution acceptable to all parties, failing to do justice to the medical students of SAITM, failure to effect changes to the additional allowance of doctors, the filling of posts of director, in a number of government hospitals based on political considerations. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they had already communicated their decision, informing of the proposed strike action, to the President, and, the Director General of Health Services, but had so far failed to receive a response. Hence their decision to resort to strike action will remain unchanged.
This sudden decision on the part of the GMOA, to break from its lengthy period of inaction, could not have been accidental. It has obviously been biding it's time until the local government election campaign goes into full throttle. On another flank, the workers of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, too, are poised to strike, any time soon, that will result in breakdown in the supply, and, repairs and maintenance work going unattended, affecting the consumers.
It appears that the doctors, and, their partners in crime, in other sectors, are planning to place the government under siege, during this crucial time, with a view to extracting the maximum concessions, or, better still, give their political masters an advantage, at the election, by way of a public backlash against the government, for failure to provide essential services.
An indefinite strike is bound to continue into election day. Even if it does not, it would still have an impact, due to the episode still being fresh in the minds of the public. It is not known what other trade unions are planning to go on strike as D day draws near, and, if, the cumulative effect is designed to cast the government in poor light, on the eve of the poll.
On earlier instances, during such disruptive trade union action, that threw the country into chaos, such as during the petroleum strike, we urged the government to have contingency plans put in place to meet the crisis, head on. We also hailed the proposal made at Cabinet to set up a Special Task Force, headed by Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka to get things moving in times of paralysis. We are yet to read, or, hear if such a machinery exists.
The biggest advantage from the doctors strike, no doubt, will accrue to the Joint Opposition. There is no better image to move the public than the sight of patients lying in different postures of agony, or, discomfort in empty public hospital premises, ignored and uncared for. The government can be certain that the private TV channels backing the Rajapaksas, would go that extra mile to bring such images to the homes of the general public. Most will carry this image with them, going to the polling booths.
Is the government going to sit by and permit these recurrent bouts of strikes continue without check Hasnt it come to the realization that the GMOA is bent on backing the political project to bring the Rajapaksas back to power Does not the timing of the strike action to coincide with an election, tell a tale
True, the Yahapalanaya government takes pride in unshackling the media, ushering in freedoms, and, permitting free speech and association. It has also, so far, acted with great restraint in the face of great provocation. Trade Unions are allowed plenty of leeway to engage in street protests, and, other forms of agitation. There are no incidents such as that which occurred at Rathupaswela, Katunayake and Negombo.
However, it appears that things are being taken for granted. Court orders banning protests and demonstrations that inconvenience the public are openly defied. Court premises are invaded and judges bad mouthed in the open. Politicians taken to court on charges of bribery and corruption make their exit, brandishing their manacled hands in gestures of heroism.
It is time that the government takes a firm decision to stem the rot. Today it will be the doctors. Tomorrow it will be the CEB or postal workers. There is no knowing where it is all going to end up. It is obvious that slush funds are at work, financing these strikes. It is not difficult to guess the source.

UNF says No to debate before polls
The United National Front (UNF) decided to oppose having the Parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report prior to the elections, National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said. The Party Leaders representing the UNF met for a special meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees yesterday.
Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rauf Hakeem, Rajitha Senaratne, Mano Ganesan, Malik Samarawickrama, Lakshman Kiriella and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam took part in the hour long meeting.
Ganesan told the Daily News that it was pointed out at the meeting that the reason to call for a Parliamentary debate on the reports of two Presidential Commissions of Inquiry before the LG elections was nothing but political.
We decided that it is not proper to hold the debate on February 8 as it affects the silence period before the elections. Any media may give a twist to the content of the debate and it will be too late to correct it, he commented.
He said the UNF leaders would register their opposition to have the debate before the elections at the Party Leaders Meeting convened by the Speaker today. He further said President Maithripala Sirisenas recent remarks at a public rally inviting the Joint Opposition to form a Government was discussed at length at the meeting. It was noted at the meeting that the President received a mandate in January 2015 against corrupt acts of some JO members. Therefore, the people who voted for the Common Candidate in 2015 will not endorse him forming a Government with the JO. However, we concluded that this was not serious talk from the President and what he said was a political statement, he added.

Renewing the agreement of the national government between the UNP and SLFP will be decided after the Local Government elections considering the achievements of the SLFP during the past two years, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
"The agreement was not registered anywhere. It was a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the parties. Any decision pertaining to the agreement will be taken only after the local government elections, he said.
Addressing the media yesterday, at the SLFP headquarters, he said President Maithripala Sirisena intends to make changes to the public administration structure.
He said the existing structure needs to be changed after the local government election and added that the President was preparing for it.
He pointed out that there were many drawbacks in state institutions.
"False promises are given about job opportunities for youths and the prevailing vacancies in state institutions would solve that problem. But no measures are being taken to rectify those issues," he said.

WADA probes possible flaw in test bottles
Montreal: The World Anti-Doping Agency said Sunday it had launched an investigation into a possible glitch in drug-testing kits which could allow sample bottles to be opened manually.
WADA said in a statement it had been alerted by an accredited laboratory in Cologne that bottles manufactured by Swiss manufacturer Berlinger could be opened after being frozen.
The glass containers, known as the BEREG-KIT Geneva, were touted as the next generation of sample bottles after being released last year in the wake of the Russian doping scandal that dogged the 2014 Winter Olympics.
It was not clear if the new Berlinger bottles were due to be used at next months Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
WADA did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from AFP.
In its statement, WADA said it had initiated an investigation into a potential integrity issue with the new generation BEREG-KIT Geneva security bottles and will recommend appropriate measures, if needed, in order to maintain the integrity of the doping control process.
The agency said it was alerted to the possible flaw by the Cologne laboratory on January 19. AFP
