[5 Great Eateries in Colombo]
The Happy Belly Round-Up
Text and Pictures Shifani Reffai
Colombo is becoming a very exciting place, gastronomically speaking. Every month or so there seems to be a fun new coffee shop or restaurant to pig out at. There are too many to count but heres a handful of our favourite places that made our bellies happy. Email us on [emailprotected] to share your own Sri Lankan foodie experiences.
The Cakery
You can find this neat joint at 2A, Sulaiman Terrace, Jawatte Road, Colombo 5. One is always looking for places to have good dessert. The Cakery makes some delicious cakes, be it chocolate, meringue or cheesecake  but youll likely spend about Rs. 300 or more per hefty slice. More than their ready-made cakes, their fresh ones ordered a day or two before are absolutely flawless  they do a mean chocolate ganache cake. Considering the quality of the ingredients used, and the care put into making these sugary treats so perfect, you could argue that its worth the price tag. They also do some of the best cupcakes in town if you call them a few days in advance and order. Also, fun fact, just a few doors down from The Cakery is Skrumptious, a little eatery that does killer brownies and chocolate biscuit pudding. (For more information - 0112501344)
Tasty Caterers
Located at 88 Fife Road, Colombo 5, this is the underdog on our list. Theres nothing fancy about Tasty, but ever since we can remember theyve doled out quality food at very affordable, for-the-average-wallet prices  be it rice and curry, short-eats or goodies for your sweet-tooth. Colombo is in no shortage of bakeries, but Tasty Caterers is the most reliable option out there in our opinion for fresh, warm pastries and short-eats in a range of meats and vegetables. The rice and curry is also top-notch and makes for a reliable, tummy-filling purchase for lunch. The eclairs here are arguably the best youll find anywhere, priced at only Rs. 40, featuring thin, delectable choux filled with oozings of fresh chocolate cream (FYI, you can get the same ones at Caf On The 5th). But heads up  chances are all the shelves will be literally wiped clean by early afternoon, so if youre heading there for food, run over early morning. (For more information  0112580844)
Giovanni
On the road between Thimbirigasyaya and Baseline you get Giovannis at 145, Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 5. There is good pizza, and then there is amazing pizza. Giovanni is a place where youll pay the bill and then go hey, money CAN buy happiness. This small restaurant is run by Dimuthu, a very vibrant, enthusiastic young entrepreneur, whose special recipes have driven foodies in Colombo wild. The pizzas are priced at Rs. 1000  1400, and are easily enough for two  you can see them getting cooked in a yellow clay oven downstairs, before they are sprinkled with fat, succulent layers of meats, cheeses and veggies. You are going to be utterly stuffed after just three slices. In terms of toppings, this place is the most generous in the city, and one visit is likely to make you a repeat offender. (For more information  0770335366)
Nihonbashi at ODEL
Located on the Ground Floor, ODEL, 5 Alexandra Place, Colombo 7 you get the ever so famous Nihonbashi. Japanese food has made a totally unprecedented mark on local palettes  Colombo loves it. Considering the meticulous preparations however  chefs can take years to master just slicing fish for sushi  its not the most affordable range of food to nom on. Still, Dharshan Munidasas little Nihonbashi outlet at ODEL, is not too harsh on the wallet, and if you are a fan of Japanese food, they do a flawless job at it. The fish comes delicately sliced and absolutely fresh, light and cooling  the salmon sashimi, especially, makes a happy meal. The sushi features rice with just the right amount of stickiness and a good meat-rice ratio. The okonomiyaki, grilled with strong savoury-sweet flavours, is a grander, more filling choice on the menu. If you love the cuisine and want quality with affordability, Nihonbashi at ODEL should be at the top of your list. (For more information - 0114718758)
Dolce Italia
Located at 147, Vajira Road, Colombo 4), Dolce Italia is a relatively new and unexpected addition to the local food scene. Its a small teal and yellow themed eatery on a restaurant-ridden corner of Havelock Road, run by an Italian chef. No Italian style pizzas here  but everything else here is gold, from the gnocchi to the lasagna to the wide range of creamy, mouth-watering Italian pastries. The best thing about it is that its not as expensive as youd think, for a high quality, authentic foreign restaurant  less than Rs. 1000 for a massive main. (For more information - 0112559900)

All Black skipper Richie McCaw retires
Wellington, Wednesday: Two-time World Cup-winning All Blacks captain Richie McCaw announced his immediate retirement on Thursday after a record 148 Tests, with a new career beckoning as a commercial helicopter pilot.
Im going to be hanging up my boots, the end of my rugby days, the 34-year-old told a press conference that opened with a minutes silence for All Black legend Jonah Lomu, who died on Wednesday.
I want to let people know that my last game with the All Blacks and as a rugby player was the World Cup final a couple of weeks ago.
Last month McCaw, a three-time World Rugby player of the year, became the only captain to ever claim back-to-back World Cups, capping a career that has seen him anointed as one of the all-time greats.
McCaw said he had been considering retirement for a while and the time felt right after New Zealands 34-17 win over Australia in the World Cup final against Australia.
That last game, to have that as the lasting memory of the last time on the pitch -- pretty satisfying, he said.
The other thing Im proud of is I played some of my best rugby in the last couple of weeks. To finish on that note is pretty good.
McCaw, a keen aviator, said he intended to pursue a post-rugby career as a commercial helicopter pilot. I am hugely passionate about it, it will never replace the thrill of running out in front of 80,000 but it is not far short of it, he said.
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen joked that McCaw couldnt catch, couldnt pass, couldnt run when he first saw him paying as a teenager.
But Hansen said the outgoing skipper turned himself into one of the games legends through sheer hard work.
Youve got to pick the right time to go and he couldnt have picked a better time, he said.
He is on top of the heap, hes made his own decision and well be forever grateful for what he has done for the All Blacks.

## Title: Anne Frank publishers dispute copyright

Anne Frank publishers dispute copyright
FRANCE: When Otto Frank first published his daughter's red-checked diary and notebooks, he wrote a prologue assuring readers that the book mostly contained her words, written while hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex of a factory in Amsterdam.
But now the Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to "The Diary of Anne Frank" is alerting publishers that her father is not only the editor but also legally the co-author of the celebrated book.
The move has a practical effect: It extends the copyright from Jan. 1, when it is set to expire in most of Europe, to the end of 2050. Copyrights in Europe generally end 70 years after an author's death. Anne Frank died 70 years ago at Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp, and Otto Frank died in 1980. Extending the copyright would block others from being able to publish the book without paying royalties or receiving permission. "The Diary of Anne Frank" is currently being staged in a "worthy production" at the Shakespeare
Three years later, he set up the foundation in Switzerland to collect the diary's royalties and distribute them to charities such as Unicef, children's education projects and a medical fund that today supports about 50 gentiles who saved Jews during the war. He left her actual diaries and notebooks to the Dutch state.
In the United States, the diary's copyright will still end in 2047, 95 years after the first publication of the book in 1952.
While the foundation, the Anne Frank Fonds, in Basel, signaled its intentions a year ago, warnings about the change have provoked a furor as the deadline approaches. Some people opposed to the move have declared that they would defy the foundation and publish portions of her text.
Foundation officials "should think very carefully about the consequences," said Agns Tricoire, a lawyer in Paris who specializes in intellectual property rights in France, where critics have been the most vociferous and are organizing a challenge. "If you follow their arguments, it means that they have lied for years about the fact that it was only written by Anne Frank."
The decision has also set the foundation on a possible collision course with the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam, a separate entity that for years has sparred with the Anne Frank foundation over legal questions, such as ownership of archives and trademark issues.
The museum has been working for five years with historians and researchers on an elaborate web version of the diary intended for publication once the copyright expires. The research is still progressing with a historical and textual analysis of her writing, including deletions, corrections and stains.
"We haven't decided yet when or how the results will be published," said Maatje Mostart, a spokeswoman for the Anne Frank House. "Any publishing will always be done within the legal frameworks." She added pointedly that neither "Otto Frank nor any other person is co-author."
One of Anne's own astute diary entries seemed to anticipate the disputes: "Why do grown-ups quarrel so easily"
Anne was 15 when she died at Bergen-Belsen. She had been arrested after someone alerted the authorities that the family had been hiding in the secret annex of a pectin factory on the Prinsengracht, or Prince's Canal. Otto Frank was the family's only survivor.
After arranging for her diary and notebooks to be published, he tried to secure Anne's legacy. In 1960, he and the City of Amsterdam helped save the building where the family had hidden. (It became the Anne Frank House.)
"Effectively, Otto split up the legacy of his daughter, which one could say has created a bit of a nice mess ever since," said Gerben Zaagsma, a historian of modern Jewish history at the University of Gttingen in Germany who is working on a scholarly edition of the diary backed by the foundation and Germany's culture ministry.
The foundation does not publish yearly reports about its finances. But in recent years, it said it had donated about $1.5 million annually to hundreds of charitable organizations.
"The longer they can claim copyright protection, the longer they can ask money for publication of the works," said Stef van Gompel, a professor at the University of Amsterdam who specializes in copyright law.
Six years ago, the foundation asked legal experts in various countries for advice on its copyright, according to Yves Kugelmann, a member of the foundation's board. They concluded, he said, that Otto "created a new work" because of his role of editing, merging and trimming entries from her diary and notebooks and reshaping them into "kind of a collage" meriting its own copyright.
Merely declaring Otto the "co-author" on copyright filings extends the copyright, legal experts said, though such a stand could be tested in the courts. Readers would not see any changes on the books themselves, foundation officials said.
The foundation's officials said that their aim is to "make sure that Anne Frank stays Anne," Mr. Kugelmann said, by maintaining control and avoiding inappropriate exploitation of the work. "When she died, she was a young girl who was not even 16. We are protecting her. That is our task." - SYDNEY MORNING HERALD

Anuradhapura tanks filled to the brim
All main, medium and small scale tanks in the Anuradhapura district are filled to the capacity due to torrential rains. District Irrigation Director S. M. A. Nelugolla said no damage is reported to any tank. Farmers can continue their Maha season cultivations without any shortage of water, he said.
Meanwhile, referring to 3,056 minor irrigation tanks under the Agrarian Services Department, Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Services Development Commissioner S. Y. D. A. Somawansa said 1,700 small tanks were holding water capacity between 75 percent and 100 percent whereas the water capacity of 700 minor irrigation tanks was at the level of 50 percent to 75 percent. Farmers depending on village tanks will cultivate around 80,000 hectares or more during the Maha cultivation season, the Assistant Commissioner said.

BBC reporter breaks down live on air
FRANCE: A BBC reporter has broken down on air during a live cross from a memorial to the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.
Graham Satchell, an experienced BBC news journalist, was overcome with emotion while standing before a wall of flowers in Paris' Place de la Republique.
As Satchell spoke of the "hope" that had flowed through the city over the past 24 hours, he could no longer keep his composure.
"The feeling here in Paris has certainly changed significantly since we arrived on Saturday when Paris was a ghost town," he said. 'Last night it was incredibly busy. There were vigils here, there were vigils at the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower was lit up in red, white and blue, which I think is a sign of hope," he said as his voice cracked.
Struggling to regain his control of his emotions, Satchell apologised to the camera.
"Sorry, I'm so sorry."
Sensing his distress, BBC anchor Sally Nugent attempted to draw the broadcast back from Satchell.
The father-of-three said, "I will leave it there. There is certainly hope here in Paris," before walking off-screen struggling with the emotion of the scene before him.
The managing director of the Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma in the Asia Pacific Region, Cait McMahon, said that the emotional impact on journalists in these situations was down to a number of factors.
"The horror of the story has an impact, but that compounded with the workload that people are doing in these jobs really just erodes people's resilience in the moment," she said.
"Also the actual fear, I was speaking with a woman in Paris and just the notion of getting the tube [Paris Metro] at the moment is a really scary thing. It's a cocktail of the normal fear of being in the city combined with the horror of what they are reporting on."
McMahon said that Satchell's reaction was a natural human response.
"The fact that he got support is really important. [Sometimes] journos feel a sense of shame that they are not being objective; that they have breached their own reporting code if you like, but those sorts of things catch us unawares." Viewers were quick to comfort Satchell.

Broadband subscriptions to reach 3.2 mn by 2019
Broadband subscriptions are forecast to reach 3.2m by 2019 in Sri Lanka, according to Sri Lanka Telecommunications Report Q1 2016 Published by Business Monitor International.
The BMI report stated that over 74% of mobile phone subscriptions remain prepaid which limits the market for premium services, and average ARPU has declined steadily as operators compete aggressively on price. Further consolidation is likely in the mobile market will with telecoms tax eroding operator revenues.
Prepaid subscribers dominate the mobile market and ARPU has been trending lower as operators engage in price competition to retain their subscriber market share.
Although 4G LTE and LTE Advanced technology is now present in the market, we believes that take-up of data services is still limited in the medium term due to the price-sensitive nature of the consumer market.
As the high telecoms tax continues to squeeze operator margins, smaller operators have been expressing interests in divesting their local operations; which could lead to consolidation in the sector. SLT's new fibre-optic network, which is still being rolled out, will bring fixed broadband to the next stage.
Dialog Axiata continues to dominate the mobile market with an estimated 41.8% share of subscriptions in H115.
The report says that improvements in broadband coverage and speed are vital to the future of the telecoms industry in Sri Lanka, and there is pressure on SLT to complete its fibre-optic network on time by end 2016.

Sri Lanka is on the move and logistics is one aspect of it.We are going to ensure that we make the world look at Sri Lanka as a foreign operation destination.The government will ensure that the best of talent will be brought in as the country is keen to use foreign capital with the local knowledge to take the industry forward.

Church doors must stay open despite terror fears - Pope
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis said today that the doors of Catholic churches around the world must remain open, despite increased security fears in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.
"Please, no armoured doors in the Church, everything open," the 78-year-old pontiff told pilgrims in St Peter's square, Italy's AGI news agency reported.
"There are places in the world where doors should not be locked with a key. There are still some but there are also many where armoured doors have become the norm.
"We must not surrender to the idea that we must apply this way of thinking to every aspect of our lives," Francis said.
"To do so to the Church would be terrible."
The pope did not explicitly refer to last week's attacks on Paris, which he has condemned as "inhuman".
His comments came in the context of intense discussion in Italy about the security of the Vatican and Rome, which are seen as potential targets for Islamist terrorists. Francis's comments also had a spiritual significance he has urged the Church to keep its doors open to lapsed believers who are considering returning and to the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.
Italy announced this week that it would close airspace over Rome to drones for the duration of the upcoming Catholic jubilee year, which is expected to bring more than a million extra visitors to the Italian capital. The move reflects fears a remote-controlled aircraft could be used by Islamic State or other terrorist groups to stage a potentially spectacular attack on the home of the Catholic church.
Security has also been stepped up at airports and train stations and some 700 extra troops deployed in public spaces in Rome. Individuals purporting to be Islamic State terrorists have made a number of threats against Rome on social media and in the group's propaganda outlets. - AFP

CILT wants relook at Customs Ordinance
The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Sri Lanka (CILT) Chairman Niral Kadawatharatchie urged the government to revisit the Customs Ordinance in 1869 as a matter of urgency to address multiple issues faced by the local shipping and logistics industry.
"The provisions of the Ordinance are not compatible with the global maritime and logistics activities in today's context,"he said.
He also requested the government to create a platform to facilitate free movement goods across borders to do away with cumbersome and lengthy Customs procedures .
Speaking about the issues prevailing in the railway industry he stressed that government should go ahead with projects such as rehabilitation of railway tracks and rail system electrification .
Kadawatharatchie pointed out that the proposed transport master plan for Colombo city is in hibernation and requested the government to implement the project as soon as possible. However, Deputy State Enterprise Development Minister Eran Wickramaratne responding to Kadawatharatchie's comment on the transport master plan said that he doesn't agree with Kadawatharatchie's comment as the megalopolis plan incorporates the master transport plan for the Colombo city.
Minister said the Customs and ports in Sri Lanka need to fully adopt, as a matter of urgency, electronic document processing to increase the accuracy, speed and integrity of the logistics process. Sri Lanka's soft infrastructure looks archaic in comparison to competing nations, and improving the soft infrastructure is a matter of priority for the present government.
"Moreover, there are a number of government ministries involved in managing logistics in Sri Lanka.
"For example, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Aviation Authority Sri Lanka, and SriLankan Airlines Cargo all come under different ministries."
He queried whether there is sufficient coherence in the way the Ministries of Ports, Transport and Public Enterprises operate with regard to Sri Lanka's logistics.
Corruption can prevent the sort of reform that can truly improve a business. Keeping it electronic helps us to also deal with corruption problems that are endemic in this sector, he said adding that across the world, many people think that corruption- such as a bribe- can grease the wheels of the system. People in logistics might not think there is a problem in making payments to get things done-something as basic as getting a document. However in the long term ,corruption is also sanding the wheel and preventing progress.
He added that for more than 20 years, Sri Lanka has tried to make the transition to electronic processing but people who are beneficiaries of the incumbent system generally block it. As a result, Sri Lanka's logistics won't be as competitive on as it could be on the global scale. Good governance does come into other areas of logistics as well, and we should look into issues like the role of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as both a regulator and an operator.

Cocktails and Mocktails of Marmite
They have you Chocolate mitethen they moved on to Noodle-Mite and now Unilever Sri Lanka Brand Marmite brings to those people who are adventurous in trying new drinks, their very own Marmite Cocktail and Mocktail for the ones who prefer the light drinks.
Marmite has indeed gone from one thing to another coming up with some crazy creations. Simple yet no one ever really thought about  unless you are the experimenting kind and like to try to something new every now and then.
This time, the team got together with Cinnamon Grands Restaurants & Bar Manager Namal Jayalath to come with this unique drink that will be served at their Cheers Pub and Breeze bar.
Just last month they unveiled Chocolate-Mite getting together with celebrity Chocolatier Gerard Mendis and it was well received by many Marmite fans followed by Noodle-Mite that they created together with celebrity Chef Koluu. And today they added it to something more than just hot water.
On behalf of Cinnamon Grand Colombo, I like to thank Unilever for giving us the opportunity to create something unique with Marmite. Bianca came to me and asked shall we make a cocktail out of Marmite to which I responded Why not, Namal stated at the launch. After trying and trying making nearly 50 cocktails we finally got the right mix  which turned out become a beautiful Cocktail Mite. The base is Vodka, Grapefruit juice, Tabasco and Marmite. I must add that the saltiness of the Marmite really balances the citrus of the Grapefruit and the Tobasco gives the right spiciness and enhances ones palette. The Mocktail Mite .
We had to do a mocktail for the ones who dont drink alcohol and I accepted the challenge. Again it was a tough journey trying it so many times. But finally I found that Fresh Orange really enhances the flavour with a little bit of Marmite, Namal stated.

Namal also added that this cocktail can actually be taken before a meal as it really enhances the appetite. Kumar de Silva also stated that this is one drink that you can drink and drink and not feel any guilt as its absolutely healthy and totally good for your health.
Marmite has undergone a magical metamorphosis these past few weeks in Sri Lanka. And now Marmite takes Sri Lankas F&B circuits with this double-barrelled experience. These are two distinctively contrasting yet complementary beverages which challenge ones taste buds. Shaken and stirred they give the experience a fabulously adventurous dimension and are exclusively available at the Cinnamon Grand, Unilever Sri Lanka Marmite Brand Manager Bianca de Silva said in a press release.

Consistent policies expected from today's Budget
Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake will present the 2016 budget today
in Parliament. This is the first budget to be presented by the coalition government.
It is expected that the budget will a be capital oriented one aiming at higher revenue than recurrent expenditure. The Minister said that the capital expenditure will be significantly increased in the coming budget.
The Minister also hinted that the budget is aiming to raise taxes in areas which have not been looked at before without placing a greater burden on the public. "It will create revenue, the revenue will be greater than the recurrent
expenditure of the year 2016. But the revenue plan won't have a cost impact
on the people," Minister Karunanayake said when a group of Sri Lankan based foreign correspondents met him in his ministry Wednesday evening.
Meanwhile the automobile industry that went though several ups and downs
due to policy changes is looking at a long term policy.
Tax consultants and the Mobile operators too are expecting a similar long term policy to be in place.
"We hope the budget for the fiscal year 2016 to be read by the Minister of Finance to be a one that will focus on framing long-term policies for the development of the country.
Ideally it has to lay the foundation of a concrete plan that will spell out a clear pathway for the business community to boost confidence among all,"a leading banker said.
"We Sri Lankans are tired of changes in policy every time a new government comes in to power or even at change of officials.
This has to stop and we are hopeful that there will be transparency in fixing policy looking at the interest of the country as a whole and not to favour a selected group of people," said
Gihan Pilapitiya, Chairman Ceylon Motor Traders' Association Chairman.
The expectation of the Motor Industry is that the government will adopt a long term strategy and maintain a three to five year constant policy towards the industry rather than changing policies in an adhoc manner. It is only then the industry can invest on infrastructure and create employment added, Chaminda Perera, Chief Executive Officer, Ideal Motors(Pvt) Ltd.

A day in the life: A monk on Fearless Mountain
Ajahn Pasanno appears out of the woods, walks up a few steps and plunks himself down in a comfortable wicker chair on the front porch of Abhayagiri Fearless Mountain Monastery in Redwood Valley.
The day is coming to a close and the peace and the quiet of the place is what is noticeable. The only noise is the distant sound of a lawnmower, which almost seems to come from some other world, a world different from this one. Ajahn, means teacher and is used in place of a first name for the abbot of the monastery. Pasanno means one having faith and joy, the name his teacher bestowed on him when he was still a novice.
It is difficult to imagine Ajahn as a young man in a secular sense, now that he is of middle age, with a shaved head and clothed in a simple mustard-colored robe. It seems he was always this person he is now. But Ajahn's journey began in the 1970s as a young man when he left his home in Manitoba, Canada after finishing his university studies to travel the far reaches of the world. He rambled through Europe, Afghanistan and India, not seeking to become a Buddhist monk but visiting various holy places along the way.
It wasn't until he arrived in the north of Thailand that he began to feel a sense of belonging. In order to learn more about Buddhism, he attended some classes at a monastery called Wat Nong Bah north of Chiang Mai. I was just passing through, but the Thai society seemed to have a whole different value system. I felt at home, he said.
After a month-long stay, the Abbot of the monastery suggested the young man consider ordination with an initial goal of remaining three or four months. Although he was not yet sure what he was getting into, he was willing to give it a try. He took on the robes of a forest dwelling monk thinking it would be only for a short time that was the beginning of the life he still lives now, more than 30 years later.
You are not required to make a life-long commitment, Ajahn says, It just happened.
The monk says he didn't have any intuition that he would lead a monastic life.
When I began it was to learn how to meditate. But, he says, at one point, it didn't seem possible to go back.
Thus the young monk began a practice where monks wear plain robes and shave their heads in an effort to let go of their own personal preferences.
Doing this, is about simplification, Ajahn says. We renounce the world because of the peace that comes from it. The quality of peace we can access and dwell in is deeply satisfying.
I encourage people that peace and well-being are a possibility for your life - to explore that for your life. I encourage people to use the tools of a virtuous life.
An Abhayagiri pamphlet lists the The Eight Precepts for leading such a life: 1. Harmlessness: not intentionally taking the life of any living creature. 2. Trustworthiness: not taking anything which is not given. 3. Celibacy: refraining from any sexual activity. 4. Right Speech: avoiding false, abusive or malicious speech. 5. Sobriety: not taking any intoxicating drink or drugs. 6. Renunciation: not eating after mid-day. 7. Restraint: Not seeking entertainment, playing radios or musical instruments. Dressing in a modest, unadorned way that does not attract attention. 8. Alertness: refraining from over-indulgence in sleep.
Choosing to live amidst the beauty that surrounds Fearless Mountain may not seem to be renouncing the world at all, but Ajahn Pasanno says, we even try to renounce the beauty. Most people try to get more of everything. Then when they get more they feel a loss when they lose it and don't have it anymore. Then they lament the separation.
A monk gets to the place of stillness. It is not rejecting anything - it's another aspect of life that most people don't pay attention to.
There are eight monks who live at Abhayagiri, plus one novice and one postulate in training, all living on 250 acres of almost untouched forest land, originally a gift from the late abbot of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Ukiah - Master Hsuan Hua. Master Hua dreamed of bringing the Northern and Southern Traditions of Buddhism together again where they could relate in an atmosphere of mutual respect and harmony.
The monastery was founded by two teachers, Ajahn Sumedho, and Ajahn Amaro after they developed a devoted following in Northern California in the1980s. The original Abhayagiri was in ancient Sri Lanka at Anuradhapura and although it follows the Theravada branch of Buddhism, the monastery was known for accepting both teachers and practitioners from many different Buddhist traditions.
The monastery currently has more people who want to come here and be monks than the facility can handle, Ajahn says.
A monk named Sudanto, meaning one who trains himself well calls Abhayagiri, a zone of peace people can use as a community resource. He explains the monastery's connection with the community as, an interrelationship that keeps us (the monks) relevant, as a peaceful presence - people with deep knowledge and experience of the Buddhist teachings of peace and wholeness.
The day on Fearless Mountain begins at 4 a.m. Then from 5-6 a.m. they begin their spiritual practice with meditation and chanting. These reflections set a tone of the mind during the day. 6:30-7 a.m. there are some general chores, cleaning up and a light breakfast. At 7:30 a.m. the monks meet to delegate chores - maintenance, cooking, office tasks and the job of maintaining the miles of trails which circle through the forests. After chores, the monks have their main meal from 10:30-11 a.m.
When it comes to food, the forest dwelling monks are alms mendicants. Not allowed to plant or pick their own food, they rely on gifts. The monks can be seen on Fridays walking through the center of town collecting gifts of food.
This creates interdependence with the lay community. We don't want to be completely cut off,Ajahn said.
He explains this synergistic relationship. People from the community come to the monastery to gain more simplicity, more well being. We give the opportunity for people to have the way of living, which is more peaceful, more fulfilling. Sharing our life is sort of the by-product. If one's goal is to teach, it can be distorted. Refocus on the quality of our lives and that becomes an example to others.
Ajahn is suddenly explaining some of the core elements of a monastic life. The more the I can get out of the way, the more peaceful things become.

Delicious work of art!
Q: Tell me a bit about yourself
A: I am Chandana Wijeratne. I live in Yakkala with my wife, two daughters and son. I've been in this profession for 25 years
Q: How long have you been at your present work place
A: I've been with Ramada Colombo for 2 years on this current stint. I also worked here in late 2000 for two years.
Q: Why are you a chef
A: I'm extremely passionate about what I do. To me I love the thought of creating something. It doesn't feel like just food, it feels like a work of art. I truly believe in soul cooking. It's about making a connection with my guests and serving them from the heart.
Q: What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen
A: I feel it's what I was made to do. It doesn't really feel like work. I guess there is truth behind finding what you love to do and it will never seem like another day of work after.
Q: Who is your biggest critic
A: Well, that would be my children!
Q: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen
A: Guests have very varied tastes. If dishes are rejected it means they may not meet the guests particular preferences. At such times it is very important to speak to the guest personally and understand what they wish for. Any dish can be customised and the guest expectations can be exceeded.
I would see this as an opportunity to open a dialogue and improve communication. In reality this is the best way to build loyalty in your guests. Often guests who have complained at one point have later become regular repeat guests and overtime my good friends.
Q: When at home...do you cook or do you let your partner take control
A: At home, both my wife and I take turns in the kitchen. Of course when she was pregnant with our children it was most flattering that she only wanted to eat food that I cooked for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in between.
Q: If you were not a chef...what would you be today
A: It's hard for me to think of being anything other than a chef.
Q: Demi: Of all the places you worked, what are your greatest memories
A: In over the 20 years of experience, I have had the good fortune of meeting and serving world famous personalities. However one memory will forever remain in my heart - Chairman of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata on a brief visit to Sri Lanka stopped over at the hotel I then worked at.
Full of awe for this great man I expected his dinner order to be of a grand nature. I was humbled by Mr. Tata - his dinner request was for simple Sri Lankan hoppers with white curry. I made these items personally and served them myself. This incident has had a remarkable effect on my own life - I always use it to remind myself of the importance of being simple.

Dilroy and Lomu at Commonwealth Games
Sri Lanka's most recognized rugby referee Dilroy Fernando officiated at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Sevens final played between Fiji and New Zealand that featured the late rugby icon Jonah Lomu.
The match took place at the Petaling Jaya Stadium in Kuala Lumpur in front of over 20,000 spectators.
Rugby Sevens marked its first appearance at a Commonwealth Games at this event and it was an enormous success with New Zealand winning the gold medal with a 21-12 win over Fiji, the reigning world champions. Man of the match was legendary Jonah Lomu.
"The giant ruggerite Lomu was highly emotional after the All Blacks' victory. Although he was a legendary rugby player, he was down to earth, a humble and simple man," said Fernando who had the honour of officiating the final.
"Lomu was overjoyed with the victory which was regarded as their highest achievement apart from the World Cup. It was a wonderful experience to officiate at such a final with legendary players like Lomu," Fernando said.

Emirates SkyCargo's Freighter Terminal inaugurated
Emirates SkyCargo's state-of-the-art cargo terminal at the Logistics District in Dubai South was officially inaugurated by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline and Group, further establishing Dubai as a leading global air cargo and logistics hub.
Named Emirates SkyCentral, the cargo facility is the home of Emirates SkyCargo's fleet of 15 freighter aircraft, and was officially opened on the side lines of the Dubai Air Show.
The event was attended by a number of dignitaries, including members of Dubai's Executive Council, representatives from various local authorities, members of Emirates' senior management, as well as local and international media.
"The opening of Emirates SkyCentral is an important milestone for us, as it represents our vision for future growth and firmly establishes Emirates SkyCargo as the world's leading air cargo carrier across all its operational areas. The space it currently occupies on the land allocated to us at Dubai South is part of a much bigger area, which we can develop over time to increase our cargo handling capacity to achieve our vision of 12 million tonnes annually by 2050, from the current 2.3 million tonnes," said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Cargo.
Mohsen Ahmed, Vice President of Logistics at Dubai South, said: "With the launch of the Emirates SkyCargo facility, Dubai South begins an exciting new chapter in its journey towards establishing Dubai's excellence as a logistics hub. Dubai South offers the ideal connection point for sea and air cargo, which calls for rapid movement to the markets of the Middle East, Asia and Africa."
Emirates SkyCentral is located 77 kilometres from Dubai International Airport (DXB) - a convenient location with factories and forwarders in the surrounding areas, and in close proximity to a dedicated corridor to the Jebel Ali Port and Free Zone.
Emirates SkyCargo has 47 trucks that ply the virtual corridor between the two airports, with each truck being equipped with satellite tracking to ensure the safety and security of cargo and staff.
Emirates SkyCentral is a dedicated freighter facility, and with 12 aircraft stands directly in front of the terminal, one of its key features is the close proximity of aircraft to the receiving docks, which enables quick movement of goods.
The freighters that operate from Emirates SkyCentral fly to more than 50 destinations around the world.

The Exporters Association of Sri Lanka which is affiliated to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, recently communicated its fullest co-operation to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Malik Samarawickrema Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to address aspects within its purview, which will be necessary to implement the necessary methodology and mechanisms to enable the country to strengthen the economic sphere envisaged by the Government, through the Export Sector.
It welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement that he has 'proposed to adopt a competitive foreign exchange policy that will encourage and empower exports'. The EASL has frequently acknowledged the importance for Sri Lanka to link into global value chains. However it believes that this can only be achieved if Sri Lanka is acknowledged regionally, to have a stable labour policy and a workforce with a good reputation for high productivity.
The EASL has previously gone on record stating that an appropriate education strategy structured to meet the rapidly changing business demands must evolve for the country to progress economically. It therefore commends the proposed development of innovation centres, ICT and science knowledge hubs, and digital infrastructural services and to support investment in this lucrative business. The EASL opined that bringing the BOI and the SLEDB under a single Ministry will positively enable an environment of consistency and cohesion for Export enterprises to grow exponentially.

In face of the abusive
A sylvan grove nestled at the foothills surrounding the capital city of Rajagaha: this royal pleasance, known as the Bamboo Grove, was offered to the Buddha by King Bimbisara. The king built a monastery there with a large number of meditation huts where at least 1250 monks stayed, spending their time in meditation and intense spiritual endeavor. The Bamboo Grove was neither too far nor too near the city, but at just the right distance from it for the large number of devotees who flocked there every morning and evening to pay homage to the Lord.
A certain brahman belonging to the Bharadvaja clan had a great prejudice against the Buddha since he thought a kshatriya had claimed to be a saint. And as it transpired, his own wife was a great devotee of the Master. On a certain festival day when everybody, including his wife, had gone to the monastery to hear the discourse, the brahman, coming to know of it, became furious. Fuming with rage, he rushed to the monastery, and forcing his way through the crowd and shouting loudly foul abuse, he headed straight to the place where the Buddha was seated. People were aghast. Even the presence of the king, the nobles and ministers did not deter the enraged brahman from reviling the Buddha to his face. When the Buddha remained completely unruffled, projecting powerful thoughts of loving-kindness, the brahman stopped abusing him. But he was still peevish.
Now the Buddha asked him: "My friend, if somebody visits you, and you offer food which he refuses, who gets it"
"If the visitor doesn't accept it, I will get it back because I offered it to him."
"Since I don't accept your abuse, to whom will it return"
The brahman was so moved by the tremendous implication of this analogy that he fell at the feet of the Buddha and sought to be ordained as a monk. Soon after his ordination he attained Arahatship. The Buddha had transformed him by his positive approach.
A friend of this brahman, belonging to the same Bharadvaja clan and noted for his cantankerous nature, heard about the incident and became very angry. In fact, he was known as Akkosa Bharadvaja, "Bharadvaja the Abusive." He made his way to the monastery on a certain day when a large number of people flocked to hear the Buddha's discourse. The outcome was identical and he too became a monk, and later on an Arahat.
Such was the tremendous impact which the Buddha's positive response wrought even on the most hostile persons. The Tipitaka is replete with such instances. The following discourse known as the Akkosa Sutta describes the incident vividly.
The Sutta
Once the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove near the Squirrels' Feeding Place. Now the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja heard this: "The brahman Bharadvaja, it seems, has become a monk under the Great Monk Gotama." Angry and unhappy, he went to where the Blessed One was. Having approached the Blessed One, he abused and criticized the Blessed One in foul and harsh words. Thus reviled, the Blessed One spoke to the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja: 'Well, brahman, do friends, confidants, relatives, kinsmen and guests visit you"
"Yes, Gotama, sometimes friends, confidants, relatives, kinsmen and guests do visit me."
"Well, brahman, do you not offer them snacks or food or tidbits"
"Yes, Gotama, sometimes I do offer them snacks or food or tidbits."
"But if, brahman, they do not accept it, who gets it"
"If Gotama, they do not accept it, I get it back."
"Even so, brahman, you are abusing us who do not abuse, you are angry with us who do not get angry, you are quarreling with us who do not quarrel. All this of yours we don't accept. You alone, brahman, get it back; all this, brahman, belongs to you.
"When, brahman, one abuses back when abused, repays anger in kind, and quarrels back when quarreled with, this is called, brahman, associating with each other and exchanging mutually. This association and mutual exchange we do not engage in. Therefore you alone, brahman, get it back; all this, brahman, belongs to you."
"People, including the king, know the Venerable Gotama thus: 'The Monk Gotama is the Worthy One.' When does the Venerable Gotama become angry"
Said the Buddha:
"Where is anger for one freed from anger, Who is subdued and lives perfectly equanimous, Who truly knowing is wholly freed, Supremely tranquil and equipoised He who repays an angry man in kind Is worse than the angry man; Who does not repay anger in kind, He alone wins the battle hard to win. He promotes the weal of both, His own, as well as of the other. Knowing that the other man is angry, He mindfully maintains his peace And endures the anger of both, His own, as well as of the other, Even if the people ignorant of true wisdom Consider him a fool thereby."
When the Lord proclaimed this, the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja said this to the Blessed One: "Wonderful, indeed, O Venerable Gotama! Herewith I go to the Venerable Gotama for refuge, to his Teaching and to his Holy Order of Monks. Most venerable sir, may I have the privilege to receive at the hands of the revered Lord Gotama the initial monastic ordination and also the higher ordination of a bhikkhu."
And the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja received at the hands of the Blessed One the initial monastic ordination and he also received the higher ordination of a bhikkhu. And within a short time of his ordination, the Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja, living alone, secluded, diligent, zealous and unrelenting, reached that incomparable consummation of holiness for which sons of noble families, having totally abandoned the household life, take to the life of homelessness. With direct knowledge he realized the ultimate, then and there, and lived having access to it. He saw with his supernormal vision: "Ceased is rebirth, lived is the holy life, completed is the spiritual task and henceforth there is nothing higher to be achieved."
The Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja, indeed, became one of the Arahats.

Fifth Asia Leisure Resort to open in Kosgoda
Asia Leisure will open another resort in Kosgoda in December 2016.
Asia Leisure's accelerated thrust on expansion is further cemented with the launch of this, their fifth resort.
The 30 key property with an investment outlay of US$ 5 million shares in the governments drive for increased Foreign Direct Investment with investors consisting of a consortium of Japanese and Sri Lankan parties, with the management of the resort by Asia Leisure.
Asia Leisure Chief Executive Officer, Reyhan Morris said Asia Leisure is bullish on its investment perspective, having already launched two new properties in the last 20 months.
"Kosgoda represents a new dimension of expansion where Asia Leisure is entrusted with delivering expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders through a management contract."

[Cross Currents]
Focus on PTA
A group of Tamil prisoners taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) started a fast last week demanding their release. Most of them have been in prison for over six years and many have not even being charged in courts. Throughout this whole period the investigating authorities have been unable to complete their investigations. One wonders whether this is sheer inefficiency or wilful neglect.
Be that as it may, the issue of these prisoners has been in the focus of attention these days. Opinions, naturally differ. However all opinions cannot be correct or justified. It is necessary to look at the issue objectively and rationally without being emotively provoked.
In the meantime the PTA is up for revision or repeal as the Government has given a pledge to the international community at Geneva to do so. To understand the rationale behind the demand of the international community and the Government's response it may be necessary to briefly look into the history of its enactment and application.
The PTA was preceded by a special Act of Parliament called the Proscribing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and other Similar Organizations Law of 1978. It was originally intended for one year but was subsequently extended for another year. Then it was repealed and replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of No. 48 of 1979. In both cases the Acts were intended to be temporary. (It is a different matter that the PTA has been in existence up to now, that is a period of over three and half decades.) Even if one does not agree with the need for the PTA even then, one could understand the political expediency which may have prompted the rulers to resort to such draconian legislation. Now that the LTTE has been definitively defeated and the war was over six years ago even that expediency is not there. Hence there is no rationale for preserving the PTA. It must be repealed.
Opposition parties
This should be done as it is an obstacle to any reconciliation between the Sinhala and Tamil communities, which is essential for national unity and development. Moreover, the PTA is basically anti-democratic in nature and hence could and would be used against the popular masses in their agitations and other struggles.
Former LTTE child soldiers
Opposition parties and groups that want to bring back the former regime are carrying on a campaign to instil fear in the minds of the people about the likelihood of a resurrection of the LTTE and the re-emergence of the war. These projections run counter to the ground realities. The war as well as the dominance of the LTTE among the Tamil community was a direct result of the failure of the peaceful struggle carried out by the Tamil people for their rights under moderate leaderships. It was also a response to the repression of that struggle.
Now that the war is over and the LTTE defeated it has not got any substantial support among the Tamil community. The situation of No war - No peace that prevails now requires strategies different from those pursued during the war. What is now requires is a strategy that would bring peace instead of war. Hence the continuation of the PTA or incarcerating persons under the PTA would be counter-productive.
It is not only the Opposition that is up in arms about the release of persons incarcerated under the PTA. The mass media continue to display the same ethnic bias that existed during the war. For example, an editorial last Sunday in a mass circulation Sinhala weekly categorically stated that those taken into custody under the PTA are not political prisoners. They are terrorist suspects. It claimed that it cannot be considered as a political organization as it has been banned in several countries.
We have to forgive the writer for his ignorance. Almost all freedom struggles were branded as terrorist by governments when they were fighting for power. The ANC of South Africa was considered terrorist. So was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLA). One does not become apolitical due to the method of struggle. It is the objective of a movement that determines its politics. Even if the method of struggle is inappropriate it is a different matter but it remains a political organization if the objectives are political.
PTA detainees
Political prisoners are those that have been taken prisoner on account of their political beliefs and/or actions committed in pursuance of those policies. The LTTE suspects fall into this category.
Another fallacy of the argument of the above writer is that all those who are taken into custody under the PTA are terrorists. Governments in office have right through used the PTA to take into custody and harass their political opponents. They have imprisoned and even indicted numerous persons though the victims had never even handled a single galkatas in their entire life. Some of these PTA detainees later became Members of Parliament and even Cabinet Ministers.
There is also the precedent of the former government pardoning several prominent LTTEers involved in armed actions against the State. In this background it is ridiculous to detain further a single individual that is now in custody since by comparison they are small fry.
The message that is given to the Tamil community by keeping the prisoners is that the Sinhala dominated governments, including the present one cannot be trusted. This would lead to a fresh round of alienation and estrangement.
Finally, let us have a quick glance at the PTA and its usage to understand its draconian nature. Under Section 9 of the PTA the Minster could detain any person when he "has reason to believe is connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity" for a period not exceeding three months in the first instance, in such place and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister, and any such order may be extended from time to time for a period not exceeding eighteen months at a time".
Thus everything is at the discretion of the Minister. He even determines the place of detention. It could be any private place. He can determine whatever condition and impose it on the victim. Usually the victim is not allowed even family visits and is not provided with newspapers.
What is worse is that under Section 10 "An order made under Section 9 shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court or tribunal by way of writ or otherwise".
Emergency regulations
Even after 18 months the suspect is not released. The practice has been to detain them then Regulation 18 of the under the Emergency Regulations which prescribes indefinite detention.
Once in detention the police need only to extract a confession from a victim. Under the PTA a confession is a valid evidence. One could only imagine how these confessions are taken. One has only to remind oneself of how kondaya confessed to murdering the little girl Seya or how evidence was found to incriminate a schoolboy in the same case.
Anyone taken into custody under the PTA reaches a dead end. He has no legal redress mechanism if he has been unjustly taken into custody. This is a violation of his basic human rights. Such laws should never be enacted. High time it is repealed together with similar regulations under the Emergency Regulations.

Food never felt this satisfying
Like I always said when travelling, if the company is good then you know the journey is going to be an epic one too. So getting on a bus on a random Friday and that too happened to be those 5-seater ones where you are just crammed in. Word of advice: do not take those buses if you have extra luggage and if you want to sit somewhere where you just got to keep on getting up and suck your stomach in, put your luggage above your head when people want to get in and get out.
This random getaway took me to Shinagawa Beach Resort located in Balapitiya. With the weather being topsy turvy I didnt expect it to be all sunny side up over there. But I think the weather god took a shine to us because she did give us a very beautiful weather to enjoy the weekend in a true Sun-Sea-Sand manner.
You can get off at the Balapitiya town and its just a 10 min taxi ride from there to the hotel. We checked in and were immediately shown to our rooms. Every room has the view of the beautiful Indian Ocean and my first reaction as I went to the balcony to take pictures (and upload to instagram) was that it reminded of the beautiful location in Bali Island that I remember seen in Rogers & Hammersteins South Pacific.
As we were hungry and basically didnt have breakfast we straight off freshened up and went to the restaurant. Salt Restaurant allows guests to dine in or outside by the poolside and looking over the ocean. I must add that the dining was the BEST part of my trip. You usually tend to get lost in the beauty of the property, room or just the surrounding. But in this particular trip the food really took me away.
There were only a few guests on the day I went so the property felt almost like yours alone. So the dining also becomes exclusive where you get to choose from their day to day to a-la-carte menu. I love my Sri Lankan rice and curry so I opted for that while my friend decided to have the Pasta. From the entre to soup to salads to the bread and their days specialty butter  it was exquisite. We ended up eating the bread and butter more than the others and since we are both foodies  we quite didnt expect what the weekend was about to unfold to us  food wise :).
The always smiling and very attentive staff explained to us that on the days they have few guests they serve the a-la-carte menu and on the days they hotel is happening or have guests who bring their staff for the weekend, then they opt for buffet so that hungry guests are not kept waiting for too long for their food. And they keep changing the menu every season so youre always having a taste of something new, unique and fresh. They have already changed the menu for the coming season so if you are making your way over there  you are in for a surprise.
As they had a few more guests arriving in the night, the culinary team organized a BBQ with everything you needed from meat to seafood. Since I had a heavy lunch I went slow on my dinner and it was a good thing too. When we went in for breakfast we got the a-la-carte menu again and it was a page full of things to eat. And yes, I did try out everything on the menu  and I do advice youll as well to have a light dinner and really try out everything at breakfast. From toast to cereal to waffles to pancakes and fruits and so much more  how can you resist it
They are totally different from the other hotel menus. Its no wonder, when the Resident Manager started off as a bartender in his beginning days. Our beverage menu has a lot of creations. And all the recipes given to make them are all my recipes - from the milkshakes to cocktails and even to the selection of the wines.
We have a very premium selection of wine as we are particular about the premium quality of things and we make sure to keep maintaining them. This is why people like this property so much and is very much known on TripAdvisor, Susantha Bernard added.
Everything that is served to the guests is homemade from chocolates to cashew nuts, even the bread is made in house along with the ice cream. One can truly feel the difference in taste when they take a bite of these delicacies.
The a-la-carte menu will include more local dishes especially with seafood dishes as Balapitiya is famous for their seafood collection. Their fish supplier stays very close to the property so everything is bought from fresh from him and nothing is kept in the deep freezers for long. They were awarded 7 medals as well from the Chef Guilds Culinary Awards 2015  2 Silver, 4 Bronze and a Gold.
Susantha who has been with the property from its inception has seen the improvement and popularity of the hotel taking place day by day. All 24 Deluxe rooms and the two Suites give you that spectacular beach view and of course is the perfect location to catch the sunset. And since you can basically dine in your room or the balcony, sometimes you wish to never leave the room.
But if you do decide to leave the room then there are plenty of stuff to do. You can lounge by the pool or the beach. Or you can unwind at their Spa which gives all the treatments from ancient healing to aromatherapy sure to give you that relaxed weekend. If you like to venture out of the hotel then you can try out their Water sports, river safari on the Madhu Ganga, check out the Turtle hatchery in Kosgoda, go get some souvenirs from traditional mask workshops and museums in Ambalangoda, go deep to a moonstone mine, visit the Kande Vihara ancient temple and even Whale watching in Mirissa.
And with Christmas and New Year around the corner the hotel has come with a few plans. Christmas will be all about an action buffet while for 31 they will go on the lines of seafood. They are hoping to get a boat and spread the seafood for people to pick and choose and get it done by their talented chefs. Tables will be set out in the grass. And at midnight they will have the fireworks as well as give each guest a wishing lantern to send off into the sky.
Sometimes, the random getaways are the best trips you can have. And since Balapitiya is not far from Colombo, you really dont feel far away from home.

A helping hand for would-be scholars
Twenties is a prime period in ones life. So it is for the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation (SLAFF) that celebrates its 23rd anniversary of scholarship award ceremony. About 137 new students will be eligible for the scholarship in 2015. The ceremony will be held at D S Senanayaka Central College Auditorium, Ampara, on November 20 at 3 pm under the patronage of Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Athukorala and Primary Industries Minister Daya Dharmapala Gamage. Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, State Minister Champika Premadasa, Former Minister P Dayaratne, Parliamentarians Sriyani Wijewickrama and Wimalaweera Disanayaka will also grace the occasion.
Agonshus chief donor Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera founded the Agonshu sect in Japan. Japan holds reputation for being home to a number of Buddhist sects. Agonshu is a grouping of Northern Mahayana, Southern Theravada and Tibetan esoteric Buddhism.
Historical evidence indicates how Buddhism arrived in Japan officially in the sixth century. It was multi-theism that existed before the arrival of Buddhism. Buddhism was Koreas gift to Japan. To Korea it was a gift from China. Apparently Buddhism linked these three countries: Korea, China and Buddhism.
Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation was inaugurated in 1994 under the patronage of Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama. The Thera will turn 95 in January, 2016. A series of programmes to offer him blessings will be held following the scholarship awards ceremony.
The scholarship is the only programme offered to students who have failed their Grade V scholarship.
If we just neglected them, the nation would have been deprived of many scholars. SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana noted.
Under its Agonshu scholarship prgoramme, SLAFF has awarded 12915 Annual Educational Scholarships and 33 Annual Scholarships for medical students so far. At its 23rd Annual Scholarship Awarding Ceremony, 735 scholarships are to be awarded to students from all parts of the island for 2016.
The scholarship programme has produced doctors, engineers, university lecturers and other scholars. The scholarship, which includes three uniforms, shoes and socks, and exercise books in addition to Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary, feeds its holder till they pass A-Ls. Medical College students will get a coupon. Every province, except for North, has been benefited by the scholarship programme.
Once the scholarship is offered, a strict procedure is followed. The education level is considered in addition to the low income level. Divisional coordinators are appointed to monitor the scholarship holders.
There are times when some exploit these scholarships. We are at liberty to get rid of them immediately. Scholarship is an invaluable asset, and we cannot afford to waste it away.
The inspection for the scholarship holders will also be done. SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana himself takes the trouble to go through each and every exercise book to check on the scholarship holders progress. We make it an opportunity to talk to parents individually too. Some parents have financial issues as well as other material problems.
The New Year festivities are done every Sinhala Tamil New year to gather all scholarship holders. In addition to scholarships, SLAFF makes use of its funds to help dilapidated temples. Addarapathirana knows value of scholarship since he is a Grade V scholarship recipient. He initiated his career as a teacher in Matara.
I studied under harsh conditions. I still remember how our temple used to be. Even after 20 years, the temple was still like that. The sermon hall was beyond repair. We could build a two-storied building for various purposes.
The foundation has built over 200 buildings mostly meant for schools. The Buddhas birth, according to Japanese calendar, came to pass on April 8. The SLAFF had planted a Bo tree in Thanthirimale to commemorate the great event.
Agonshus social responsibility is not confined to Sri Lanka. Various other projects are implemented in Italy, Thailand, USA, France, Israel and Bhutan. Most Ven Kiriyama Thera, however, had remarked that it is in Sri Lanka that the Agonshu projects are carried out good and proper. Recognizing Addara Pathiranas painstaking as well as instrumental role as Director General, he was further appointed as the Advisor for South Asian Affairs of the Agonshu Sect.
This is a great achievement for us Sri Lankans. We could genuinely be happy as we have several outcomes. The achievements of our scholarship recipients at public exams are one. In addition the Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Special Vocational Training Centre in Matara district has given vocational training to 1240 youths. We could also offer assistance to over 200 Buddhist temples. SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana added.

IGL pioneers gas production from Sevanagala molasses fermentation
Industrial Gases Ltd. (IGL) will partner with Sri Lanka Sugar Company (A 100% Government owned entity), in pioneering a project involving the installation of its own plant with state-of-the-art environmental-friendly technology enabling a more cost effective method of capturing CO2 emitted during the molasses fermentation process at Sevanagala Sugar Plantations.
IGLChairman Sumith Guruge said they are pleased to be the pioneers of such projects; this being the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, and are excited about the potential opportunities for their enterprise in this sector.
"Capturing the CO2 that is otherwise released into the atmosphere will help reduce this emission into the environment that could result in harmful effects. In addition to contributing towards reduction in CO2 imports, we hope to provide a boost to the economy as a result of this venture. The combination of IGL's financial strength and development capability together with the specialist knowledge and experience of the best engineering team will help to position us as the leading CO2 manufacturer in this sector."
Gas World Pvt. Ltd., which is under the IGL umbrella, recently launched the supply of medical gases to private and government health sector establishments.
CO2 production is estimated at around 200 to 300 tons of CO2 per month. IGL will in addition, provide Sri Lanka Sugar Co. the opportunity of obtaining carbon credit in lieu of this operation.
As part of IGL's acceleration of its plan for growth and development, this undertaking provides advanced capabilities from a dedicated on-site supply of CO2 liquid gas anytime, anywhere. Commercial production is presently underway after extensive pilot testing and final commissioning of the production process.
The resulting CO2 is trapped, cleaned and safely stored in special storage tanks which would be delivered to any part of the country by the company's efficient fleet of bowsers.
The commissioning of this vital project provides efficient facilities for CO2 manufacture and storage, backed by standardized technologies that ensure reliability and safety while optimizing logistics. Installation of the plant was carried out by IGL engineering staff under the supervision of the manufacturers.
Major equipment is PLC controlled with automatic operation designed to produce the highest quality and purity that is compatible for the food and beverage industry. Other sectors that would benefit from this project are the welding industry, fish exports, airline industry and courier sector, in addition to the servicing of fire extinguishing systems, carbonation of soft drinks, freezing of food products.

Importers play vital role in shaping Lanka's economy - CCC
Sri Lankan importers currently face numerous challenges and the Government should identify them immediately and focus more attention towards solving them, Ceylon Chamber Of Commerce (CCC) , Import Section, Chairman Dinesh De Siva said.
Chairman De Silva made these comments at a media forum held at the CCC Auditorium.
Speaking further De Silva said the CCC, the country's largest grouping of local importers marks its 80 th anniversary and since the formation of the Association it worked tirelessly to help the national economy grow, while looking after the interest of local importers.
He said the Associations' work came to a standstill and it did not function until 1928. The Association was reestablished on December 1928.
"The Import Section plays a vital role in shaping Sri Lankan economy by promoting, coordinating and supporting the interest of the local import trade," He said it is the duty of officials to look into the problems faced by local importers and rectify them immediately before the main importers get discouraged which will affect the country's economy.
Quoting examples De Silva said although the price of imported drugs are controlled and they cannot be sold beyond the controlled price, the countries from where these drugs are brought time to time change the cost of the prices and as a result local drug importers face untold hardships. This situation must be looked into by authorities.
He also made similar comments on imported cosmetic items too.
He said "Our country still has an import dependent economy and it is the duty of authorities to focus attention towards increasing exports in order to swell the country's economy. It is sad to say that our imports from India is higher than our exports to that country,"
"Although we have forwarded the problems faced by our importers to authorities the relevant Government institutions do not take firm actions in a proper manner"
He said the Import section has taken several initiatives with the support of the successful governments to ensure that the best interest of importers are met and this will be its prime objective in future.
"The import section of the CCC plays a critical role in the continuous advancement of the import sector of the country.. It initiates action to identify future trends, he said.
Sanjeev Samaranayaka said "We maintain an excellent rapport with the state sector and provides a platform for its members to project issues affecting their trade.
He said the Import Section functions as a facilitator and a link between the members and the government sector.
"Considering the yeoman service rendered to the import trade, the Committee has thought to commemorate this historic occasion in an appropriate manner by conducting the 80 th Anniversary celebratins on November 22,"
A number of Senior CCC officials including, CCC, Chief economist, Anuska Wijesinha, CCC, Import Section Past Chairman Kevin Edwards, CCC, Import Section, Committee Member Sanjeeva Samaranayaka were also present.

Ishani  adjudged champion womens swimmer
Twenty two year old Ishani Senanayake of Sri Lanka Army was adjudged the champion women's swimmer at the National Swimming Championship organised by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) and worked off at the Sugathadasa Stadium Swimming Complex in Colombo.
Ishani Senanayake though still very young is a much heralded swimmer having several meet and national records to her credit. She had her initial eduction at Samudra Devi Balika Vidyalaya where she cut her teeth in swimming before going over to Sirimavo Balika Vidyalaya for her Advance Levels where her rough edges were cut. There is swimming in her family as her elder sister Niyathamani is a top swimmer and now an officer with the Sri Lanka Army. At school level she set up many records and won a large haul of medals.
At this National Swimming Championship 2015 she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze.
What is most remarkable about her performance was that she was indisposed three days before the championship which continued up to the day of the meet and was in two minds whether to compete or not, as she will not be able to give out her best. She was persuaded by her mother to participate who said that winning or losing does not matter and armed with some of her personal best timings that she could not lose much.
Her swimming coach Manoj Abysinghe further encouraged her to compete and the rest of the talking was done by her swimming. Her meet timings is as follows:
800 metres free style 10.07 mts Gold Medal.
400 metres free style 4.50 mts. Gold Medal.
200 metres free style 2.17 mts. Gold Medal.
200 metres back stroke 2.27 mts. Silver Medal.
200 metres Beast stroke 3.05 mts Bronze Medal.
With dehydration troubling her, she could not go for record timing or better her personal best but with will and determination she was able to grab three first places and was also adjudged the Best Women Swimmer of the meet No doubt a great achievement considering the circumstances she was placed in.
Free Style appears to be her forte and winning the 800 metres even she gave an object lesson and with strong will and steel nerves one could overcome these hurdles.
She is now training for the next South Asian Games in New Delhi, India. This little girl with her father in the hospital bed for a long time is determined to make him happy with her performance, though complete recovery at this stage could be a shot in the dark'.
This is Ishani Senanayake always sporting a smile and adversity could not put her down easily. She is a brave girl with her mother and sister to support her and of course with the blessings of her bed ridden father. This writer met her in April this year and since then through words of encouragement she has come a long way.

## Title: Japan's train diplomacy
## Supertitle:

Japan's train diplomacy
Since the first operational line between Shinbashi and Yokohama opened in 1872, rail has become a major Japanese industry, even creating several milestones, such as the Asia Express and Shinkansen. Although Japan's exports in this industry are considerable and the country also builds railroad facilities overseas, those deals are mainly either commercial or aid, such as Official Development Assistance (ODA). With its active foreign policy, the second Abe administration offers the Japanese railroad industry the potential to play a salient role in diplomacy.
First, given demographic changes and competition from highways and aviation, domestic Japanese demand for trains is decreasing. Since the period of the "bubble" economy, a number of railroad lines, especially in remote areas, have gone out of service, and this trend is unlikely to stop any time soon, with JR Hokkaido just announcing another wave of local line closures. As a result, Japanese rail manufacturers need to look overseas for new markets.
Second, rail sends a strong geostrategic signal. On the one hand, rail is still an efficient means of land transportation, one that can stimulate trade and secure the supply of certain resources or materials. In China's "One Belt, One Road" policy to extend its geopolitical influence, railroads are a key element, especially high-speed rail. Tokyo could use railroad projects to counter Beijing's geopolitical expansion. With its excellent safety record, high reliability, and original technology, Japan's railroad industry may still be able to compete with cheaper Chinese counterparts. Moreover, given its geographic location and political environment, Japan is unlikely to represent the same kind of geopolitical pressure to other countries of the region that Beijing does.
Economic recovery agenda
Third, given a lack of uniform signal, power, and other technical conditions, in contrast to aviation, sea transport, and highways, railroad is not universally compatible with alternative platforms. In other words, obtaining a contract to construct a railroad would to a certain extent ensure subsequent economic opportunity, which in turn would be helpful for Abe's economic recovery agenda.
Currently, Japan's railroad diplomacy takes three forms: donations, aid, and joint high-speed rail projects. Donations refer to Japanese rail operators, such as JR East Japan, sending their retired rolling stock to developing countries.
Many Southeast Asian countries, particularly Myanmar, have received a number of used Japanese trains. However, when Japanese railroad operators mainly use electric multiple units (EMUs), their retired EMUs may not fit receiver countries' needs. For example, the Philippine National Railway (PNR) had to significantly modify the JR 203 series EMU to run on its non-electric system.
Moreover, despite showing friendship, donations create little economic benefit, so that they should not be the mainstay of Japan's rail diplomacy. Aid in building railroad facilities is similarly unprofitable. Although construction is related to certain technical requirements, such as gauge and curve radius, those conditions are usually determined by existing systems that Tokyo is unable to significantly influence.
Compared to regional projects such as subways or commuter trains, high-speed rail are the most important target for Japanese rail diplomacy, given their large influence.
Technological capacity
Reflecting colonial or other historical legacies, many developing countries' railroad systems, especially in Southeast Asia, are narrow gauge (less than 1.435 metres), such as 1 or 1.067 metres, with a top speed no higher than 160 km/h. In South Asia and other areas, despite using standard (1.435 m) or wide gauges, such as 1.676 metres, safety, signal systems, and other conditions such as slope, tracks, and curve radius make the lines unsuitable for high-speed operation. Therefore, when those countries plan to build high-speed railroads, unlike their European counterparts, they need to establish a new and distinct system rather than upgrading their existing assets. This means greater budgets and thus more potential for profits. In addition, high-speed rail projects often pave the way to additional construction, such as economic corridors, new cities, and industrial zones.
In terms of high-speed rail, Japan not only has the longest experience and an excellent safety record, it also offers various indigenous designs, from the mini-Shinkansen with lower construction standards to a magnetic levitation train under construction that is scheduled to link Tokyo and Osaka, with a shorter demonstration service. That is, Tokyo has the options and the technological capacity to pursue its rail diplomacy with high-speed lines. Despite its impressive technology capacity, Japan's rail diplomacy faces challenges, as evidenced by the loss of an Indonesian project to a Chinese bid. As with most infrastructure projects, high-speed rail is unlikely to be a purely commercial competition - political involvement is unavoidable.
Political leaders
Politically, it is easier for Beijing and its state-owned enterprises to concentrate resources than it is for Japanese commercial actors to cooperate with their official counterparts, which might be checked by the Japanese Diet and media. Moreover, countries looking for high-speed rail are often short of capital, so that financial support will be crucial. With its more rapidly growing economy, China might be better placed to provide loans and other financial measures than Japan is. For political leaders in most countries, quick results at relatively low cost are always attractive.

KR explores innovation in fashion with 3D Concept Studio
Sri Lankan fashion designer Kasuni Rathnasuriya, founder of contemporary womens wear line KR, recently showcased her latest collection for spring/summer 2016 (SS16) at the Sunshine Coast Fashion Festival in Australia.
The collection was a mix of past and future with the incorporation of traditional Beeralu lace and 3D printing. To make her vision for this collection a reality Kasuni partnered with Sri Lankas first rapid prototyping firm, 3D Concept Studio. With their help she was able to 3D print the unique eyewear the models wore on the runway.
I wanted to create a phenomenal look for the SS16 collection, Kasuni said. As a clothing label we are very much open to new technology. I wanted to bring conventional and non-conventional elements together to create a phenomenal look. If you look at the SS16 collection it has handcrafted lace incorporated clothing, 3D printed accessories/eyewear and handmade leather shoes. And its all made locally. We want to be futuristic as the fashion business is heavily influenced by technology today.
New to the technology herself Kasuni took advantage of 3D Concept Studios wealth of experience and design features to take her concepts from the drawing board to completed accessories. The learning experience has convinced her of the future of the technology within the fashion industry.
I believe in 20-30 years down the line we will all have a 3D printing facility at home and well be printing our own pieces. Or downloading artwork from different designers from different parts of the world and printing our own accessories at home. Thats the extreme we could go with this technology. This will change a lot of things in the fashion business just like how social media is being used to advertise brands, Kasuni added. The influence of technology on fashion is clearly evident with the growing trend of 3D printing in the industry from big name brands to haute couture. These experiments and fledgling attempts with the technology move the boundary between imagination and reality and slowly evolve the capabilities of designers and what they are able to offer.
3D printing holds a lot of potential for fashion. It releases designers from the constraints of traditional manufacturing and allows them to explore a wider array of shapes and designs. What was impossible is no longer the case. Their only boundary now is their imagination, 3D Concept Studio CEO and Founder Nissanga Warnapura stressed.
Kasunis label KR is an ethically conscious brand that respects local traditions, heritage and craftsmanship. A labour of love the label helps to revitalise a dying craft in Sri Lanka while empowering the Beeralu weavers, mainly women, in the south of Sri Lanka.
3D Concept Studio was founded in 2013 and offers services in 2D and 3D design, 3D scanning, 3D printing, 3D fabrication and laser cutting.

Ko and Park fight for top spot
United States, Thursday: New Zealand teen star Lydia Ko and South Koreas seven-time major winner Park In-Bee will fight for the LPGAs top prizes this week at the season-ending Tour Championship.
Lydia Ko of New Zealand putts during the final round of the Evian Championship Golf on September 13, 2015 in Evian-les-Bains, France.
While 18-year-old Ko, who won her first major title at this years Evian Championship among her five tour triumphs this season, has the edge on Park in the chase for world number one, LPGA Player of the Year, the season money crown and the season points title.
Park, 30, won the Womens British Open and her third consecutive Womens PGA Championship among her five LPGA titles this season and leads in the Vare Trophy scoring average contest.
But the margins are slim enough to take the drama for each of those honors into the years final round.
Im going to just try and concentrate on my game and I think thats what Inbee is going to do, Ko said. Ive just got to concentrate on my game.
I know there are obviously a lot of things on the line at the end of Sunday, but if I end up thinking about all the things like Player of the Year or Vare Trophy or the race or the tournament, I think its way too much because when were out there were just trying to hit good shots, trying to make a lot of good putts and give ourselves good looks for birdies.
Ko won last years $1 million (939,000 euros) bonus for the season points title and captured the Tour Championship for another $500,000 for the richest payday in womens golf history. But Park comes in off her 17th career LPGA victory at the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Mexico and has given herself a chance to finish the season atop the rankings. A victory would ensure that but she could finish as low as 12th this weekend and still pass Ko.
It feels good to actually have a chance, Park said. I thought I may not have a chance at Player of the Year coming into last week, but after winning, that definitely gave me a good chance to look at it this week.
Its good that I actually got an opportunity. I should be very thankful for that. It was already a great season with the two major wins.
- Scary similarities for Ko, Park -Park said the most dangerous thing about a showdown with Ko is how similar the Kiwi prodigys style is to her own game.
Shes a very good putter and so am I, Park said. I think were good short game players and not long hitters, but we can hit it straight, and were mentally very similar, staying calm on the golf course.

Korea helps enhance database capacities in Census and Statistics Dept
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) launched a project to set up a Statistical Database Management System (SDMS) with the financial and technical co-operation of the office of the Commissioner of the Statistics, Korea (KOSTAT), Director General Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe said.
Addressing the overview of KOSTAT project second year completion ceremony in Colombo on Wednesday, he said the project will modernise the system of data inputs in statistical production and deliver efficient service to end users.
The project was designed by the Korea Institute for Development Strategy(KDS) to enhance cooperation between Korea and Sri Lanka and strengthen sustainable statistical capacity for governmental officials of DCS and establish IT infrastructure in Sri Lanka for an advanced national statistical system.
The project duration is three years. The KDS takes in charge of management and implementation of its 2nd year from April to November 2015 and 3rd year in 2016.
The project scope covers system development, expert dispatch, provision of equipment and training.
The system development includes development of SDMS, statistical portal service system, meta-data system and integrated data base.
It also includes human resources development and IT infrastructure development in data collection, processing and dissemination.
The Director General said the US$ 2.1 million project will be completed by the end of 2016.
KOSTAT will support the DCS to set up mid and long-term development plans, develop strategies to strengthen human resources and training in Sri Lanka.
The project includes training in Korea for high level and working level officials and instructors. The project will set up a training centre at the DCS, he said. "The DCS plays an important role in the dissemination of data among users. We need to set up an efficient and user-friendly system. We don't have a database. We store data in different forms.
We use a manual data collection process. It is costly and inefficient because it involves several steps such as collection and
transportation of documents and data entry process,"he said.
"In the last census, we used scanning for data entry. We hope to introduce a computer-based data collection system under the project to eliminate paper work and improve efficiency in data processing," Satharasinghe said.
A statistical database management and service system helps enter data easily and provides users the access to official statistics in more productive and efficient way while strengthening the capacity of the statistics staff.

Motorcycles: main cause for fatal accidents - Dr. Kodagoda
Motorcyclists failing to adhere to road rules have resulted in a large number of deaths. The National Council for Road Safety and the Traffic Police Department have shown concern over the increase in road accidents due to motorcycles. The quality of the motorcycle and safety of the children who travel on motorcycles without helmets have become the prime concern of the authorities in order to reduce fatal deaths.
A preliminary study on the condition of the motorcycle would begin in the near future in collaboration with the Moratuwa University's Engineering Faculty, said National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda.
According to the Traffic Police Department, there is a vast difference between the conditions of the Japanese manufactured motorcycles and Indian motorcycles.
The durability and brake system of the Japanese motorcycle is in better condition, compared to the Indian motorcycle, while there is also the possibility of Indian motorcycles being thrown away easily, Traffic Police Department sources said.
However, there is also a clear difference in the nature of injury caused to the riders, the sources added.
"It is motorcycles that collide with vehicles very often and it is also the motorcyclists who violate road rules in all possible ways," Dr Kodagoda said.
The Traffic Police Department enforces laws pertaining to road rules, but it is the traffic police officer who experiences the real situation on roads.
Motorcycle riders are those who are hard to handle as they never adhere to road rules, said a Traffic Police officer, who declined to reveal his identity as he had no authority to speak to the media.
According to the police department, the main causes for accidents are careless riding, unable to control vehicles, speeding, overtaking ignoring traffic laws, driving on the right side of the road, drunk driving and cornering carelessly.
Dr Kodagoda said motorcycle riders between the ages of 25 to 40 years, are those who prefer taking up the challenge of riding motorcycles at high speed.
He further said the motivating factor for the riders is that, they are able to move faster on our roads by the use of motorcycles than cars, while buses have to endure traffic jams. Motorcyclists maneuver in between vehicles at the risk to their lives, unmindful of the rights of other road users such as vehicles and pedestrians.
Many riders are not up to standard in riding, especially in busy streets or the suburbs. Inexperienced motorcyclists have led many of them in colliding with vehicles quite often, said sources of the Traffic Department.
According to police statistics, 43 percent of the accidents have occurred when motorcyclists lose control and 49 percent of deaths have occurred due to speeding.
High speed is one of the main reasons for the loss of control, said Dr Kodagoda.
Careless riding is another reason for many accidents, said Dr. Kodagoda.
The Police Department said that motorcyclists and pillion riders should wear authorized head gear, while the chin strap of an authorized helmet protects the rider as well as the pillion rider.
The Police Department intends to strictly implement laws against motorcyclists and pillion riders wearing helmets which violate laws.
Most riders do not use proper helmets. They are unable to see through the helmets. Motorcyclists do not wear authorized helmets. Helmets are thrown away when motorcycles collide with other vehicles. This causes head injuries, said Dr. Kodagoda.
He added that other drivers do not notice motorcycles when they are in front. Therefore, steps are taken to attach light sensitive glow stickers on helmets and motorcycles to enable other drivers to notice the motorcycles travelling in front.
Dr. Kodagoda pointed out that parents who take children on motorcycles without their helmets should consider the dangers of this practice.
Children who travel on motorcycles should wear helmets and parents should make sure that they wear the correct size, he added.
Almost all parents take their children on motorcycles without their helmets. This is very dangerous. They carry infants on motorcycles. Mothers carry babies on one hand and holds on to the motorcycle with the free hand. This is very unsafe, said the traffic police officer.
Dr. Kodagoda said awareness programmes would be conducted for parents on the dangers caused to children riding without helmets.
However, the Traffic Police Department pointed out that according to law, not more than two persons could ride on a motorcycle.
Parents should be cautious as their children's lives are at stake, they said.
Motorcyclists are accused of accidents and deaths that occur due to carelessness. The Traffic Police Department who deal with incidents daily, stressed that it is the carelessness of motorcyclists that lead to deaths.
Police statistics have revealed that 38 percent of the people killed in vehicle accidents are motorcyclists. About 75 percent of pedestrians are killed in accidents caused by motorcyclists.
They do not ride on the proper side of the road and make sudden turns which are reasons for the increase of motorcycle accidents. They do not care for road rules. Some motorcyclists take us for a joke, he added.
Dr. Kodagoda said when vehicles are stopped to let pedestrians cross the road, it is the motorcyclists who move forward first, causing injuries to pedestrians.
He said motorcycles are a convenient mode of transport, but they need to ride safely.
Motorcyclists should understand that it is not only they who are affected due to carelessness, but also threatens the life of pedestrians. However, he said, change in the attitude of riders would reduce fatalities.
"We are planning to strengthen the legal system pertaining to motorcyclists and increase the fines imposed on them. Programmes would be conducted for youths on the dangers of reckless riding, he added.

NASA to grow flowers in space for first time
US: It is the first time that a flowering crop will be grown on the orbiting laboratory, NASA said.
Flowers could be blooming on the International Space Station (ISS) after the New Year, thanks to NASA's first flowering crop experiment on the orbiting laboratory.
NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren activated the Veggie plant growth system and its rooting "pillows" containing Zinnia seeds on the space station.
Growing Zinnias in orbit will help provide precursory information about other flowering plants that could be grown in space. It is the first time that a flowering crop will be grown on the orbiting laboratory, NASA said.
"Growing a flowering crop is more challenging than growing a vegetative crop such as lettuce," said Gioia Massa, NASA Kennedy Space Centre payload scientist for Veggie.
"Lighting and other environmental parameters are more critical," said Massa.
Lindgren will turn on the red, blue and green LED lights, activate the water and nutrient system to Veggie, and monitor the plant growth.
The Zinnias will grow for 60 days, which is twice as long as the first and second crop of Outredgeous red romaine lettuce that grew on the space station.
During the growth cycle, the LED lights will be on for 10 hours and off for 14 hours in order to stimulate the plants to flower.
"Growing the Zinnia plants will help advance our knowledge of how plants flower in the Veggie growth system, and will enable fruiting plants like tomatoes to be grown and eaten in space using Veggie as the in-orbit garden," said Trent Smith, Veggie program manager at Kennedy.
Researchers also hope to gather good data regarding long-duration seed stow and germination, whether pollen could be an issue, and the impacts on crew morale.
Growing tomato plants on the space station is planned for 2017, NASA said.
The Veggie system was developed by Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) in Madison, Wisconsin, and tested at Kennedy before flight.
Veggie, along with two sets of pillows containing romaine seeds and one set of zinnias, was delivered to the station by SpaceX on the third cargo resupply mission in April 2014. - PTI

New satellite plane tracking system agreed
A deal has been struck on using satellites to track planes, motivated by the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 last year.
The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow "real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world," said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radio communication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
'Record' response
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.

Obama enlists unlikely ally to safeguard climate deal
PHILIPPINES: Fearing a nascent global climate accord could be strangled at birth by sceptical US Republicans, President Barack Obama is wooing an unlikely ally -- big business.
Obama has spent the months ahead of crunch talks in Paris starting on November 30, setting out the moral, political and economic case for tackling climate change.
On Wednesday in Manila, Obama renewed that push, urging a forum of influential Asia-Pacific CEOs to get behind the accord, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are blamed for global warming.
"An ambitious agreement in Paris will prompt investors to invest in clean energy technologies because they will understand that the world is committed to a low-carbon future," Obama said.
"That's a signal to the private sector to go all-in on renewable energy technologies."
It is just the latest White House effort to woo companies and get big name CEOs to lend their political support to the deal.
At the White House in October, Obama hosted CEOs from Intel, Johnson & Johnson and some of the 81 companies that have signed up to a climate pledge.
But the White House drive is about more than moral support, it's about creating political facts on the ground.
The White House is betting that having corporate support will make new rules more difficult to overturn and position climate-denying Republicans in an uncomfortable position in opposition to their traditional allies.
"If you look at the history of environmental regulation, rules that are put in place that go with the grain of where the industry is headed very rarely get scrapped or completely overturned," said a senior administration official.
"When they become embedded in the structure of the sector in which they operate you actually create long-term incentives that the private sector responds to, and they become part of the structure of our economy."
Administration officials point to the experience of fuel economy standards. That "offered companies long-term certainty -- instead of states setting" a multitude of disparate rules.
In the White House and among US allies there is a perennial concern that US commitment to a deal could be gutted after the 2016 election.
Two decades ago Bill Clinton, a second term democratic president agreed the Kyoto Protocol in the twilight of his administration.
Within months, Republican victor George W. Bush had shredded the agreement and along with it US credibility on climate change. Obama could find himself in much the same position as Clinton did before Kyoto was agreed. On Tuesday the Republican-run US Senate rejected key rules wanted by Obama's administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions by power plants. - AFP

Politicos accountable for inter union rivalry - Railway TUs
The inter-union rivalry and rancour among Railway Department Trade Unions was fanned by politicians who held the transport portfolio in the past, the joint council of Railway Trade Unions stated in a press release yesterday. The council said that although Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva recently claimed that union rivalry had prevented him from filling vacancies in the Railway Department, all former Transport Ministers, including Minister de Silva were to be blamed for creating rivalry and fanning it for their personal political gain.
Administration in the Railway Department had been messed up due to political interference.
The General Manager of Railways was in a helpless situation unable to enroll even a casual employee to the department.
The release said former Minister Kumara Welgama made political recruitments to the department from the Kalutara district only through the consultation of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Dumriya Sevaka Sangamaya while former Transport Minister Madduma Bandara made recruitments from the Uva Province.

## Title: The right quality of rice

The right quality of rice
The price of rice is escalating daily making the consumers pay more for their staple diet. Meanwhile, the authorities have failed to take meaningful steps to solve some of the problems related to rice production. The winding up of the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) would give the private sector a free hand to handle this vital sector in our country.
There are many problems when dealing with paddy cultivation and rice production. One is to provide good quality rice and it is strange that this situation continues despite laws such as those on consumer protection.
Before 1977 rice milling was the sole monopoly of the government. The government made use of the private rice millers to process the paddy brought under the guaranteed price scheme. The rice thus processed was distributed by the Food Department.
The system of government control was introduced to regulate the price of rice and to give farmers a better floor price. The setting up of the PMB was to purchase paddy from the farmers and sell rice to the consumers at a reasonable price. Therefore, it became the sole responsibility of the PMB to handle the food supply in the country.
The Food Department
With the change of government in 1977, it was decided to do away with the existing system. Thus the milling and marketing of rice was passed on to the private sector. The PMB functioned as a standby to handle milling and selling rice and it also kept buffer stocks to keep the price of rice stable.
The Food Department handled the imported rice and the PMB was in charge of handling local rice. Along with these changes small time rice millers came into the scene.
After liberalization, millers have become the middlemen who buy paddy, mill it and sell it to consumers. They also handle the distribution of paddy to the retail sellers. The consumers in turn receive their supply of rice from the wholesalers as well as retail dealers.
In the end, the millers and traders profit at the expense of the farmers and consumers. In the study of the problems dealing with rice production, one has to go into the details concerning the process of rice milling. Only then will it be possible to identify the problems.
There are two types of milling done in our country. They are raw rice milling and parboiled milling. Raw rice milling is done mainly in the south of Sri Lanka.
The advantage of milling parboiled rice is that it can be kept for a longer time than raw rice. But the raw rice is more nutritious than parboiled rice. It is also found that two thirds of our consumers eat parboiled rice.
Modern milling methods
In order to produce quality rice, the first step is to harvest the paddy at the proper time. When the grain is harvested there is 15% to 18% moisture in the grain. The process of milling par boiled rice begins by soaking the paddy in water, steaming, drying and finally hulling.
Paddy is soaked in cold water for 24 hours before it is steamed and par boiled. The water is changed at least once every twelve hours. Research has shown that the process of hot water soaking before steaming and parboiling takes less time. It also removes the offensive smell in parboiled rice.
In developed countries, modern milling methods have reduced the time required for parboiling to a few hours. This is possible by adopting the technique of soaking paddy in hot water.
In our country, the mills usually keep the paddy for 24 to 36 hours in cold water. They do not change the water to make the rice absorb more moisture and become heavier. The quality of water affects the rice adversely. The ideal form of drying is achieved through sunlight. The moisture content in rice for milling should be 13.5 - 14% which is the same as for milling raw rice.
The fact remains that the miller is not concerned in giving the consumer quality rice. He mills his rice when the moisture content is between 15 -16%. This gives added weight to the rice but its keeping time is shortened and it tends to mould in storage.
In finding solutions to overcome these problems Pathmasiri Dias of Somasiri Hullers has identified the areas where improvements should be made.
He has pointed out the stages that need the attention of the rice millers; cleaning, milling and winnowing, separating, destining, polishing and grading.
During these stages the millers should take extra care in the process of milling. When paddy is brought from the threshing floor, there are impurities picked up especially while harvesting and transporting, which has to be cleaned before milling begins.
This means the extraction of dust and other extraneous matter such as immature, unripe paddy, sand and stones. When cleaning paddy, a sheller (rubber roller) should be used. Before the rubber roller, steel cylinders were used and there was a high rate of breakage of grains.
The sheller separates the hull from the grain. In advanced rice-producing countries, rubber roller shellers are used for rice milling.
The process of hulling or shelling is designed to separate the hull from the grain. The hull must be separated from the grain through the process of winnowing.
In shelling or hulling the milling machine functions only with 85 percent efficiency. This result in 85 percent of brown rice and 15 percent un-hulled grain mixed with extraneous matter such as stones equivalent in size to the paddy grain left over.
The paddy thus hulled and winnowed comes out approximately as 85% brown rice and 15% un-hulled paddy.
The mixture of rice and un-hulled of separation where a separator is used. This machine separates the brown rice from the un-hulled paddy. The hulled brown rice is contaminated with a certain amount of stones equivalent in size to the grains.
The separated brown rice will now go through the process of de-stoning. The most efficient process of de-stoning can be done at this point because of the difference in surface structures between the grain and stones.
Developed countries
The grain still coated with bran has a smooth and even surface while the stones have a rough and uneven surface. The process of de-stoning leaves the brown rice taking away the contaminating foreign matter.
In developed countries at this stage the rice grain is polished. The best method of polishing is not to apply too much of pressure to the grain which will result in breathing and consequently cracking it. Polishing is best done in three stages.
The first stage removes 40 to 45 percent of bran by a polisher. This is called first - pass - polishing. Then the rice is tempered or allowed to cool. In the second stage called the second - pass - polishing another 30 - 35% bran is removed. The machine peeler is then used to remove the balance bran. It should be noted that is the bran. It should be noted that it is the bran that contains the nutrition. The rice thus gone through the processes of polishing and pealing contains a small amount of broken rice. Separation of the broken rice from the whole grain is the process of grading.
In our country rice millers use only a sheller and a polisher of the cylinder type. This type of polishing results in wasting the grain and in passing husk with polished grain proper milling and polishing results in 71% turnover efficiency as against 67-68% efficiency when done in the wrong way. The process of milling must be improved in matters of cleaning, par-boiling, hulling, destoning, polishing and grading.
The rice must leave the mill as quality rice with the correct moisture content and free of impurities.
The quality must be ensured and in a manner that leaves no room for the wholesaler and the retailer to tamper with it. Today, adulteration takes place either at the miller's end or at the trader's end. Therefore rice leaving the mill should be packed in 1/2 kg, 1kg, 5kg, 10kg, 50kg and 80kg packages. Each packet should carry the name and address of the miller. Only then can the miller be held responsible for the quality of the rice packets will prevent adulteration at the trader's end. Only the co-ordinated approach will improve the quality of rice that the consumers' need.

Sacred Tree Of Life
A branch of the sacred Bodhi tree was brought to Anuradhapura from Bodhgaya in India over 2,000 years ago. I caught a leaf and learnt about the incredible importance of Anuradhapura as a pilgrims site.
Sri Lankas first capital city Anuradhapura is where the sacred tree Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya is found. Over 2200 years ago Sanghamitra Thera brought a branch of the sacred Bodhi tree (under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment) to Anuradhapura from Bodhgaya in India. The tree was planted by the then reigning monarch, King Devanampiyatissa and is the oldest recorded tree in the world. To explore this magnificent ancient city, get a guide and better still book a bike tour so you can really go off the beaten track.
Natures inspiration
Cannonball flower given as puja
My guide J P Ravinia Jayalat aka Tharanga explained entering the holy of holies, that if you fold a Bo leaf you will see how nature inspired the architectural design of the areas magnificent temple stupors. I also learn the meaning behind the colours of the Buddhist flag from Tharanga organized through Ulagalla resort. Each colour has a meaning: Blue- confidence, Yellow  holiness, Red- wisdom, White  purity and Orange  desire.
If you have time talk to the fascinating priests based at the most sacred site on the island, they will explain why. All Sri Lankan Buddhists believe in the Sri Maha Bodhi. The tree has many special qualities like the way that only one leaf falls at a time from the south branch, but from the other branches three leaves fall simultaneously.
The temple guardians
Walking around clock wise I learn how the city founded in 337BC was made the capital of the country by King Paundukabhaya, who started the far sighted irrigation works and tanks that have made the area so inhabitable and are still great places to cool off. At one time, the city was ranked alongside Nineveh and Babylon for its colossal proportions, with avenues that artists occupied and areas where foreign merchants had their houses. Most impressive is the enormous Lovamahapaya, situated on the processional way that leads to the tree, an extraordinary ruin with countless rows of tightly packed granite columns, originally seven storeys high and housing more than 3,000 monks.
Sri Maha Bodhi
If you want to see the Sri Maha Bodhi among the other 44 amazing sites remember the temple is only open from 6am and closing between 12-2pm and reopening when it gets cooler from 2pm-9pm. If you arrive during lunch hour do go and see one of the many impressive museums starting with the Anuradhapura Archaeological Museum (open 8.30am-5.30pm except for Tuesdays and public holidays) between the Brazen Palace and the Ruwanweli Seya. Then there is the Folk Museum next door detailing the culture of the north-western province, the small museum at the Isurumuni Raja Maha Viharaya where you can see the beautiful 4th-6th century Isurumuni Lovers carved in stone, the Abhayagiri monastery museum and the museum in the treasure room of the Jetavanarama Monastery.
Every night at 9pm, this benevolent man awaits the moment, when the great doors to the temple are closed and the last pilgrims are ushered out, diya (oil lamps) glow from stands and the smell of incense lingers in the air. With the other seven resident monks he conducts private worship in front of the tree. Biking back along the old ox cart tracts with stars twinkling over head, including the constellation Anuradha which the city is named after, it is clear as the star filled sky Rawaela feels privileged to live in the grounds of Sri Lankas most sacred ancient city.
Bike Tour
The three hour amazing guided bicycle tour I took can be done in the morning or evening when the temple stones underfoot are not so hot and the light is better for photography. By bike you can cut through the old paths and ox cart lanes.
Temple offerings
If you fancy a cycling tour then Ulagalla is an outstanding resort to organize this and make your base, as this is also how you get around this wonderful nature resort. This is a place that celebrates all things natural and throws in special things like picnic surprises in the ruins. Also water just when you need it and as if by magic appear with a bottle.
If you are doing it on foot and staying near the ruins, do try out the night market with a magical range of foodie stalls in the high street selling tasty fish balls, fried lake fish, spicy samosas and rotti. Little carts also appear around town and by the lake early evening with delicious sweet delicacies and during Poson festival the place turns into a carnival like city. With 25,000 pilgrims visiting the city during this period finding a room is practically impossible, so book ahead or bring a tent and join one of the most spiritual and special events of the year, when everyone gives gifts of food and the country shuts down for several days to celebrate this deeply spiritual period.
How to find them:
www.ugaescapes.com organise excellent bike tours of the ruins from the Ulagalla Resort, which is only about 28kms away with a travel time of approximately 30 to 40 minutes. They provide you with first class guides and delicious picnic breaks in one of the 44 ruined sites, which are so much more accessible by bike. One of the best guides is JP Ravinda Jayalat Tharanga.

Sri Lanka is emerging to be a top outsourcing destination for ICT related businesses and a knowledge centre. Last year Lankan exports from IT related exports hit $790 m and the latest projections are the country will achieve $1Billion this year itself-a year ahead of what was previously predicted.
"We work on JISA Spirit, meaning ICT is the base industry for all other industries. Our MoU with Sri Lanka's ICT and BPO sector in which we share industry information is not only a new opening for Sri Lanka but for us at JISA too," JISA Vice President Kazunori Hamano said . "The first MoU is also about technology and technical aspects."
JISA has similar MoUs with Taiwan, China, Bahrain and Korea and this is a first for us in South Asia -and therefore this is important for us too. JISA has 593 Japanese members including information processing and database VAN service suppliers and leading software developers under it. JISA is multinational and we support the globalisation of IT industry. Today 8% of global ICT market belongs to Japan. Close to half of the Japanese software business belongs to Customised Software followed by software product development and other businesses such as internet based.
Japan is considered as Asia's high-tech powerhouse. The 2014 estimate for global production by Japanese electronics and IT companies was $362 Bn.

"There are indications that this was a planted lead, but it still can't be ruled out that this was indeed an IS terrorist posing as a refugee," he told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday, referring to Islamic State, which France blames for organising the violence.
Any link between France's worst terror attack since World War II and Europe's refugee crisis would raise the stakes for German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she defends her open-door policy for asylum seekers in Germany's debate over immigration and security.
French prosecutors have said the remains of an assailant who attacked the Stade de France stadium during a soccer game between France and Germany matched the fingerprints of an individual registered by Greek authorities as an asylum seeker in October.
Investigators were weighing the authenticity of the passport, made out to Ahmad Almohammad, 25, born in Idlib, Syria.
"It's certainly unusual that such a person would have been faithfully registered in Greece and Serbia and Croatia, while we're constantly pressing for registration and aren't happy that it isn't happening to the necessary extent," de Maiziere. - BLOOMBERG

Taylor Swift is her Clothing Lines own Best Model
Feast your eyes on further proof that Taylor Swift will never go out of style.
As in, her street style is (and continues to be) one of the most influential fashion factors on the block. In fact, shes one of the ultimate trendsetters on the planet. Familiar with #LegsForDays She basically invented it with her colossal number of leggy looks. Those 50s-chic frocks She singlehandedly brought em back. And as for the crop top, well, it might as well be her calling card.
So duhits about time she launched a clothing line !
After first announcing her clothing collaboration with Heritage 66 back in July, the first items from T. Swifts line have finally hit the e-shelves of the Chinese retailers website. And bad news, US shoppersthese Swiftie steals are only available in China. But seeing as shes the face (and name) behind the line, or course this street style star would rock a few of her own goods.
Popping up at LAX in between the Chinese and Australian legs of her 1989 world tour, Miss Swift sported her letter-printed sweater (hint, hint: they all go together to spell one very important name) along with a black skirt and sweater tied around her waist. Oh, and lets not forget about her staple red pout, which is a given in any of her looks.
In addition to said sweater, the 30-piece collection has plenty of Swift-finger printed designs, from namesake T-shirts to tight leggings and even a sweet little skater dress. On the bright side, yes, youve still got to wait for Tays collection to make its way stateside, but in the meantime you can still shop her Keds collection. E! Online

Tiger, Stricker, Furyk named Ryder vice-captains
Simons Island, United States, Wednesday: Tiger Woods, a 14-time major winner and seven-time member of the US Ryder Cup team, will be among Americas 2016 vice-captains, US captain Davis Love said Wednesday.
On the eve of the US PGAs RSM Classic hosted by Love, he announced that Woods, Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk would join Tom Lehman as vice-captains on the US squad that tries to reclaim the trophy from holders Europe.
Next years Ryder Cup will be played September 30-October 2 at Hazeltine in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Americans lead the all-time rivalry 25-13 with two drawn but the Europeans have won three in a row, six of the past seven and eight of the past 10.
Woods, who turns 40 next month, is coming off two back operations and has not announced a time-table for his return to competition, but he also said he has not ruled out making the team as a player, a difficult feat given his injuries and struggles of late. I would like to thank Davis (Love) for his confidence in me and for my selection as a Ryder Cup vice-aptain. This is something I want to do, Woods said.
Ill continue to do whatever I can to help win the Cup back. Once Im fully healthy, I would like to try to make the team too.
If Woods plays his way onto the team or receives a captains pick, Love would have the option to name a replacement as vice-captain. Stricker and Furyk joined Love as three of the assistants to Jay Haas on the triumphant US Presidents Cup team in South Korea last month.
To welcome four vice-captains of this caliber is a giant first step towards preparing the 2016 team for success, Love said. I am grateful for their commitment, dedication and passion to win.
Furyk, 45, won the 2003 US Open and has played in the past nine Ryder Cups, second to Phil Mickelsons 10 appearances in US Ryder Cup history.

As Cinnamon Reds first anniversary approached on the 1st of September, an art and design competition titled Red Rave was launched on August 3 via the hotels Facebook page, encouraging more artists to submit proposals and sketches for potential work to be added to the currently colourful car park featuring eight pieces from last years competition.

These 10 talented artistes won a cash prize each, art supplies and a full board stay at the hotel.
Cinnamon Red has brought a new dimension to the tourism industry in Sri Lanka and we hope that our trendsetting approach to cater to the new-aged traveller will also be reflected in the way we create and craft new experiences through the form of art; and not just through innovative design, products and services. We place high importance in bringing local talent to the spotlight and help upcoming artists continue their journey to rise in prominence. By providing these artists Reds vibrant spaces to develop their creative expressions, we hope we have done just that, Terrence Fernando commented.
This years winners include three artist collectives including Doodle Dumps, The Hermits and P413, the latter being featured the previous year with two pieces as well. Individual artists include Yogya Thalagala, Kavindu Abeysundera, Supun Zetter Ravisanka, Lishni Tilakaratne, Stefan Pakinathan, Udani Samaraweera and Samithira Sriranganathan Sami all the way from Jaffna. Their respective pieces will add to the current collection of work at the Cinnamon Red car park turning the space into a must-see art walk when in Colombo. Together, the pieces tell the story of the countrys emerging creativity and alternate urban expression. The artists selected are at the very top of their game; one of the artists from last year, Ruwangi Amarasinghe has since gone on to exhibit in London and create a piece in Berlin earlier this year as well.
Yogya Thalagala, whose piece will begin the narrative journey of art is a school teacher by day and encourages young minds to keep expressing themselves creatively. My piece depict giant, open hands with a 3D feel, using red, black and white to bring out Cinnamon Reds vibrant brand identity.

Waves, Whales and Water
No matter the distance and no matter the weather condition, when you need to check out the latest hotspots in the country that you can escape to when you need that special getaway  you just do it.
Last weekend, Weligama was all hyped with music, fireworks and fire dancers as it opened doors to a brand new boutique property to promote the beauty and beach front surroundings of the southern coastal Sri Lanka.
W15 Weligama is indeed the latest boutique property that is already making waves in that area from the day of its soft opening couple of months back. A cocktail reception was held to celebrate their success and the unveiling to VIPs from embassies, ministries and the media.
I got together with Isabel Jamaldeen who is the lovely Managing Director at W15 to get to know more of what they have to offer to their guests here and from around the world.
Q: Who owns this property
A: Controlling share is owned by Hardy Jamaldeen with an overseas Investor owning the rest of the shares in the company. Steradian Capital Investments (Pvt) Limited is the manager. We have our own in-house team looking after the operations at W15 with me as the MD.
Q: Why did youll pick Weligama
A: Weligama is an amazing, all year round destination, not just for surf lovers. The beaches are calm with beautiful waves to enjoy. We absolutely love the bay, it is still fairly undeveloped, has lots of natural beauty and charm. W15 is located on the perfect spot right in the middle of the bay, with breathtaking views.
Q: Who came up with the name W15 and what was the reason behind it
A: We (Hardy and I) were looking for an unusual name that people would remember easily. We were looking for something edgy and short. The W stands for Weligama, the WoW factor, and the Wonderful feeling you associate a beach property like Whales, Water and Waves. The 15 is short for 2015, its year of our launch.
Q: How do you stand unique from the rest of the boutique hotels in that coastal area
A: W15 has a unique charisma. Its an exclusive boutique hotel with picturesque seascape that is situated right in the middle of Weligama Bay. The architecture of the building itself is far from the colonial style found throughout the island.
With its clear lines it reflects the stylish and fresh artistic touch that differentiates itself from most other properties. We put the highest possible attention to customer needs and try and make every guest experience a unique one. Our staff is happy and proud to be part of the W15 family and no request is too much.
Q: Speaking of the staffare they from the nearby area or from Colombo as well
A: Most of our staff members are from the local area. They are proud to be working for W15 and for us it is most important to make them part of the family. We value each and every team member and are happy to have so many great people working for us.
Q: What sort of cuisine do youll cater to the guests
A: The W15 kitchen specializes in amazing seafood dishes with so much variety of fish and seafood right available at its shore. Our signature dishes are the Seafood Platter, Seafood Spaghetti Marinara or the Seafood Pizza.
We also serve the classic dishes like an amazing Beef Burger, Nasi Goreng or mouthwatering sandwiches. There is a lovely mix of different dishes to appeal to every guest. Our head chef takes great joy in cooking special dishes requested by the guests to spice up the menu choice.
Q: Anything else planned for the property in the near futureany upgrades additions Also will you be opening more boutiques of this sort anywhere else in the island
A: We are proud and happy to be open for the first high season and are focusing on creating the most wonderful guest experiences. The bigger picture will definitely include more properties around the island, so watch out for more to come.
As you walk in, you are welcomed by a pathway that leads to the pool, green lawn and then the beach front. On your left you will find the bar and al-fresco dining area.
All ten rooms - one executive suite, four ocean view deluxe rooms, four superior double rooms and one standard double room are unique in every way. Theres a balance between modern and traditional interior dcor along with modern amenities - Flat screen TV with cable, Wi-Fi, IDD telephones and mini bar facilities, king-sized beds, plush couches and rugs paired with patterned cushions and printed sheets. Some rooms have four-poster beds while the other rooms have sofa beds - ideal for a group or family stay.
W15 also arrange excursions for whale watching, visits to tea estates Madolduwa and Madu Ganga, and historical sites such as the Kusthiraja Gala temple. And if youre into surfing, well its the best location to get your surfs up. You can get your surf boards from the hotel.
