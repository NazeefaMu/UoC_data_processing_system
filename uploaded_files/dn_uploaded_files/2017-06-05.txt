Big Blow for Sri Lanka: Tharanga suspended for two ODIs
On top of the injury sustained by Angelo Mathews that resulted in the captain sitting out the opening Group B Champions Trophy fixture against South Africa at the Oval on Saturday, vice-captain Upul Tharanga who led the team has been suspended from the next two matches after his side was found guilty of a serious over-rate offence in the match.
David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the suspension after the Sri Lanka side was ruled to be four overs short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration. In accordance with Article 2.5.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to serious over-rate offences, players were fined 10 per cent of their match fees for the first two overs and 20 per cent of their match fees for the additional overs their side failed to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain also receiving two suspension points.
As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player, Tharanga has been suspended from his sides upcoming matches against India (at The Oval, 8 June) and Pakistan (at the Cardiff Wales Stadium, 12 June), while each of his players have received a fine of 60 per cent.
Tharanga pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was laid by on-field umpires Ian Gould and Aleem Dar, third umpire Paul Reiffel and fourth official Bruce Oxenford, all from the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. Unless Mathews recovers from his calf injury before Sri Lankas next game against India at the Oval on June 8, Sri Lanka will be forced to appoint discarded vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal to lead the team in the next two Group B games. Sri Lankas final group match is against Pakistan at Cardiff on June 12. Apart from leading the team, Tharanga is one of the few Sri Lankan batsmen in form.
He scored a half-century in Sri Lankas 96-run loss to South Africa.

Big onion seeds free for selected farmers

Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare has decided to distribute indigenous big onion seeds free of charge among the selected onion growers within the current Yala season in Matale district.
This was decided at a discussion held at Matale district secretariat auditorium.
Minister further stated that 5,000 kg of indigenous big onion seeds would be purchased on Rs.9,000/= per kilo from onion seed growers in Dambulla, Sigiriya, Galewela and Dewahuwa areas where the big onion seed production is abundant and it will be distributed among selected farmers free of charge.
The aim of this is to encourage the farmers to promote the big onion cultivation.
Matale district is the hub of the big onion production for about three decades but the big onion production is limited only to 40 percent (40%) of the annual need as farmers could not produce the entire requirement of big onions, the Minister said.
Therefore, the agriculture officials should encourage them to reach the anticipated goal Minister Aluvihare further said.
The representatives of farmer organizations and agrarian service officials participated at the occasion.

A response to May 31st editorial
On ending tobacco menace
On behalf of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) and the thousands who are committed to eliminate the harm from tobacco, I want to say thank you and congratulate you for your excellent editorial Ending the tobacco menace of May 31, the WHO World No Tobacco Day. It was so inspiring and instructive to all of us who are doing what we can to totally eliminate the harm from tobacco in all its forms to have the premier newspaper in the country providing such strong support.
I might also mention that the media has been one of the key partners over the past decade that helped Sri Lanka to arrest and contain the tobacco menace to what it is today.
I was also so heartened to note that you had got all the factual information absolutely correct and had addressed the whole range of issues around cigarettes in particular and tobacco in general.
We are planning to use your editorial and some of its contents in some of our prevention and advocacy work widely and I am sure you would not have any objection to our doing so.
Finally I have no doubt that you will continue to support and work in partnership on this nationally important issue in the future.
As you have correctly mentioned in the article it is imperative that we eliminate the socio-economic harm from tobacco as soon as we possibly can. Once again thank you very much.

Deforestation in hill country for tea led to floods - JVP
The clearance of large tracts of forest lands for tea cultivation is responsible for flooding, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) charged yesterday.
JVP politburo member Bimal Ratnayaka said that the disaster was on track since 1815.
Imperialists started it when they cleared forest cover in the central hills to cultivate tea, he said. They cut off forest in rain catchment areas of the mountains to grow tea, and successive governments have followed in their footsteps ever since, which has brought about the disaster.
We cannot reverse the situation like bolt from the blue, he said.Ratnayaka was speaking at a press briefing at JVP headquarters in Pelawatte, Battaramulla. He said ,As the rulers were destroying the forest cover for agriculture, the companies joined them in the act for profit. The public too participated in the process following in their footsteps.
The downpours have stopped, but the flood waters do not seem to recede from land. This is the result of disorganized development by the rulers, he said.
Flood damages have increased enormously when compared to the floods had had in the past two decades, he said.He said the government should take responsibility for missing important weather forecast warnings and weather threats to the public when it mattered. They could have saved more lives had they been able to communicate critical information to the public at right times.
Ratnayaka said the government has clearly shown that it has neither planning nor preparedness to face a natural disaster.
Its disaster management institutions are so weak that there is hardly any leadership for their administration, he explained.
He said the government has to pay compensation up to Rs 2.5 million for each family for damaged houses in accordance with the proposed budget. The government may not be able to receive the total amount of the insurance at once. Nevertheless, we expect the government to be fair by the affected and to pay compensation accordingly, he said.

Dilmah and Expolanka lead private sector support for LKI research
The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), Sri Lankas leading foreign policy think tank, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the MJF Group, the group of companies that manufactures, exports, and markets the Dilmah brand.
The MoU establishes a three year partnership between the MJF Group and LKI, to support LKIs Global Economy Programme. Expolanka Holdings PLC, one of Sri Lankas best known conglomerates, has also committed to facilitate quality research by enabling essential research databases for LKIs research team.
The establishment of the Global Economy Programme at LKI reflects the increasingly key role of economic diplomacy in Sri Lankas foreign policy. The programme will focus on international trade, foreign investment, and tourism, and its research aims to ensure that Sri Lankas economic diplomacy reflects sound research and innovative insights, as well as the potential and priorities of Sri Lankas private sector.
The programme will be headed by Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, who will join LKI as Chair of the Global Economy Programme (supported by Dilmah). Dr. Wignarajas experience over the last twenty-five years spans the private sector, international organisations, and academia in the UK and Asia.
Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of LKI, commented on these developments said, Commercial diplomacy is vital to Sri Lanka, as a middle-income country that wants to progress to the next frontier of development. It is inspiring to see Sri Lankas private sector step up so generously, to support research that can identify new possibilities for Sri Lankas trade, investment, and economic growth.
Dr. Harsha de Silva, former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and new Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, also expressed his thoughts at the media briefing he chaired at LKI stating, This is the first time that the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka has established a partnership with our own globally recognised brands such as Dilmah and Expolanka to promote economic diplomacy. Im appreciative of the fact that Dilmah and Expolanka responded immediately to my request for financial partnership in this endeavour. I hope to see other global brands also join in promoting our efforts in economic diplomacy.
LKIs Executive Director, Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, welcomed these recent developments, stating, LKI is deeply appreciative of these landmark commitments from the MJF Group and Expolanka Holdings, which enable LKI to build an exceptional research team with access to international research databases.
She added that, LKI is grateful to the Dr. Harsha de Silva, M.P. and Former Deputy Foreign Minister, for initiating the call for research support from the private sector. The funding will enable LKI to scale up their research activities, and add compelling new voices to shape Sri Lankas foreign policy.
Dr. Panditaratne observed that the generosity of Dilmah and Expolanka for research builds on contributions by other highly respected corporates for programmes and communications at LKI, including from Hemas Holdings PLC, John Keells Holdings PLC, and J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka.
Together, all these companies are pushing the frontiers of corporate citizenship in Sri Lanka, and showing how the private sector here can  like their counterparts elsewhere in the world  support research, programmes, and communications on issues of global importance.
The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) is a think tank focusing on Sri Lankas international relations and strategic interests, to provide insights and recommendations that advance justice, peace, prosperity and sustainability. The Institute reflects the vision of the late Lakshman Kadirgamar by promoting the countrys intellectual profile in foreign policy research and engagement.

Divided by politics, united by disasters
Divided by politics and hate speech united by disasters is an adaptation from a popular jingle featuring stars in the IPL in India.
The reason being recent floods showed a refreshing outpouring of civic consciousness and action by rich, poor, urban, rural, media houses and social media galvanizing to organise responses small, modest and big to help affected persons.
It was a re run of what we saw soon after the 2004 Tsunami. Some of the interventions are not necessarily what best practices prescribes. But you cant fault the heart for trying. Nor should politics of self-interests nor bigoted messaging of hate stand in our collective way.
Our disasters
We will face disasters through floods, droughts, landslides, food shortages, water shortages due to climate change and potentially tremors/earthquakes downstream due to a fault line coming from the Himalayas.
Climate change has emerged as a key concern for Sri Lanka and its people in the 21st century.
Sea level rise, warming temperatures, uncertain effects on forest and agricultural systems, and increased variability and volatility in weather patterns are expected to have a significant impact in the developing world, where people remain most susceptible to the potential damages and uncertainties inherent in a changing climate. Source: National Physical Planning Policy and Plan. Sri Lanka 2006-2030 (final draft).
This necessarily means we need to act together to protect ourselves. Hence civic consciousness is critical and fundamental.
An abundance of which we have at present. But people are going to be tired if called to do so too frequently.
Policy
Sri Lanka NEXT  Blue Green era, aims at transformation towards a low carbon economy with 10,000 climate resilient villages will be set up, -Punarodaya 2016-2018 will establish Climate Resilient Villages and Climate Smart Cities, - Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) have been submitted, achieve 20% renewables by 2020.
It will be further increased by 2030, forest cover increased to 32% from the present 29% by 2020, Cabinet of Ministers has approved the setting up of an Independent Climate Change Commission to deal with climate related problems and issues. We are behind schedule in this process.
Awareness and Advocacy
A multi-pronged solution at all levels is a must in creating the required awareness and advocacy on all important topics i.e. Environment Protection and Conservation, IWRM, WASH, Climate Change, SDGs.
A good starting point is school education and curriculum development.
Existing Partnerships to consider are Lanka Jalani (LJ)  i.e. Area Water Partnerships, LJ and Girl Guides Programme, LJ and Boy Scout Programe, Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Religious Organisations trained in Disaster Relief Work, UNDP SL.
Promoting this slogan as a CSR Using Air Conditioning Sensibly, Switching Off Appliances and Equipment When Not in Use, Driving Greener Cars, Buying Energy-efficient Appliances, subscribing to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Some of us are mapping disaster prone areas with the intention of having on board households with mobile phones voluntarily in a data base to enable early warning messages to be targeted when needed with links to further back end information.
Ultimately its the poor, vulnerable who might be in the path of unfolding disasters who need to be equipped with information and options. The numbers are not huge and easily manageable.
Key considerations
 Conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecosystem structure and function are important climate change adaptation strategies because genetically diverse populations and species rich ecosystems have greater potential to adapt to climate change.
 National ownership on and leadership of the SDGs is vital, country will need to follow a whole-of-government approach, building broad coalitions around the goals will be crucial to achieving them, co-operation by sharing new ideas, knowledge, and technologies, and investment, leveraging Science and Technology to address national needs.
 Our physical attributes, elements of policy and COP21obligations need to be connected and implemented.
 Control of Greenhouse Gas Emissions / International Climate Change Protocols / Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
 Proactive Reforestation programmes and projects should be implemented to offset destruction of forest cover for development as well as to maintain required national Carbon Emission levels as per agreed upon global Climate Change Protocols.
 Effective monitoring of Carbon Emissions i.e. Pollution Mitigation through effective Transportation Policies.
 Mitigation of the Destruction of Marshlands and Wetlands:
 Flood Risk Management Policies and Action Plans should be developed underpinning Climate Change.
 Managing flood risk by striking for good balance between effective Urban Management and maintenance of existing flood mitigation infrastructures.
Technology
 Wherever possible adopt and adapt Technologies for local consumption. Utilization of the rapidly developing local mobile industry link up to the global Disaster Response Programme in improving network preparedness in providing effective coordinated support to humanitarian response and disaster affected communities (GSM / GSMA Foundation http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programmes/disaster-response).
 Implement locally developed Low Cost Open Source Weather Station technology. This technology provides capacity building in schools and Universities in the operations and maintenance of the technology. (http://iwmi.cgiar.org/tools/mobile-weather- stations/Mobile%20Weather%20Stations%20-%20Manual.pdf).
Partnerships
 Utilize existing National/Local Partnerships for research, development, mitigation and disaster risk reduction activities.
 Rainwater Harvesting  RWH should be considered as a Silver-Lining to Disaster Response in making it mandatory to include a RWH System in newly constructed housing. (http://lankarainwater.org/wp/ / http://www.unhabitat.lk/confagn.html).

Do-or-die match for Bangladesh - crucial for Australia too
I am sure the Bangladesh team would have watched Australias match against New Zealand with great interest writes Habibul Bashar who was skipper when Bangladesh last made an appearance in the ICC Champions Trophy in 2006. I did too, because Bangladesh is due to play the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 champion next and I wanted to get a sense of what new one could expect from Australia. While the team was its formidable self, there were a few signs that Bangladesh will take heart from.
The no-result in that match at Edgbaston on Friday means Mondays match at The Oval is important not just for Bangladesh, but for Australia as well. It is clearly a do-or-die match for Bangladesh, which lost its opening game to England on Thursday and will be out of the ICC Champions Trophy if it doesnt defeat Australia.
But it is also a very important game for Australia because if it doesnt win, qualification will become tough for it. From both teams point of view, there is no way back if they make a mistake, which sets the stage for what should be a humdinger.
If you compare the two teams, Australia is definitely ahead in both bowling and batting. It has someone of the calibre of Glenn Maxwell in the middle-order who brings with him the same X-factor that Ben Stokes does for England.
Then, there are David Warner and Steve Smith  a lot of quality players. And when you look at its bowling attack, guys like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins have a lot of firepower. It doesnt have a quality spinner - it didnt play Adam Zampa against New Zealand - but it still has a really good attack.
But the one thing Bangladesh should look at positively from Fridays match is that the Australian bowlers didnt look unplayable. While they might be quick and fierce, they can also be taken for runs in different ways, like Luke Ronchi and Kane Williamson showed.
Thats something Bangladesh can derive confidence from. In the last game against England, Bangladesh didnt bowl particularly well, but it is batting with confidence and purpose at the moment. If the bowlers can pull up their socks and deliver on the big stage, I honestly believe it has a fair chance against Australia.
The important thing for Bangladesh is to be positive. At The Oval against England, Bangladesh was a bit defensive with both its bowling and its fielding. On good batting tracks, it is difficult to contain quality batsmen, therefore the intent must be to go for wickets even if you are a little expensive. The lines and lengths of the Bangladeshi bowlers were pretty good against England, but line and length can only take you that far. You need to bowl wicket-taking deliveries, you need to keep thinking  wicket, wicket, wicket.
In the last game, Australia showed a little bit of vulnerability at the top of the order. It has good batsmen, but no one is invincible, no one is indestructible. With its presence in the tournament on the line, Bangladesh must keep that in mind and play its best cricket yet, otherwise its last game will be only be of academic interest.
As we mentioned in our last column, Bangladesh made a tactical mistake by going a bowler short against England. With there being no second chances, it must play with five bowlers this time around. It will be another flat track at The Oval if there is no rain, which means you must have the extra bowler. And even if there is help from the weather, an eighth batsman isnt of much use if the top-seven dont come up trumps.
I would like to see Mehedi Hasan in the playing XI, and Mashrafe Mortaza can even toss the new-ball to the 19-year-old off-spinner. There are a lot of hard-hitting opening batsmen who dont like playing spin at the beginning of their innings, so that wont be a bad idea. And once the ball gets old, he will obviously be quite a handful, as he has shown in his brief international career.
Bangladesh might also opt for a pace bowler instead of Mehedi, and thats fine as well, so long as the intent is to play the extra bowler. At the end of the day, in a must-win game, the need of the hour is to take wickets, as Mashrafe and the think-tank will be well aware.  ICC news

Expressing views following assumption of duties as the new Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Dr.Parakrama Dissanayake Dr .Dissanayake stated that the challenges ahead being a part of the global shipping chain should be well identified by all engaged in the Sri Lankan maritime sector. Earlier we had four shipping alliances and now three alliances which means there is concentration among shipping lines. The shipping lines have got enormous power over the selection of ports.
Last year the top 20 container shipping lines lost about US$ 15 billion pointing to the enormity of the global challenges we are faced with. And more importantly, the East-West trade route where the Port of Colombo is situated, we should understand that within the next two years, the ships plying will have 90% of Ultra Large Container vessels, Dr Dissanayake added.

Ernest Corea  A man for all seasons
My cousin Lester sent me a message on the 11th of May, my uncle Ernest had gone home. He knew Jesus and he was in heaven. Here on earth I thanked God for his life. His favourite psalm was read out to him. The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his names sake.
Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
Davids Psalm 23 gives us that assurance that Gods goodness will follow us throughout life and we will dwell in His house forever. Uncle Ernest was at peace. Childhood memories of our days in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) came flooding back. It was fun to be around Ernest Corea. My sister Ouida called him Uncadaddy. Our eyes lit up when he strode into Maha Nuge Gardens in Kollupitiya where we lived. The atmosphere changed when he walked in. Uncle Ernest was here.
Lake House newsroom
I think the atmosphere changed in any room he walked into. He was gracious, kind, caring and compassionate. We loved visiting him at Lake House when he was Editor-in-Chief of the Daily News. We ran up those stairs to his office saying hello to George Mason and Phillip Cooray on the way. Aunty Indra who was his Secretary had her desk on the side. Many of the Daily News journalists used to come and say hello to us, among them Errol de Silva. There was a sense of community, in the Lake House newsroom.
Uncle Ernest drove a Triumph Herald. We simply adored that car. We used to clamber into the back seat and he used to take us to the legendary Fountain Caf run by Elephant House and situated in Colombo-2. We were clamouring for those amazing Fountain Caf hotdogs and the best ever vanilla ice cream. Uncle Ernest bought them for us and we joined many families in the car park at the back. They were the simple joys of life. Going to the movies, sing song sessions with Uncle Ernest on drums, Dad on his harmonica, Vernon jr and yours truly on our Prep School recorders. Hours of jokes, fun, laughter and enjoyment.
Uncle Ernest was born in 1932 in Kurana, Katunayake. My father, Vernon Corea was his only brother. His parents were Reverend Canon Ivan Corea and Ouida Corea. He grew up in the historic vicarage of St. Lukes Church, Borella. A visiting Archbishop of Canterbury once stayed in that vicarage with my grandparents. The brothers were inseparable. Even later in life they remained extremely close. They also got into a great deal of mischief. When I quizzed Uncle Ernest about these stories, he denied all knowledge of them! There was the story of a Bishop of Colombo visiting St. Lukes Church, Borella. After the church service, he had problems starting his car - to find that sand had been poured into his petrol tank! The finger was clearly pointed at young Vernon and Ernest!
On the 5th of April 1942 Commander Mitsuo Fuchida of the Imperial Japanese Air Service led his Japanese zero bombers in a daring attack on Ceylon. Commander Fuchida had also led the raid on Pearl Harbour. It was called the Easter Sunday Raid. My grandfather, Reverend Canon Ivan Corea was preaching that Easter morning, at St. Lukes Church in Borella. Revival had come to St. Lukes in the 1940s and the church was packed to the rafters. Military and medical folk were also in the congregation, celebrating Easter.
The RAF hurricanes (who were based at the Colombo Racecourse nearby) engaged the Japanese zero bombers high over the skies above St. Lukes Church, Borella. Having heard the dogfight in the skies, Vernon and Ernest ran out of the church to see what was going on!
It was fascinating to talk to him, even recently after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. He had a mastery of the English Language and a wealth of knowledge on current affairs.
Journalist and diplomat
Ernest was educated at Royal College, Colombo, where his uncle J.C.A. Corea was the first Ceylonese Principal. He then went on to the University of Peradeniya where he graduated with a Bachelor of English degree in 1955. Soon after University he joined Lake House as a journalist with the Ceylon Observer from 1955-1959. He then served with the United Nations in New York and is said to have covered the first and last address to the UN General Assembly by President S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. He went on to be appointed a Research Officer at the United Nations Information Center in Washington DC in 1960 and served in the Congo now Zaire as Economic Reports Officer of the United Nations from 1961-1962. He returned to Lake House and Esmond Wickramasinghe appointed him Assistant Editor of the Daily News in 1963.
Ernest Corea went on to become Editor and Editor-in-Chief of the Daily News from 1965-1970. He was also Editor of the Ceylon Observer for a year. He was also Chief Administrative Officer of Lake House from 1964-1965. He left Lake House moving to Singapore to take up the post of Foreign Editor of the Straits Times Group in Singapore from 1971-1975.
He served as Director Division publications International Research Center, Ottawa, Canada, 19751978. President J.R. Jayewardene appointed him High Commissioner Sri Lanka in Canada and Sri Lanka ambassador to Cuba, 19781980, Sri Lanka ambassador to United States Washington, from 1980-1986. The Commonwealth Secretary General Sonny Ramphal asked him to Chair the Commonwealth Committee Communications Development from 1980-1982.
He was truly a man for all seasons and was highly successful as a journalist and a diplomat. His biggest triumph was to secure the first and to date the only State Visit of a President of Sri Lanka to the United States of America, when President J.R. Jayewardene was invited to the Rose Garden of the White House by US President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Uncle Ernest saw the immense PR coup for Sri Lanka when the Sri Lankan Government wanted to gift President Ronald Reagan a baby elephant.
The Washington Post observed: Acting as go-between in the arrangements has been Sri Lanka's ambassador, Ernest Corea, who as a former newspaperman recognizes the picture possibilities of two presidents with the very live symbol of each of their political parties. Corea was brought into the act when his foreign ministry awakened him at 2 one morning last winter. Asked whether Reagan might like to have his own elephant as a state gift, Corea thought the official was talking about an elephant statue. The caller assured the sleepy envoy he was talking about a real elephant. Corea woke up very quickly.
The State visit was a huge success for Sri Lanka, Ronald Reagan even invited J.R.s favourite singer, Frank Sinatra to sing My Way, at the State Banquet in the White House.
US Ambassador Howard B. Schaffer, husband of Ambassador Teresita Schaffer paid a stunning tribute to Uncle Ernest recently on his blog Southasiahand. In an entry titled: The Importance of Being Ernest, Ambassador Schaffer said: As deputy assistant secretary for the subcontinent in the old Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian affairs I had worked closely and admiringly with Ernest during his Washington years.
I recall that one of the things that most impressed me about the way he went about his diplomatic chores as the representative of a small power in the capital of a big and powerful one was his talent in befriending people who could provide him access to U.S. government VIPs when he needed high-level help. It is an important asset for diplomats to have as they navigate the citys brutally competitive foreign affairs scene.
Open and accessible to all
One of those Ernest cultivated was a tough, formidable woman named Millie  I cant recall her last name  who made officers throughout the State Department quail. Millie was secretary to the even more formidable Larry Eagleburger, then undersecretary of state for political affairs, and was an effective guardian of the gates of his seventh floor Department suite. Ernest made it his business to get to know her well and would often stop by to chat her up during his visits to Foggy Bottom.
One otherwise quiet morning I was informed by a distraught Embassy Colombo that the Government of Sri Lanka in its wisdom had declared one of the embassys junior officers persona non-grata and ordered his prompt removal from the island. He was charged, as I recall, with making inappropriate public comments about the Sri Lankan president. It was clear to me that we would have to follow the time-honoured practice of reciprocity and expel an officer of equivalent stature from the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington.
I was going down the Diplomatic List to identify a proper scapegoat whom we could cast into the wilderness when an urgent phone call came in. It was from Millie. She informed me that (unbeknownst, of course, to me) Ambassador Corea had just met informally with Under Secretary Eagleburger and discussed the PNG issue with him. Mr. Eagleburger, she recounted, had decided that it would not be necessary or advisable to practice reciprocity in this case and the NEA Bureau should take no further action on the matter.
I asked Millie what had led Eagleburger to make this ruling. She said she understood that he recognized that Sri Lanka was a small and friendly country. After talking with Ambassador Corea he had concluded that the United States had better things to do than beat up on the islands junior diplomats.
A diplomatic win for an effective ambassador, and further evidence of The Importance of Being Ernest.
Uncle Ernest asked Dad and yours truly to visit Washington when he relinquished his post as Ambassador in 1986. We spent a wonderful time at his residence and visited the Embassy.
At a farewell dinner at a Thai Restaurant in Washington DC I was mesmerised seeing the roll call of diplomats, congressmen and women at the function  even staff members of the office of the fearless Stephen Solarz, chairman of subcommittees on African affairs and later Asian and Pacific affairs in Congress.
The distinguished journalist, Barbara Crossette who was Chief Correspondent of the New York Times writing about Uncle Ernest, said: Everywhere, he was open and accessible to all.
Leading the tributes was former Lake House journalist Thalif Deen, (one of his closest friends) who has written extensively about Uncle Ernests life and times in the world of journalism and diplomacy. US Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Atul Keshap released a message:
A generation of U.S. diplomats and I convey heartfelt condolences to the family of Ambassador Ernest Corea, diplomat and journalist extraordinaire...
My mind goes back to a night in the 1960s. My father was driving our Fiat 1400 after a dinner engagement in Colombo. We were going down this road and what appeared to be an extension of the road turned out to be a massive ditch. The car crashed into the ditch, splitting into half. Mercifully we were all alive - but injured. Subsequently a Sri Lankan newspaper wrote that many people over the years had perished in this ditch and we were the first to come out alive. That was a miracle. The first person to rush to our aid was Uncle Ernest, in his sarong, driving his Triumph Herald. It was curfew and the military were on the streets, Uncle Ernest had to show his Daily News curfew pass and say that he was taking us to hospital as we were involved in a very bad accident. They took one look at us at the back and waved us through. Uncle Ernest had no sleep that night as he saw to our medical needs, such was his love and compassion. This memory is firmly etched in my mind. And so, I say farewell to a wonderful uncle and mentor. I have learnt so much from him. He has gone to a far, far better place, trusting in the promises of God of no sickness, death, pain or sorrow in Paradise on Earth.
A Service celebrating the life of Ernest Corea will be held on 8th July at St. Christopher's Episcopal Church in Springfield, Virginia, USA. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to St. Christopher's Episcopal Church, 6320 Hanover Avenue, Springfield, VA 22150, USA (designating the Hypothermia Prevention Programme)

Four countries cut links with Qatar over 'terrorism' support

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region.
The countries say Qatar is supporting terrorist groups including the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact.
It cited officials as saying it was to "protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism".
Egypt has also closed its airspace and ports for all Qatari transportation, the foreign ministry said.
The United Arab Emirates has given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave the country. Abu Dhabi accuses Doha of "supporting, funding and embracing terrorism, extremism and sectarian organisations," state news agency WAM said.
Bahrain's state news agency said the country was cutting ties with Qatar over "shaking the security and stability of Bahrain and meddling in its affairs".
The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar from its alliance because of Doha's "practices that strengthen terrorism" and its support to groups "including Al-Qaeda and Daesh [also known as the so-called Islamic State], as well as dealing with the rebel militias", according to SPA.

Growing the best tomatoes ever!
Red, ripe homegrown tomatoes are the crown - jewel in many a vegetable garden. Let this be the period that you can say the same, with luscious fruit grown in your backyard garden, patio or balcony. Follow these tips for the best tomatoes ever.
More sun equals more fruit
Choose your sunniest garden spot, because tomatoes soak up sunshine just like water. Aim for seven hours of sunshine a day.
Give them room to grow, too, planting seedlings 30 to 48 inches apart, with rows set 48 inches apart. This will let light into the lower portions of the mature plants and improve air flow.
Beef up the soil
Tomatoes thrive in rich, well-draining, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. To determine pH, pick up a soil tester from the Garden Center or your local Cooperative Extension Service. If soil is too acidic, add dolomite lime.
If its too alkaline, add sulfur or composted organic matter.
Timing is everything
Whether you start your own seedlings or pick them up from the Garden Center, tomatoes like warmth. Wait until soil temps are consistently over 60 degrees before planting outside. If the weather is still iffy, protect tender seedlings from cold with row covers or plant protectors.
Plant deeply
Heres a neat trick: Tomatoes will root along their stems. With leggy transplants, dig a trench and lay the stem sideways, bending gently upward. Snip or pinch off the lower branches and cover with soil up to the first set of leaves. This extra root growth will produce a stronger, more robust plant.
Water deeply and mulch, mulch, mulch
Juicy jumbo tomatoes need water, about an inch a week. A blanket of mulch  anything from shredded pine bark to grass clippings and composted leaves  will keep the water from evaporating in summers heat.
A soaker hose is an efficient solution; just position the hose in the garden and pile mulch up and over the hose.
Offer a cup of (compost) tea
Add the benefits of nutrient-rich compost to keep heavy-feeding tomato plants happy. Soak one part organic compost in one part water, let sit for 24 hours, filter the tea and use to nourish plants.
Pruning is for suckers
Tomato plants send out suckers  leaves that shoot out from the main stem. Suckering tomato plants, or removing the suckers, makes sense because it promotes air circulation, keeps down disease, and focuses the plants energy on growing fruit. Small leaves and tender stems can be pinched off with your fingers; pruning snips give a clean cut to thicker stems.

Hayleys Puritas provides clean drinking water to flood victims
In a bid to support ongoing relief efforts in the wake of devastating flooding across large areas in the Southwestern provinces of Sri Lanka, the Hayleys Group through its environmental engineering services provider, Hayleys Puritas, announced the installation of seven water filtration systems to meet the urgent need for clean drinking water in displaced and affected communities in the Ratnapura and Galle districts.
Comprising a combined capacity of 33,600 litres per day over 12 hours of operation, the treatment plants are estimated to be able to provide clean, safe drinking water to serve the needs of approximately 13,440 people per day.
Our thoughts and prayers are with all Sri Lankans who have been affected by the floods, and with the loved ones of those who have lost their lives in this terrible disaster. The Hayleys Group will work to provide whatever assistance it can in this difficult time and we wish to thank all Sri Lankans who have once again united and stepped forward to help our brothers and sisters in need, Managing Director Haycarb, Rajitha Kariyawasan, said.
Of the systems installed in Parana Thanayamngoda, Gonalagoda and Niyagama in the Mapalagama region, two of the water treatment systems had an installed capacity of 400 litres per hour and another two had a capacity of 200 litres per hour.
A further three water treatment systems were installed in Kalwana in the Ratnapura district with capacities of 1,000 litres per hour, 400 litres per hour and 200 litres per hour with the largest capacity system being installed at a disaster management center to distribute purified water to the surrounding affected villages through a bowser with the assistance of Sri Lanka Army.
Puritas (Private) Limited is an environmental engineering entity specialised in providing water and waste water treatment solutions for commercials and municipalities and has built over 350 treatment systems in Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar.

Health advice for people living in flood affected areas
The public should drink boiled and cooled water and eat home- made cooked meals as much as possible. Meals should be eaten immediately after cooking. Food should be stored in cleaned containers and they should completely covered without letting flies to contaminate them.
* The infants below the age of six months should be fed with breast milk ONLY and the infants and children above six months should be fed with breast milk and other clean complementary food. No milk powder should be given to them.
* Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap after using toilets, before cooking meals, before taking meals etc. All fruits and raw vegetables should be thoroughly washed with clean water before consuming. Eating green leaves, salads and other raw vegetables should be discouraged as much as possible during these days.
* People should not get themselves contacted with contaminated flood water because they can be infected with rat fever. Two Doxycycline tablets should be taken and the two tablets will provide immunity against rat fever for a period of two weeks. This should be done by relevant persons who are being forced to get contacted with contaminated flood water or mud.
* Fungal infections can be developed on the skin after being exposed to contaminated flood water. Medical treatment should be sought from health camps / clinics.
* People with diabetes should take an extra precaution about their foot when stepping into flood water because their existing wounds can get infected and new injuries can occur due to cuts etc.
* Wells should be properly cleaned before re-using. Everything required for flood victims such as chlorine, cleaning chemicals, etc are now available with all PHIs and MOHs free of charge.
* People often inhale poisonous fumes while starting generators in order to obtain electricity. They should start generators in open spaces and if anyone inhales a poisonous fume, the patient should be taken into an open space where fresh air is available and seek immediate medical treatment from a hospital.

High drama all round
She dubs their wedding day on April 4, 2014, as the happiest day of their lives. Three years from the day that they tied the knot this loveable couple has settled down to a comfortable lifestyle. They have had their share of ups and downs but Dananjaya and Shashini Siriwardane have realized today that nothing can keep them apart. Their history together says it all.
The actor
Dananjaya is very professional when it comes to his career. He is so committed to his job. I too was employed at Emirates and was part of the cabin crew and a part time instructor. However Dananjayas commitment to his profession really amazes me. He does not take sick leave even when he is ill. He loves his job. I believe that this feature shows in his work. I also think he has the talent to portray diverse roles.
The husband
The transition from boyfriend to husband has changed Dananjaya. He has become a very responsible person. I was surprised to find out how helpful he is around the house when he has some free time. I actually never expected that from him before we got married and it came as a pleasant surprise. He is also very loveable. That is mainly what a woman needs after she gets married. He takes care of me. He tries to give me everything that a man is supposed to give in a marriage. He is still learning but he is managing well.
First meeting
We started off as friends during our school days. I was at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya while Dananjaya was from Ananda College. We met for a photo shoot for a novel which was published in a magazine. Our pictures were carried on the page with each edition. He was my boyfriend in that magazine photo shoot. He was not famous then. He had just started his career.
More than friends
We were very young then. So I had no idea that he was the one. I think our relationship started out with maybe something like a crush. I can call it love at first sight but when I recall those times I think we were too young to consider it seriously. It was something like puppy love then. However later on through ups and downs we figured out that we should be together. Dananjaya did not ask me to become his girlfriend directly. We knew that our alliance is going towards a relationship.
The proposal
Unlike getting into a relationship, Dananjayas proposal was very dramatic. We had a lot of break ups in our relationship in between. We were both young so we did not really know how to patch things up. We have actually had disagreements like a zillion times!
I was in Dubai and Dananjaya came looking for me. We got back together. Then at the Mall of the Emirates he went down on his knees and in front of so many people he proposed to me. I was stunned because never saw it coming. I never expected such a thing from him! I was laughing at first because I thought that he was joking. Then I was embarrassed because so many people have stopped to watch and clap. What was really nice about it was that nobody knew who we were over there. We got engaged in 2013.
Favourite role he has played
Dananjaya did an amazing job in Rathu Ahasa. I think that it was the best he has done so far. He was nominated for Best Actor for his role. We were engaged when he took on the project and I witnessed how much he contributed to that teledrama mentally and physically. That character took a lot out of him. It was a complicated role. It is a person who has a mental disorder but is ordinary in his everyday life. At the end of the production, even though he was the villain, everybody felt pity for him.
We used to discuss his works together from those days onwards and he mentioned that the teledrama is a masterpiece. He was very excited about the script. He had a lot of hopes for the project and he was thankful that he got the role.
Sri Lanka is such a small country and the art industry here is small. Therefore actors do not get much exposure to showcase their talent. He took his character in Rathu Ahasa as an opportunity that was handed over to him to display his acting prowess.
Role best suited for him
I would like to see Dananjaya do a really thuggish role. He has done villainous characters before but not to the extreme level. I would like to see him do a character similar to the one Akshay Kumar played in Rowdy Rathore. I am sure he will do a great job!
Passions
Dananjaya has a passion for writing as well as painting. The writing talent comes from his mother. He is inspired by Mahagama Sekara. He reads his work and gets a lot of influence from them. I have not seen him doing oil paintings but the does abstract pencil drawings well.
Foodwise
Dananjaya is not at all fussy about his food. I know what ways and what kind of food he prefers now. However he does not push me to make them. So I have an easy time cooking for him. I try to make the meals as healthy as possible especially since he is an actor and has to manage his physique well. He has to maintain a proper diet.
I try to mix up the meals. For example if he has something heavy for lunch, then he gets something very light for dinner. We go for steamed food mostly in the night. The morning meal is usually Sri Lankan food. I make milk rice or string hoppers with pol sambol, chicken or fish curry and dahl curry. Those are two of his favourite meals. I love all types of food. There is a big, fat foodie inside me!We go out a lot. If it is only us together we go for a healthy choice. However with friends, we have no choice but to eat whatever food they go for.
Togetherness time
Honestly we dont get that much of free time. We like to stay at home and watch movies together. He is not a fan of Hindi and Tamil movies but I make him watch them because it will benefit him as an actor. We love films based on real life stories. We always check to see what movies have won accolades and go for them. We watched La La Land together recently. The way I watch movies and the way he watches them are totally different. He was discussing with me about the camera angles and other techniques of the production. The movie was colourful but a little bit boring for us.
We switch off our phones and have some Zen time. We have a place we go to for meditation at Kelaniya temple. We are gym freaks. He goes to the gym more than me. I like to run and engage in contemporary dancing.
Dananjaya is not keen to travel out of Colombo much. I love visiting Nuwara Eliya. We fly to foreign countries whenever we can. We visit Dubai a lot because that is my second home.
Most toughing saying
Dananjaya was recently down with the flu. When I was attending to him he said that I take care of him like a mother. That was a very touching thing to hear from your husband.
Birthday celebrations
We were in Yala for one of my birthdays which happened in 2015. Dananjaya organized a moonlight dinner for me.
We havent really held parties for our birthdays. We prefer to put the money in some cause. We have given money to orphanages and like to spend time with the kids.
Acting offers
I have gotten some acting opportunities before we got married. However Dananjaya did not like me to get into acting. He knew that it was not for me though I was such a drama queen at school. I said no because I dont see any potential to flourish in the industry here. Whenever I see Jacqueline Fernandez on screen I feel so glad that she is not acting in Sri Lanka.
General opinion about artistes marriages
I believe that the publics perception about the marriages of artistes becoming unsuccessful is very wrong. I have friends who do not belong to this field but have been divorced a couple of times. Nobody knows about it because they are not in the spot light. Artistes get the opportunity to reach out to many people and make contact. I was a cabin crew member and people have perceptions over that as well. All of this depends on the person and how they have been brought up.
Future plans
Dananjaya has not directed any production yet but he intends to. His father, Sunil Siriwardena, is a director. Dananjaya has an eye for it. I have watched more movies than him in my life. I have watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons before but the minute I watched it with him is amazing. He has seen the film from a technical angle.
We are also discussing about having our own business. We want to have lots of kids and enjoy a good life.

Humans cannot survive without a sustainable environment: President
It took several centuries for human beings to be modest enough to accept the fact that they are only one of natures creations, President Maithripala Sirisena in a World Environment Day message said.
The message added: Even though human civilizations, from its origin, made efforts to change the natural environment to suit their needs, at present, due to the frequent occurrences of natural disasters, we have to admit that humans cannot survive without a sustainable environment. Nature reminds us of its message through landslides, devastating floods.
Nevertheless, it is not too late to understand the message of nature comprehensively, as well as to live in harmony with nature.
Connecting people to nature, the theme for World Environment day 2017, invites all of us to unite to build that kind of nature friendly relationship. This years World Environment Day expects to bring knowledge and awareness to the people about the need to sustain the environment in their activities and daily lifestyle. Avoiding lifestyle habits detrimental to nature and engaging in appropriate nature friendly lifestyle habits is directly interconnected with human survival.
I wish every success for all the World Environment Day programmes carried out to achieve these goals, and join hands with all those who contribute for the sustainability of the environment.

India to sell only electric cars by 2030
While the United States is walking away from the historic Paris Climate Agreement, India is making a bold vow to start selling only electric cars by 2030.
India is one of the world's most polluted countries. Its energy department said in a blog post that it has set the "ambitious" target to stop selling gas-powered vehicles in an attempt to clean up its air.
As the country's economy has boomed, new industries and commuters have spewed pollutants in the air at staggering rates. Now, its 1.3 billion residents are suffering. One estimate says India's air contributes to 1.2 million deaths per year. CNN News

June, national nutrition month under the theme Taste without sugar

The Health Ministry declared this month as the national Nutrition Month under the theme `Taste without sugar', Health Education Bureau sources said.
According to the sources, the World Health Organization guidelines said that the energy obtained from sugar, per person, per day should not exceed more than five percent of the total energy intake, which amounts to 25 grams of sugar (six teaspoons of sugar) for better health status.
During the National Nutrition Month, it is expected to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages among all age groups, to create awareness among the general public regarding addiction to sugar sweetened beverages and the resulting detrimental health effects, to promote consumption of clean drinking water and other naturally available healthy drinks, to promote a conducive environment for consumption of safe drinking water and other natural drinks by strengthening multi-sectoral coordination and participation through advocacy, the sources said.
High sugar consumption is a major cause of weight gain leading to overweight and obesity the Health Education Bureau sources said.
Costly economic and social consequences of overweight and obesity are made manifest in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, disability, chronic kidney disease, musculoskeletal conditions and psychological problems, among others. In addition, excess weight can lead to reduction in productivity, poor quality of life and shortened life span, the sources added.

Kitchen Confidential
It always feels so good to come home to the smells of chili, garlic and spices mingling in the air, the sounds of a pressure cooker whistling or a pot on the stove bubbling, and the sight of my mother, moving from the sink to the cutting board to the cupboard, while my cat Podi sits on the chair in the corner of the kitchen, with half-closed eyes, in mindful meditation.
I confess, my mother is the chief cook in our family. All of us, including my father, chip in to help her, but almost never do we find the courage to make a full meal on our own. On days my mother is not at home, we unanimously agree to buy lunch packets from the 'kade', order pizza or go out for a snack.
Yet we all know (and I know you do too)that eating out all too frequently, is bad for us. Even as I write this a lot of junk food is probably clogging our collective arteries and making our nation a land of overweight people. Soft drinks are giving us diabetes and even that innocent restaurant salad can have three times as much fat as a cheeseburger.
Isn't it time we (guys and girls, young and old) start to brave the kitchen, battle the dirty dishes and deal with siblings and offspring who would rather eat pizza or string-hoppers and spicy dhal curry from 'indiappa akka's kade' every night instead of the home-cooked red rice you made, with the rather bland dhal curry, and a burned mallum.
Happy family
Sure, home-cooked meals might not be as tasty at the beginning of your journey into the land of culinary delights, as the food you find on the streets. Yet, there are so many reasons to cook at home, it's surprising that we aren't all doing it at least some of the time. For starters, research shows that regularly eating home-cooked meals as a family is linked to healthier and happier children, and teenagers who are less likely to use alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes.
As Laura Newcomer points out in her article, ' The Health and Social Benefits of Home Cooked Meals' adults also reap considerable benefits from eating at home. Research finds that people who eat home-cooked meals on a regular basis tend to be happier and healthier and consume less sugar and processed foods, which can result in higher energy levels and better mental health. Eating home-cooked meals five or more days a week is even associated with a longer life.
As if all that weren't enough, home-cooked meals can also benefit the environment - and all of us, by extension - by saving money and reducing our carbon footprint. Experts say home cooking gives us the opportunity to choose component ingredients over processed meals, which cuts down on packaging. Buy those ingredients from the Sunday fair or grow your own, and you will make an even bigger impact on the environment by significantly reducing the amount of transportation required to get food to your plate.
Not enough time
So, given all these benefits of home cooking, why aren't we all cooking for ourselves
The most common excuse is that there is not enough time. In fact, people who work more than 35 hours outside the home each week do tend to cook less.(Although in reality, many of us spend more time watching TV and on Facebook than we do cooking for ourselves.) Other reasons for avoiding the kitchen include having to spend long hours on the road traveling back and forth from work, the widespread availability of food options outside of the home, and the notion that convenience should always be our ultimate priority.
But the benefits of home cooking are just too good to give up. And given that supermarkets offer a larger variety of ingredients than they ever have and the number of organically grown food stalls is increasing, there's no better time to develop the habit of cooking meals at home.
Newcomer advises if you fall into the trap of thinking you are too busy to cook, you should evaluate whether that's really the case. Take a week to write down how long you spend browsing the internet, watching TV, or counting the number of 'likes' on one of your Facebook posts. Tally it all up, and you will probably find you have more free time than you realized. Use some of that down time to cook delicious meals.
Love cooking!
To do so, you must fall in love with your kitchen, says Newcomer. "A functional and cared-for kitchen is a much more appealing place than one that's grimy and uninviting. Create a space you feel good in by investing in some basic cooking equipment and developing an organizational system that works for you." It will also be helpful to know that cooking feels much less daunting if you don't have to run out to the store every time you need a single ingredient. Stock the pantry with your most commonly used items (such as rice, spices, and coconut oil) so you can always cook something without needing to shop.
Each weekend, set aside time to plan meals and make shopping lists for the week ahead. Take your weekly schedule into account: For example, if you know Tuesday will be busy, then plan for a meal that's quick and easy to make. With a little forethought, you can tailor home cooking to even the busiest weeks.
Eating home-cooked meals on a regular basis, however, doesn't mean you need to cook every night. Give yourself a break by cooking large batches of every meal you make so you can reheat it throughout the week. Also consider making items that can be reused in different ways - for example, a bottle of seeni-sambol can be used in sandwiches, with rice, or with roti to make multiple different meals over the course of a few days.
In addition, growing your own produce and herbs will be a sure-fire way to feel more connected to the food you eat. There's nothing more satisfying (or nutritious) than making a salad from greens and vegetables you grew yourself. While you are at it, consider learning how to preserve food too, and compost leftovers.
Whether you have never cooked a meal in your life or you want to stop being your mother's assistant cook and wants to take up the challenge of preparing a meal on your own (I will, this weekend), give a few of these tips a try, and commit to a few small lifestyle changes.
You will be on your way to living a healthier, happier life.
And, if you are brave enough, do drop in at our place on Saturday night to taste my home-cooked meal.
Bon apptit!
Home Cooking Benefits
Nutritious - Restaurants, both fast food and otherwise, are known to be notoriously high in calories sugars, fats, sodium and carbohydrates, and it is also likely they may contain low nutritional content. Even the healthier, low-cal options can contain a very high level of sugars and fats. Eating at home, on the other hand, allows you to cut out what you may deem unnecessary in your diet. You're in control of the food you cook and the food you consume.
* Increase knowledge of food - Food is much more than just something that tastes good and fills up your stomach. What you eat can heal, cause sickness, or even inflict pain. Cooking your own meals can teach you what foods are high or low in certain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
* Savor your food - The physical act of preparing your own meals will lead to a newfound appreciation for the food you consume. This is very important since mindless munching and emotional eating can contribute to unhealthy weight gain because you are not fully conscious of what you are eating. Being more aware of what you consume when you prepare it will make you less likely to overeat.
* Appropriate portions- Restaurants are notorious for their extreme portion sizes, which may contribute to the vast overeating culture and obesity in the modern world. Preparing meals at home gives you the ability to exercise portion control and help curb the temptation of overeating.
* Encourages family bonding - Family dynamics can greatly improve with more at home, family meal times. Children greatly benefit from the ritual of preparing and eating meals together.
* Cleanliness - Cooking at home can give you the clean conscience of not only knowing what's in your food, but how clean your food is. Naturally, you will want to make sure your kitchen and dinnerware are sterile and your ingredients are prepared thoroughly before eating.
* Saves money - Eating dinner out is expensive! It is a lotw more cost-effective to purchase groceries than ordering take out every night. While there is much controversy as to whether or not an individual meal is cheaper made cooking in-home than eating out, with nutritional intake and serving size accounted for, you will save a lot more money by eating in!

Kohli, Yuvraj lead India rout of Pakistan
Birmingham: India captain Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh made Pakistan pay for fluffing catches with quickfire fifties as the holders launched their Champions Trophy title-defence with a rain-affected 124 run thrashing of their arch-rivals at Edgbaston on Sunday.
After India made 319 for three in 48 overs, the third rain stoppage of the match left Pakistan with a revised target of 289 in 41 overs when play resumed in bright sunshine.
But Pakistan, rarely up with the stiff run-rate, finished on 164 for nine, with injured last man Wahab Riaz unable to bat as India won with 44 balls to spare.
Kohli, who on Saturday had dismissed reports of a rift with India coach Anil Kumble, was equally contemptuous of Pakistan's attack during a blistering innings of 81 not out off just 68 balls that included six fours and three sixes.
Left-hander Yuvraj, named man-of-the-match for his game-changing innings, smashed a rapid 53 while helping Kohli add 93 for the third wicket in just 59 balls.
That was not the end of the run spree, with Hardik Pandya hitting sixes off the first three balls of left-arm spinner Imad Wasim's last over of the innings.
India smashed 72 off their final four overs as Pakistan's attack wilted.
Rohit Sharma (91) and Shikhar Dhawan (68) laid the platform with an opening stand of 136.
Mohammad Amir was the pick of Pakistan's attack with none for 32 in 8.1 overs.
But fellow left-arm fast bowler Wahab was hugely expensive, his wicketless 8.4 overs costing 87 runs.
Wahab's day was summed up when he was unable to complete his ninth over after falling awkwardly in his delivery stride.
Before the match, players, officials and a crowd of 24,156 -- a record for a one-day international at Edgbaston -- observed a minute's silence for the victims of Saturday's London terror attack that killed seven people.
Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed won the toss in what was the opening Group B match for both the Asian giants in a tournament featuring the world's top eight ODI teams.
Sharma was fortunate when, on 21, he edged Amir just beyond a diving Azhar Ali at slip for four. Pakistan were donated a wicket, however, when Dhawan hoisted a full toss from teenage leg-spinner Shadab Khan straight to Azhar at deep midwicket.
Sharma went 43 balls without a boundary in the face of tight Pakistan bowling before cover-driving and pulling Wahab for a four and a six off successive deliveries.
But eyeing what would have been his 11th ODI hundred, Rohit was run out when he just failed to beat Babar Azam's throw to wicket-keeper Sarfraz after Kohli's call for a tight single.
It was the end of a 119-ball innings featuring two sixes and seven fours.
Yuvraj should have been out for eight but Hasan Ali, sliding round at long-on, dropped the two-handed catch off Shadab. AFP

Legal shelter for natural resources
Sri Lankas environmental law is a curious mixture of civil law and common law principles derived from Roman Dutch law and English law, statute law juristic writings and judge made law. As a result, there is a multiplicity of jurisdictions and institutions in the environmental arena.
The judiciary on the other hand has shown a keen interest in the development of environmental law. Natural resources are managed through the law. Laws provide the tools and the framework for its management.
The numerous tasks of management including policy making, enforcement, application of management techniques and tools and the making of specific decisions have to be performed within that framework.
One trend that should be noted is the inter-polation of a new level of provincial government after the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987.
The constitutional amendment introduced a new level of institutions between the Central Government and local governments. Accordingly, Provincial governments also have legislative and executive power over environmental matters.
The key environmental law at the statutory level in Sri Lanka is the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980 as amended which introduced both EIA and EPL procedures. Apart from this Act, there are many other sectoral statutes that deal with specific areas of resources or development activity.
Concept of Trusteeship
The Doctrine of Public Trust is an important legal principle which has its roots relating to environment and public law. The duty cast on the State to protect and conserve the environment for the benefit of the people is not a new concept that was introduced with the enactment of the 1978 Constitution. In the Danube River case (1997  General List N92 25th September 1997, ICJ) then Vice President of the International Court of Justice C.G Weeramantry J, referred to the conversation of King Devanampiyatissa (247 -207 BC) and Arahat Mahinda dating back to the 3rd century BC. The excerpts from the said conversation is given below:
Or great king, the birds of the air and the beasts have as equal rights to live and move about in any part of the land as thou. The lands belong to the people and all living beings; thou art only the guardian of it  (Mahawansa; Chapter XIV).
Dr. A.R.B Amarasinghe J. in Bulankulama and Others v Secretary of Industrial Development and others (2000), refers to the fact that the king was Bhupathi or Bhupala meaning lord of the earth or protector of the earth. The Doctrine of Public Trust which was developed through the concept of trusteeship of the kings and rulers is now a well developed legal principle in many parts of the world. In Bulankulama case the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka observed that the organs of State are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people.
In Watte Gedara Wijebanda v Conservator General of Forest and Eight Others (2007), (per Shiranee Tilakawardane, J), the Supreme Court held:
Courts in Sri Lanka have long since recognized that the organs of the State are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people. This recognition of the Doctrine of the Public Trust, accords a great responsibility upon the Government to preserve and protect the environment and its resources.
Sources of Public Trust Doctrine
There are two possible sources of Public Trust Doctrine namely, (a) Roman Dutch law in relation to environmental law and (b) the notion of trusteeship in the law of Trusts. The Doctrine of Public Trust was initially developed in the Roman- Dutch law, particularly with reference to environmental law and the rights of the public to natural resources. Roman  Dutch law which distinguishes between res nullius and res communes, assigns common ownership to that which comes under the latter category. In assigning natural resources with a sense of common ownership Title I of Book II of the Institute of Justinian is pertinent. This section states as follows:
The following things are by natural law common to all  the air, running water, the sea, and consequently seashore. No one, therefore is forbidden access to the seashore .. for these are not, like the sea itself, subject to the law of nations.
This notion of common to all or common all mankind underlines the fundamental basis upon which the Doctrine operates : all natural resources such as rivers, forests, air are subject to common, or public ownership and therefore are held by the government in trusteeship for the use of the general public and are managed and utilized for public purposes. The doctrine also affirms that endowments of nature should be freely available to public, irrespective of the social or economic standing of the person. The roots and fundamental basis of the Doctrine may also be traced to the concept of trust which dictates that property or resources can be held by one person, on behalf of another.
Basis of Public Trust Doctrine in Sri Lanka
The Doctrine of Public Trust in Sri Lanka is the bedrock of the Constitution and elected officials and the arms of the State are mere enforcing agents of the power that is truly vested in the people. In this regard, Articles 3 and 4, Article 12(1) and Chapter VI of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka are of immense importance and have been cited in many cases regarding the doctrine.
Article 3 of the Constitution provides that in the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty of in the people is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of the government, fundamental rights and franchise. In order to establish that the officials are custodians of powers held on behalf of the people, it is argued that these powers are vested in the people and are inalienable by virtue of Article 3. Article 4 provides that the legislative power of the people is to be exercised by Parliament, the executive power by the President of the Republic and the judicial power by Parliament through Courts, tribunals and institutions created, established or recognized by the Constitution.
Moreover, Article 4(d) provides that the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government and shall not be abridged, restricted or denied, saved in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided.
Also relevant are the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties outlined in Chapter VI of the Constitution and mostly importantly Article 28 which provides that  It is the duty of every person in Sri Lanka  (d) to preserve and protect public property and to combat misuse and waste of public property and  (f) to protect nature and conserve its riches .

## Title: Make Our Planet Great Again
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Make Our Planet Great Again
These were the parting words of French President Emmanuel Macrons brief address in English aimed at the American people, following the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Accord on Climate Change. Apart from three countries (US, Syria and Nicaragua), all other countries will abide by this accord aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions and making our planet safer for the future generations. As Macron said, there is no Plan B (on climate change) because there is no Planet B, at least not yet.
Climate change is a result of mans relentless assault on the environment. In the long evolution of the human race a stage has been reached when, through the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the power to transform the environment in countless ways and on an unprecedented scale.
The United Nations has set apart June 5 (today) as the World Environment Day (WED) for mankind to reflect upon the importance of saving Nature and Planet Earth itself. The WED theme for 2017 is Connecting People to Nature, which urges people to get outdoors and into nature, to appreciate its beauty and to think about how we are part of nature and how intimately we depend on it.
We really do not appreciate Nature and what it does for us. To cite one example, did you know that the world as we know it will grind to a halt in a couple of weeks if bees go extinct Natures gifts are often hard to value in monetary terms. They are often taken for granted, at least until they become scarce. In fact, most countries will experience a severe water scarcity in the next 15-20 years. While we cannot really put a price on nature and natural resources, economists are developing ways to measure the multi-trillion-dollar worth of many so-called ecosystem services, from insects pollinating fruit trees to the leisure, health and spiritual benefits of a hike up a valley.
Mans attempts to tame and overpower nature have resulted in alarming consequences. The excessive burning of fossil fuels has led to global warming which will see a steep rise in temperatures and sea levels over the next few decades, wiping many islands off the map.
The worlds forests are being degraded and lost at a staggering rate of 3.3 million hectares per year. While their steady destruction in many Asian countries continues apace, deforestation of the worlds largest tropical forest  the Amazon  increased 29 per cent from last years numbers. According to FAOs Global Forest Resource Assessment in 2015, forests continue to be lost in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region, including Sri Lanka, though the Government has announced plans to increase the countrys forest cover by as much as 35 per cent. Deforestation has another consequence  the extinction of thousands of species of flora and fauna by 2100. Our rivers and oceans are also being polluted at an unimaginable rate.
Here in Sri Lanka, we have seen the ill-effects of harming nature  the Meethotamulla garbage dump disaster, the recent massive floods and the landslides, all tell a story of natures adverse reaction to our follies. The problem is that we hardly learn a lesson from any of the major natural disasters or disasters caused by mans indifference to, and exploitation of, nature.
There are many challenges ahead  the world population will rise to nine billion by 2050, which means an extra two billion mouths to feed, with the same (or diminished) area of arable land. We will have to drastically cut down on fossil fuels and opt for renewable energy to save millions of people from rising temperatures and seas. We will have to strictly enforce the 3Rs  Reduce, Re-use and Recycle to reduce the massive burden on the environment.
Some experts fear that the way things are going, the Earth may no longer be habitable in just 100 years. Renowned cosmologist Professor Stephen Hawking has repeated his warning that human survival depends on finding a new home beyond Earth. The search for other planets to colonise should start now, he believes. Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla has already launched a programme to find new homes for humanity in the next 100 years, starting with nearby Mars.
In the meantime, we should try to save the one planet we already have. Every little bit helps in this effort. If you walk to the junction instead of taking the car, you will save some fuel. If you install a LED bulb instead of a normal one, you will save power. If you use a reusable bag for grocery shopping, it will reduce polythene waste. If you use a cup of water to wash your mouth instead of using running water, at least five litres of water can be saved. If every person on Earth does just one thing every day to save the environment and connect closely with nature, we might still be able to call the Earth home even by 2500. It is still not too late to start making the Earth Great Again.

Market suppliers cry foul at first Ministerial meeting
Retail market supplier collective in Sri Lanka voiced that the prohibited market practice of mixing imported and domestically milled rice could be overcome with a simple move, instead of resorting to punitive official raids.
Meeting the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on Thursday the Colombo Traders Association (CTA) said that maximum retail prices, imposed by the government have become an impediment, hampering Lankan consumer well-being, rather than improving it.The meeting was also attended by Ministers top officials in charge of retail (across such institutions as the Consumer Affairs Authority, the CWE and Lanka Sathosa).
Here the delegation proposed equal prices for both imported and domestically milled rice in the local market.
This can be done by a simple move -by increasing the duty on imported rice by as little as Rs 10 and no more. Raids are needed to prevent abuse but the present system of raiding is harsh and they show no mercy, they opined.
The June 1 meeting, was attended by the CTA 90% of its 210 members are large volume importers and distributors and committed tax payers. The top CTA reps at June 1 meet were Chairman of CTA YM Ibrahim, Chairman, Ishana Exports Pvt Ltd-a leading exporter of spice), CTA Deputy Chairman SM Zaneer, Chairman, KTC Group-the main importer of dates, raisins & sultanas for Lankan market and also a leading rice miller, and CTA Secretary Sooriyar, Chairman of Sooriyan Traders-large scale importer of essential food items to Sri Lanka.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.08% W-o-W (or LKR 2.32Bn) to LKR 2,960.63Bn cf. LKR 2,962.94Bn last week.
Liquidity (in Value Terms) | The Banking, Finance and Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the week's total turnover value, accounting for 57.01% (or LKR 2.36Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by the Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank and Bimputh Finance which accounted for 86.44% of the sector's total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 17.85% (or LKR 0.74Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Browns capital, JKH, Richard Pieris and Browns Investments which accounted for 84.33% of the sector turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 7.25% (or LKR 0.30Bn) to the market driven by BPPL Holdings which accounted for 18.31% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Dialog and BPPL Holdings led foreign purchases while Browns Capital and Vallibel led foreign sales.
In terms of value, JKH and Dialog led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank and Union Bank led foreign sales.
Point of View
Markets lost a marginal 9 points over the week with average turnover levels hovering around LKR 0.83bn. Markets see-sawed this week as gains on Wednesday and Thursday (+38.4 points) which is largely due to the new appointments to the cabinet helped pare down losses which caused due to devastating floods and landslides that weighed on sentiment at the start of the week (-42.6 points).
Average turnover levels therefore were dwindling around LKR 0.83bn during the week, 29% lower than last week's average turnover levels of LKR 1.07Bn and 9% lower than the year's average turnover levels (0.91Bn).
Large parcels in Commercial Bank (73% of the total crossings), SAMP (15% of the total crossings), Lion Brewery (9% of the total crossings) however helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover as total crossings accounted for 48% of total market turnover.
Foreign investors too remained on sidelines this week as the total net inflows amounted to LKR 142.75Mn during the week, 89.71% lower than last week's average inflows of LKR 1.39Bn. Similar market momentum is likely to prevail in the week ahead amid some profit taking.
Earnings of 90% of Market Broadly Positive
Corporate earnings for the quarter ending March 2017 have been trickling in and have, so far been positive.
Market earnings of 90% of corporates have been broadly positive with 57% of the reported companies recording a Y-o-Y gain in quarterly earnings.
Total market earnings thus far amount to LKR 80bn relative to LKR 65bn (up 23% Y-o-Y) reported by the same companies in March'16. Counters in the Banking, Finance and insurance (+58% Y-o-Y), Manufacturing (+10% Y-o-Y), Healthcare (+57% Y-o-Y), Trading (+244% Y-o-Y)sectors increased their contribution to total market earnings over the quarter.
Earnings growth in the Diversified and Construction sectors, reflected recovery in the general macro-economic environment over 2016/17 compared to early 2016 with earnings from Diversifieds growing 79% Y-o-Y and Construction sector growing 152% over Mar'16.
Counters in the Telecom (-32% Y-o-Y), Beverage Food and Tobacco (-31% Y-o-Y), Hotels and Travels (-28% Y-o-Y), Land and Property (-63% Y-o-Y) and Motor (-24% Y-o-Y) meanwhile recorded Y-o-Y declines.

Murray fells Del Potro in Paris
PARIS: Top seed Andy Murray eased into the last-16 of the French Open 7-6(8) 7-5 6-0 on Saturday, over a flagging Juan Martin Del Potro.
Murray did enough to keep his nose in front throughout, while the giant Argentine was unable to reprise the heroics that saw the pair produce such magic in last years Rio Olympics gold medal match. While Murray won that affair too -- and their only previous grand slam meeting -- Del Potro had triumphed in their most recent clash, so the Scot had been alert to the dangers.
Yeah, it was obviously an important win for me and a big match, because Juan, when hes playing well, is one of the best players in the world, Murray said.
To be playing him this early on in the slam is obviously not easy, but it can be a very positive thing.
You play someone that good, maybe youre a little bit more switched on.
Your focus is maybe a little bit higher. Del Potro, whose career has been blighted by a recurring wrist injury, needed a good start against the world number one, but when he lost a tight first set tiebreak, the stage was set.
Losing that opener on a disputed linecall cut Del Potro deep. Murray jogged to his seat at the changeover, the Argentine stood at the net, bent at the waist, his head resting on the netcord. There he stayed until the umpire called time.
I couldnt believe that set, that I lost that set, because I had many opportunities to win, Del Potro said. I have been playing great, great points during whole, the first set.
But this happens when you play against the No. 1 in the world or a great champion as Andy or Rafa (Nadal) or Roger (Federer) or these guys. You never know when you can win a set or a match, and that happened today.
The pair traded blows in the second set with Murray creeping ahead. But a monumental effort by Del Potro saw him break back for 5-5, only to instantly drop serve again as Murray yanked him around the court with tight angles, drop shots and lobs.
This time the Scot would make no mistake and crunched it out with his fourth ace of the match. Del Potros spirit was broken, and the vocal Paris crowd were quelled.  Agencies

Murunga : Unmatched Nutrition
Murunga (Moringa Oleifera) has a reputation of legendary proportions for being a vegetable high in nutrition and many health benefits. Garden Talk talks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana, District Agricultural Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on this plant also known as the Drumstick tree that Sri Lankans have placed their trust in.
To lead a healthy life and maintain our mental and physical health you need clean oxygen, clean water and nutrients. We can get these important nutrients by consuming healthy foods. We need to consume vegetables that are high in nutrition. We like to consume foods that are healthy and also delicious. However we must choose intelligently and Murunga is an intelligent choice, said Jayathilake.
Murunga is one of those vegetables that can provide our body with proper nutrients.
The Murunga pods and leaves are high in nutrition. It has many benefits. It is free of chemical agents which makes it good for human consumption. You can easily grow this vegetable in your home garden and it is a local product. It is ideally grown in the Dry Zone, where the temperature is high, stated Jayathilake
It is a perennial plant growing up to four to five meters.
It can be grown in the Wet Zone, but because of the low temperature you dont have a good harvest or get many pods. Even though this is a Dry Zone plant, growing in a home garden in the Wet Zone is not a problem. This is because it is for daily consumption and not on a commercial scale. Also wherever you grow it, you can still use the leaves which are packed in nutrients. Through the leaves we can satisfy our daily nutritional needs, pointed out Jayathilake
Varieties
In the Dry Zone the rainfall is less and the temperature is high. The climatic conditions are suitable for growing Murunga. Growing in the Wet Zone does not yield such a good harvest that you can get in the Dry Zone. Consuming Murunga leaves is practical, recommended and an intelligent decision. In Sri Lanka we have identified two varieties of Murunga. They are Jaffna and Chavakachcheri types. The Jaffna variety is 60  90cm while the Chavakachcheri is three to four feet. It is spread out in India, Pakistan, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, added Jayathilake Murunga is propagated by cuttings and are grown in polythene bags to draw out the roots. The soil medium in these polythene bags is made up of top soil, compost and sand. When the roots come out, we plant the Murunga plant in the field. When leaves appear, then we know that the roots have developed. When the plant grows up to one meter we cut off the Apical bud. The Secondary shoots then appear and spread out to the sides. When this happens you are able to better maintain the plant and easily pick the pods and leaves since the tree has not grown too big. We cut off the Apical bud because if the tree grows too high, plucking pods and leaves will be difficult. These secondary shoots spread out like a bush and can be pruned. The Murunga has medicinal value and can also be used as a soup or curry. There is no such insect attack when it comes to this plant. No insecticides and Pesticides are needed, so there is food security, explained Jayathilake.
Health benefits
Moringa Oleifera (Murunga) is considered legendary when it comes to health benefits and studies are already being conducted into the potential of this vegetable. The internet is abuzz with news about its powerful medicinal possibilities. One thing we know for sure is that it is rich in healthy antioxidants. It is reputed to help reduce high blood sugar levels. However more studies must be done for confirmation concerning reduction of blood sugar levels.

NCE to hold Annual Export Awards on September 29
National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) proposes to celebrate the 25th Annual Export Awards ceremony on September 29 at the Hilton Colombo.
The Annual Export Awards Ceremony of the NCE recognizes and rewards Sri Lankan exporters on their achievements in the International Market Place. It serves to motivate them to reach greater heights in the field of exports, and enhance their contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka.
It is the most looked forward to event in the business calendar of Sri Lanka, and is attended by over 600 participants including the political leadership, members of the Diplomatic Corps, high State Officials, the cream of the Business Community, member exporters of the Chamber, and special invitees.
The newly elected President of the Chamber Ramal Jasinghe in his address at the AGM had stressed the importance of reaching out to the Regional Chambers, and present special awards to especially export oriented SMEs, Service Providers to Exporters, and entities which are links in the Export Value Chains, with a view to motivate them. The Management Committee of the Chamber has also taken special interest this year to ensure that Entrepreneurs linked to the Export Value Chains from the Regions are recognized with Special Awards.
In this context the NCE also wishes to emphasize that the Export Awards Ceremony is not exclusively for its members.As such all Direct Exporters, Indirect Exporters, Service Providers to Exporters,as well as other Stakeholders in the field of exports could apply for awards.
Shiham Marikar, Secretary General of the Chamber emphasizes the reasons, why Sri Lankan exporters of Products and Services, as well as upcoming SME exporters should apply for Awards. Firstly, winning an Award serves to motivate employees of the enterprise by witnessing the outcome and benefits of their efforts. Secondly, an award winning export enterprise receives tremendous exposure and publicity through the print and electronic media, regarding its business and professional standing, there by boosting its image among stakeholders. Thirdly and most importantly recognition of the achievements of an enterprise enables it to attract overseas buyers thereby facilitating expansion of the business.
The event this year which celebrates its 25th anniversary, includes several new features, which gives recognition not only to the value and growth in exports of an enterprise, but several other important areas related to the Management of the enterprise, financial parameters, impact on the environment including aspects such as Waste Management and Recycling, Energy Management and Energy Audits, ability to acquire internationally recognized special certifications related to exports, as well as the overreaching activities of an enterprise which has a positive impact on the stakeholders and associated communities etc.
In the above context the Chamber in its 25th year of the event has extended its outreach to Provincial Exporters, as well as related stakeholders in the field of exports.
The objective of the Chamber in respect of this outreach program is to encourage Regional SME Enterprises and Potential Exporters,and develop them into independent export enterprises. It also serves to increase the number of entrepreneurs and export enterprises in Sri Lanka, in order to diversify and expand production capacities of Sri Lankan Export Enterprises.
Officials of the Chamber have already met with Key representatives of Regional Chambers in Kandy, Kurunegala, Uva, Trincomalee, and Jaffna Districts and have appraised the importance of their members applying for 25th Anniversary Awards of the NCE.

No fruit juice until kids are one
Parents should avoid giving fruit juice to kids in the first year of their life. These new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics have been published in the journal Pediatrics.
The group had previously advised parents to wait to offer juice until a child reached six months old but decided to make the change based on rising rates of obesity and concerns about tooth cavities.
We couldnt really see any reason why juice was still part of the potential recommendation for 6 to 12-month-old kids, said Dr. Steven A. Abrams, chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, and co-author of the policy statement.
We recommend breastfeeding or formula in that age group, and there really isnt any need or beneficial role for juice, so we kind of made that adjustment.It is the first change to the academys fruit juice recommendations since 2001.It wasnt some magical new science that inspired the alteration, noted Abrams, but rather this (guideline) hadnt been looked at in a long time, so we thought it was time to take a close look.
The problem is, parents will stick a bottle or sippy cup in the kids mouth and kind of leave it there all day. Thats not good from the calorie-intake perspective, and its sure not good for the teeth, Abrams said. What happens is, the kid then gets used to all the sugar, and then they wont drink water. ANI

However, since the disease could appear in such areas after the floods recede, a decision to keep adequate stocks of the Dextran 40 drug was taken at a special disaster management meeting held at the Health Ministry recently.
At this meeting, a decision was taken to urgently import 5,000 vials of Dextran from Thailand through the World Health Organisation. Steps had also been taken to import further stocks of Dextran through the State Pharmaceuticals Cooperation, he said.

Pelwatte Dairy celebrates World Milk Day
World Milk Day falls on June 1, first held in 2001 as an initiative of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), this day is celebrated internationally and is the perfect opportunity to focus attention on this global food  milk and raise a glass to celebrate the benefits of milk for our lives.
This years celebrations revolve around the themes of Good food, health and nutrition, Farmers caring responsibility for their communities, the land, and their animals and how dairy contributes to economic development and livelihoods.
In an industry dominated by foreign brands and foreign importers, Pelwatte Dairy Industries is the first private sector firm to invest in a milk production plant and is in the forefront of promoting self-sufficiency in milk for Sri Lanka.
The company stands out as a leading manufacturer of dairy products that are fully produced locally. In foreign imported products, the components and supply chain is unknown. However, Pelwatte prides in ensuring that 100 percent of the milk used is locally sourced and is 100 percent organic without any added preservatives to increase shelf-life. This assures that locals are delivered the cream of the cream, the best of the best, the healthiest and the highest quality dairy products.
If Sri Lanka was self-sufficient in milk once upon a time, then this can be done again. It is simply a matter of concentrating on what we have and channelling funds used for imports to uplift our own farmers and industries. As we celebrates World Milk Day, this is what Pelwatte aspires to do as we deliver Sri Lankans the highest quality dairy products while conserving valuable foreign exchange currently spent on imported dairy products, said Pelwatte Dairys Managing Director, Akmal Wickramanayake. Being ranked amongst the Most Respected Entities in the country, Pelwatte also ensures that they go beyond mere production of dairy but also plays a major role in boosting the economy of the country. The company places importance in being seen as a value adding partner not just in business but also in social aspirations. By promoting local sources, the company supports over 25, 000 farmers from whom about 150,000  200,000 litres of milk is collected daily.
Further the company decided to establish its factories in areas such as Buttala and Moneragala which show slow growthin terms of local economies in order to bring about positive change and development in these regions.

Permanent solution for floods in five years with support of all: Vajira
A permanent solution to major floods in the country could be provided within five years if the public and political parties extend their fullest support to the Government during its implementation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The Minister addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday said major floods that occurred in Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Hambantota could be prevented by properly managing the Gin, Nilwala and Kalu Rivers.
He said the construction of six main dams is required for this purpose. These include Maguru, Kukule, Ratnapura, Jasmine, Binghamara and Hulandwa Dams.
Minister Abeywardena said the original plans in this regard were proposed in the 1960s, but nothing has materialised even after the lapse of 60 years. The minister was referring to a report of a feasibility study jointly carried out by an engineering firm in the USA and the then Agriculture, Irrigation, Lands and Power Ministry in Sri Lanka.
ECI Engineering Ltd., in Colorado was involved in this feasibility study and its report was submitted in 1968. I read this report very carefully and found out that it had rightly predicted the severity of floods and landslides the country recently experienced. It recommended the construction of six dams to avoid this catastrophe which we had failed to do, Minister Abeywardena said.
He pointed out the proposed dams would also be helpful to provide water for cultivation and several mini hydro power plants.
The Minister said the foundation stone for the Dam in Galle would be laid before April next year, adding that about 400-500 families would have to be evicted for the purpose. This is to avoid a serious catastrophe in the future. This is the only longstanding solution. I urge the public and political parties not to come up with popular slogans and hamper the implementation of these plans, he noted.
The minister, observing that the preliminary calculations of economic loss from the recent disaster runs into billions of Rupees, said a survey on its impact on peoples livelihoods has commenced.

PNS Zulfiquar leaves after disaster relief operations
The Pakistan Navy Ship Zulfiquar sailed from Colombo after the successful completion of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA&DR) operations and relative normalisation of situation in flood-stricken Sri Lanka.
The operations were conducted in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Army, Navy and local administration.
During the four days of the operations, the Pakistan Navy teams rescued/evacuated a large number of flood-stranded population from far-flung villages, provided medical treatment and medicines to flood affected families, restored fresh water supply to local population by decontaminating wells, cleared roadways and passages by de-flooding marshy areas and last but not the least, provided edibles, fresh water and dry ration to displaced families, mostly women, children and the elderly.
The Pakistan Navys ardent and unflinching support immensely helped restore activities of life amongst the population of far-flung villages. Shades of relief and contentment on the faces of flood-stricken people were an overwhelming sign of gratefulness for the Pakistan Navy officers and men who participated in the operations. Sri Lankan political and military higher echelon acknowledged and highly appreciated Pakistan Navys efforts for helping Sri Lankan people in the hour of need.
Naval forces have an inherent capability of flexibility and reach, which have been clearly manifested/employed during the relief operations in Sri Lanka.
The operations signify the professional acumen and commitment of the Pakistan Navy to conduct such large-scale operations involving diverse technical and professional expertise under a single umbrella.
The Pakistan Navy is resolute in maintaining and delivering on its commitment to the nation and global community for providing any assistance to keep Pakistans flag higher. Our ships, flying the green flag around the globe, are reflection of our national character, resilience and unrelenting commitment to the humanitarian cause, read a press statement issued by the Pakistan Navy. - Daily Times

Police arrest 12 over London attacks
British Police arrested 12 people Sunday in connection with the attacks in London that left seven people dead, after raiding several addresses in Barking, a suburb to the east of the capital.
The investigation into last nights horrific attack in London is progressing rapidly as the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) continue to piece together exactly what occurred, the force said in a statement.
It added that a number of addresses in Barking were still being searched.
Four women wearing Islamic veils over their faces were seen being led away by police by an AFP photographer, although it was not clear whether they were among those arrested.
There were several police vehicles outside a block of flats that had been cordoned off.
Sky News had previously reported the arrest of four men following a raid by armed police at 7:00 am (0600 GMT), as well as one woman who was then released.
Three men rammed a van through crowds of pedestrians on London Bridge on Saturday, before attacking revellers with knives, leaving seven people dead and 48 in hospital.
The assailants were shot dead at the scene, although police are still seeking to establish whether they had accomplices.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick earlier told reporters: We believe the threat that they posed was neutralised.
Of course its a very complex and confused scene, and a confused series of events.
So its important that we first of all make sure there is no one else outstanding. We dont believe there is, but we must make absolutely certain of that.
We have a very large investigation ongoing, and we will be seeking to establish whether anyone else was working with or assisting in any way or helping in the planning of this attack. - AFP

Raigam Wayamba Salterns revenue tops Rs 723.4 mn in 2017
The Wayamba Salterns PLC has recorded a revenue of Rs. 723.4 million in 2017.
Commenting on the unprecedented financial growth achieved during this financial year, Raigam Wayamba Salterns, Chairman, Executive Director Dr. Ravi Liyanage said in comparision to the revenue of Rs. 414.6 million recorded in 2016, this was the highest ever financial performances recorded by the Group.
This feat was due to the consumers attraction and loyalty towards Raigam products and the uninterrupted distribution of the products to all retail and wholesale outlets throughout the country, he said.
Dr Liyanage said the company was established in 2005 as the subsidiary of the Raigam Group of companies with the objective of developing the salt market in Sri Lanka and at that time the countrys salt market was dominated by Indian salt suppliers and this situation prompted them to start salt manufacturing in Sri Lanka.
He said since the company showed remarkable progress within a short period, in 2010 the company was listed at the Colombo Stock Exchange as Raigam Wayamba Salterns PLC .We wanted to give the opportunity even to the general public to become owners of this venture, Liyanage said.
He said the company issued 80 million shares at an affordable price of Rs 2.50 per share for anyone like school teachers or university students to become shareholders of the company by investing Rs. 2,500 the minimum subscription. The share issue following the boom in the capital market in Sri Lanka was very successful and oversubscribed by 20 times.
Dr Liyanage further said that there were bad experiences in the share market due to unethical attempts by some companies who entered the market to grab opportunities during the post war season.
But the Raigam Wayamba Salters is proud to mention that the company could establish its market value and maintain the confidence of investors, he said. Dr. Liyanage also mention about the severe slat shortage in the country in 2016 and said although many salt businesses came to a standstill, Raigam managed to service the market due to prudent stock management practices of the company.
He said the salt refinery and the Pure Vacuum Dried (PVD) salt plant which is located in Palavi, Puttalam is used to harvest raw salt and directly distributed from Western Region to Northern Region enjoying the comparative advantage of low distribution cost.
CEO/Executive Director Ganaka Amarasinghe refering to the state of the art Raigam Salt refinery in Hambantota District said that the raw salt harvest of this saltern is well enough to provide services to Southern and Uva Regions with a low operational cost.

Ramos shows ugly side before glorious celebration
CARDIFF, Saturday - sReal Madrid captain Sergio Ramos showed the best and worst of his game in the Champions League final on Saturday, finishing it by holding the trophy aloft minutes after his simulation led to a red card for Juventus substitute Juan Cuadrado.
Real captain Ramos had been booked in the first half and risked getting sent off for the 23rd time in his career with a wild lunge on Cuadrado in the 86th minute.
When the Juventus winger came over to complain about the challenge, making the slightest of contacts with Ramos's back, the Spaniard threw himself to the floor, earning the Colombian a second yellow card instead. While Cuadrado contemplated becoming the first substitute to get sent off in a Champions League final after earning two bookings inside 18 minutes, Ramos took centre stage in the trophy presentation, lifting the huge cup as his team celebrated becoming the first to successfully defend the title since 1990.
Ramos had made his mark in his previous two finals for the right reasons, heading in the 93rd-minute equaliser in 2014 against Atletico Madrid to save Madrid's skin and set up their 10th European triumph. He headed in the first in 2016 against Atletico and again came to his side's rescue with a cynical challenge on Antoine Griezmann to halt a late counter-attack when the game was poised 1-1, later converting his penalty in the shootout win.

Recent floods not caused by Southern Expressway construction: Minister
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday categorically rejected the claims that the recent floods in the southern part of the country were caused by the construction of Southern Expressway.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, the minister dismissed those claims as rather immature arguments.
Such comments may misguide the people. There is nothing wrong in the Southern Expressway. It was properly constructed, the minister said.
Abeywardena further said the Southern Expressway was an initiative of the UNP back in 2001 when there was a coalition Government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
It was Minister Tilak Marapana and I who laid the foundation stone for the expressway. Under the previous reign, it was removed and replaced with a new stone. Despite that we assume the full responsibility of this expressway, and we will not let it cause any problem. Foreign consultants were also involved in that project he noted.
The minister said recent floods were not caused by the Expressway, but because of the absence of water basins to retain water in the upper parts of the river. Expressways are needed for the country. The Southern Expressway is being extended to Beliatte and it should also be extended to Badulla via Monaragala he added.
Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka recently told a press conference that the Southern Expressway contributed to the flood havoc in the South. Asked about this comment, the minister said if there were issues concerning the construction of expressway those could be rectified.
Ministers are entitled to their own views, but we come to common ground when it comes to the implementation of Government policies the minister said when queried about Ranawakas contradictory stance that improving public transport is what the country needs rather than expressways, Abeywardena added.

Red Cross launches appeal for post flood recovery
The Red Cross is concerned about the spread of water-borne diseases in the aftermath of the catastrophic floods and landslides that have engulfed south-western Sri Lanka in recent days.
The floodstriggered by the beginnings of Tropical Cyclone Morawere the worst to hit Sri Lanka in 14 years. According to the Government, more than 630,000 people have been affected, including 70,000 who remain in temporary shelters having been forced to abandon their homes.
Over 203 people have been killed and close to 100 are missing. The flooding has contaminated drinking water sources and damaged toilets and sanitation systems, raising the risk of water-borne diseases, including dengue.
Tens of thousands of people are still unable to return home, Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) president Jagath Abeysinghe. Dengue is endemic in Sri Lanka and with so much standing water, conditions are ripe for mosquitoes to breed and spread the disease. Providing clean water and sanitation together with awareness on preventing communicable diseases is a critical part of in our humanitarian response.
SLRCS disaster response teams and volunteers have been on the ground supporting the emergency aid effort. Many of the volunteers are from affected communities and have been responding to the crisis since the floodwaters started to rise. Red Cross teams have helped to evacuate more than 7,500 people to safety in seven of the worst affected districts, performing life-saving first aid and delivering food and other emergency relief items to affected people.
As the floodwaters began to subside one of the priorities has been decontaminating wells to ensure that people have a safe drinking source and to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as dengue.
In response to the urgent humanitarian needs, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and SLRCS have today launched an international emergency appeal for two million Swiss francs (approximately 2.1 million USD or 1.9 million EUR).
Through this appeal, Red Cross volunteers and staff will assist 40,000 people with emergency relief items including shelter materials and household items; provision of medical and first aid services; support to schools and community health centres; clean water and sanitation; and cash grants to help people recover their livelihoods.
This is the beginning of the monsoon, more rain is expected and our goal now is to help these people recover so that they can cope with any further challenges and begin to rebuild what they have lost, IFRC Operations Manager in Sri Lanka Gerhard Tauscher said.

Roadside Memorials
Today Im in ParisParis, Texas. Its a sweet little town heading toward the Arkansas border. Some people would say its in the middle of nowhere, but Parisians regard it as very cosmopolitan. To prove their kinship to Paris, France, the Texas Parisians have erected a sixty-five-foot Eiffel Tower replica, but this one is crowned with a giant red metal cowboy hat.
Other than the Eiffel Tower, theres not much sightseeing to be done in Paris. I know because I drove around the town, which took ten minutes, and nothing caught my eye. That is, except the graves. Not cemetery graves, but roadside grave markers. No bodies are buried here, but homemade wooden crosses and bouquets of faded plastic flowers mark the places where a loved one died along the lonesome highway.
Grave markers
The stretch of road from Sulphur Springs, Texas to Paris is where the landscape loses the last flourishes of Dallas and opens up to flat, wide, empty country. There seem to be roadside grave markers every mile. They command the eye, perhaps because theres not much else to look at besides cows and fields of cotton.
I cant ignore their presence, so I pull over. The most touching ones are also the most simple. I find a grave marker for BobbyI think its Bobby, I mean, but the rain and sun have faded it badly. It may be Robby; I hope it doesnt say Baby.
This grave marker is made from the two wooden stirrers you get when you buy a quart of paint. Theyve been stapled together to make a cross and painted white. Someone dug a small hole by the side of the road and filled it with cement before the cross was installed.
This is not a temporary memorial. The base of the cross is tied with a brown bandana. It flutters in the dry wind. R.I.P. Bobby.
A mile later, I see another roadside grave. This one looks like a bower bird built it: its is a freeform mound of objects, shards of blue and green glass, a yard of yellow ribbon, a bar towel, and one of those plastic key chains sold at 7-11 with the persons name on it. This one says Susan. I try to interpret the grave as an anthropologist might. Why a bar towel Are the shards of glass from beer bottles Maybe Susan was driving drunk when she died here. Is this a tribute or a warning
Some scholars believe the first roadside graves date to centuries ago, when they were erected in heavily Hispanic states like New Mexico and Texas. In Spanish, theyre called descanos, or resting places.
Flower arrangements
But theyre not just in the American Southwest, of course; you see them everywhere you travel. In Connecticut, my home state, they tend to be more formal, sometimes including large color photographs of the deceased along with flower arrangements, some fake some real.
Someone is curating these graves, because the flowers change with the season. In the autumn there are pumpkins, on birthdays there are stuffed toys or bottles of wine.
Not everyone finds these grave markers as touching as I do. States have passed various efforts at prohibiting them, only to have those rules ignored or overturned.
To make a memorial on a public highway bothers lawyers and government bureaucrats. They see the roadside memorials as eyesores, something on the level of graffitia usurping of public land for private use. They see them as a danger to the flow of traffic, and as visual clutter.
One anti-grave advocate said that because they often feature crosses theyre offensive to people of other faiths.
Wooden posts
A pro-grave lawyer went to court representing a grieving family horrified that the roadside grave they made had been removed.
Colorado and Wyoming have tried to standardize roadside graves by producing uniform wooden posts with a symbol of a dovethese and these alone are legal to place next to a road. They bear no names or tender words.
Driving by them in a car you might not even know what they are. They look like mile markers or rest-stop signage.
I see roadside graves as pure, heartfelt folk art, a collision of grief and found materials. A way to remember what happened to someone beloved. I cant remember the last time I went to a cemetery to visit the grave of someone dear to metheyre in a kind of isolation therebut if they had a little tribute by the side of the road I would think of them every time I drove by to get gas or go to the grocery store.
After a few days on the road in Paris, Texas, Bobby-Robby-Baby and Susan had been on my mind so much they felt like old friends. Theyll come back to me whenever I think of the Eiffel Tower with the jaunty Stetson. - Paris Review

Second chance for school dropouts
What can be done for young students who drop out of the education system without a single major certificate to their name Do we have a comprehensive plan for fighting against student dropout
According Jayasinghe Weerakkodi, a prominent social worker who heads the Sri Lanka National Social Service and Youth of Education organisations, currently, there is no proper plan to both, identifing school dropouts and fighting against it.
According to Weerakkodi, high dropout rates beget social and economic woes for communities. Dropouts are far more likely to become unemployed, commit crimes and become incarcerated.
Weerakkodi, who conducts student motivational workshops and lectures in chosen schools throughout the country as one of his social service programmes says student dropouts in Sri Lanka mainly occur either at grade eight or after failing the ordinary level exam.
He believes students without at least the Ordinary Level certificate will struggle to find viable employment and is more likely to become a social misfit.
We need to give the admirable idea of a second chance its full place in our system. The obtainment of a qualification is the best way of combating unemployment, he said.
With this in mind, Weerakkodi has embarked on a new mission, which is to help students who drop out of school after failing their ordinary level exam. Weerakkodi believes a fresh start and a new school, coupled with proper remedial work for their issues, will help such students to get back on track.
He has identified several such students and currently gives them shelter, food, education material and other support free of charge. He also has arranged a new School in Gonapola area in Horana for them to sit for OLs again
Shenal, who hails from the Gampaha area, is one such student. He had refused to go back to school after failing at the OLs. Shenal, who belongs to a well-to-do family, believed he should try his luck at business instead.
Weerakkodi sir spoke to me over skype for about 5 hours. Finally, he convinced me that I should pursue education again. I was quite demoralized after failing OLs. Sir came to my house and spoke with my parents and they agreed. So now, I am studying at the Weediyagoda Maha Vidyalaya in Gonapola and preparing for OLs again. Being in the company of several others like me and the support Weerakkodi sir gives has given me confidence, said Shenal.
Kosala from the former war-ravaged Welioya in the north, is another student whom Weerakkodi has given safe shelter and education to. Kosala had been identified by Weerakkodi during one his motivational lectures at the Welioya School which Kosala formerly attended.
Kosala was dejected after failing OLs and had decided to end his school-going as he believed he did not have the knowledge or capability to do it.
I had no desire to go to School again, but one day, Weerakkodi sir came to our School. He conducted a lecture and later singled me out and spoke to me alone as well. He encouraged me to do OLs again. So I came to Gonapola with my parents consent. I am enjoying studying with my friends here. I also want to do my ALs here and Weerakkodi sir has told me he will help, said Kosala.
Meanwhile, Lakmal from Udugampola became a Buddhist monk at an early age. He had first ended his education at grade 2. He also had later given up robes. His attempts to make a comeback to school also had failed.
"That is when I met Weerakkodi sir. He spoke to my grandmother. He encouraged me to go back to school. So I came to Gonapola with him and I am preparing for OLs. I am confident of doing well. Shenal and Kosla are also helping me," said Lakmal.
According to Lakmal, the students under Weerakkodi work on daily time table and they have targets. They are also free to play, engage in extra-curricular activities and meet relatives and parents. But discipline is also a key factor and those who step out of boundaries are not tolerated. He also encourage students under his tutelage to live independently.
Weerakkodi only has a few students currently. He spends his own money, as well as those of the well wishers to carry out the programme. He expects to extend his programme in the future and encompass more deserving and needy students.
"When it comes to School drop-outs, my oganisation is striving to deal with prevention, re-entry education and remedial work. My main objective is giving young people a new chance to succeed in education," Weerakkodi said.

Sri Lanka to release 42 boats, but warns of action if Indian fishermen enter its waters
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera confirmed the release of 42 Indian boats, and warned that Sri Lanka wouldn't stop taking boats that crossed the maritime boundary into custody.
After a long wait, it's time to rejoice for fishermen in Tamil Nadu's Rameshwaram. Minister Amaraweera has confirmed the release of 42 boats - out of a total of 143 - that are in Sri Lanka's custody.
However, Amaraweera added that this doesn't mean Sri Lanka will stop taking boats that enter Sri Lankan waters into custody.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka in May, it was confirmed that the Sri Lankan government would consider releasing Indian boats in its custody. While Indian fishermen are happy about the announcement, they've said that they need protection in the Indian Ocean region.
"Every time we go to sea there is a threat to our life and property. We want the government to ensure our protection," said Emerat, fishermen leader. "Now we want our government to ensure that the (released) boats reach us at the earliest, and also ensure that the rest of the 101 boats also be released," said Jesuraj, another fishermen leader.Sri Lanka's Fisheries Ministry has said Indian fishermen should remember to not enter Sri Lankan waters, and that they must refrain from using nets or trawlers - which are banned in Sri Lanka.

Standing up for cinema
I am neither a writer nor a theorist. Im a filmmaker. I saw something extraordinary and inspiring in the art of cinema when I was very young. The images that I saw thrilled me but they also illuminated something within me. The cinema gave me a means of understanding and eventually expressing what was precious and fragile in the world around me. This recognition, this spark that leads from appreciation to creation: it happens almost without knowing. For some, it leads to poetry, or dance, or music. In my case, it was the cinema.
Quite often, when people discuss the cinema, they talk about single images. The baby carriage rolling down the Odessa Steps in Battleship Potemkin, for instance. Peter OToole blowing out the match in Lawrence of Arabia. John Wayne lifting Natalie Wood in his arms near the end of The Searchers. The blood gushing from the elevator in The Shining. The exploding oil derrick in There Will Be Blood.
Extraordinary images
These are all absolutely extraordinary passages in the history of our art form. Extraordinary images, to be sure. But what happens when you take these images away from those that come before and after What happens when you lift them out of the worlds to which they belong Youre left with records of craftsmanship and care, but something essential is lost: the momentum behind and ahead of them, the earlier moments that they echo and the later moments for which they prepare the way, and the thousand subtleties and counterpoints and accidents of behaviour and chance that make them integral to the life of the picture. Now, in the case of the blood-gushing elevator from The Shining, you do have an image that can exist on its own  really, it can stand as a movie on its own. In fact, I believe it was the first teaser trailer for the movie.
But that image on its own is one thing and how and what it is within the world of Stanley Kubricks film is something else again. The same goes for each of the examples Ive mentioned above, all of which have been excerpted in countless clip reels. As artfully put together as some of those reels are, I find them disconcerting, because they usually amount to a series of official great moments pulled away from their contexts.
Still frames
Its also important to remember that most of these images are actually sequences of images: Peter OToole blowing out the match followed by the sun rising over the desert, the baby carriage rolling down the steps amid the chaos and brutality of the attack by the Cossacks. And beyond that, each separate cinematic image is comprised of a succession of still frames that creates the impression of motion. They are recordings of instants in time. But the moment you put them together, something else happens. Every time I get back into the editing room, I feel the wonder of it. One image is joined with another image, and a third phantom event happens in the minds eye  perhaps an image, perhaps a thought, perhaps a sensation. Something occurs, something absolutely unique to this particular combination or collision of moving images.
And if you take a frame away from one or add a couple of frames to the other, the image in the minds eye changes. Its a wonder to me, and Im far from alone.
Sergei Eisenstein talked about it on a theoretical level, and the Czech filmmaker Frantiek Vlcil discusses it in an interview included on the Criterion edition of his great medieval epic Marketa Lazarov (1967).
The film critic Manny Farber understood it as elemental to art in general  thats why he named his collection of writings Negative Space. This principle, if thats what you could call it, is just as applicable to the juxtaposition of words in poetry or forms and colours in painting. It is, I think, fundamental to the art of cinema. This is where the act of creation meets the act of viewing and engaging, where the common life of the filmmaker and the viewer exists, in those intervals of time between the filmed images that last a fraction of a fraction of a second but that can be vast and endless.
Different progression
This is where a good film comes alive as something more than a succession of beautifully composed renderings of a script. This is film-making. Does this phantom image exist for casual viewers without an awareness of how films are put together I believe it does. I dont know how to read music and neither do most people I know, but we all feel the progression from one chord to another in music that affects us, and by implication some kind of awareness that a different progression would be a different experience.
In the January 4 issue of the TLS, there was a review of my most recent film, an adaptation of Shusaku Endos novel Silence. The review, written by Adam Mars-Jones, was not entirely positive, but I found it thoughtful and, for the most part, carefully considered. There were, however, two points with which I took issue: a factual error and a series of statements about the cinema. I wrote a letter to the TLS in response to both points. When the Editor notified me that the letter would be published (March 17), he asked me if I might be interested in writing a piece that would elaborate on my response to Mr Mars-Joness thoughts about the art of film. I decided to take Mr Abell up on his offer.
Over the years, Ive grown used to seeing the cinema dismissed as an art form for a whole range of reasons: its tainted by commercial considerations; it cant possibly be an art because there are too many people involved in its creation; its inferior to other art forms because it leaves nothing to the imagination and simply casts a temporary spell over the viewer (the same is never said of theatre or dance or opera, each of which require the viewer to experience the work within a given span of time).
Oddly enough, Ive found myself in many situations where these beliefs are taken for granted, and where its assumed that even I, in my heart of hearts, must agree.
Harsh assessments
I do not mean to imply that Mr Mars-Jones subscribes to all of the above positions. However, he does seem to have an opinion about the cinema that is more or less in sympathy with such harsh assessments.
Even the most relentless book filters diffusely into the life of the reader, he writes, while a film suspends that life for its duration. I know for a fact that this isnt true, based on my own experience. First of all, it seems to me that we all want to surrender ourselves to art, to live within a given film or painting or dance.
The question of how an artwork is absorbed in time, whether were standing before it in a gallery for a matter of minutes, reading it over a matter of weeks, or sitting in a dark theatre and watching it projected on a screen for two hours, is simply a condition, a circumstance, a fact. So yes  when Im really watching a film from beginning to end, Im not stopping it to make a phone call and then starting it again. On the other hand, Im not letting the film override my existence. Im watching it, experiencing it, and along the way seeing echoes of my own experience illuminated by the film and illuminating it in turn.
Im interacting with the film in countless ways, great and small. Never once have I felt like I just sat there and let a picture wash over me like a tidal wave, and then come back to my senses as the lights came up. Mr Mars-Joness conception of the film-viewing experience seems to be quite different from my own. For me, it was always a source of excitement and enrichment. Im sure that the same can be said for many of my fellow filmmakers.
In a book, writes Mr Mars-Jones, reader and writer collaborate to produce images, while a film director hands them down. I disagree. The greatest filmmakers, like the greatest novelists and poets, are trying to create a sense of communion with the viewer. Theyre not trying to seduce them or overtake them, but, I think, to engage with them on as intimate a level as possible.
The viewer also collaborates with the filmmaker, or the painter. No two viewings of Raphaels Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints will be the same: every new viewing will be different. The same is true of readings of The Divine Comedy or Middlemarch, or viewings of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp or 2001: A Space Odyssey. We return at different moments in our lives and we see things differently.
Exaggeration overall
I also disagree with Mr Mars-Joness contention that any adaptation of a novel into a film can only amount to a distortion or an exaggeration overall. Of course, in one very important sense, he is correct. Alfred Hitchcock once told Franois Truffaut that despite his admiration for Crime and Punishment, he would never have dreamed of making a film out of it because in order to do so he would have needed to film every single page (in a sense, this is what Erich von Stroheim tried to do when he adapted Frank Norriss McTeague as Greed). But sometimes, the idea is to take elements of a novel and craft a separate work from it (as Hitchcock did with Patricia Highsmiths Strangers on a Train). Or, to take the cinematic elements of a novel and create a film from them (I suppose that this was the case with certain adaptations of Raymond Chandlers novels). And some filmmakers really do attempt to translate a novel into sounds and images, to create an equivalent artistic experience. In general, I would say that most of us respond to what weve read and in the process try to create something that has its own life apart from the source novel.
As I said, I found Mr Mars-Joness review of my film quite thoughtful, and I do not wish to take issue with his opinion of the picture.

Sunshine Holdings launches trading day at CSE to celebrate 50th anniversary
Sunshine Holdings PLC (SUN) rang the opening bell to commence trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Friday. The Bell Ringing ceremony was organized by the CSE to celebrate Sunshine Holdings 50th anniversary.
The Board of Directors and top management of Sunshine Holdings were present at the ceremony while the CSE was represented by Chairman Ray Abeywardena, Chief Executive Officer Rajeeva Bandaranaike and the senior management. Other related senior representatives from the financial services sector were also present at the event.
Elaborating on the benefits of listing the company on the CSE, Sunshine Holdings PLC Group
Managing Director, Vish Govindasamy noted that its involvement with the CSE has greatly supported the Group in elevating its stature to attract substantial local and foreign investments which in turn supported greater liquidity and enhanced brand value.
It is a great honour for our Group to take part in todays ceremony given the significant growth opportunities that our involvement with the CSE has enabled. Over the recent past, we were able to participate in international roadshows in London, New York and Singapore.
Particularly in the last CSE roadshow, we were able to enter into a groundbreaking new partnership with Duxton Asset Management to establish Sunshines first commercial dairy operation through an investment of US$ 12 million. It is through these kinds of engagements that Sri Lankan listed corporates stand to unleash a new wave of growth in the domestic economy, while serving as a vital platform for international exposure, investment and growth. Govindasamy stated.
He further noted the listing of Sunshine Holdings was instrumental in driving concerted refinements to the companys governance structures, reporting and disclosure procedures, all of which enabled Sunshine to deepen stakeholder engagement and enhance its investment attractiveness.

Three assailants kill 7 in London terror attack
UK: Three assailants stabbed passers-by at random after smashing into pedestrians in a van, killing seven people in a terror attack in a popular night-life hub in London before armed police shot all three dead.
As they rampaged through the bars around London Bridge on Saturday night, the trio wore what looked like suicide vests which turned out to be hoaxes, said Mark Rowley, head of counter-terrorism policing.
We believe that seven people have died in addition to the three attackers shot dead by police in what is being treated as a terrorist incident, Rowley said.
Some 48 casualties were rushed to hospitals in the area, according to the London Ambulance Service.
The injured included a British Transport Police officer who was one of the first responders on the scene and was stabbed in the face and leg.
The attack came just five days ahead of a general election and only minutes after the end of the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus, in an area teeming with bars where many fans were watching the football on television.
They were stabbing everyone. They were running up and going This is for Allah, a man called Gerard told the BBC, adding that he had seen the assailants stabbing a girl and had tried to confront them.
Another witness called Eric told the BBC he had seen three men come out of the white van after hitting pedestrians and thought they were going to help.
But instead they started kicking them, punching them and took out knives. It was a rampage really, he said, adding that he also heard a shout of: This is for Allah.
Britain is on high alert only 12 days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester, northwest England and ahead of Thursdays general election, in which security is a major theme. Several people said they were ordered to stay inside pubs and restaurants by police and eventually had to come out with their hands on their heads.
Italian photographer Gabriele Sciotto, who was watching the football at the Wheatsheaf pub in Borough Market, said he saw three men shot just outside the pub.
In his picture, a man wearing combat trousers, with a shaved head and what looked like a belt with canisters attached to it could be seen on the ground with two more bodies behind him.
In two or five seconds, they shot all the three men down, Sciotto told the BBC.
Dozens of emergency vehicles could be seen and a wide area around London Bridge was cordoned off as two helicopters hovered overhead. Media reports said there were three controlled explosions carried out by police during the night.
The attack had harrowing echoes of the one on Londons Westminster Bridge when British Muslim convert Khalid Masood rammed his car into pedestrians before crashing into the barriers surrounding parliament and then stabbing a police officer to death.
Masood was shot dead by a ministerial bodyguard.
Prime Minister Theresa May, who held an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday, confirmed the terrible incident in London was being treated as a potential act of terrorism. Our thoughts are with those who caught up in these dreadful events, she said in a statement. US President Donald Trump offered his help, tweeting WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS! Trump also seized the occasion to plug his thwarted ban on travellers from six mainly Muslim countries.
French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said France was more than ever at Britains side. US pop star Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester was the scene of last weeks fatal terror attack, tweeted: Praying for London. - AFP

Timid Sri Lanka let South Africa off the hook
It was an extremely disappointing start to the tournament for the Sri Lankans. Missing captain Angelo Mathews badly, they showed all the reasons why they have been so inconsistent in the past 18 months.
The bowlers started strongly and then fought-back well in the final death overs after a wonderful partnership between Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis. There were also glimpses of promises with a lively start from Niroshan Dickwella and Upul Tharanga.
However, there was also a lack of clarity in purpose and a confusion in role identification. The players were too timid to decisively commit to their strengths or the situational requirements.
As a Sri Lankan, I hope they are able to regroup and commit to a brand of cricket the fully displays the wonderful talents and abilities I know they possess.
South Africa, on the other hand, will be delighted to have completed a comprehensive win, bagging critical points, but they did not play like a champion side. No future opponent watching them today would have thought they were witnessing a ruthless and clinical performance by an unbeatable side.
However, what they did show was character. They showed the ability to come back from tough situations and they also showed once again that in leg-spinner Imran Tahir they have a talisman that makes their attack far more potent and effective. He is a match winner who lifts the entire side with his skill and exuberance.
AB de Villiers also had a good game in charge of the South Africans. Except for giving Wayne Parnell a few too many overs at the start of the innings, he marshaled his side with skill and authority. Field settings were imaginative and challenging. His bowling changes for the most part were smart and effective.
Although not dominant, South Africa will be relieved with the result and also confident in the knowledge that it is capable of much better.
Sri Lanka's problems started before the game with the injury to Mathews. Facing the South Africans without their captain and most experienced and able batsman was always going to be a challenge.
It also presented them with a selection dilemma. They choose the more conservative option and decided to bolster the batting, playing just four specialist bowlers with Asela Gunaratne as the fifth bowler. It was a big gamble given the strength of South Africa's batting and the fact that Lasith Malinga was playing his first ODI for a long time.
Having won the toss, Sri Lanka inserted South Africa to bat on a slightly tacky two-paced pitch and it would have been hoping to exploit this initial advantage to the maximum. Indeed, the first 10 overs from Malinga and Lakmal were disciplined with Quinton de Kock and Amla being respectful of the bowlers and conditions.
The inconsistent pace of the wicket made shot-making difficult and both batsmen struggled to find their timing. The Sri Lankan bowlers assessed pitch conditions superbly and, although lacking bite and penetration, managed to make scoring difficult and the going tough for the opposition.
Sri Lanka was in need of a breakthrough when Nuwan Pradeep came into the attack and his beautiful delivery to de Kock did the trick.
Du Plessis immediately showed intent and innovation in an attempt to move the scoring rate along. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, it was not able to capitalise on an opportunity with Malinga misjudging a catch in the deep.
Amla and Du Plessis thereafter batted extremely intelligently. Understanding the need for a strong foundation for their batting unit, they mixed caution and aggression with some superb running between the wickets. They pushed the fielders hard and maneuvered the ball into gaps so that the need for high risk shot making was minimised.
By the time Du Plessis was dismissed for 75, South Africa was threatening to build a total well beyond the chasing capability of the Sri Lankans. However, the early exit of de Villiers and the run-out of Amla after a magnificent century brought the match back in the control of the Lankans.
At one stage South Africa looked set to score below 290, well below the huge scored that had been threatened, but a wonderful cameo at the death from JP Duminy lifted them again.
The total was respectable but only marginally above-par at The Oval and I think the Sri Lankans would have walked off the park feeling confident and satisfied, aware that an upset was possible. To win they would require a solid start, a few batting partnerships, and one of the top four batsmen to bat deep into the game. Unfortunately they only got one of those right: a bright start.
Niroshan Dickwella played some in innovative and telling strokes in getting Sri Lanka off briskly. Against the pace of Kagiso Rabada and Wayne Parnell, he looked assured and confident. Moving around the crease, he unsettled them and forced them to bowl to his strengths.
After 10 overs they were ahead of the pace, but the Sri Lankans joy was short-lived as Morne Morkel dismissed Dickwella and then de Villiers pulled off a brilliant catch to get rid of Kusal Mendis.
With the game in the balance with Sri Lanka's most experienced pair at the crease, Tahir then started his match-winning spell, ripping through the middle order and quickly extinguishing hope for Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka would have been bitterly disappointed having squandered the opportunity to beat one of the tournament favourites. Its inability to absorb pressure, to take the match deep with partnerships, and inability to read situations allowed South Africa to escape a tricky situation.
Perhaps with hindsight, Sri Lanka might rue trying to protect Mathews in the opener in the hope that he would be fitter to play India as he was sorely missed in the batting effort. His form and ability was exactly what was needed in the run chase. - ICC news

Two-goal Ronaldo fires Real to 12th European title
CARDIFF, Saturday - Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid beat Juventus 4-1 in a memorable Champions League final full of attacking verve and brilliant goals on Saturday as the Spaniards won the title for the third time in four years and 12th in all.
Portugal forward Ronaldo hit Real's first and third goals to become only the second man to score in three European Cup finals and take his career goal tally to 600 for club and country.
Few of those will have matched Mario Mandzukic's spectacular overhead equaliser for Juventus, which was eventually in vain for the Italian side who had the best of the first half before being swept aside in the second. A long-range deflected effort by Casemiro and a neat finish by the irrepressible Ronaldo within four minutes effectively settled one of the most entertaining finals for years, with a late tap-in by substitute Marco Asensio adding the gloss.
The victory means Real are the first team to successfully defend the trophy in the Champions League era. AC Milan were the last team to retain Europes top prize when they triumphed in 1989 and 1990.
It's been a spectacular year, you couldn't dream of anything better, said Real coach Zinedine Zidane. We won the (Spanish) league on the very last day. It's very difficult to reach the Champions League final two years running, but we did that.
The first half was difficult, but in the second we were quickly superior. We pressed a lot more and physically we won the game there too, so I'm very happy.
It was heartbreak again for Juve, however, who were seeking a treble after winning the Italian league and cup. They came away as losers for the seventh time in nine European Cup finals having also lost to Barcelona in 2015. The Italians let in more goals on Saturday than the three they had conceded in the 12 games they played to reach the final as a much-vaunted Real attack versus Juve defence scenario went emphatically in Madrid's favour.
REAL STRIKE
Juventus looked the more adventurous side in the first 20 minutes but it was Real who struck first after the sort of trigonometric build-up that coaches write books about.
Ronaldo was at the heart of it, playing the ball into the path of Dani Carvajal who cut it straight back to allow the Portuguese forward to sweep the ball sweetly into the far corner. That made Ronaldo the second man to score in three finals, after Alfredo Di Stefano, who netted in five in a row for Real in the 1950s. Ronaldo's effort was eclipsed seven minutes later by one of the all-time great final goals.
Juve centre back Leonardo Bonucci drove a long diagonal ball which Alex Sandro reached and cushioned back across the box.
With another volley Gonzalo Higuain knocked it to Croatia striker Mandzukic, who took a touch on his chest and, with his back to goal, struck a stunning bicycle kick that looped over Real keeper Keylor Navas. The ball did not touch the ground between leaving Bonucci's boot and hitting the net.
The Juventus fans in the 72,000 crowd erupted, ramping up the atmosphere that was already crackling under the closed stadium roof.
DIFFERENT STORY
It was a different story after the break, however, and though Juve's drilled defence initially kept Real at arm's length, they were undone by a two-goal salvo.
Casemiro made it 2-1 after 61 minutes when his defelcted long-range wrong-footed veteran keeper Gianluigi Buffon - who has now lost in three finals - and Ronaldo swept in the third at the near post after a great run and cross by Luka Modric.
Juventus then wilted and finished with 10 men after Juan Cuadrado was sent off in the 84th minute  18 minutes after coming on as a substitute  following a second booking for the mildest of pushes on defender Sergio Ramos, whose theatrics left a sour taste on an otherwise uplifting occasion. Asensio tucked in the fourth goal after Marcelo had charged to the byline and Real's dominance was complete.
Again, I've had an amazing season, said Ronaldo. Me and my team mates have done the double. The numbers don't lie. I'm very happy  an amazing season, we've won trophies. This is one of the best moments of my career  I have the chance to say this every year. After a positive start it turned into a hugely frustrating night for Juventus and their coach Max Allegri.
My only criticism of my team is that after the second goal we should have found a solution to stay in the game, he said.
But Real Madrid have important players and when they have a player who wins the Ballon d'Or (Ronaldo) it's a huge advantage.

Warwickshire collapse after record Hampshire stand
LONDON: Sean Ervine collected a double century and joined Jimmy Adams, another century maker, in the highest stand in the Championship this season before inflicting more misery on Warwickshire as they collapsed in the final session.
Ervine moved from 140 overnight to a sublime 200 to hand his side a first innings total of 515.
But Hampshire domination on the game didn't stop there as they left Warwickshire floundering on 49 for 6 - still 316 behind the follow on.
With blue skies overhead and on the same dry track as the first day, Warwickshire toiled in their reply.
Earlier, Ervine and Adams continued exactly how they left day one as their record fourth wicket stand looked unstoppable. Their records included the highest fourth wicket stand for Hampshire of all time and the top stand of any wicket in Division One this season.
The epic stand was finally broken and Sunny Singh started to chip away with his left arm spin. Adams was the first to depart for a scrappy yet completely chanceless 166 having batted for 502 minutes and 386 balls. A rare attacking shot from Adams was flicked off his legs to midwicket - the colossal stand ending on 367.
Ervine completed his stunning double century, his second for Hampshire and the third of his career, but was out just three runs later. The Zimbabwean attempting a reverse paddle but missed Singh's low slow bounce.
The light for Warwickshire was quickly dimmed again as debutant Ian Holland added 61 for the seventh wicket with Lewis McManus, with the hosts still yet to accelerate. McManus did club a massive six over square leg before Holland was lbw and he was caught at first slip while attempting to slog.
Crane was yorked first ball handing Singh his maiden professional five wicket haul. Singh picked up a sixth when Gareth Berg clubbed to the long on boundary, before Andrew Usmeed grabbed his first career scalp to wrap up the innings. But after their evening heroics, Hampshire look in a great position to win back-to-back for the first time this seasons.

Watch corals without diving
What if you were told that you dont have to go on a multiple days expensive diving course in case you wanted to experience underwater coral reefs and the varied marine life under the sea And no, Im not talking about visiting an aquarium as an alternative either. In fact, if you head an hours drive to the west of the city of Jamnagar in Gujarat, you can do a walking tour of corals. Yes, you read that right. A walking tour of underwater corals.
The Marine National Park and Sanctuary in the Gulf of Kutch in Jamnagar region offers visitors an opportunity to view coral reefs, mangroves, sea-grass beds, mudflats, a network of creeks and other ecosystems which support rich marine life and bird life. It is one of those rare places in the world where you can look at coral reefs without having to dive underwater. Visitors can just walk in ankle deep water when the tide ebbs to watch this fascinating world.
Besides the reefs, a variety of puffer fish, sea horses, octopus, jelly fish and star fish can be spotted during the coral walk at Narara which lies about 60 km from Jamnagar. The coral walk can be done during the dry spell between two high tides. The walk takes anywhere between two to three hours. However, before going on the walk, one has to obtain a permit from the forest department which is available at Narara itself. One can also avail the services of the guides who are skilled and will make your visit very informational.
One can also take a day trip to Pirotan island which is close by but it requires a lot more planning than coral walk. Tide timings have to be taken into account to see which is the most favourable day to visit the island as the boat can only reach the island when the tide is at its fullest. Also, a whole day has to be dedicated; once you reach the island you can only return to the mainland after completion of a tide cycle which is usually 10-12 hours later. Therefore, pack your food, water and other essentials like sun glasses, sun blocks, and a good pair of shoes. The best time of the year to visit the sanctuary is from October to March when the days are sunny and the temperatures are relatively cooler.
Unfortunately, the recent boom of SEZs, ports and oil pipelines is beginning to show their adverse effects on sea life of the sanctuary. Lots of corals are dying and the mangrove covers are depleting. Hopefully, the authorities will initiate necessary action to keep this wonder of nature as pristine as it once was. Deccan Chronicle

Sri Lanka has the advantage of a unique bio diversity footprint and ecological advantages yet over time, as a result of short term goals that border on fast gains, the eco balance has shifted, causing considerable harm to the environment around us, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an World Environment Day Message said.
The message adds:We need to rediscover the manner in which our ancestors were able to co-exist in harmony with nature; as a country, every one of us must be conscious of the need to address ecological and environmental concerns as we travel the a path to progress. It is the challenge that faces every individual and the Government in achieving an optimum balance between development and managing the environment the right way.
If we do not pay adequate attention to the eco-systems and address environmental erosion, needless to say that there would be drastic consequences which the world has witnessed time and again.
As we celebrate International Environment Day, we must come together as a nation to rediscover the respect and the consideration for nature, while inculcating a wider consciousness of the environment in everyone.

Webbed fingered family
Physical deformities are found in rare cases among people in different parts of the world, but more than limited access to medical help, superstitions and a clear lack of awareness about these conditions prevent people from seeking appropriate help to find a cure.
A family in Keralas Alappuzha is facing a rare condition which has left everyone from the 85-year-old head of the family to the youngsters with webbed fingers. They dont have to live with the disorder called Syndactyly as it can be treated, but the family doesnt acknowledge it as a medical problem.
The Kannathu family from a village in Alappuzha believes their life altering disorder to be a curse from god, and they dont want surgery since they are afraid that it will bring bad luck upon the family. The family insists that they can live a normal life even with their fingers stuck together, and carry out daily chores like cooking and cleaning.
The family started having webbed hands 90 years back and since then this has been passed on to every generation. They say they have learnt to use their fingers properly and are proud to show their hands to people who travel from far away places just to see their fingers.
The family believes that they started having this condition when a neighbour cut off a tree in a sacred grove nearby. They are afraid to undergo surgery as a relative who tried lost his ability to hear later. They also hold prayers to appease the snake god.

West Indies rout Afghans in T20 series
Basseterre: Another abject batting display by Afghanistan paved the way for the West Indies to complete a series-clinching 29-run win on the Duckworth Lewis System (DLS) in the rain-affected second fixture of the three-match T20 International series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Saturday.
Set a revised target of 123 after the hosts were limited to 112 for three in a match reduced to 15 overs per side, the Afghans were routed for just 93 off 13.3 overs with fast bowler Kesrick Williams leading the demolition with figures of three for 11 to take the Man of the Match award.
A day after being restricted to 110 all out off 20 overs on the way to a six-wicket defeat, this effort did little to enhance the visitors claims to be elevated to the ranks of the Test-playing nations.
They now face the prospect of being whitewashed in the T20 series going into the final match at the same venue on Monday and look set to suffer the same fate in the three One-Day Internationals which follow in St Lucia.
Karim Janat topscored with 20 as the wickets tumbled around him. As in the first match, much of Afghanistans misery was self-inflicted through a series of poor shots compounded by a lack of understanding in the middle which saw two run outs contributing to the ignominious slide to defeat.
At one stage they had crashed to 55 for eight before Janat and the last two in the batting line-up delayed the inevitable, the match concluding when West Indies captain Carlos Brathwaite took the catch that ended Janats resistance and give Williams his best figures in T20 Internationals.
I just give it everything on this pitch, said Williams after the match. I just knew if I bowled with pace in the right areas success would come my way.
Brathwaite chipped in with two wickets and was especially pleased to complete a second consecutive win in challenging circumstances after the West Indies innings was interrupted after 11 overs by heavy, sustained showers which held up play for almost two hours.
Its difficult to be switching on and off when there are interruptions like that and Im glad that we were able to stay focused through it all, he explained. Now we have to keep in mind that the job isnt finished as yet because we want to get another win on Monday.
West Indies were 79 for two off 11 overs when the rains came with an intensity that raised fears of an abandonment. However they eventually relented and the hosts managed to get another 33 runs off the remaining four overs on the resumption.
After Brathwaite chose to bat first on winning the toss, openers Chadwick Walton and Evin Lewis sought to give their team a flying start with a succession of boundaries. Both got into the twenties before falling though.
Walton was caught at long-on off spinner Mohammad Nabi while Lewis pulled a short ball from medium-pacer Janat to be taken at deep midwicket.
Marlon Samuels and Lendl Simmons were just getting into stride when the heavy showers swept across the ground and on the restart, Samuels departed to the bowling of Gulbadin Naib in the desperate rush for runs.
West Indies retained an unchanged 11 from the first match while Afghanistan made two changes to no avail. Noor Ali Zadran replaced Usman Ghani at the top of the batting order while Dawlat Zadran came into the final eleven at the expense of fellow seamer Shapoor Zadran.
It is important for our development to have more matches against teams of this calibre, said visiting captain Asghar Stanikzai. Its the only way we can improve and we hope to show a much improved performance in the final match of this series. AFP

What causes sudden fall
National Training Officer, Accident Ward of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Pushpa Ramyani De Zoysa speaks about the reasons behind sudden falls. A fall can be either fainting or a more serious condition such as a heart attack or a stroke.
What can lead to a fall 
A. Just fainting, a heart attack, a coma or a stroke can lead to a fall. These are the most common reasons for falls - getting fainted and being in a state of shock.
How can we identify the reason that leads to a fall 
A. For an example a male or female person at the age of 40 or 50 can suddenly fall from the chair or while standing. It can be due to a sudden heart attack.
But a person may fall for the following specific reasons too.
* If a person does not take regular food and beverages,
* If he has been mentally suffering for a while,
* A recent head injury
* Being pregnant
Persons who suffer from Diabetes can fall due to a coma when the blood sugar level goes extremely high without his/her knowledge.
When should one immediate medical treatment 
A. If the fall is due to a heart attack, we need to seek immediate medical treatment from a hospital. The patient needs to be transported to the hospital by a vehicle in the Prop Up position. If the patient was taking a drug such as TNT, it should be given to him/her (placed under the tongue). We should assure the patient that he/she will be all right and there is no reason to panic. No food or beverages should be given to the patient.
The patient should be monitored continuously while being brought to the hospital. We need to be vigilant on his/her breathing, pulse, etc and should be given artificial respiration or at least cardiac compression in order to prevent brain cells dying.
The patient should be immediately taken to the General Out <U+200B> Patient Department (OPD) of the hospital and NOT to the Accident Ward / Unit. This saves time.
How can we identify a stroke 
A. If a person falls unconscious, if he/she looks not normal it can be a stroke. If a person's appearance is not normal, the best option is seeking medical treatment immediately. If he/she cannot speak words / sentences clearly, complains about felling lifeless in one hand / leg etc, has a severe headache, the face or a side of the body shifted to one side, it can be a stroke and should seek immediate medical treatment. The symptoms differ depending on the affected area of the body. Therefore appearance of one or more symptoms needs seeking immediate medical treatment.
What is the general advice that can be given to the public 
A. All the people should undergo regular medical check-ups and find out whether they suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure or have high cholesterol level in their blood etc if they have reached middle age - may be even 30 or 40 years of age.All facilities are available free of charge at all Healthy Life Style Centres located at state hospitals island- wide to undergo screening for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, high blood Pressure etc.

Why Thomas Hardys Angel Clare is the Worst
Reading a novel is an affair of the heart. And like most confirmed bookworms, my relationship to a book is textured by emotional attachment to its characters. SomeJane Eyre, Maggie Tulliversummon my affection like old chums. Fitzwilliam Darcy What can I sayan epidemic crush always possesses some widespread appeal (it is a truth universally acknowledged, and so forth). And yet, my most passionate literary relationship is characterized neither by empathy nor by romantic whimsy. Im instead most preoccupied by an almost lunatic animosity for a singleirredeemably wretchedfictional man.
Incandescent goodness
Thomas Hardy, born on this day in 1840, introduced me to the object of my devoted loathing when I first read his 1891 novel Tess of the DUrbervilles.
I consider Hardy one of my favorite writers and count the book among those most beloved to me. Each time I weep for Tess Durbeyfield because her incandescent goodness finds no sanctuary in Hardys indifferent universeand because she has the misfortune to become entangled with one despicable Angel Clare. Dear readers, I fucking hate that guy.
If youve also read the novel and share my staunch loyalty to Tess, I suspect your own estimation of Angel Clare is none too lofty. After all, nearly every misery Tess encounters results, if not from cruel happenstance, others vanities and caprices.
Wealthy family
After her drunkard father, John Durbeyfield, learns that his family is descended from the great English family DUrbervillenow all but extincthe and his wife, a similarly callow person, send Tess to claim kinship with the last of their wealthy family.
On this errand, which Tess is mortified to perform, she encounters Alec DUrberville, a mustachioed villain who would be comical if his lust were not so dangerous. After raping Tess, she lives unwillingly as his companion until, utterly unable to bear it, she abandons him, returns home, and delivers his illegitimate childa boy called Sorrow, named deliberately by his mother before he dies in infancy.
Tess meets Angel a few years later while working as a milkmaid, and though their attraction is potent and mutual, she fears taking a husband when, according to Victorian morality, her virtue has been blemished. Yet she finally yields to him, too in love to deny herself the first ardent joy she has known. And for a fleeting moment, she believes that she is deliveredthat she has emerged, finally, from the shadow of her past.
On the night of their wedding, Angel confesses to Tess that, years ago, he had an affair in London. In turn, Tess readily confides her history with DUrberville, believingappropriately but naivelythat Angel could not possibly fault her when her sin matches his own. But he does.
Platonic ideal
Nineteenth century misogyny teaches Tess that she bears the brunt of DUrbervilles shame, and so she equates rape with Angels willful dalliance. But Angels perspective is further manglednot merely by social mores, but also by his warped mythology of women. For he has come to love Tess as a platonic idealshe is not merely a woman, but burdened with the mantle of idealized virginity. After learning that his new wife is not an untouched nature goddess he pronounces Tess dead and abandons her. Forgiveness does not apply to the case, Angel declares, as Tess begs for her new husbands pity. You were one person; now you are anotherthe woman I have been loving is not you.
Perhaps, after following my account this far, youve already raised a skeptical eyebrow. To be sure, Angel is a feckless hypocrite, but what about Alec DUrberville, Tesss rapista man who ravages the Wessex countryside in search of fresh, nave prey, and who wields his influence to indulge his obsession with Tess. I dont deny Alecs villainy: he is one grotesque and immediate cause of Tesss bevy of misfortunes. - Lit Hub

Wonder Woman breaks box office record for female director

Patty Jenkins has broken box office records for a female director afterWonder Womanhad a strong opening weekend in cinemas.
The Warner Bros/DC film, which stars Gal Gadot, earned aglobal opening weekend totalof $223m (173m), with $100.5m of that figure coming from the US. It means that Jenkins now holds the record for the biggest US opening by a female director, beating the previous$85.2m total set byFifty Shades of Greys Sam Taylor-Johnson.
Patty Jenkins
WhileWonder Womandid not quite reach the $242m total reached by Fifty Shades of Grey at the global box office, it nevertheless performed well in international markets. It debuted at number one in many countries, including China, where its $38m total made it the fourth largest opening of all time at the countrys box office. In the UK, the film took a total of 5.82m.
Wonder Womans weekend earnings comfortably puts it ahead of the lifetime grosses of previous female-fronted superhero movies, including 2004s Catwoman, whichgrossed $82mworldwide, and 2005s Elektra, which managed$57m. The film also performed better at the global box office than several other successful superhero films, including both instalments of Guardians of the Galaxy and the first two Iron Man and Captain America movies.
Unusually for a superhero film, the majority of Wonder Womans audience was female. According to theHollywood Reporter, women accounted for 52% of its audience, in a genre that, on average, is 60% male.
Wonder Woman has proved popular with audiences and critics. The film has received an A rating from the audience survey firm CinemaScore, and currently holds a93% ratingon the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. One of the few dissenting reviews came from the Guardians Steve Rose, who criticised the film for its over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot.

World Environment Day -Connecting People to Nature
The World Environment Day is celebrated around the globe today, (05) under the theme Connecting People to Nature. This years theme implores people to get outdoors and into nature, to appreciate its beauty and to think about how we are part of nature and how intimately we depend on it, says the United Nations World Environment Day programme. Canada hosts the World Environment Day official celebrations this year.
On December 15,1972, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating June 5 as World Environment Day and urging all governments and organisations in the United Nations system to undertake on that day every year, world-wide activities reaffirming their concern for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, with a view to deepening environmental awareness and pursuing the determination expressed at the Conference. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the specialized agency on environmental issues, was formed on the same day.

World Environment Day : Join race to make the world a better place!
Today is World Environment Day, WED. Also known as International Eco Day, it is commemorated each year on June 5. It is one of the principal vehicles through which the United Nations (UN) stimulates worldwide awareness of the environment and enhances political attention and action.
Since it began in 1972, global citizens have organised many thousands of events, from neighbourhood clean-ups, to action against wildlife crime, to replanting forests. This years theme invites you to think about how we are part of nature and how intimately we depend on it. It challenges us to find fun and exciting ways to experience and cherish this vital relationship.
An opportunity to sign
The aim of WED is to encourage people to become active supporters of sustainable and equitable living, to promote awareness and have an understanding that communities play a central role in changing attitudes towards environmental issues. It also exhorts us to develop partnerships that will ensure all nations and people enjoy a safer and more fulfilling future.
A volcanic eruption
The theme for World Environment Day 2017 is, Connecting People to Nature. The campaign implores us to get outdoors and into nature, to appreciate its beauty and its importance, and to take forward the call to protect the Earth that we share. Essay contests have been organised among schoolchildren in several nations to submit entries on the theme: Join the race to make the world a better place.
This observance also provides an opportunity to sign or ratify international environmental conventions. Last year the day was dedicated to the prevention of illegal trade in wildlife commemorated under the theme Go wild for life! The topic covered a diversity of areas including animals and plants that are threatened with extinction within your local area as well.
Several agencies have decided to focus on biodiversity, taking into consideration the rate of extinction of wildlife and plants. Its frightening but true: Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of plants and animals  the sixth wave of extinctions in the past half-billion years.
We are currently experiencing the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural background rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate were now losing species at 1000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day. It could be a scary future indeed, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century.
The current crisis
Unlike past mass extinctions, caused by events like asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate shifts, the current crisis is almost entirely caused by us  humans. In fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.
Because the rate of change in our biosphere is increasing, and because every species extinction potentially leads to the extinction of others bound to that species in a complex ecological web, numbers of extinctions are likely to snowball in the coming decades as ecosystems unravel.
This years Connecting People to Nature theme gives people the opportunity to experience the beauty and diversity of forms of wild flora and fauna and at the same time to remind everyone about the importance of the active fight with wildlife crime, that has broad environmental, social and economic consequences.
In Sri Lanka, for instance researchers believe poaching has helped reduce our elephant and leopard populations by up to 75 percent over the last century. While firm numbers are scarce, biologists estimate that less than 500 of the big cats remain in the island nation. Unfortunately, Asian elephants face massive threats from poaching, habitat loss and human-elephant conflict. Tens of thousands of African elephants die every year at the hands of criminals out for their tusks. A global treaty made trading in ivory illegal in 1989, but the illegal international trade in ivory has skyrocketed in the past 10 years, fuelled by demand from a growing middle class in Asia.
Dangerous international crime syndicates are often behind the trafficking of ivory and other illegal wildlife products, weakening governments and using corruption and coercion to move their goods.
Ecological catastrophes
Meanwhile, Asian elephants, also vulnerable to poaching at a smaller scale, struggle with shrinking habitat. This forces elephants into close quarters with humansoften raiding crops and sometimes injuring people, which leaves them vulnerable to retaliatory killings.
Import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species of flora and fauna should be made on the basis of special permits and certificates. Despite the many laws in force for their protection leopards are in trouble. The big spotted cats have been hunted to extinction in some areas, and their habitat is under pressure from growing human populations.
But while parks and preserves have helped save leopard and elephant habitat, the cats striking pelt and the pachyderms valuable ivory continue to make them attractive targets for poachers. While not as fashionable as they once were, a leopard fur can still fetch thousands of dollars on the black market.
Species diversity ensures ecosystem resilience, giving ecological communities the scope they need to withstand stress.
Since 1973 the annual event on June 5 is marked by campaigns in order to raise global awareness about the importance of the healthy and green environment in human lives, to solve the environmental issues by implementing some positive environmental actions as well as to make aware that everyone is responsible for saving the environment.
Wild life lovers hope to prevent such ecological catastrophes by learning more about leopard and elephant habits and answering key questions, such as how much territory the majestic pachyderms and big cats need to survive. And, eventually, they hope that people will see that a leopards skin or a pair of ivory tusks are more valuable on a living animal than they are as ornaments or in their living rooms.
Floods, and landslides - a result of reckless devastation
Sri Lanka remains in the grips of the worst flooding in 14 years, and the bad weather that has killed at least 194 people is expected to continue, according to the countrys Ministry of Disaster Management. The monsoon rains are the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003. They come after two months of drought, which had grown severe enough to warrant aid from the World Food Programme.
For thousands of Sri Lankans fleeing the floods in many cases everything has been lost. Conservationists have placed the blame on the nations recurrent flood disasters to the failure of successive administrations to adequately address environmental concerns. Over the years our forests, mangroves, wilderness, wetlands and rivers have been irretrievably destroyed. In some instances the destruction is attributed to accommodate population pressures and development. But in many cases the reason behind such reckless devastation is solely greed. This is sinful depredation of some of our most valued natural resources.
In reality, diversified ecosystems protect watersheds, local rainfall, food supply and soil. Equally importantly, our jungles, rainforests and wetlands are also a bulwark against global warming. One cannot simply fill them up, chop them down or obliterate such natural systems without running dangerous climatic risks.
Conservationists have been placing the blame squarely on extensive deforestation and the filling of thousands of acres of wetlands for our strangely altering climate that has more recently been manifesting itself in the form of droughts, flash floods, landslides and soil erosion. The result has been causing human and economic suffering on a colossal dimension. Once fashioned such misery is not easy to alleviate.
Ours has been a nation where forestry has gone mad, where our invaluable wetlands and mangroves are being treated as worthless marshland and are being filled willy-nilly for new construction development and housing. Besides, wildlife, bird and marine habitats that sustain such unique species, once destroyed can never be replaced.

Zhong Tian Construction Co to invest US$ 1 bn in SL
The Zhong Tian Construction Company Ltd of China plans to invest over US$ one billion in real estate and leisure sectors in Sri Lanka.
The company will shower over US$ 70 million in the Millennium Park to develop the center into a international entertainment hub. This will also comprise a 200 room four star hotel, apartments, shopping mall and a mini amusement park. This development is being planned with Browns Leisure which is already maintaining and operating the Millennium Park in Maradana.
Zhong Tian Construction Company Chairman Feng Zhong Wei said that they have pledged to invest over US$ 250 million for the Horton Place twin tower project, which is expected to be one of the biggest twin towers in the region. The ground breaking ceremony has already been held for this project at the former Asha Central, Army Hospital premises in Colombo 7.
The Chairman said that they have been visiting and studying the developments in Sri Lanka for the past two years and had gained much confidence in the Sri Lanka real estate sector and that was the reason they were investing large amounts in Sri Lanka. Our estimate is that today Sri Lanka is where China was 10 years ago and we see the Sri Lankan economy moving forward and we see opportunities here, Wei insisted.
The company also venturing to leisure sector has taken Palm Beach Hotel Mount Lavinia on a 10 year lease. In addition they have also taken the Palms Colombo in Kolluptiya on lease. This newly built hotel scheduled to be opened in August will be a four star property. With seven floors the hotel will have 90 rooms, a swimming pool, gym, spa, roof top bar, three banquet halls, conference facilities and many other facilities. We hope to market both these hotels with Asian Leisure, Wei further explained.
He also said that they have purchased land in Sooriyaweva Kanda and contemplates building a villa type luxury bungalows there and will also look at extending their foot print in both Galle and Kandy and were also on the lookout for two hotels with under 80 rooms.
Back in China many people like to travel to Sri Lanka mainly because of the prevailing peaceful atmosphere and due to the rich bio diversity of the country. We see this trend increasing and we are not afraid to invest even further in this segment, Wei said.
The company also has similar business ventures in Thailand which were now performing up to expectations. We have also moved to the Maldives hospitably sector with a Sri Lankan player and this joint venture resort would open next year, he added.

Paws down, car buying can be ruff. Fortunately, theres a pint-sized car dealer whos eager to help.
Introducing Brus Griffin, an adorable Brussels Griffon who you know you can trust because shes wearing a suit and tie.
The tiny dog, whose real name is Gilda, is the star of a hit YouTube video that shows her peddling cars for the imaginary Brus Griffins Motor World.
Our prices are dangerously low because I cant read! Brus Griffin boasts while posing in a used car lot. Should a dog be selling cars Probably not. Come get yours today before the government catches wind of this and shuts us down!
Brus owner, a woman named Steph who also has a second Brussels Griffon named Griff, told HuffPost that inspiration for the commercial filmed last week came after she purchased the child-sized suit for her little breadwinner from a thrift store.
I buy them outfits sometimes because its hilarious and great for the pictures, she said by email on Wednesday. It was only $4 and had already paid for itself in laughs before I even got home.
After putting the suit on the pooch - which Steph said her dog actually really liked - she said she couldnt shake off her dogs resemblance to a car salesman. As for the name, Brus Griffin, she called it just the slimy car salesman name I used.
Of course, because they say its the suit that makes the man, other videos posted on Instagram show Gilda posing as a serious, chair-swiveling attorney, with the Law and Order theme song playing in the background.
Have you been a bad dog Injured while fetching the videos captions asks. Call Brus Griffin of Griffin & Griffin Law.

[APPRECIATIONS - (05-06-2017)]
Stanley Dunuwille
Resilient heart
The 44th death anniversary of the late Rajakarunadara Dharmakeerthi Ekanayake Wasala Panditha Mudalige Stanley Jayampathy Millawa Dunuwille of Katugastota fell on May 29.
The initials SJM symbolizing the name had to be confined only to officialdom, as the casting of the horoscope by the astrologer remained at a dead end due to the situation that SJM was born on a Vesak Day and the observation of sky and planetary influence annulled such casting of a horoscope. The adoption of the alternative name SJM was the only parental via media to prevent a calamity of intense magnitude. The irony of this fiasco is a matter for conjecture, but when viewed from the point that SJM was born also in the month of May i.e. May 19, 1927, a rarity quite perceptional from a humane point of view there emanates and arises the brilliance of the intellectual thinking of supremacy of lordship we as Buddhists respect, adore and honour.
SJM's life and times as a schoolboy at St. Anthony's College, Kandy and as an adolescent, was power-packed with anecdotes, as was his public service, till his demise. During his hectic but stormy sojourn in Samara, Dickie achieved greatness in his own inimitable style. He was a daring young man who came to the rescue of the innocent and the under-privileged, often looking after the sick in hospital during nights. Leadership was thrust on him as he was fearless and forthright, having an inborn capability to command in any given situation with his acumen in militarism.
Soon, SJM made his mark as a person to be reckoned with, both, at St. Anthony's College, Kandy, where he was schooled and later on as a Post Master attached to Kandy, the CTO and the up country. He took to sports in a very big way at SACK and as a loyal public servant, deeply participating in public service sporting activities. He forced his entry as an ace swimmer, crossing the mighty Mahaweli river bordering SACK, often coming to the rescue of learners and new comers in tight situations, enjoying water bouts with his school friends in the small silent within the Mahaweli which is no more today. Cadetting was his forte during the war years, attending the Diyatalawa Camp and before long, at 14, was the SACK Sergeant Major with the enduring ability and affinity within the allied forces stationed in the College grounds. Simultaneously, he served his alma mater (SACK), astounding critics and beating seniors at will to bag prizes and trophies offered by the forces.
He entered the playing fields of Katugastota with a bang as an ace all-rounder; SJM was adept at everything and anything he pursued; brought merit both to him and the team he represented.
As a schoolboy, he played 1st XI cricket and Soccer for the College. He was also a champion athlete, a champion boxer of the light heavy weight class and above all, a commanding leader of the then Ceylon Cadet Battalion, who led all school ranks as a Sergeant Major.
His crowing glory was when he commandeered the combined Battalion of all island Schools and College at the first Independence Day Parade at Bogambara on the 4th of February 1948, taking the salute from D.S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon, which he cherished to his last days. He was such an admirer of the late Dudley Senanayake that against heavy odds, he had the courage and affinity to replace the fallen photograph of Dudley back in position and face the wrath of opportunism and opposition who were putting expediency before principle such as political time serving facing all concerned at the turn of events aftermath of the United Front victory of 1970.
SJM Dunwelle is remembered by Antonians young and old for his magnificent bowling effort 6 for 10, 2 for 27 and 28 runs in two overs against Trinity in the 1948 Trinity-Antonian big match played at Katugastota and won by the Antonians after 18 long years. St. Peters and St. Benedicts lost their encounters with SACK because of SJM's bowling.
This trinity victory is all the more great because SACK overcame hostile opposition from leading Colleges and since then, leading Colleges have faced defeats every now and then.
Antonians have never looked back and can be proud today that many Antonians have played Test Cricket for Sri Lanka with outstanding success.
Credit for this pioneering efforts goes to the then Principal late Father D.A. Roasti, the Prefect of Games Fr. D.C. Mackey, Robert Wright and Kanniath the ace footballer. The 1948 cricket Captain Lionel A. Pamunuwa deserves the highest praise along with the rest of the team for SACK's outstanding success as a leading College.
Trinity, at that time, was studded with stars like Lala Wadsworth, their Captain, who later captained the Combined Colleges Etam Eustace Rulach, batsman of the caliber of Sirimanne Pilapitiya and two outstanding personalities in terms of today's reckoning such as the later Kakashman Kadirgamar and Lakshman Jayakody.
What is morale-boosting is the fact that the later John Hallangoda, the famed Trinitian was the Antonian Coach who planned and destined the Antonian victory.
Unfortunately, there is none to vouch for SJM's outstanding herculean qualities of sacrificial acts.
An offer of alms to the Maha Sangha (Sangika Daval Dana) will be held on September 7 remembering SJM's mother, father, SJM himself and his departed brothers, sisters and relatives, at the residence of the writer at 180/2/G, Molewatte, Amunugoda, imbulgoda.

Dunstan Fernando
Natural leader
It was the 100-year birth anniversary of our father Warnakula Weerasuriyage Captain Lodwin Wilfred Dunstan Fernando of Kumbukgahamulla Group Walauwwa, Nattandiya and of St. Winifred House Walauwwa, Marawila, born in May 16, 1917. He was the only child of Warnakula Weerasuriyage William Rovinu Fernando. His mother, our grandmother, Clotilda Peiris of Moratuwa; such a pretty lady, converted to Catholicism from the Anglican Faith. She was a lady of classics and refined tastes.
Thaththi faced the reality of being a single child when his father passed away in 1928. He was only 11 years. The wealth and estates intact and well administered by Carsons Cumberbatch Co. Ltd, a Scottish company. According to the last will, at the age of 21, his inheritance in wealth and estates was gracefully handed over to him.
St. Anthony`s College, Kandy, became his alma mater; opening bat for the first eleven with M.D. Banda (Minister of Food and CommerceUNP, MP for Mathurata; DS as Prime Minister). Cricket and sports was in him and encouraged us to see through any game well. With his interest for agriculture and animal husbandry, he was lined up for his career and obtained a Diploma in agriculture from the School of Agriculture in Kundasale, Kandy.
His academia and interest saw him demarcating 10 acres of coconut land for experiments and growth of plants, flowers and vegetables. It was called the uyana. Variety in flora attracted birds and bees; it was a colourful sight. He encouraged and invited the village people and schoolchildren to see what is going on and wanted them to take an interest.
Thaththi initiated the idea of the Weekly Pola; earmarked two acres from his lands as a trial project until further. 'A place for the village to meet and people to do business' was his aim. On some Pola days, senior management from Carsons, Cargills (Scottish) were in attendance. Some of the Livestock as exhibits with links to the School of Agriculture as subject matter guided many, boosting it's acceptance as priority for the area.
His thoughts for better coconut growing through organic farming, having a grazing area, water and poonach for livestock were good enough and was brought to the notice of people and farmers alike. His own herds; 650 cattle (imported from India/Pakistan Sindh breeds added to local), 350 buffaloes, 5,000 goats, 9,000 sheep, grazing in different parts of the estate created an impact for the subject. The Nalla Waddakkiyas was magnificent. Monks at the Temple were happy to receive two of them and a Thirakkaleas a donation.
When World War ll broke out in 1939, Thaththi too, like few of his friends, joined the Volunteer Defence Force of the Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI)1940-1947present day Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI). The role of the Army and the fear of the British Administration for it's colonies, India and Ceylon, intriguing tales by him of Military intent was sometimes breathtaking. Powerful stories which many of us cared to listen, knowing now, facts were so real in the past and today, the future too, has so much to resemble of the happenings of the past.
After he resigned his commission in 1947, Thaththi entered local politics coaxed by S.W.R.D. (Minister of Local Government in DS Government ), while few of his friends in his Regiment CLI moved into National politics. Thaththi was returned un-contested at the local government elections 1949 (UNP), as the first Village Council/Village Committee (VC) Chairman of Udubaddawa VC, near Kuliyapitiya in the Kurunegala district. According to my mother, people tried to carry him, but had to put him down; this giant of a man of 6ft.7 inches.My father used his wealth, authority and influence in creating the required amenities for the village people and area; co-ordinating activities to Military precision; 'the Army matters' he had said a few times. Now and again, he would use the very liked words of his 'Ich Dien,' Germanfor 'I Serve;' the motto of the oldest infantry of the British Army; Light Infantry and the CLI/SLLI. He was proud of his Regiment CLI being the cradle of the Ceylon Army. He would keep a track of his friends: Remember your friends. Talk about them often.
Much village activities were established at the temple where he would summon the church (St. Anthony's Church in Dunakadeniya) which was donated by his father William where the Parish Priest was his cousin. He made sure to have the mosque at these meetings. Temple lands and buildings, the land for the mosque, were linked to his father's generosity: the temple which taught us the first letters of Sinhala.
The idea of monks going on Pinna-pahthe to fetch Dhanne,was not liked by my father. He persuaded Loku Hamuduruwo to accept Dhanne brought to the temple by villagers. The villagers' access to the temple became a fact. Having his paddy fields manned by Muslims, he made sure to have them provide a small quota of Wattalappan to the temple at the end of Ramadhan. Likewise, the Temple took everything, kiribath, kavum, kokkis etc, to the mosque; what it received from the village for the Sinhala and Tamil new year. Reflecting his discipline and military humour, he had once frowned on his chain-smoking cousin priest at temple discussions: Father, your lungs are full of sin.
Agricultural policy of the government was opening up the East, Gal Oya etc. My father wanted to do just the opposite, establishing livestock farms in the Puttalam District on crown lands which were getting squandered. He wanted to settle people on six months to one year contract basis, temporary stay on these lands and having them return to their respective areas in the province on a job rotation basis. The idea was to get them to start their own little farms in their areas on their return with government assistance on gained interest, guidance and knowledge. The government of the day had no objections and was fully supportive. When it came to the poor: one must look for initiatives and talent and support them, he told us.
Gentleman, honest to the core, attentive father to his children, natural leader, known for his suits from Saville Row. To impress his new bride, our mother, he was the first person to import a Riley Sports Motor Car to Ceylon in 1936. He would sing 'It's a lovely day tomorrow' and 'Up the wooden Hill to Bedfordshire' by Vera Lynn; such favourites of his and also play them on his Masters Voice gramophone. Fate in life overtook him and the latter end of his life was not a bed of roses, but he fought back well.
Sounding the 'last post,' my own duty: I have to.
May your soul rest in peace!

Guiding star
Three months have gone, since the day my beloved Thathi (father) passed away, leaving our family with a profound sense of sadness and deep shock. Thathi passed away unexpectedly on 6th of March 2017, while he was being treated for his illness at a private hospital, in Colombo. Though he was undergoing treatment for few years, he was capable in managing his work at home and had the grit and determination to move on.
During his illness, I was always at his side, ensuring that due medical care was being provided by the doctors and other medical staff, on time. As a result Thathi, did not experience any complexities during his time of ill health and I was pleased to see him leading a peaceful retirement life. As a son, I always looked after and cared for Thathi during his time of need, simply out of love and affection and never considered it as my duty to provide him with the best medical care and attention.
As a learned person, he gained much respect in the financial sector, especially amongst the professionals in the Leasing and Hire Purchase industry for his wealth of knowledge, expertise, experience and commitment displayed to uplift the profession. He held the Chairmanship of the Finance Houses Association and also the post of Secretary of the Leasing Association during his career in the financial sector. With the help of few of his reputed colleagues in the industry, Thathi was instrumental in establishing the Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management and he was also one of the most sought after resource persons (lecturer) to conduct seminars, for persons in the Finance and Leasing industry. As a career-minded individual, his dedication to his employers was recognised and appreciated by his superiors and peers. He was much loved and respected for his integrity, guidance, wisdom and even after his demise, his assistants and colleagues and those who have dealt with him speak of his legacy of honesty and transparency and recall his relationship with pleasant memories.
In spite of his busy career, he always had time for his family. His sudden demise has created an emptiness in me as he was my 'guiding star' from my childhood days. Thathi and I had a special bonding and a close relationship which cannot be explained in words and I feel that, he is still with me in my heart, guiding me on the righteous path of life. When I had questions, Thathi would always answer them. He always had answers for my questions! I should say that, it was like a 'ritual' for me and Thathi to have dinner together and ponder over the things that transpired during the day. He always used to wait for his 'Putha' to come home after work to enjoy his meal and if I do get late due to some commitment, he used to still wait for me to turn up at his bedside and say good-night to him, so that he knows I have come home safely. He used to be so fond of me that whenever I travel out of Colombo, he gets worried and keep calling every half an hour until I reached my destination.
He was very helpful to his relatives and whenever they needed his assistance, Thathi was ever willing to help them and was happy to see them doing well in their personal lives. He gained immense pleasure in assisting all who sought his professional advice and his irreparable loss is still being felt not only by his family, but by his friends, colleagues and assistants.
After the funeral, I realised that not only I had lost a parent, but my hero and teacher as well. My mind starts wondering and at times I am in deep thought as to what happened to my Thathi and why he left me. Just two days prior to his death, one day he called me from his hospital bed and said that he really loves me and he also knows that I love him a lot as well.
His loving words still keep echoing in my ears whenever I wonder as to why I could not save him this time. Like those days, I still have plenty of questions, but now nobody to answer them! Though my relatives and friends have kept on telling me to make up my mind and move on, I have realised that one of the hardest things about losing a parent is feeling that nobody understands the loss.
My dear Thathi, I will never be the same as I was before and I feel as if I am incomplete without you. We shared memories that nobody else shared, which means you knew me differently than anyone else. We were a close-knit family and you and Amma had a happy married life of 52 years together. Now, when it gets dark in the evenings, Amma and I stare at the chair in the living room and wonder as to what happened to you and we terribly miss your words of wisdom.
During the past few years, you have been telling me that according to Lord Buddha's teachings, one day, we need to leave this world in order to escape samsara and attain nirvana! However, the past three months have been hard for me to get over your death as I realised that when someone you love dies, that part of you dies a well.
When you left us, I used to cry because of the void left by your death, but now I have gradually realised, it is easier to smile at the memories. Several years ago, you told me the day you pass away to cremate within twenty four hours ,which was done according to your last wish.
Thathi, if you can see me, I want you to know that you are still guiding me and still answering my questions. I will always miss your blessings which helped me to overcome the difficulties that I faced in my life, but I know that you will always be there watching upon me. The gap that has been created is hard edged and it is something which has been chiseled by you into my life and now that you have left me, your memories are enduring.
Thathi, I am ever so grateful to you for being my father and I hope that I will meet you again in this journey of samsara once again as my Thathi, prior to attaining nirvana which will be my happiest moment.
May you attain Nibbana.
Your ever loving and grieving son,
Thusitha
Chrissie Aloysius
Founder president of Doctors Wives Association
When I received a call around 9pm that night conveying the sad news of our past president Chrissie Aloysiuss passing away, I couldnt believe it. It was totally unexpected.
The Doctors Wives Association was formed by Chrissie in December, 1985. She was keen to promote fellowship amongst all the Doctors wives and also to bring them together to work towards helping the community in the field of health care.
The very first time I met Chrissie was at a doctors wives function. I was standing in the queue to serve dinner, when I noticed a well-dressed smart lady talking to each one in the queue. As she reached me, she introduced herself as the president of this association. I told her that I was aware of its existence and would like to join. Then she invited me to their meeting. I contacted my friend Vasanthy Rajaratnam and she agreed to come with me.
As both of us walked into the room for the meeting, Chrissie welcomed us warmly and introduced us to the council members. Next minute, Chrissie proposed our names to be included into the social activities committee.
Several healthcare programmes and exhibitions were organized over the years. The Jewelerama was organized by Mallika Hemachandra in 1986, an evening together by Fashions and Music in 1988 and Barbecue Nite in 1991. These were a tremendous success and Rs. 100,000 was donated to the Sri Lanka Medical Association, Rs. 25,000 to Sevena Foster parent home, Rs. 25,000 for the UNIAID project of Colombo University and Rs. 25,000 to the institute of Neurology. The hobbies exhibition which was held in 1992 provided a forum to display the talents of the members. A book project was started in 1995pencils, pens and books were distributed to over 100 needy schoolchildren which is being continued till now.
Chrissie was very keen on helping the poor and worked enthusiastically and tirelessly by organizing healthcare, eye camps and also dental care. Spectacles, toothpastes and medicines were distributed. We used our tsunami funds to buy all the necessary equipment and distributed to several fisher folk. I am happy that I took part in all these camps.
My association with Chrissie started in 1998. A year later, I had to undergo surgery and was discharged on the third day. I was about to leave the nursing home when Chrissie rushed in a bouquet of flowers. After apologising for her late arrival, she told me that the current secretary of the association was migrating to Australia and that she wanted to propose my name to fill that vacancy. I was so surprised, I immediately told her that my sons were still small and that I had to take them to school and back and help with their home-work and also attend PTA meetings etc., as my husband Vasanth was working in the periphery and was on transfer every four years. Chrissie was expecting my refusal and replied that I had to only write and read the minutes and that she would help with addressing half of the circulars sent every year for the get-together. She just wouldnt take no for an answer.
Over the years, I got to know Chrissie very well. She was a very caring, understanding and affectionate lady. She was an excellent organiser and planned everything meticulously which made my work easier. Since I am a perfectionist too, we made a good team. Chrissie came to realize that she could rely on me to make sure everything was attended to in order to make each event a success.
Chrissie, like everyone else, had to deal with a few tragedies during her time starting with her youngest daughter Ruwanis accident at a very young age. Chrissy never left her side. More recently, her granddaughter was very ill and it hit Chrissie very badly. Being a devout Catholic, Chrissie found her strength to carry on through it all.
Our annual members get-together was a grand affair carefully planned with entertainment by the doctors families. Chrissie had written the skits for the plays and doctors and some of their wives had given their free time to make these plays a success. Chrissie organized picnics annually for the council members. She arranged the hotel, the games and also provided music for a Baila session inside the rooms given to us.
She looked after her husband Dennis so well by making sure their house was well organized, so that Dennis did not have anything to worry about. They have never been parted, except once when she had to go Australia to help one of their daughters. Reluctantly, Dennis agreed to her trip abroad. The moment she landed in Australia, there were calls from Dennis wanting to know where his clothes were etc. Chrissie took the next flight back to Sri Lanka. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband Dennis during this very sad period. We convey our deepest sympathies to their children.
Thank you Chrissie for forming our association which you managed to keep alive for 32 years. It is a great achievement, only you could have done it. There will never be another Chrissie Aloysius during our time.
May your soul rest in peace, you richly deserve it. RanjiniThuraisingham,
Jt. Secretary,
Doctors Wives Association.
