1000 more British spies to combat terrorism
UK: Britain's intelligence agencies will be given funding for 1000 extra spies to work on combating terrorist plots, the government announced on Monday.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ would be granted money for a recruitment drive as he warned "now is not the time" to scale back Britain's commitment to intelligence gathering following the suspected bombing of a Russian passenger jet.
Mr Osborne said in west London: "As the nature of war, espionage and terrorism changes - we must change with it. The internet - central to modern life - provides new ways for our enemies to plan and act against us. The threat from terrorists - from extreme ideologies - needs to be challenged head-on."
He said ministers would "substantially increase the number of people across all three secret intelligence agencies who investigate, analyse and help disrupt terrorist plots" over the next five years, adding that extremism was "poisoning minds" at home and abroad.
He said Britain's prime minister David Cameron would set out further details later this month. A government source said around 1000 extra jobs are expected. They said: "Given the increasing threats to the UK's national security, they [security services] are likely to receive one of the most generous settlements across government at the spending review".
The Chancellor spoke of the need to ensure Britain is economically secure - a concept he described as the "bedrock" of the spending review next week. He added that economic security and national security "are two sides of the same coin".

Ulagalla Organic Cooking Class
All the colours of the world
I, having heard about the legendary Ulagalla Resort set in the heart of Anuradhapura decided to book a stay so I could take a lesson in their fabulous organic cooking class, but discovered on arrival that the wild elephants had beaten her to it.
Juliet coombe
Ajith, Ulagalla's accomplished masterchef, stands gracefully over the wonderful array of colour and form that is the meal-to-be's finer trimmings. How could all this go into one meal I wonder, thinking I should perhaps paint them rather than cook them, before I'm off on a walk around the organic vegetable garden to pick what I am about to cook.
Wildlife treats
A garden surrounded by various wildlife treats like the group of peahens protecting their poults, pink exploding lilies, a monitor lizard unhurriedly hampering our progress to pick ladies fingers, a snake slithering away so fast from our noisy presence so we only see the undergrowth moving as it passes, and I learn there are wild elephants not too far away as I have been warned that the organic vegetable garden is not so abundant today owing to a midnight feast for five of them.
Ajith at hiscooking class

The entrance to the garden is marked by high poles arranged in a square, rather like the gateways to Wild West towns, with plenty to feast the eyes on behind it. There is absolutely no symmetry to this vegetable garden in stark contrast to fussy allotments, market gardens and western vegetable gardens but here, in the jungle, this feels infinitely more real and at one with nature. Different vegetables are afforded different bedding and fencing and it's almost as if the most favoured ones are given the most elaborate enclosures - such as the chilies which are set in terraced circular beds higher up than the rest, confirming its status as the most important ingredient of a vast array of Sri Lankan dishes.
At the other extreme, one random patch of gotucola, a beautiful light green explosion of colour, had no fencing or bedding whatsoever and was amoebic in shape, perhaps reflecting the status of a more lowly salad. As we passed each patch the gardeners expertly picked or sliced off ladies fingers, lemongrass, chilies, beetroot, spinach, curry leaves, limes from the trees and sweet potatoes. It was by the last of these that I was introduced to the evidence of the previous nights pillaging. Large croquet sized balls of elephant dung lay carelessly discarded amongst the muddy patches where sweet potato plants once flourished. The elephants had made no effort to disguise their oversized presence as the Buddhist philosophy allows them free access to such a garden of delights where any attempts at deterrence would probably be futile anyway.
Cooking begins
Arriving back at the hotel, Ajith adorns me with a white apron and immediately sets me to work on the cutting of vegetables into an old pan set upon a skew whiff gas hob that I think to be a deliberate means to hold the pan at a strategic angle until later on when I discover the mysterious visit from one of the other kitchen staff has resulted in the magic growing of the fourth supporting leg.
As we fill the first pan with water, salt, curry powder and sliced sweet potato for a 20 minute boil, we also start work on a portion of dhal, initially blending coconut oil with onions, curry leaves and cinnamon sticks to give off the most heavenly pungent aroma I've smelt since I can remember, reminding me that there is nothing quite like cooking freshly picked ingredients straight from the garden nearby. Ajith could see by this stage that I hadn't really entered into the spirit of the cooking class as I was juggling my camera, a notebook, the pan and the cutting knife all at once so he took over the cooking, albeit leaning across from the client side, whilst my able eight year fellow student, handled the cutting up of the various ingredients. The latter was doing a fine job until he had the idea of augmenting the ladies fingers with his own whereupon first aid was nearly called. Ajith, having realised we were unconsciously acting out a Laurel and Hardy sketch, decided at this point to cook from the usual aspect and take over the more dangerous slicing jobs, leaving only the lowly gotukola for me to cut very carefully for the next vegetable curry dish.
Little go in
Traditional cooking

This of course, was really a cunning plan on my part to get the most delicious possible meal cooked by a true master of the kitchen, whilst capturing the enthusiasm of my highly photogenic sidekick, getting his fingers into everything possible.
What struck me was how little seemed to go into each of the pans to make these delicious meals, and how much we seemed to end up with at the end. Also it appeared that within half an hour we had six fabulous dishes of curry chicken, ladies fingers tempura, dhal, a delicious lemon salad, devilled prawns and curried sweet potatoes all ready to eat. A table was set for us by the beautiful infinity pool with the monkeys and peacocks playing in the trees nearby. By now we were a party of six and everyone ate their fill with plenty left over.
Grating coconut

Ajith was the perfect gentleman, at all times reading the situation and adapting his style to suit his students. The whole journey from the plant growing in the Ulagalla organic garden to plate can be booked through www.ugaescapes.com Staying at Ulagalla and doing the wonderful cooking class that even wild elephants want to feast, I discovered during my two hour cooking class with Ajith the sheer delights of bringing plants to plate in such a beautiful setting that is a tastebud's treat as you enjoy picking the truly fresh ingredients, which is a very satisfying 'bringing of order out of chaos' experience that no-one should miss.

Apple: Don't give spies back door to read e-mails
UK: Plans to give intelligence agencies a back door to reading people's emails would fail to halt terrorists while making it easier for criminals to hack ordinary consumers, the boss of Apple has warned.
Policies that undermine data encryption would be bound to backfire, creating opportunities for hackers to steal people's private information and even commit acts of terrorism by seizing control of trains and other key infrastructure, he said.
Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, the world's most profitable company, warned in an exclusive interview with The Daily Telegraph that "any back door is a back door for everyone. Everybody wants to crack down on terrorists. Everybody wants to be secure. The question is how. Opening a back door can have very dire consequences."
He said that preventing law-abiding companies from making sure that data was properly protected would not deter criminals, who would find other ways of communicating without the authorities finding out. But it would harm consumers, who are already under unprecedented attack from hackers.
"It's not the case that encryption is a rare thing that only two or three rich companies own and you can regulate them in some way. Encryption is widely available. If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folk that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go."
Cook made the comments ahead of Britain's proposed Investigatory Powers Bill, spearheaded by Theresa May, the Home Secretary. The bill, dubbed the Snoopers' Charter by opponents, would not ban encryption but would force tech firms and service providers to help police or spy agencies hack customers' smartphones or computers if requested through a warrant.
Civil liberty campaigners fear the Bill could be used to demand that firms terminate the strongest form of "end to end" encryption, used by Apple, Facebook and others, which ensures that nobody apart from the sender and recipient can access the information.
Mr Cook, who unlike many tech executives is a leading privacy advocate, said: "We don't think people want us to read their messages. We don't feel we have the right to read their emails. We believe very strongly in end-to-end encryption and no back doors."
He said that experts in "cryptology and other people with deep knowledge of technology" agreed with his stance, which he said was not motivated by any financial gain. Even those with no interest in privacy should oppose any measures that would force companies to make communications less secure. Weakening encryption would pose a grave security risk, he said.
He added: "To protect people who use any products, you have to encrypt. You can just look around and see all the data breaches that are going on. These things are becoming more frequent."
He raised the prospect of cyber criminals and cyber terrorists hacking into the IT systems that control infrastructure and transport systems, with potentially devastating effects. He added that data and identity theft not only jeopardised people's financial security, but affected psychology and health.

About 66.9 percent of the land area in the Badulla district is prone to landslides, according to latest reports of the Building Research Institute, said Uva Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyaratne.
Vidyaratne has drawn the attention of the Uva Provincial Council and the Central Government and requested them to take measures to prevent natural calamities. He said landslides in hilly areas in Uva slopes had been a common feature. Several large scale landslides have been reported during the last few decades.
He said Sri Lanka had been included in the minor earthquake prone areas in South Asia following the 2004 Tsunami.

Building squad to defend world title vital than result - Malinga
Sri Lanka T20 captain Lasith Malinga said that winning and losing was part of the game and that he was not duly worried about the defeat at the hands of West Indies in the second T20 international but more concerned in building up a strong squad of 15 players to defend the World T20 title in India next year.
Sri Lanka lost to West Indies on Wednesday and to share the two-match series played for the Hero Cup one-all.
Sri Lanka are the reigning World T20 champs having won the final in Bangladesh against India last year.
Malinga who led Sri Lanka to that memorable win said, "Everybody likes to win but more than the result we have to look at how we can build a strong team of 15 players to defend our world T20 title in India.
"That's why we tried out several youngsters in the two games. While in the process of experimenting we will suffer losses but what is important more than anything else is that we need to pick a strong squad of players to defend the title," he said.
West Indies captain Darren Sammy said the key to beating Sri Lanka was the constant bowling changes they made that resulted in Sri Lanka being unable to build partnerships that was necessary during a run chase.
Sri Lanka chasing a target of 163 were bundled out for 139 to lose by 23 runs. "They didn't get used to any particular bowler. The plan was to give one-over spells to the bowlers and it worked," said Sammy.
"We kept on picking wickets every time they looked like building a partnership that was the key for us.
"When we played the final here we scored 130-something and defended it - that was a reminder for the guys when we went into field," Sammy said. "We had a good start. We controlled our play. They didn't get off to a flyer."
"(Lasith) Malinga hit a lot of his yorkers and so did (Nuwan) Kulasekara. They bowled really well at the end of the innings. The work done by (Johnson) Charles and (Andre) Fletcher at the top gave us that cushion - even if they bowled some good overs," he said.
West Indies opening pair put on 62 off 6.2 overs that set the tone for their final total.
Sammy was extremely happy to see his team end their tour of Sri Lanka on a winning note after having gone without a win in any of their last seven matches. "It's good to end the series on a winning note. You could see the difference after playing the first game which we still thought we could have won," said Sammy.
"But coming from a long break from T20 international shows how quickly you could learn. You could see it was a much professional effort out there.
The likes of (Dwayne) Bravo who was man of the match, (Kieron) Pollard, the senior guys stepped up. The past score here was 150, we got 30 more and we were able to defend it," he said.
For this series West Indies were without two of their experienced T20 players Chris Gayle and Lendl Simmons who were both injured.

Burglaries, thefts terrify Nugegoda residents
A spate of burglaries and thefts in Nugegoda area since the beginning of this year has left residents insecure while Police are struggling to get a grip over the situation. Police's inability to arrest the situation has come under fire by residents.
They accuse that the law enforcement authorities are idling. The most recent robbery took place two weeks ago when a house in the 6th lane of Jambugasmulla Mawatha was broken into. But culprits remain at large to date. Theft has become a common occurrence in the Jambugasmulla Mawatha, residents claimed.
Those living in nine by-lanes of Jambugasmulla Mawatha fear that their movements are being watched before thieves make a bid to rob the house.
"They enter houses strategically, in a way that they will not be caught. They rob the same house again after a period of time when they determine it's safe for them. They are one step ahead of every precaution we take," said R. Wickramasinghe, a resident of Jambugasmulla Mawatha, Nugegoda.
He claimed that the people in the area are in danger as robberies continued over the last six to seven months without any attempt to apprehend the escalating trend.
"Robbers take away money and jewellery. More than eight houses had been burgled in our area. Higher authorities should be made aware of the situation. Action should be taken to increase security measures to prevent more residents falling victim to the robbers," Wickramsasinghe said.
Residents claim that in some cases, the same house has been robbed multiple times. They highlight that thieves carefully select which house to break in.
"Most of the houses targeted were without CCTV facilities," said Indragith Udayanga, another resident of the area.
"Not all the houses have CCTV camera facilities. As all the lanes in the area are interconnected, it is easy for robbers to find their way to main roads from these lanes" he said.
The residents claim although Police respond to reports of theft, they hardly carry out further investigations. "There is no progress after", claimed a resident who wished to be anonymous. People complain to Police, but no person connected to the robbery has been arrested. I have accompanied people to the Police station several times, but there is no progress, Chanaka Sanjay, a three wheel driver said.
However, he claims that there is a lull period after a Police visit following complaints.
"But there is no end of burglaries in the area. Police should take steps to reduce it" Sanjay said.
Denying the allegations of Police inaction, OIC, Kohuwala Police I.P Mallavarachchi said a special police team has been assigned to investigate into the incidents occurring in the area.
"Complaints are made by the people, but the problem cannot be solved in one night," he said.
OIC Mallavarachchi said extra measures are being taken to reduce crime rates. The station has sought the assistance of the Police Crime Division as well, he said.
"Investigations are in progress pertaining to many robberies. Suspects with regard to the incidents will bearrested soon," he said. Mallavarachchi said police are taking measures to prevent similar incidents happening in the future. Police officers have been assigned to patrol in the areas where many incidents of crime have been reported. He said precautions will be taken parallel to the investigations.
Police Commission Chairman Profesor Siri Hettige speaking to the Daily News said that many reasons contribute to increasing incidents of crime such as theft and robbery.
However, when dealing with immerging trends unique to an area, demographic and socio-economic factors have to be considered in analysing and solving crimes, he said. The prevention and control should begin from a local level, Prof. Hettige said.
The relationship between local problems and the crimes has to be identified to find a sustainable solution. Different localities, social groups and other social problems in the locality may contribute in different ways to increase trends in crime. Therefore, crime prevention and control may differ from one area to another, he said.
"Addiction to drugs and alcohol appear to be the main causes tempting the people to commit burglaries although they are not the only causes", he said.
He explained that the process and reasons driving the people to commit robbery are many and varied. The economic situation of the people may also influence in increasing robbery, Prof. Hettige said.

General Secretary of the EPDP and Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda visited the Magazine Prison accompanied by National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganeshan to meet Tamil prisoners who launched a satyagraha campaign in prison on Tuesday.
The visit was made at the request of parents and relatives of the pioneers, said a spokesman for the EPDP. The spokesman said Commissioner General of Prisons Rohana Pushpakumara arranged a delegation of the striking prisoners to meet the visiting group at his office considering the violence Devananda had to face when he visited Tamil prisoners in May 1997.
The prisoners alleged that they had been kept in prison without trial for over five years.
They wanted the legal process expedited to obtain their release.
The spokesmen said Devananda assured the prisoners that he would try to obtain a common amnesty for them or direct them for rehabilitation by making representations to the President and the Prime Minister.
Devananda told prisoners that eventhough he was against LTTE terrorism, he would look at the predicament of Tamil prisoners with sympathy from a humanist angle.

European astronomers here to track falling space junk
An European Space Agency (ESA) team arrived in Colombo and have positioned themselves along the coastal belt in Matara, to cover the splashdown of mysterious object WT1190F.
According to Marco Micheli, an astronomer at the ESA Space Situational Awareness-Near Earth Object Coordination Centre (SSA-NEOCC), the object has been in Earth's orbit since at least 2009, and is speculated to be the rocket booster, aka 'Snoopy', from NASA's Apollo 10 mission in 1969. WT1190 is expected to splash into the Indian Ocean just 65kmoff the southern coast of Sri Lanka according to the ESA, who have predicted the object's trajectory based on data from 2012 and 2013. It is forecasted to move from North West to South East and is expected to explode at an altitude of 80km above sea level. As it is still a mysterious object, its remains are unlikely to reach the ground, but a fireball is expected once it enters the lower altitudes.
The team of ESA scientists are assisted in Sri Lanka by a team from Ruhunu University, led by Subath Amaradasa, to observe and report the end of WT1109F's journey. Remnants of the object, if intact after it punctures Earth's orbit, would be vital in ascertaining its origins.
Micheli adds, 'The object has been moving in an elongated orbit with apogee at about twice the distance of the Moon, and perigee getting closer and closer to the Earth, until the upcoming re-entry. Since 2009, it has completed dozens of orbits around the Earth, and each orbit is about a month long.
Explaining the entity's distinction from the International Space Station (ISS), Micheli states, 'Given the fact that the orbit is so long, the geometry is totally different from a pass of the ISS. The latter orbits the Earth in about 90 minutes, while WT1190F takes weeks. The current pass is actually the last part of the last orbit for this object.'
Renowned Sri Lankan Astronomer and Astrobiologist, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe of Cambridge University, UK, states, 'Fate has conspired to put our young astronomers in the world's spotlight.

Featuring the Best of Ramani Fernando Academy
Hair Art 2015 promises to be a glamorous evening of high fashion on December 5 this year. The show will be a platform for the talents of the students graduating this year from the Ramani Fernando Sunsilk Hair & Beauty Academy. Hair Art will also be a gala to celebrate ten years of styling careers in the industry.
"The Academy began with just eight students, but today there are more than 100 students graduating and more than 4000 people have studied at the Academy. The industry is getting more professional," Academy founder and renowned Sri Lankan hair-stylist Ramani Fernando said at a media briefing. The Academy boasts of having trained a student who went on to receive the prestigious City & Guilds' Medal of Excellence, an internationally recognized award for hair and beauty.
Ramani Fernando Training Managing Director Lucky Lenagala added that the Academy focused on 'quality training' and 'raising the bar' every time. Speaking about what this may mean to women and fashion in Sri Lanka Unilever Beauty Nilushi Jayatileke said that there has been growth in the beauty industry in the past two years, fashion and beauty is now taken more seriously, and that "the Sri Lankan woman is transforming."
Hair Art will feature some interesting themes this year: hip-hop street fashion, formal elegant up-do's, and fantasy styling - we were told, by fashion designer and Hair Art choreographer Senaka De Silva. We caught a glimpse of all this at the media briefing, and it was a very creative, interesting presentation. The hip-hop styles were youthful, popping with neon colours, braids and a street-punk appeal complemented by an upbeat soundtrack and enthusiastic, spunky models. Next, for elegant up-do's we saw a bold, dramatic, precariously hair-sprayed up-do on a model who glided gracefully over the catwalk in a long white figure-hugging gown, with make-up in nude and silver tones - altogether, beautiful and ethereal, coupled with ambient music. The last category - fantasy styling - lets students really let loose with their creativity. This edition, the theme for fantasy styling is 'the celestial signs of the zodiac' - as a sample, a model walked out depicting Pisces, with a long fish-tail dress, theatrical make-up and a dramatic silver fish-scale headpiece.
There was a lot of theatre in the presentations by the models and a lot of quality effort put into sculpting the hairstyles - if you're a fashion enthusiast or in fact an artist in any field, Hair Art 2015 will definitely be a show worth waiting for.

First Ever Urdu Language Center in Sri Lanka Inaugurated
The first ever Urdu Language Training Center in Sri Lanka was inaugurated today at an impressive ceremony in Colombo.
The Minister for National Dialogue Mano Ganesan was the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony. The High Commissioner of Pakistan in Sri Lanka Maj. Gen. (R) Syed Shakeel Hussain, State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation A H M Fowzie, Sri Lankan Government Ministers, Ambassadors, senior government officials, Think Tank representatives and parents/friends of the students also attended the event.
The Urdu Language Center has been established by the High Commission of Pakistan as part of Pakistan Culture, Education and Urdu Language Learning Center, and it would be imparting language training to Pakistani, Sri Lankan and other expatriate students.
The Center has been named after Baba-e-Urdu Maulvi Abdul Haq in view of his vision and extraordinary contribution towards development of the modern Urdu language. The center will provide free Urdu language education to the students as the entire expenditure of the training will be borne by the Government of Pakistan. The students would only be required to pay through their hard work and dedication.
While addressing the gathering, the High Commissioner Syed underscored that Urdu enjoys the status of being the mother tongue of millions of people who are residing in all parts of the world. Urdu also enjoys the status of being the national language of Pakistan.
He also underlined that Urdu language training will promote better understanding of Pakistan and its culture in Sri Lanka. He added that Urdu language training will not only assist the Sri Lankan students who go to Pakistan for various educational scholarships and advance learning programmes but will also prove to be a useful skill for the business community.
Chief Guest Mano Ganesan said that Urdu Centre would be beneficial for all Sri Lanka communities to learn Urdu language and observe Pakistani culture closely. He emphasized that Pakistan has remained a close friend and partner of Sri Lanka and has helped Sri Lanka in times of crisis throughout its history.
The event also features several cultural performances by the Pakistani and Sri Lankan students, which was thoroughly admired by the participants.
The first Urdu language class for Pakistani and Sri Lankan students was held on August 6 at the Pakistan High Commission Colombo. The classes are continuing since then and the numbers of students is increasing gradually.
Historically, Urdu language developed and evolved after the 8th Century AD in the subcontinent region. Urdu acquired status of lingua franca of the sub-continent during approx. 1000 year long Muslim rule over India.

How to Make Peanut Butter Cups at Home
Im not a Reeses peanut butter cup lady. Or a Kit Kat lady. And to be honest, Im not really a Snickers lady, either. What can I say, Ive always been an opinionated chocolate purist, only interested in the darkest of the dark chocolate. Maybe accented by bits of orange or espresso here and there, but never  not ever  peanut butter.
I know, I know. Some of you must be up in arms by now. But the truth is Im not a peanut butter lover at all. The flavor is too strong, and I dont know, maybe something traumatic happened to me as a little girl that had to do with peanut butter. I have no clue.
However, my boyfriend Eric loves it, so I figured Id make him homemade peanut butter cups for him. My version is larger than a store-bought cup and is filled with ground espresso, chia seeds, flax seeds, and bittersweet dark chocolate. The thing is, I could NOT stop eating them. Now I believe I understand why they are a classic pair.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups Makes 9 extra-large cups
1.5 cups of Trader Joes flax and chia seed peanut butter 1 heaping cup of powdered sugar 1 10-oz. bag of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips Your favorite ground espresso or coffee for sprinkling
Special equipment: 9 foil cupcake liners
Method
* Melt the chocolate chunks in the microwave using a microwave-safe bowl (it should only take around 90 seconds). Be careful not to burn the chocolate.
* Line your cupcake liners with a bottom layer of chocolate, about 2 teaspoons worth. (It should be just enough to coat the bottoms.)
* In a separate bowl, mix together the peanut butter and the powdered sugar. Then separate the peanut butter dough into nine equal balls, and flatten them in your palm. Place them on top of the bottom layer of chocolate inside the liners. (Its OK if the patties touch the sides of the tin. This will make the cups looks more homemade and beautiful, because once you unwrap them, youll get to see bits of peanut butter oozing through the sides.)
* Cover them each with the remaining melted chocolate, sprinkle them with freshly ground coffee or espresso beans, and then let them sit at room temperature to harden.

IFFC opening dinner
Hameedia recently hosted the opening dinner for the International Film Festival of Colombo for the second consecutive year. The festival took place from November 6 - 11 and was attended by a distinguished gathering of renowned actors, actresses, filmmakers, filmgoers and critics from around the world.
The opening event brought together members of the Film Directors' Guild, festival participants and audience members in an effort to celebrate a new era of Sri Lankan and international cinema. The International Film Festival of Colombo was launched in association with the Okinawa International Movie Festival of Japan, to further promote the development of the film and cinema industry in Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lankan cinema has gained recognition at various independent festivals, the country had not been able to establish an effective film festival of its own. In order to fill this void, the International Film Festival of Colombo was launched to help take Sri Lankan cinema to new heights.
"It was a great honour for us to host the opening dinner for the International Film Festival of Colombo, for the second year. Hameedia has continuously set the benchmark in the fashion industry and is recognized as the leading menswear specialist in Sri Lanka.
"We have a strong association with many international and local events and felt truly proud to extend our support to this important festival. Fashion like cinema is an art and we remain committed to supporting the development of the arts in Sri Lanka and gaining international recognition for our local talent and creativity", Fouzul Hameed Managing Director Fouzul Hameed Hameedia stated.

ISIS Jihadi John targeted in US airstrike  Pentagon
The notorious Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi, better known by the nickname Jihadi John, has reportedly been targeted by a US airstrike in Syria, US officials said. The Pentagon is still accessing the results of the assault.
The airstrike allegedly targeted Emwazis vehicle near the Syrian city of Raqqa  the self-proclaimed capital of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL).
We are assessing the results of tonights operation and will provide additional information as and where appropriate,Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told the media.
The Pentagon is still trying to determine whether Jihadi John was killed in the airstrike.
Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John, first appeared in an online video showing the murder of US journalist James Foley in August 2014.

He was subsequently shown in other videos of further IS beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, UK taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter Kassig.
In each of the clips, Jihadi John appeared wearing his signature black robe, with a black balaclava covering his face.
In August, Emwazi threatened to return to the UK with the Khalifa (the leader of the caliphate) to cut heads off. The footage was said to be the first glimpse of the IS militant since he appeared unmasked in February.
In February 2015, the British Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to do everything the UK could to track down Jihadi John.
When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, with the security services, with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action,Cameron said at the time.
Born in Kuwait, childhood friends of the 27-year-old said he spoke little English when he arrived in the UK in 1993. He was the only Muslim pupil in his class at St. Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London.
He regularly attended a mosque with his parents and five siblings, as well as embracing the British culture of his classmates, one source said.
The British authorities first came into contact with Emwazi in 2009 after he was stopped during a post-graduation safari trip to Tanzania. They claimed he had links to the Somali Islamist militant group Al-Shabab.
According to advocacy group CAGE, which was in contact with Emwazi for two years before he disappeared, he was subsequently denied passage to Kuwait several times. They also claim MI5 tried to turn him into an informant.(RT.com)

Is James Bond more moral than a drone
US: One of the hallmarks of the last two James Bond movies, "Skyfall," released in 2012, and "Spectre," which arrived in theatres last weekend, has been the way director Sam Mendes has tried to reckon with who 007 might be and how the agency that employs him might operate in the context of the war on terror, mass surveillance, drone strikes and increasing government oversight on these issues.'
It's always an open question whether action movies, which depend on lots of cheerful mayhem for their appeal, can actually mount coherent critiques of national security. But though "Spectre" badly wants to have something to say, the swipes it takes at mass surveillance and drone programmes contribute to the film's overall hollowness.
In "Skyfall," the oversight question was whether individual agents, with all their idiosyncrasies and potential for failure, were more trouble than they were worth in a modern era. "We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows," Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) lectured M (Judi Dench), insisting that she submit to oversight after James Bond (Daniel Craig) failed to stop the theft of a list of agents and their cover identities, followed swiftly by the bombing of M's offices.
"It's as if you insist on pretending that we live in a golden age of espionage, where human intelligence was the only resource available," sniffs a priggish MP (Helen McCrory) at the resulting hearing, calling M's worldview "old-fashioned" and "reckless."
M's response is that you need individuals and human intelligence to capture the individuals who present threats to world security. "I suppose I see a different world than you do, and the truth is that what I see frightens me," she tells the committee. "I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us. They don't exist on a map, they're not nations. They're individuals. Look around you.
Who do you fear Can you see a face A uniform A flag No. Our world is not more transparent now, it's more opaque."
Her point is made for her when Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent with a murderous grudge, crashes the hearing and starts shooting. It's an event that also absolves "Skyfall" from having to reckon with the ways that office workers rather than field agents might be able to track and analyze a hacker like Silva.
The Bond franchise's engagement with present debates about national security occupies more of "Spectre," though to less - and less coherent - effect.
Mallory has taken over for the deceased M and finds himself in a bureaucratic battle with C (Andrew Scott, the Moriarty of "Sherlock," used to less effect than he might have been), who wants to create a multinational surveillance system and end the double-0 programme.
"My door is always open, 007, for my employees," C tells Bond with great condescension toward the beginning of "Spectre," echoing the rhetoric Mallory, who took over M's job, has since abandoned. "This is the beginning of a new age in British intelligence. We're going to bring things out of the dark ages and into the light."
The discussion of security policy proceeds from there along two tracks. In the first, "Spectre" suggests that government reliance on surveillance plays into the hands of potentially evil data-hoarding corporations. And in the second, the film suggests that someone like James Bond is ultimately more moral than a drone program because he can exercise moral authority and is closer to the facts on the ground. Neither amounts to much.
"Spectre" doesn't really have thoughts on privacy or the unnerving ends to which a more benign government could put large stores of data. Instead, the movie's ideas mostly come down to a sentiment M voices early in the movie. "I know surveillance is a fact of life. It's how you use it and who's using it that concerns me," he tells C. Surveillance technology is bad when bad people use it. It's dandy when it means Q (Ben Whishaw) can put nanobots in Bond's blood to track him in ways with satisfying operational implications, or when it means that M can outflank C (who, of course, turns out to be working for the bad guys) and tell him smugly, "Not a good feeling being watched, is it"
The argument that James Bond himself is a more morally sophisticated tool of the British government than drone strikes doesn't advance further. "To pull that trigger, you have to be sure," M argues. "A license to kill is also a license not to kill." He suggests that double-0 agents have to look the people they kill in the eye, which is true, but, perhaps wisely given Bond's body count, doesn't argue that 007 can avoid collateral damage that drone strikes cannot. All of this adds up to a sequence in which Bond decides not to kill Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz), a friend of his boyhood who has since grown into the antagonist in "Spectre" and the architect of C's surveillance plan. I suppose it might be a morally powerful moment if Bond hadn't been under the impression earlier in the film that he'd blown up Oberhauser, his spy facility and a large number of Oberhauser's associates. And it's sapped further by the fact that as Bond stands over Oberhauser on a bridge, rafts of British armed servicemen are closing in on the wounded villain.
This isn't a hard choice Bond is facing here, where he might have to kill Oberhauser or risk his escape. If Bond shot Oberhauser under these circumstances, he'd just be a murderer.

A. Well I think theres the kind of love that you have in creating something which is also gives a very nice feeling at all times. I like cooking, innovations and following new trends always. Modern cooking inspires me to a great deal.
Q. What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen
A. Everything based on how much you can imagine, you have to understand what guests need by looking at them. It is not an easy job to do. We are working with many cultures and traditions. Its a great feeling to serve different people, cultures and many traditions.
Q. Who is your biggest critic
A. Me. Before presenting a dish to anyone outside one must be satisfied with their own creation. If Im not happy with what I make no one else would be able to enjoy it.
Once Im through with it then only Ill consider letting someone else try. Im a kind of a perfectionist and prefer everything to be in line with required standards.

Q. How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen
A. I will personally go and talk to the guest and check what went wrong. Then redo the dish according to their wishes - maybe it didnt go with their pallet because its very difficult to satisfy everyone with food.
But having dishes returned back to me is very rare.
Laap Moo (Pork Salad)
Q. When at homedo you cook or do you let your partner take control
A. I love my mothers cooking, no one can beat that!
Q. If you were not a chefwhat would you be today
A. Naturalist. Because I love nature especially bird watching.
Q. Of all the places you worked at what are your greatest memories of them
A. That will be in Laos. I was part of a new hotel opening, so at first I had to learn the language, it was a big challenge for me as there was only just few weeks left.
I had to do everything by myself, I did it very successfully accomplishing the task to the desire of the management and that is a great memory in my life and kind of a milestone.

Mannar residents demand Tamil prisoners' release

A group of residents in Mannar and politicians held a demonstration opposite the Mannar Kachcheri on Tuesday demanding the release of Tamil prisoners held in custody. Wanni District MP Selvam Adaikalanathen who joined the protesters said the government's failure to release the prisoners before the Deepavali festival as promised earlier was most regrettable.

Meteor monitoring network to be set up in Abu Dhabi
UAE: The UAE Space Agency has announced a joint venture to set up a meteor monitoring and filming network that will provide astronomical reports and data around meteor and satellite movements in space.
The deal with the International Astronomy Centre will witness the setting up and management of the network, to include a number of stations in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and the Western Region of the country.
The project is expected to be ready before the end of next year. The network would consist of a number of cameras that film the meteors in space that then provide video clips, a statement released here said.
Each station contains two cameras, the first one contains a lens known as 'fish eye' which covers the sky with a wide angle and the second has a narrower vision.
The 'fish-eye' lens will allow the camera to capture the greatest number of meteors appearing in the sky but the results of the analysis of the captured video clips may be less accurate, while the narrow lens will collect a smaller number of shots but the results of the analysis will be more precise for a clearer picture the meteors and asteroids.
The Agency said this joint project will provide substantial astronomical reports and data around meteor and satellite movements in space, including determining and tracking their coordinates, all of which will help support the dedicated scientific research being carried out in this field.
As part of the agreement, at least three monitoring stations will be built with the exact locations of each to be confirmed. Each station will contain special technology dedicated to space monitoring and there will be command and control centres set up that will receive information and analysis including mechanisms for the presentation of results.
The agreement states that the UAE Space Agency will be the representative for the UAE government with regards to issues of funding and supervision of the project, which was proposed by the International Astronomy Centre in Abu Dhabi.
Both parties hope that, through this agreement, the project will help raise awareness on space matters and meteor monitoring amongst students and citizens.
This project will help contribute to raising awareness and the education of student and academic institutions around the topics of astronomy and space, Dr. Mohammed Al Ahbabi, Director General of the UAE Space Agency said.
Khalfan Al Nuaimi, CEO, International Astronomy Centre said this is a key strategic project that will contribute to supporting the state towards developing the space sector and building a base of statistics and results that will without a doubt support the academic and research sectors.

National reconciliation and transitional justice
Hindus celebrated the Deepavali on Tuesday. Issuing a message on that occasion President Maithripala Sirisena said that "May the light of Deepavali lighten up hearts of all individuals with a collective yearning for reconciliation".
National integration, reconciliation, unity are laudable objectives. Almost approve these objectives at least verbally. However, mere pronouncement of the objectives would not lead to their achievement. How to proceed there from the status quo that exists now What strategies should be implemented and what mechanisms should be used to reach there What measures are necessary that would ensure the realization of the objectives So far we have been unable to answer these questions. It is a different matter whether this failure is due to ignorance or willful neglect
Those who hold the reins of Government always say that it is not that easy to ensure reconciliation and achieve national reconciliation after a three decade civil war and over half a century of growing estrangement, hatred and clashes among national communities. Perhaps they are correct. Yet has any genuine effort been made to do so
Human rights violations
Human rights violations may and do occur during a war. Reconciliation is impossible without establishing accountability, ensuring non-repetition of such incidences, ensuring justice and reparations to the victims, payment of compensation and a host of other measures. Actually international experience has provided a methodology to effect such changes. In brief it is called transitional justice. The Tamil National Alliance in a statement expressing their approval for the Resolution on Sri Lanka co-sponsored by the United States and Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed their hope that transitional justice would be ensured for the Tamil people.
It is obvious that expecting transitional justice is not the same thing as bifurcation of Sri Lanka. Moreover, it is an expectation of justice within a united Sri Lanka. In other words it is a healthy alternative to separation.
Human society has traversed a long way to reach the present level of civilization. Hence customs and practices of the tribal society are inappropriate today. Then the defeated were killed in tribal clashes. It was also unavoidable due to the low level of development under which no one could produce a surplus over their immediate necessities of life. Unfortunately we have in our society some with tribal instincts and desires akin to those of the late K. M. P. Rajaratne who wanted to wear shoes made from the skin of the last remaining Tamil in the country. These obscurantist forces should be defeated for the good of the society.
Transitional justice means settling accounts with the past by a society that has inherited large-scale human rights violations. This is to be done through a series of processes and mechanisms designed to ensure accountability and justice, moral and material reparations and payment of compensation to the victims and seek truth. It also includes institutional reform and public apologies as well as steps toward memorialization.
There is, however, no single prescription that would cure all the ills of such a society. The solutions will be unique since the economic, political, social, cultural conditions as well as historical experience of different countries would be naturally different.
National reconciliation
The Human Rights Council Resolution on Sri Lanka adopted in Geneva recently contains proposals to ensure transitional justice. It has outlined several measures and processes that would lead to transitional justice.
On the other hand, whether the United Nations or foreign countries recommend or not transitional justice processes and mechanisms are imperative if national reconciliation is to be achieved. We should adopt such practices and measures to ensure justice to our own citizens who are victims of human rights violations due to the war or other causes, to develop fraternal relations among all peoples inhabiting our land and to ensure a stable peaceful climate for the development of the country. Hence it is undoubtedly reactionary to reject or ignore an investigative mechanism.
There is no unanimity in our society on the nature of the investigative mechanism that should be set up. The extremists in the Sinhala community reject any investigation. Some others are opposed to an international investigation on the grounds that it violates our sovereignty and is intended to make our country a satellite state to be used in their geo-political strategies. On the other hand a majority of the Sri Lankan Tamil population have no faith in a domestic investigation since their experience of such previous investigations was negative. That is why they clamour for an international investigation. What is proposed is a mechanism half way between these polar opposites. That is the basis for the highly vocal debate on its so-called hybrid nature. Actually what is proposed is more a domestic investigation with international technical support than a hybrid mechanism.
The need for international technical assistance arises from the weakness of our justice system and the necessity of its updating to modern international standards. Such assistance is not foreign to all developing countries. Whatever the assistance received legislation is a prerogative of our Parliament which alone could enact laws. Hence there is no question of any infringement of sovereignty as alleged by chauvinist elements.
There is also an objection to foreign funding of the investigative mechanism on the ground that he who pays the piper also selects the tune. Thus they allege that it is not the national interest that would be served by such a mechanism. It is well known that the IMF when granting assistance not only subjects the recipient countries including ours to their financial discipline but also oversees the use of the funds granted. No one talks of national interest or sovereignty. Why this hypocrisy
Transitional justice is for all victims of human rights violations irrespective of their racial or religious differences. For example, it covers all victims of abductions or involuntary removal of persons. However, it is obvious that an absolute majority of victims are Tamil. This arises from the nature of the war itself.
Take another example. The Geneva Resolution also envisages a repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and a revision of the Emergency Regulations. These laws apply to all citizens and have been applied so. Hence heir repeal would benefit all communities. What is strange is the behaviour of politicians who object to such revision or repeal despite shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the people.
Political prisoners
Finally it must be mentioned that both the Government and the public have paid scant attention to the proposals contained in the Geneva Resolution other than that of recommending an investigative mechanism. There is hardly any discussion on the Truth Commission, reparations, compensation to victims and institutional reform etc. Even in the case of the investigative mechanism the politicians only parade their so-called success in averting allegations against certain individuals. They seem to be more concerned about the fate of few individuals who had the possibility of being indicted rather than on the fate of the mass of victims whose human rights were violated. Such behaviour on the part of government politicians could lead to the growth of scepticism about the usefulness of the proposed investigation. Why is it that any sympathy and fraternity of the rulers towards the victims is not visible in the horizon
One incident could explain how this scepticism grows. Take, for example, the question of Tamil political prisoners. Responsible Ministers promised their release before the Deepavali. Even the president referred to a similar intention. Deepavali is over. The political prisoners are still languishing in prison. In the meantime the chauvinist Opposition claim that these prisoners are LTTE leaders which is far from the truth.
Several actual leaders of the LTTE are freely roaming the streets either rehabilitated or not. It seems that the Government leaders are also being influenced by the chauvinist propaganda. They seem to be on the defensive rather than fight chauvinism aggressively. Some of them seem to compete with the chauvinists in promoting a so-called patriotism. Those that are in prison on account of their political beliefs and activities are prisoners of conscience. They are political prisoners who cannot be categorized with ordinary criminals. Their release is a political act and not a legal one. There are previous examples of such political decisions. LTTE and other political detainees and prisoners were released earlier also on political grounds. There is no ground for hesitation and vacillation. Release of political prisoners would contribute positively to the development of national reconciliation and unity.

Nina L'Extase now in the island
Nina Ricci stands by women through their "revolutions." Anticipating their desires, an instinctive and mysterious presence; an understanding feminine voice that makes each Nina Ricci woman an exceptional person revealed only to herself.
Every creation of Nina Ricci is an ode to femininity. Nina Ricci fragrances reach out, full of poetry, to the very core of a woman's sensuality. In every era, an aspiration and a dream are revealed.
The House of Nina Ricci introduced its first fragrance in 1948, a great classic and a spicy floral fragrance whose modernity and balance still surprises over half a century later.
Nina by Nina Ricci, a fruity floral fragrance introduced in 2006, explores the imagination of a young girl, balanced between fairy tales and first attraction. A quest for femininity that is as mischievous and as tempting as forbidden fruit. A woman in the making.
With this new perfume - L'Extase - Nina Ricci opens a new chapter, setting free a new feminine dream. A chapter that is both legitimate through its link to womanhood and bold through its expression.
With this new creation, Nina Ricci embraces the dream of a woman in tune with her most secret desires. A woman of her time, she asserts the right to experience pleasure with all her senses. The pleasure of being surprised, aroused and overwhelmed. Femininity filled with sensuality. To be herself - incandescent, free, determined - a woman's erotic dream an imaginary and carnal voyage to the core of her being, all the way to ecstasy.
Free and instinctive with an absolute sensuality, Laetitia Casta is the epitome of French chic. A figure, an appeal, a uniquely photogenic presence, with a face that is never as beautiful, whether in Fashion or on film, as when it is bare, without artifice. For this new Nina Ricci dream, she invites women to set free their desires, experience their pleasures and deliver themselves to ecstasy.
Memorable and with a clear identity, this first Francis Kurkdjian creation of Nina Ricci is evocative of a woman's desire. A carnal portrait - a flowering of the senses. Two accords, powerful and mysterious, chase and echo one another. Barely Rose is built around a bouquet of white petals, highlighted with natural roses and structured with pink peppercorns, like a satin caress. Then Musky Shadow is revealed, intoxicating and arousing, with notes of benzoic Siam and Virginia cedar subtly caught up in a breath of musk and amber. L'Extase, an incandescently modest Eau de Parfum with a genuinely erotic signature.
The bottle of L'Extase is modelled on a couture clutch, one of the House's iconic accessories. It is a mysterious glass envelope in shades of dark mauve, the gold detailing and delicate black satin ribbon with the signature plate all place L'Extase boldly in the line of the great Nina Ricci perfumes. The outer box wears a powdery pink texture, decorated with the signature plate and a black ribbon lined with gold. The black inside reveals the promise of L'Extase: "Liberate your fantasies".
This new perfume is available at The Parfumerie - the number one name for perfumes, cosmetics and skin care.

Obama congratulates Myanmar on polls
MYANMAR: Myanmar said Thursday President Barack Obama had congratulated the nation on holding "free and fair" election, as the government and army chief promised a smooth transition of power with Aung San Suu Kyi's party edging towards victory.
The country has been dominated by the military for half a century through direct junta rule and since 2011 by a quasi-civilian government run by its allies.
But Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) is on the verge of tipping the balance of power after capturing more than 85 percent of seats declared so far from Sunday's election -- a huge stride in the party's long democracy struggle.
Obama "called President Thein Sein this morning to congratulate him and the government for successfully holding a historic free and fair general election," Myanmar's Information Minister Ye Htut said on his official Facebook page.
The American leader has thrown his weight behind Myanmar's reform process and its pro-democracy figurehead Suu Kyi, visiting the country twice since the end of outright military rule in 2011.
Myanmar President Thein Sein
He has urged the country to tackle religious intolerance and promote full democracy. He has also highlighted the plight of the ethnic Rohingya Muslims, tens of thousands of whom were excluded from voting.
In his call, Obama told his counterpart to be "proud of.. the milestone election" and praised "the president's brave reforms", said Ye Htut, a close Thein Sein aide.
There was no immediate confirmation of the call by the US State Department.
By Thursday morning the NLD had swept up 273 seats, 56 short of an outright majority. It is almost certain to smash through that marker, with more official results due to be released on Thursday. In statements released via Facebook, Thein Sein and the powerful army chief Min Aung Hlaing congratulated Suu Kyi's party, vowed to respect the poll result and work with the new government.
The army chief repeated his position to military top brass, vowing "co-operation with the new government during the post-election period," according to a statement posted on his Facebook page Thursday.
Suu Kyi on Wednesday called for national reconciliation talks with the army chief and Thein Sein, stressing the need for a peaceful transition.
Many NLD supporters remain deeply suspicious of the army and its parliamentary allies, who are notorious for political sleight of hand and crackdowns on democracy movements that have left hundreds dead and thousands jailed.
Suu Kyi's party won a 1990 election by a landslide only for the army to ignore the result and tighten its grip on power.
In an indication of the days and weeks of manoeuvring through Myanmar's treacly politics that lie ahead, NLD spokesman Nyan Win said the call for talks was "our first move... to help a smooth transfer of power."
- Ruling party battered -
While its political proxy, the USDP, faces annihilation at the polls, the army has its stake in future carved out under a constitution it wrote.
It is gifted 25 percent of all parliamentary seats, as well as control of Myanmar's security apparatus -- meaning it will retain immense practical powers as a counterpoint to the NLD's popular mandate.
Suu Kyi's own path to power is also blocked by the 2008 constitution that bars anyone with foreign children -- or husband -- from the presidency.
Her sons are British as was her late husband -- who died in Britain while she was under house arrest in Myanmar.
'Mother Suu', as she is affectionately known, has said a democratic government would not seek to punish historic abuses by the military and a large parliamentary majority would increase her leverage against the army bloc.
But ahead of elections she struck a defiant note, saying she would take a position "above the president" in the event of an NLD win.
Now her party is poised for power it is likely she will put forward a proxy for the role, a move which could set her on collision course with the army.

Platini not among 5 candidates approved to run for FIFA president
GENEVA: FIFA on Thursday approved five candidates to stand in February's vote to replace Sepp Blatter as president of world football's governing body, but Michel Platini has not yet made the list.
The five who met the qualifications following a series of integrity tests were: Prince Ali Al Hussein, Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, Jerome Champagne, Gianni Infantino and Tokyo Sexwale, a FIFA statement said.
The candidacy of Platini, the suspended head of European football who had been the favourite to succeed Blatter, will be examined once his 90-day suspension by FIFA's ethics committee is over.
The only candidate to be disqualified after receiving provisional approval was Musa Bility, the head of the Liberian football association.
The Ad-hoc Electoral Committee did not admit the candidature of Musa Hassan Bility, in view of the content of the integrity check report relating to him," the statement said.
FIFA said it had explained the reasons for disqualification privately to Bility, but it would not make the specifics public.
The race is thought to be wide open given Platini's potential ethics violations, including a probe over a murky $2 million payment he received from FIFA in 2011. His suspension triggered a flurry of activity with the powerful Asian football chief Sheikh Salman, former FIFA official Champagne, South African anti-apartheid campaigner Sexwale, UEFA general secretary Infantino and Bility all throwing their hats into the ring.
The race is likely to be heavily shaped by whether Platini is ultimately admitted, with Infantino indicating he would stand aside if his UEFA boss qualifies for the vote. - AFP

World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims 2015
Remembered with affection, sorrow and vigil
The Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, first held in 1993 in the United Kingdom and organized since then by non-governmental organizations in a number of countries, was created as a means to give recognition to victims of road traffic crashes and the plight of their loved ones who must cope with the emotional and practical consequences of these events.
On October 26, the United Nations adopted a Resolution which calls for governments to mark the third Sunday in November each year as World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Observation of this day provides an opportunity to draw the public's attention to road traffic crashes, their consequences and costs, and the measures which can be taken to prevent them. The day also provides an opportunity to remind governments and society of their responsibility to make roads safer.
Road crashes as we know are never any pleasurable memories, especially to the victims and their families. The victims or their deprived families do not need to remind themselves the gruesome memories that they have undergone. By hosting this day we hope to honour the deceased and to acknowledge the society. In this manner we believe that the awareness on road accidents will increase in our country.
Sri Lanka joined as this global event in 2014 with the spearheading of National Council for Road Safety along with the active participation of Sri Lanka Police, RDA, WHO and other responsible institutions.
Imagine the chaos that erupts in a family once the sole breadwinner perishes or is permanently crippled for the rest of their life. No compensation can yield them light from the grave they have fallen. No one can bring happiness back to their family hearth. Their drawbacks and adversities will be beyond renovation. With a moment's mistake, many will be tormented for ages. Therefore as responsible citizens and far more being humans, we must think again before we start speeding or losing our attention on the road, for it is not only our lives that we put into stake, it is others as well.
Nearly 3400 people perish per day due to road accidents and it totals up as 1.3 million per year. Also, nearly 30 to 40 million injuries record up due to road accidents, 500 children perish per day due to road accidents.
Existing system of accident management
Speaking about the Sri Lankan context, nearly six to seven people perish per day, but as of the records of 2014 and 2015, it has risen to seven to eight per day. Also nearly 2500 people perish per year while tens of thousands are injured due to road accidents in Sri Lanka.
When the facts and figures are subjected to a thorough study, one can observe that the accident fatalities in Sri Lanka fluctuate at random. For an instance deaths due to road accidents have reduced over 2012 and 2013, however, 2014 shows an increase once again.
This is a clear indication that the existing system of accident management can be improved for betterment. In the global context, developed countries possess a Sustainable Scientific Methodology for the minimizing of road accidents. By the introduction of such a system, Sri Lanka too can achieve a conspicuous result for their dedication.
Out of the fatalities in the global context, nearly 92 percent of deaths are claimed by the middle income and low income countries while only the rest 8 percent is accounted by developed countries. However what's notable is that 47 percent of vehicle registrations are claimed by the developed countries despite their very low fatality rate.
A notable example I would like to cite is Sweden, in 1997 Sweden marked 541 as the death toll per year, but in 2010 it was reduced to 270, Japan, another large consumer of motor vehicles topped 16, 705 fatalities in 1970, however by 2011 it was cut down drastically to 4611. What is notable is that the vehicle consumerism of these two countries increased even though the accident rate decreased.
Here I would like to cite an example from Vietnam, Vietnam has a GDP of 2,052.3 USD which falls acutely below the 3,631.0 USD (based on 2015 World Bank Report) of Sri Lanka, However Vietnam succeeded in curbing the road accidents because they were able to initiate an integrated scientific methodology in 2008 which received the participation of all responsible institutions of that country. Thereby their deaths per ten thousand people shows a consistent reduction which shows that their low cost, high efficient system is conspicuously successful.
'Safety is our responsibility'
As road users, we all have a responsibility; I believe that 'Safety is our responsibility'. Thereby every time an accident happens all the parties involved have a degree of responsibility, however it must be well understood that the singular participation of a party cannot address this issue properly, however with the widespread participation of all responsible stakeholders involving personalities and institutions can make this seemingly impossible task, a possibility.
Developing countries like ours vaguely identify that road crashes pose a great threat to the well-being of the society. This has been the historical error we've been doing for ages. We must open our eyes at this inevitable fact and contribute to abolish this threat, because "Together Everyone Achieves More".
For an instance, apartheid and slavery were man-made errors, but we abolished them successfully and today we stand on a world platform common to all. Smallpox was eradicated from a stage where it was an epidemic which frightened the hearts of many. But today we have changed the once fearful eras into peace. This is because the entire mankind united to change it, not alone but together, as one.
Also it should be noted that the society has a massive role to play when it comes to road safety. The civil society must be courteous enough to obey the road rules and support the government and the institutions to carry out this manoeuvre.
Since 2011 to 2020 was named as the "Decade of Action for Road Safety", we must all, as individuals and institutions, join hands and work towards one goal. I believe this is possible once a solid Action Plan is drafted and carried out. Also beyond all, I believe that this dream demands one critical requirement. All the individual institutions who work for road safety must get together and create an Integrated Network where all of them will cooperate and coordinate in their endeavours. If this is enacted, I believe that we can achieve the Safe Road we all dream. If Vietnam did it, why can't we. The Resplendent Land, do it

Resettlement not taking place adjoining Wilpattu, says AG
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that resettlement does not take place adjoining Wilpattu National Park.
State Counsel Manohara Jayasinghe appearing for the Attorney General made these remarks consequent to a writ petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) which sought an order to quash the clearing of the Wilpattu National Park forest and constructing a housing project adjoining the National Park.
State Counsel Jayasinghe said the people displaced during the war had been resettled at their original places.
He said resettlement does not continue adjoining the Wilpattu National Park.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal President Justice Vijith Malalgoda directed the respondents in the petition to file objections regarding the petition before January 7.
The CEJ filed the writ petition through counsel Ravindranath Dabare and Nilmal Wickramasinghe and named Conservator General of the Forest Conservation Department, Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Director General of the Wildlife Department, Commissioner General of Lands, Commissioner General of Archaeological Department, Mannar District Secretary, Rishad Bathiuddeen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Environment and Mahaweli Development and the Attorney General as the respondents.
The petitioner stated that 2,000 hectares in the forest complex adjoining Wilpattu National Park (Northern Sanctuary of Wilpattu National Park and Maraichukkaddi /Karadikkuli Reserved Forest Stands west ward of Wilpattu blocks II and IV) has been cleared, divided into plots, paved roads and unauthorised settlement established making irreparable damage to the whole environment and the Eco system and wildlife habitats.
The petitioner stated that approximately 1,000 hectares of forest in Madu, Periyamadu and Sannara rea which is part of the Forest complex (Madu Road Sanctuary and Madu road Reserved Forests) has similarly been destroyed for settlement.
The petitioner stated that around 1,500 families have been illegally settled in cleared areas belonging to Maraichukkaddi /Karadikkuli Forest Reserve and in the forest complex of Madu Road reserve and Madu road sanctuary which come under the purview of Forest Ordinance No. 02 of 1937 as amended.
The petitioner stated that in several plots of land, approximately 50 acres in the Northern sanctuary of Wilpattu National Park, which come under the purview of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, permanent and temporarily houses and other structures have been erected, cleared for road construction.
The petitioner has information that Minister Bathiudeen has been involved in mobilising the deforestation of these forest reserves and establishing settlements under the pretext of resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs).
The petitioner sought an order in the nature of Mandamus ordering the first respondent to take action against the illegal removal of forest cover and reinstate the forest lands to the forest reserve and organise forest replanting programmes and in terms of the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No.16 of 1907.

Rest in Peace: Kalu Chooti
I used to refer to her as 'my chubby ball of fur' and when I first went to Arpico Battaramulla and saw her, I was like "that's too puffy for a welcome carpet". But then when I looked in closer, I realized that the 'carpet' was in fact a doggy having the best naps ever and that too at the footsteps of this supermarket.
Being an animal lover and when I see dogs, my first reaction is go pet them, hug them and just have a little chit chat with them (some people think I am cuckoo because I do that). But when I saw her, I didn't want to disturb her peaceful slumber (though I really did want to feel how comfortable she is over there).
Little did I know about her, till my friend who lives in Rajagiriya and frequents this Arpico told me "ahh, yea...she's always there and no one bothers her as well so is safe". That's all I needed to hear. That she is safe and happy there.
I got to know recently that her name is Arpico Kalu Chooti. She was named by Uncle Nihal (he's the one who has dedicated his life to feeding our four legged friends in that area) and was one of Uncle's best friends. This young girl has been at Arpico since they started their construction work. When Uncle Nihal met this beauty 13 years ago, she was pregnant. After she littered, the pups were adopted one by one and Uncle Nihal adopted one girl who is now 12 years old and is still with him.
Everyday Uncle Nihal would visit her which strengthened their friendship. This friendship was so strong that even when other volunteers came to feed her she would wait until Uncle himself came for her to eat. Like one says grace before they have a meal, Chooti would look at Uncle's face before eating.
People would walk in and out of Arpico always giving Chooti a look or two. She would sit and watch the world pass by and not bother a single person. There was a man named Mohamed who wasn't a guard but was there to check on other work and would call her Blacky, bathe her weekly and make sure she looks good always.
Three weeks ago she was not feeling well and there was a kind lady who came and gave her medicine and breakfast. Since she was old, her body was feeling it too. The last time I saw her was a month ago and she was once again sleeping it off. I was told the guards had made her special four foot pen for her to stay safe and sound.
Sadly, last weekend I got a message from my friend that the Arpico Doggy has passed away. It seems that one of their delivery trucks had knocked her down. Uncle Nihal was alerted immediately and he rushed to her side. She had internal bleeding and was quite weak and she breathed her last breath by uncle's side.
Uncle Nihal misses her truly and he had this message that the Off-Road Feeding Programme would like to share with you'll.
"Yes as you said there is lot of sadness and emptiness in the air. She was the biggest strength for me to continue to do the feeding long years ago. Almost everyday before leaving her l used to pet her, give soothing loving words "mage Sudu rattharn, mage wasthuwa, mage manika kaala hondata doi ganna aiya hettath enawa good night'. Then she used to lick my hands with lot of love and said good night by looking at my eyes and booo booo to me several times before l disappear into darkness. In a way l was happy that she had her last breath in my hands and to find a quiet burial under the palm trees. Most of the times it reminds me of the beautiful moments l had with her. Take care may God bless you."
Aprico Kalu Chooti was buried at the private garden of one Dharmaratne who was kind enough to give that space as her forever resting place.
We all miss you Chooti. I hope you have found all our dear friends over the Rainbow Bridge and finally settled down. Till we meet again.

Sanga shines against Tendulkars Blasters
Houston, Wednesday: Shane Warne's Warriors walloped Sachin Tendulkar's Blasters by 57 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match Cricket All Stars Series.
Tendulkar's decision to put the opposition in to bat backfired as game's heavyweights Kumar Sangakkara (70 off 30), Jacques Kallis (45 off 23) and Ricky Ponting (41 off 16) tore apart the equally celebrated Warriors' bowling attack to smash 262 for five in 20 overs.
The likes of Tendulkar (33 off 20), Virender Sehwag (16 off 8), Shaun Pollock (55 off 22) Brian Lara (19 off 21) and Sourav Ganguly (12 off 12) enthralled a sizable crowd with their brief knocks at Minute Maid Park.
The 'legends' now travel to Los Angeles for the final game of the series on Saturday. The opening match, won by Warne's men convincingly, was played in New York on November 7.
Though the match's outcome was not that significant considering the games are a mere exhibition, the famed former cricketers from both teams displayed fierce competitive spirit.
The competitive zeal was evident when the dream opening pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag walked into the middle. What made the contest more mouthwatering was Wasim Akram opening the bowling for Warriors and swinging the ball in from the word go.
It was now Tendulkar's turn to use the long handle. The master blaster hammered three fours and couple of sixes before his old foe Saqlain Mushtaq found his stumps with a fast off spinner.
Ganguly, playing his first game of the series, was expectedly rusty to start with but managed a four and a big hit in his run a ball innings.
Warne too appreciated the crowd response.
"The way we have been treated has been fantastic.
Sangakkara, who was the Man of the Match for his blazing knock, said: "It was a lot of fun, thank you Houston for the hospitality. Lot of credit to Sachin and Warney, they are pioneers on the field and they are breaking new round off the field. All outstanding players, legends of the game, the crowd participation has been unbelievable. Players have given their all on the field. "Participation of kids is vital for the growth of the game but for us, it has been humbling. Hopefully the game catches on in the US," Sangakkara said. PTI
Warne's Warriors: 262 for 5 (MP Vaughan 30, ML Hayden 32, JH Kallis 45, KC Sangakkara 70, RT Ponting 41, A Symonds 19 n.o., JN Rhodes 18 n.o., L Klusener 2 for 45)
Sachin's Blasters: 205 for 8 (SR Tendulkar 33, L Klusener 21, SM Pollock 55, GP Swann 22 n.o., A Symonds 4 for 70)

The Story of Rossotrudnichestvo: 90 years of peoples diplomacy
This year Rossotrudnichestvo celebrates its 90th anniversary. The organization started off as All-Union Society for Cultural Relations in 1925, continued from 1958 as Union of Soviet Friendship Societies and Cultural Ties with Foreign Countries, as RusInterCentre in 1994 and in 2008 became a Federal Agency for CIS Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo).
All-Union Society for Cultural Relations (AUSCR)
All-Union Society for Cultural Relations (AUSCR) was created in April 1925. It was a difficult period fora newly emerged state that did not have international recognition and contacts with other countries.There was a need to tell the world about a completely new political system, to provide
objective information that could dispel the myths that have arisen around the young Soviet power and provide support to foreign scientific and cultural intelligentsia.
The AUSCRaimed at the establishment and development of scientific and cultural ties between institutions, NGOs and cultural figures of the USSR and abroad.
Olga Kameneva, sister of Leo Trotsky and wife of the first head of the Soviet state Leo Kamenev, had become the chair of the organization.Prior to that, she led the Commission to Foreign Aid (CFA), which was created just over a year after the formation of the Soviet Union and became the prototype of the AUSCR.
Departments of science and technology, literature, studentship and language were present in the new organization. The latter was aimed at promotion of learning foreign languages.
Such prominent figures asthe poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, composers Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, writer Mikhail Sholokhov, director Sergei Eisenstein contributed to the work of AUSCR in the field of development of foreign relations.
On the part of foreign countries, physicists Albert Einstein and Marie Curie, writers Romain Rolland, Theodore Dreiser and Herbert Wells advocated for establishing friendly relations with the Soviet authorities.
At the invitation of AUSCR,variousdelegations of foreign companies, as well as notable figures of science and culture like the French physicist Paul Langevin and writer Romain Rolland, Indian composer and public figure Rabindranath Tagore, Danish writer Martin Andersen Nexo, and many others visited the USSR.
AUSCR sent delegations and representatives of Soviet science and culture to foreign countries to participate in congresses and conferences; theatre troupes, music and dance ensembles; organized exchanges of literature and museum exhibits, etc. It was the AUSCR that initiated the first trips of Soviet citizens abroad.
Even during the war AUSCR continued to work actively with the friendship societies in different countries. These organizations participated in the resistance movement, which was established in German-occupied territories.
All-Union Society seeked to unite prominent figures of the world of culture in the fight against Nazism. For example, the famous writer Erenst Hemingway wrote in July 1941: I am one hundred per cent associate myself with the Soviet Union in its armed resistance to fascist aggression.
Together with foreign friendship societies AUSCR raised awareness by distributing materials, which voicedthe deeds of the Soviet people in the struggle against the invaders and the atrocities of the Nazis in the occupied territories.
The AUSCR contributed towards the improvement of supply routes for medicines and equipment meant for the hospitals of the Soviet Union and other assistance, which was acquired at the expense of citizens of countries that sympathized with the Soviet Union.
All-Union Society seeked to unite prominent figures of the world of culture in the fight against Nazism. For example, the famous writer Erenst Hemingway wrote in July 1941: I am one hundred per cent associate myself with the Soviet Union in its armed resistance to fascist aggression. AUSCR maintained close ties with German leaders, who emigrated from Germany after the Nazis came to power. Physicist Albert Einstein, writer and brother of thewinner of the Nobel Prize for Literature
Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, writer Lion Feuchtwanger and playwright Bertolt Brecht were among them. Books of the writers were published in the Soviet Union.
Art was a kind of weapon against Nazi Germany, as it raised the fighting spirit of the combatants. In 1941, one of the musical masterpieces of the XX century, the famous seventh, or the Leningrad Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovic was created in besieged Leningrad. This piece was heard in many
countries due to the AUSCR, which was able to pass on a copy of the symphony to England, the United States and other countries through its channels.
As soon as the war was drawing to a close, the activities of legal societies of friendship with the Soviet Union revived in the countries liberated from the Nazi occupation. New organizations, which established contacts with AUSCR, were formed. In many countries, the genuine interest for the Soviet Union and its culture.
Societies of Friendship with the Soviet Union were being actively created. Only in 1945 the Society of friendship with Albania, the Society of cultural cooperation with Yugoslavia, the Austro-Soviet society, Russian Institute in the Netherlands, the company Norway - the USSR, Romanian Society of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the company
Switzerland - the USSR and Madagascar - Soviet Union were established.
The purpose of such societies was the establishment of an increasing number of direct contacts between people from different countries.
By 1957, the National Association for Friendship with the Soviet Union worked in 47 countries.
Union of Soviet Friendship Societies and Cultural Ties with Foreign Countries
The beginning of the Cold War, emergence of the new political objectives demanded a new format of the AUSCR. In 1958, it wastransformed into the Union of Soviet Friendship Societies (USFS). Soviet social and political activist Nina Popovabecamethe firstchairman of the newly formed body.
AUSCR incorporated all of the societies, associations, friendship committees, republican societies on the cultural ties with foreign countries, various thematic sessions existing at the time. The objectives of the organisation now included not only the development of external contacts, but also acquaintance of the Soviet citizens with the history and culture of other countries. Establishment of regional branches of friendship societies contributed to this process. In addition, another hallmark of the organizations that were part of the USFS was a wide scale of their activities.
USFS as AUSCR functioned in a tense international context generated by the confrontation of the political systems created of the Soviet Union and the United States.During the exacerbation of relations between the Soviet Union and the West, when political and economic relations were virtually ceased,
activities of the friendship societies in those countries served as a binding thread, whichupheldthebilateral contact both at a high level and among ordinary citizens.The authority and significance of the emerging friendship societies were underpinned by the fact that these organizations
were headed by prominent figures of culture, science and other fields.
Thus, the Society of Friendship with Bulgaria was headed byan academician, aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev, Association for Friendship with Italy - by famous Soviet film director Sergei Gerasimov, one with Cuba  by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, with Vietnam  cosmonaut German Titov.
The USFS and friendship societies used different approaches to implementing humanitarian projects. Exchanges of delegations and tourist groups, pooling of experience in relation to scientific and cultural achievements, holding exhibitions, festivals, special days dedicated to science and culture of the USSR, exchanging mass friendly correspondence between groups and individuals.
Friendship Societies united 25,000 enterprises, collective and state farms, educational, scientific and cultural institutions. Over 50 million people participated in the activities of the USFS. Each year, republican society alone held about 25 thousand events dedicated to foreign countries.
By 1975, the USSF included 63 of friendship societieswith individual countries, which contributed to the development of international cooperation. Soviet cultural centres, the House of Soviet Science and
Culture were created in 1970s-80s. They have become places of concentration of information on cultural, scientific and social life of the Soviet Union.
At that time, centres were created mostly unilaterally. Retaliatory moves on the part of foreign countries in Moscow included openings of cinema theatres named after the capital cities twinned with the Soviet towns, such as cinema Prague, Warsaw and others.
In the same period of a heightened arms race between the USSR and the USA, the USFSwas leading an active social life aimed at the dissemination of ideas of easing international tension and maintaining peace. This approach persisted as a part of the official foreign policy of the country following Mikhail Gorbachevs rise to power.
In the 1980s, the USFS continued its activities in the sphere of humanitarian affairs, including those aimed at the dissemination of the Russian language and culture abroad. According to the official statistics, Russian language courses were organized with the support of the USFS in that period. Courses were held in more than 90 countries, where about 600 thousand foreigners received their language training.
USFS sent abroad around 10,000 exhibitions a year, distributed over 450 periodic publications to about 7,000 foreign subscribers. In the 1980s,cultural centres of several foreign countries were opened in Moscow.
Russian Association for International Cooperation (RAIC) and Russian Center for International Scientific and Cultural Cooperation (RusInterCentre)
With the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s, USFS among other organizationsunderwent a transformation. It was turned into a Russian Association for International Organization (RAIC) in April 1992. Also, a Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAICD) was created in order to strengthen informational, cultural and scientific relations between Russia and other states through the system of representative offices and centers of science and culturebased in foreign states.Later, following the government decree of April 8, 1994, functions of the RAICD were transferred to the Russian Center for International Scientific and Cultural Cooperation under the Government of the Russian Federation (RusInterCentre). For the first time in the history of the
system AUSCR-USFS-RAICD-RusInterCentre the organisationentered the structure of state agencies. The Hero of the Soviet Union cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova headed the newly created body.
Largely due to the authority and the effective work of Valentina Tereshkova, who lead the organization at that time, RusInterCentrecontinued to operate stably, preserving the connectionsit had built over the years. During that period, centers were opened in the USA, France, Belgium, Slovakia, Vietnam and other countries. A key focus has remained the cultural and awareness-building work. The Russian Centre of Science and Culture organized festivals, exhibitions, evening schoolsand workshops.
Also, Russian regions were provided with assistance in developing partnerships with other countries with support of the RusInterCentre.
Between 2004 and 2008, first centers in the CIS countries (Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan) were opened. First practices of bilateral years were introduced in the same period. They were held with the support of the RusInterCentre and considerably expanded the circle of friends and partners of our country.
Federal Agency for CIS Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo)
Expansionof a structure that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union such as the CIS necessitated fresh approaches to building a new format of international relations, not only with foreign countries, but also with Russia'sclosest neighbours. There was a need to create a special federal body, which would have full authority in the development of Russian cultural ties with foreign countries in general, and with the CIS countries in particular. In order to achieve this objective, a Presidential Decree 1315 of September 6, 2008 was issued. It created the Federal Agency for CIS Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo).
The main objectives of Rossotrudnichestvo include implementing projects aimed at strengthening international relations in the humanitarian sphere, as well as promoting of a positive image of Russia abroad.
At the present stage Rossotrudnichestvo carries out its activities in the following areas: support and promotion of the Russian language in the world, promotion of Russian science, culture and education abroad, working with compatriots, implementation of projects in the field of international development assistance and public diplomacy.
Modern Russia has a huge potential for expansion of humanitarian contacts as well as forpromotionof its culture and rich historical heritage abroad. Today, as many years ago, the need of formulating an objective vision of our country, debunking the myths about it and further expanding of the circle of friends on both diplomatic level and among ordinary citizens, remain highly significant. Given the long successful history of the systemAUSCR-USFS-RAICD-RusInterCentre-Rossotrudnichestvo, its experience, the Agency is currently involved in the implementation of state policy in this area.

The visionary who powered the rail
Engineer B. D. Rampalas 115th birth anniversary falls on November 14. Institution of Engineers holds the Annual Rampala Memorial Lecture on this day. Electrification of Ceylon Railways was a visionary idea of Rampala.
Late D. J. Wimalasurendra introduced the benefits of harnessing the Hydro Electric Power to the country from rivers Mahaweli, Kehelgamu and Maskeliya, by his presentation to the Engineering Association of Sri Lanka in 1918. In his paper, Wimalasurendra explained the ascending of the railway to Pattipola and descending again to Bandarawela (Badulla was not connected in 1918) quoting similar accounts at:
(1) Butte  Anaconda Railway in Montana United States  first electrification introduced in a freight railway.
EngineerB.D. Rampala
(2) Genoa Line in Italian State Railways; gradient 3.5 percent, trailing load of 260 tons, at 24.43 MPH and a descending speed of 30 MPH (motors acting as generators thus providing regenerative braking). Capacity availability being trebled by electrification - quoting Alfred Thomas Dovers book on Electric Traction 1912.
(3) Midi railways of France; Meter Gauge track, 34 miles in length, gradients of 22 in 1000 (almost 1 in 45 and 17 in 1000 1 in 59) between Ille  Ville Franche.
(4) Norfolk and Norton Railway in West Virginia. Gains in Electric traction against Steam:
I. Decreased outlay from speed and longer trains with improved turnaround. II. Comparative decrease in maintenance. III. Greater train mileage and Ton mileage (capacity increase). IV. Riddance of pollution inside tunnels. V. By virtue of employment of regenerative control, increased down grade speed and savings on brake show renewals.
Electrification system
However, the British who administered the country did not like investing on hydro electric power and continued with the diesel generation. In 1929, Wimalasurendra retired from the government service on reaching the age of 55 and became a Member of the State Council in 1931. Finally on October 30, 1950, Laxapana Power Station was opened, but his railway electrification proposal was yet to be executed.
Since 1977, feasibility studies for electrifying the suburban network had been undertaken six times. Offers were invited by a press notification appearing in Ceylon Daily News of February 12, 1977, for electrification of Kalutara South, Negombo and Veyangoda corridor a total of 134-mile project on a turn-key basis, with offers to include terms of credit for financing. The project was to be operational by 1982, and involved design and specification study, electrification of fixed installations, establishment of repair and maintenance shops for rolling stock, and the closing date was March 15, 1977.
Based on above, the feasibility study by SOFRERAIL of France covered three sections of the network: 1. Veyangoda  Colombo, 2. Colombo  Kalutara South and 3. Ragama  Negombo. With the change of government in July 1977, this project was shelved.
The second study in 1981 was carried out by Pacific Consultants International of Japan for Designs and Specifications from Polgahawela to Colombo, and two other sections as in the former study. It was a detailed study and included all features associated with the project. The electrification system considered was the 25 KV 50HZ system with three sub stations to be directly fed from 132 KV grid. The total track length was 146 Kms. The estimated cost of the project in 1981 was Rs 5,673 million.
The third study was by JARTS in 1987. A study on development of a standard cost effective electrification system for Sri Lanka Railways.
The study undertaken by SOFRERAIL and INTER-G in 1991 was known as the COKANEPOL Project. This acronym was formed by the use of first syllables of the destinations: Colombo, Kalutara, Negombo and Polgahawela.
Japan Transport Consultants Association undertook a study in November 1990 on the same sub-urban route. It provided a detailed account on cost factor involvements, population and traffic forecasts, financial evaluation and a project justification. It was the fifth study. However, the governments priorities were focused elsewhere.
Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka, (IESL)
The last study was undertaken by a team of consultants from the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka, (IESL) in 1998. It was a case of ramification and ratification of the previous studies with approval and disapproval of the previous studies. Vast advantages, Financial and economic viability of electrification were accepted by this team.
However, in the absence of a political will and the government nod, all these studies were shelved. Technical specifications, tender documentation already in hand will be of use in the future.
Electrification of Railways involves a lot of Civil Engineering works in the form of:
 Clearances over bridges and tunnels (16-6or 5030mm from rail level), track lowering, bridge raising, partial reconstruction, total reconstruction, station roof redesigning,
 Overhead line catenaries equipment, mast installation, pantograph installation.
 For Brick Arch or Dressed Stone arch bridges the method used is to replace the centre of the arch by a shallower spanned precast concrete arch. Inside tunnels, the tracks are generally lowered along with the approaches; and pockets are grooved in the roof. Grout sealing is performed from top of the tunnel. Drainage problems caused by track lowering also need attention.
Indigenous manufacture of requirements substantially reduces the cost of electrification. Some of which that could be manufactured locally are steel sections for overhead equipment that could be rolled and galvanized, catenary and contact wires, all other non-ferrous fittings, and solid core insulators in local porcelain factories. Indian assistance could be sought for mechanical parts, electrical equipment for locomotives, pantographs, switch gear, tap changers, silicon diodes etc.
Training programmes could also be arranged in India on erection of OH equipment, masts, simple catenary, compound catenary, pantographs, portal structures, working on rail mounted trestles to transfer contact wires and so on, all that which leads to cost reduction.

On your way to work with MLH on World Food Day
In celebration of World Food Day in October, Mount Lavinia Hotel distributed over 500 cups of herbal drink (kola kenda) to train commuters at the Mount Lavinia Railway Station. The delicious and nutritious herbal porridge, prepared under the supervision of MLH's own renown Chef Publis was offered to all those arriving and departing from the Mount Lavinia Railway Station as a breakfast drink to be consumed 'on their way to work'.
"The idea behind the project was to enliven a normal day of an average train commuter by offering this little treat. We realised that it was warmly welcomed by all as we saw the smiles on their faces," MLH Resident Manager Harinda Weerasinghe commented. "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
But unfortunately many of us do not make an effort to have a good meal in the morning. In most instances, we completely avoid it due to the rush we are in. Therefore, our cup of kola kenda on World Food Day would have even been the only breakfast to some who had it," he added.
The breakfast drink was distributed amongst a large group of commuters which included school children, public and private sector employees, vendors, parents and few tourists as well. The members of Team MLH were more than pleased to be part of the project which enabled them to give back to the society in a worthy and enjoyable manner.
Nurturing the neighbourhood and the surrounding environment is key do sustainable development for any organisation. As a leading establishment in the tourism and hospitality industry, MLH continues to undertake this responsibility and endeavours to extend the service to society as a whole.
