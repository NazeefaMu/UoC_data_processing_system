Out of six tournament matches they have won three on first innings and rest were lost on first innings.
Fourth year player and all-rounder Paththini Gamage Don Kavindu Hashan Kularatne has played a key role in their success. Hashan who opens batting and bowls right arm off spin has so far collected 524 runs with the top score of 124 runs versus P. de S. Kularathne Vidyalaya Ambalangoda and unlucky to miss a well deserved century by two runs against Holy Cross College Kalutara and 70 versus Taxila Central Horana and unbeaten 50 against Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte and finally he top scored versus formidable Rahula College Matara with 89 runs and enabled Johnians to beat them 76 runs on first innings.

He commenced his school career at Sri Chandrasekera Vidyalaya Horethuduwa Panadura and did not participate in school cricket but he attended cricket practices at the cricket school at Panadura Sports Club and he came under G. Ranasinghe who is his present cricket coach at St. Johns. Noticing the talents of Hashan he helped him to admit him to St. John's College in the year 2013. Same year he was picked for the under 17 team and collected 220 runs with the highest score of 80 runs against Vidyaloka College Galle.
This paved the way to fit in to the first eleven team in the same year and he played for the Big Match and the one Dayer and he was unbeaten on 58 runs when the game came to a halt with the crowd invading the grounds.
There was no Big Match in 2014 and in the last year's Big Match he claimed four wickets and played for the Limited overs game. He is looking forward to give his best in the big match and the one dayer and he feels Johnians can beat their arch rivals Panadura Royalists as they are going through very lean period in the current cricket season.

Pak Under 19s defend a meager total to beat SL Under 19s

Pakistan U19 after an excellent display with the ball finished on top of group B when they beat their Sri Lankan counterparts well defending a modest total. Though the result of this match did not make any difference to either teams position into the next round of the tournament as both teams were already qualified to play in quarters, the position of being unbeaten puts a team high in morale.
After Sri Lankan bowlers restricted Pakistan to a total of 212 just under 49 overs, the target for their batsmen looked to be too easy, but Pakistan bowlers did something better with the ball than the Sri Lankan bowlers as they bowled out Sri Lanka for a total of 189 inside 47 overs to win the match by 23 runs.
The match, in the end became a comeback game for Pakistan as Sri Lanka at the time Kamindu Mendis and Vishad Randika were at the wicket were cruising along nicely, but once they departed Sri Lankan innings crumbled quicker than Pakistan innings collapsed.
In quarter finals, Sri Lanka will meet England whilst Pakistan clash with West Indies.
Pakistan U19 : 212 in 48.4 overs (Hasan Mohsin 86, Salman Fayyaz 33, Mohammed Umar 26, Thilan Nimesh 2/38, Wanindu Hasranga 2/30, Damitha Silva 2/41)
