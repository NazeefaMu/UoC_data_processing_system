Cricketers badly hurt by FB posts: Faizer
	
Sports Minister Faizer Mustapha said yesterday that the national cricket team was badly hurt due to some insulting facebook posts targeting them after the team's defeat against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asian Cup tournament and appealed cricket fans not to bring down the mentality of the players.
He told this in parliament during the adjournment debate moved by the joint opposition MP Kanchana Wijesekara stating that the recent defeat was due to the issues in the cricket administration.
Minister Mustapha said moving such a debate following just two defeats was an insult to the players.
? Sports is not politics. We must be able to accept both victory and defeat. Our players have been successful in the recent tournaments against the West Indies and South Africa. It is not fair to insult them on facebook just because they were defeated in two matches. If we think about our cricket, we need to think about the mentality of our players,? he said.
He said it was not fair to claim that the cricket administration in Sri Lanka had collapsed on the basis that Bangladesh and Afghanistan won two matches against us.
He said politicians should safeguard the players and added that it was their national responsibility.
?We will engage in politics on platforms and in parliament. But don?t bring cricket into parliament. This adjournment debate is an insult to our players,? he said.
The minister said the team had made progress under the new coach Chandiuka Hathurusinghe in all three formats.
?Our progress under Graham Ford between January 2016 and July 2017 was 28 per cent in ODIs, 36 per cent in T20s and 46 per cent in Test matches. It is 16% in ODIs, 0% in T20s and 33% in Test under Nic Pothas. But it was 41% in ODIs, 57% in T20s and 57% in Test matches under the coachship of Hathurusinghe,? he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Crime against the soul of our societies
	
India was in crisis this week after a seven-year-old girl became the latest victim in a country where a rape is reported to be taking place in every 13 minutes.? ?
According to reports the seven-year-old girl is in a critical condition at a New Delhi hospital after undergoing surgery for injuries she suffered while being raped. Her mother was by her bedside after the girl underwent hours of surgery. It is alleged a metal pipe was used in the sex assault.??
A 21-year-old has been arrested in connection with the rape, which occurred in the district of Shahdara in the north-eastern part of the city.? ?
The girl was in extreme pain after the attack, said Swati Maliwal, chairwoman of the Delhi Commission for Women. She told the Cable News Network (CNN) ?We are working out her rehabilitation plan. It is very unfortunate that these rape cases are not ending in Delhi. Police resources continue to be extremely low in Delhi.???
In a series of tweets, Ms. Maliwal provided additional details of the attack, saying the girl, who comes from a poor family, had been lured to a park in Seemapuri, where the perpetrator assaulted her.? ?
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 39,000 rapes in India in 2016 -- a rate of roughly one rape every 13.5 minutes. The total marked a 12% spike over the previous year, CNN reported.? ?
On September 20, a Haryana court imprisoned a 20-year old youth who abducted, raped and brutally murdered a six-year-old girl in Uklana town of the state on December 8 last year, the Hindustan Times reported. The court also fined the youth Rs. 80,000. He was a minor when he committed the crime, but is an adult now.? ?
Pointing out that after raping the girl, the accused had murdered her in a barbaric manner by inserting a wooden stick in her private parts, the judge observed that the crime falls in the category of the rarest of the rare cases, but he could not pronounce a death sentence as the accused was a juvenile when the crime was committed. The court said, ?It is a crime against the holy body of a girl child and the soul of the society and such a crime is aggravated by the manner in which it has been committed. The nature of the crime and the manner in which it has been committed speaks about its uncommonness,? the newspaper reported.? ?
India, the second largest country in the world is widely regarded as the home of religions and for such horrible crimes to take place there, raises questions as to where the world is heading.? ?
In Sri Lanka reports last year said that a rape of a woman takes place every four hours and most of them are school children. The trend is increasing. Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera making this disclosure quoting Police reports said socio-economic conditions and standards of education should be lifted to save women and girls from this threat.??
Worldwide also we see a rise in sexual crimes against children, young girls and women with the United States President Donald Trump being widely regarded as a cad. His Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh has been accused by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford of brutally raping her while they were in high school some 30 years ago. The issue is to come up before the US Senate judiciary committee next week and has lead to an intensified campaign by the so-called ?Me too? movement comprising girls or women who were sexually assaulted by VIPs and others.? ?
The cause or causes are complex and world religion leaders need to come together and see what is going wrong in this era of modern technology where as often before in history, as Shakespeare said, judgment has fled to brutish beasts and people appear to be losing theie reason.? ? ?

Demolished K'nochchi monument not an archaeological site: Grero
	
State Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs, Mohan Lal Grero said yesterday the media report about an archaeological monument in Kilinochchi that was said to be demolished by Karachchi Pradeshiya Sabha officials was in fact not an archaeological monument.
He told parliament that the bricks found at the location were identified by the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) officials as bricks used for the renovation of the Abhayagiri Stupa sometime back.
He said this in response to a question asked by joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane whether any action had been taken against those responsible for the demolition.
The minister said the CCF had awarded a contract to several contractors to supply bricks to be used for renovating the Abhayagiri stupa.
"The army had taken away a load of substandard bricks stacked in the site of the Abhayagiri Stupa with the permission of the CCF just after the war and had erected a wall around a war memorial in Kilinochchi. The site said to have been demolished was identified as an L-shaped wall erected with the same bricks a few metres away from the war memorial," he said.
The minister said this site had been bulldozed by the Pradeshiya Sabha officials so that it could be used for a parking lot and a fair.
The MP the government had turned a blind eye to the incidents where so many archaeological sites were being vandalised in the North and East.
The minister said for the past three years more archaeological sites had been vandalised in other parts of the country rather than in the North and East and pointed out that 203 sites had been vandalised in the other areas in 2016 while it 12 sites were vandalised in in the North and in 2017. He said 290 were vandalised in other areas while 10 sites were vandalised in the North in 2018 and 184 in other areas and 8 in the North.
He said Anuradhapura was reported as the place where most number of sites were demolished while Kurunegala and Tangalle came next. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Govt. planning to hand over Trinco oil farm to India: Anura
	
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday the government was planning to hand over the Trincomalee oil tank farm to the Indian Oil Company (IOC) despite a Cabinet decision in 2016 to hand it over to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.
He told parliament that Cabinet approval had been obtained in August 7, 2018 to hand over 15 Lower Tank Farm to IOC and to hand over 85 of the Upper Tank Farm to a joint venture by the IOC and Ceypetco.
The MP said Cabinet approval was granted to develop 16 Tanks with funds from Ceypetco on June, 6, 2016 and that it had the needed US$10 million required for the purpose.
He asked on what basis was the oil tank farm being handed over to the IOC when it could be developed by Ceypetco and pointed out in COPE the developing the tank farm would provide access to the international oil market and that it would be a lucrative foreign currency earner.
Neither the subject minister nor the deputy minister was in the House to answer the question and House Leader Lakshman Kiriella assured that the answer would be given at the next parliament day. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Justice Tudor De Alwis He was a gentleman par excellence
	
In the recent past much has been said in the media about the Central Bank, the need to maintain high standards by professionals and the corruption prevalent in the system including the judiciary. This made me think about the great values displayed by both Justice Tudor De Alwis and his wife, Celine De Alwis (nee Perera) Attorney-at-Law.?
?After retiring from the judiciary Justice De Alwis was appointed as the Legal Consultant of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and held that position for over six years. It is there that I worked with him closely and got to know him well, even though I had heard of his judicial prowess prior to that.? ?
The conduct of Justice De Alwis and his wife was so exemplary and rare that I feel it is imperative to be placed on record. At the very onset of his illustrious judicial career, he made a difficult, but important decision together with Celine. Upon Justice De Alwis accepting his first judicial appointment as a Magistrate, they made the decision that Celine, who was in the process of building up a very solid practice having been in the profession for about 6 years, gave up her law career. This is because he did not think it was proper for her to continue in practice or be employed by any legal institution while he held judicial office. It has displayed the calibre and the character of this couple and is a glowing example to the present day judicial officers.? ?
This year marks the 91st birth anniversary of Justice De Alwis who passed away sixteen years ago. He is considered as one of the most independent and highly competent judges to adorn the higher echelons of the judiciary of Sri Lanka. Not only was he independent in his judgements and application of the law, his conduct made all the parties appearing before him feel satisfied that justice had been done. He had the ideal temperament for a judge and conducted himself with dignity and decorum bringing respect to himself and the august institution he represented.?
During my tenure of work under De Alwis I observed that he could not be influenced to do any incorrect thing. He did not tolerate even a whiff of political interference and treated any such attempts with the contempt it deserved. He led a simple and contended life surrounded by a very close-knit family.? ?
?
ustice De Alwis who passed away sixteen years ago. He is considered as one of the most independent and highly competent judges to adorn the higher echelons of the judiciary of Sri Lanka. Not only was he independent in his judgements and application of the law
?
?De Alwis who was born in Yatiyana, Agalawatte to an upper middle-class family. He was the 3rd of eight children. He had most of his education at St. John?s College Panadura under the principalship of Cyril Jansz. He had been a brilliant student excelling in most subjects and was always at the top of his class. He had entered the University of Ceylon and came under the tutelage of the famous Sir Ivor Jennings. He read Classics, History and Mathematics and graduated with consummate ease. Thereafter he entered Law College and graduated as an Advocate of the Supreme Court after which he set up his practice in Kalutara. Despite the propensity to earn lots of money, he answered the higher call of entering the judiciary which was considered a very prestigious honour at that time. The example he set as a judge in every respect was a very high bar indeed for others to emulate.? ?
Justice De Alwis was a wonderful family man and was adored by his wife, children and grandchildren. He was devastated at the irreparable loss of his dearly beloved daughter Shanez in the prime of her life. De Alwis would be a very happy man if he was alive today to see his wife, son and grandchildren all being very successful in their respective fields. Mrs. De Alwis after sacrificing her legal career embarked to work as a teacher in speech and drama.? Their son, Visvajit, is very well recognised and respected in the global tea industry having held senior appointments around the world. His granddaughter Danushka studied Law at University of Exeter in the UK and is based there working for one of the largest Conference producing companies as a senior Legal Conference Producer. Grandson Vimuktha is a versatile sportsman and represented Sri Lanka at Davis Cup Tennis.?
Justice De Alwis was a true son of the soil who loved our country in a genuine manner and spent his entire tenure as a judge to uphold all the noble values associated with that sacred institution. Unfortunately, over a period, many aspects of life in our beloved country have deteriorated and I often contemplate as to what holds for the future of our country? These thoughts linger in my mind as I fondly remember and honour the memory of Justice De Alwis who was a gentleman par excellence.? ?

M. E. MARIKAR  Remembering a gentleman scribe
	
Twenty one years ago on an18th September, Kandy lost one of its top journalists, who was a versatile sportsman, sports promoter and above all a gentleman. His name was M.E Marikar.??
Many are the instances during his illustrious career and public life where he displayed his integrity and honesty. He was a shining example of a clean life. The late Marikar was a fine cricketer, football player, athlete, boxer, cadet and also played hockey. At cricket he was a fine medium pace bowler and a hard hitting middle order batsman.??
ME or Mariks to his friends, he was a household name in sports. He worked for the ?Times Group? and later for the Wijeya Newspapers for thirty five long years form 1962 to 1997. Mariks used his pen to tell the country what was happening in Kandy in his own inimitable style of writing. He was an outstanding gentleman and highly respected journalist, who maintained lofty standards.??
?
Mariks, who served the Times and Daily Mirror for many years, knew about sports and news and it was he who wrote exclusively on the notorious ?Maru Sira?. When the Daily Mirror and Times papers closed, he joined Wijeya Newspapers Ltd
?
He was an old boy of St. Sylvester?s College, was gifted and was able to write on any topic from sports to news. He took over after late T.B. Marambe the renowned cricketer and coach of Trinity College, wanted a break from writing.??
He was employed by the Times Group of Newspapers. His efficiency helped him go places. Mariks succeeded veteran Cyril de Silva Ariyaratne and was absorbed to the permanent staff of the ?Times of Ceylon?. His journalism was based on balanced views. Mariks with his Yul-Brynner-like look was a familiar figure in Kandy and in most parts of the country. Mariks, who served the Times and Daily Mirror for many years, knew about sports and news and it was he who wrote exclusively on the notorious ?Maru Sira?. When the Daily Mirror and Times papers closed, he joined Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.??
Mariks was well-known in the sporting, political and social fields. He was amiable, sporty and a generous individual. He had a commanding personality, was tall and well-built. His majestic and dominant physical stature drew a smile or a good morning from the general public as he went about his work. He hailed from a well-known and respected family from Kandy.??
During his schools days, he was under the principalship of that famous educationist late D.J.N.Seneviratne. At school he was a top class sportsman, a fine boxer at the Stubbs Shield meets, a public school athlete and captained both the football and hockey teams. After leaving school he continued his sports, played football and hockey for Young Stars Sports Club. He also played football for Green Field Sports Club and Kandy YMMA. He also played for Saunders S.C, Colombo. While in Kandy he played for Kandy District and Up-Country.??
He started his career with the marketing Department and played football and cricket. He also played for the Government Services team. He led the Government Service Football team in 1956 and later served the Army 2 SR and led their football and cricket teams before taking to journalism.??
Mariks also played cricket, for Moors SC in the premier league. He became the first Sylverstian to play Premier league cricket. When he was schooling there was no cricket. He took to cricket later. He also played for Kandy Lake club, Kandy United, Kandy District, Up-Country, Times of Ceylon, Government Services and Sri Lanka Press. He was a well-known figure. Once on his way for the Inaugural Test match at the Oval, President J.R. Jayewardene spotting Mariks and offered him a lift in his official limousine. Again when he was on his way for a football final, President R.Premadasa saw him and offered a lift to the Sugathadasa Stadium.??
Mariks had a warm and generous heart and went out of his way to help a friend or journalist from any newspapers. His contribution for the citizens of Kandy in the field of sports and in general will be long remembered.??
He lived a simple life and moved with everybody and had connections with many leading figures of almost all political parties and the business world. Kandy lost a sincere friend, a helpful colleague, and a man of rare qualities and principles.??
We share the sorrow with his widow Hidaya (USA), Sons Hilmy (Switzerland, Foumy (Luxembourg) and daughter Soraya (USA) and Rozana no more.?

N.M?S ROAD TO NON-CAPTALIST PATH OF DEVELOPMENT:
	
?
Dr N.M. Perera (Phd. Dsc.-London) who spearheaded the left movement in this country with the energetic and gigantic support of Dr S.A.Wickremasinghe and Philip Gunawardena with the aim of getting rid of the British Raj and colonial rule had two primary objectives as his political and economic vision. His immediate political vision was to end the British rule from the soil of our motherland at the earliest and paving the way for a democratic form of government based on the British model -- a Westminister type of government. The second aim was to carry on a struggle within and outside the parliament for a non-capitalist path of development with the aim of establishing a socialist society at the far end.? ?
To accomplish these noble and patriotic objectives he manipulated the the parliament as a forum to highlight the inherent weakness of capitalist development depended on colonialism and at the same time waging mass struggles outside the parliament to collaborate with the inner struggle. In the field of mass struggles outside the parliament the culmination was the 1953 Hartal ably coordinated and launched by the LSSP, Communist Party and VLSSP led by Philip Gunawardena.? ?
?
NM held the portfolio of finance twice in his unique parliamentary? career. First, was when he was serving a coalition government with the? Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1964
?
The Hartal of 12th August 1953, exclusively laid the foundation stone for the defeat of the UNP in 1956.? ?
NM held the portfolio of finance twice in his unique parliamentary career. First, was when he was serving a coalition government with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1964. Then again in 1970 with the formation of another coalition with the SLFP and Communist Party. NM represented the LSSP in this coalition government, with its general secretary, Leslie Gunawardena, in charge of the ministry of transport. He refused to adhere to the dictates of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the two watch dogs of world capitalism.? ?
As a master of economic affairs, he understood the enormous difficulties an emerging economy just out from the colonial shackles was undergoing.? ?
The obstacles and impediments were (a) Facing the same as his immediate predecessors, NM as the Minister of Finance of the newly formed 1970 government , inherited a deep, crisis situation in the field of balance of balance of payments, grossly aggravated through financial imprudence practised by the previous rulers. Year by year the earnings from exports had dropped, although there was an increase in their volume. (b) The demand for imports of consumer and intermediate goods further aggravated due to the rise in unit prices. This situation arose mainly due to the continuous inflationary pressure occurring in the supplying markets. (c) The strategy of the previous government to devalue the rupee, never helped to ease the economic situation. In spite of these mad tactics, the situation worsened. (d) The drawing of foreign exchange reserves of the national economy for this purpose was another blunder committed by the governments that were in power before 1970. (e) With the exhaustion of reserves, the government was forced to borrow from external sources. Thus, high-cost borrowing from high cost foreign commercial banks was the order of the day. All these unscientific steps taken together, caused the share of short term loans to account for more than nearly 50% of the external debt of the country.? ?
The economic situation of the island-economy ripened from bad to worse. NM was compelled to implement patriotic & drastic actions. Although, the very patriotic and drastic actions, turned the economy towards progress and stability, certainly these actions had a negative effect on the political electorate.? ?
(a) Tirelessly, he worked for a balanced budget from the beginning to the end of the term as the key solution to the evils created by the dependent economy. A deficit in the budget highlighted the fact that the state apparatus and the country as a whole were living beyond their means. This was the financial scenario before 1970.? ?
(b) To counter these negative aspects in the economy, he introduced several fiscal measure?s including the ?pay as you (PAYE)earn scheme and raising of tax rates on luxury and semi essential goods.? ?
(c) De-monetization was another successful & sharp weapon introduced by NM to drive the tax evaders to the national tax net. In economic terms, wealth hoarding is sterile as it DOES NOT generate the multiplier effect. This innovative, bold and radical measure taken by NM strengthened the coffers of the Treasury immensely. Further, this exercise disclosed the existence of a large amount of untapped money(resources) in rural areas.? ?
(d) To induce and encourage institutional institutes to enhance savings, immediate steps were taken to take over the assets and liabilities of the Post Office Savings Bank, the Ceylon Savings Bank and the Savings Certificate Branch of the Post Master General. All these independent entities came under the newly formed NATIONAL SAVINGS BANK. This enabled the National Savings Bank to mobilize assets on a large scale.? ?
(e) Income -Ceiling was also brought forward as a means of containing consumption. It was also used as a tool to effect compulsory savings. Both methods were intended to stimulate investment for national growth.? ?
(f) Establishment of the State Distillery Corporation was also a new device, designed to tap a new untapped resource for the greater interest of the nation.? ?
(g) Setting-up of Workers? Councils in the public sector organizations to erase wastage, nepotism and beaucratic blunders.? ?
(h) NM inherited a thorough knowledge of the gem industry from the state council days. The records of the state council reveal that he was instrumental in setting up a select committee of the state council to inquire into the parameters of the gem industry. As far back as 1937, he functioned as member of this preliminary committee. He made use of this first-hand knowledge acquired in mid-1930?s to set up the State Gem Corporation in 1970-71 period. A senior staff officer of the central bank, Mr T.G. Punchi Appuhamy was appointed as the first chairman of this money spinner of foreign exchange. Gem exports rose sharply from a mere Rs.3.4 million in 1971 to Rs.152.8 million in 1973 and thereafter to the record height of Rs.234 million in 1974. The gem trade rose to the third largest income earner during a very short period and by far the upcoming leader among non-traditional products. The rising in income and generation of foreign exchange through this innovative mechanism helped Sri Lanka to preserve much needed foreign reserves to achieve the targets of a balanced budget.? ?
Reduction of land value (land price) was one of the significant outcomes of NM?s economic policies.? ?
He consulted Dr Gamini Corea, the Head of the UNCTAD on matters relevant to the world economy, and pressed immensely for a fair policy in global trade in the long-term interest of emerging countries.? ?
However, all his initiatives for economic independence came to an immediate end with the exit of the LSSP from the coalition government in 1976 and the country entered into a sad era of financial mismanagement with the opened economy. However, the present Minister of Finance, has a lot to learn from NM and we hope that he would rise up to the occasion, as the heat is blowing up.?

Presidential mobile service: People in Thellapilli asked to fund ceremony
	
Residents of Thellapilli in the Jaffna District have been asked to fund the inauguration ceremony of the presidential mobile service (Janadipathi Nila Mehewara), which was attended by President Maithrripala Sirusena, EPDP MP Douglas Devananda said yesterday.
He said a notice has been sent by the divisional secretariat asking the people in the area to fund the event. ?They are agitated by this notice. The government should spend for its functions instead of asking the people to fund for them,? the MP said.
Internal Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene in his response said only those who volunteered were invited to sponsor the event and that no one was forced to fund the event. He said the people had highlighted some 340,000 problems faced by them in the Jaffna District during this event and 196,000 of them were resolved. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Rupee depreciation: MR urges Govt. to find immediate solutions
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa urged the Government to come up with an immediate solution to address the issue of depreciation of rupee against US Dollar, saying it was the people who are being affected.
Speaking at a special news briefing held at his residence in Colombo, Mr Rajapaksa said the Government should admit its incapability .
?This is a serious issue, which needs serious attention. Even during the wartime and world economic crisis, we managed to keep our economy above the water. In fact, Sri Lanka was one of the few Asian countries, which remained unaffected by the economic crisis. We invite the Government to come to terms with its incapability and find solutions to the depreciation of rupee without pointing fingers at us,? he said.
Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Government should immediately resign and handover the country to the Joint Opposition led by former president Rajapaksa.
?We are ready to rule the country. We have already shown how to manage the economy. Its unfortunate that neither the President nor the Prime Minister can contain the fiscal mismanagement,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lankan Politics Scramble for Power, the Bane of the People
	
Then there is the constant rising cost of living that is our bee in the bonnet What about the colossal losses incurred by the state enterprises such as Sri Lankan Airlines
Fishing in troubled waters is what is plainly going on in our political arena
?
The great bane of many third-world countries looms in the craftily orchestrated dramas of greed and struggle for power in the political arena. Formerly Ceylon, beginning from 1956 and now Sri Lanka, in the course of the last four decades or so, has provided an ideal oasis for power-hungry politicians to play their astute games and political trickery at the expense of often misinterpreting peoples choices and oppressing them with their high-flown imaginary visions. There comes a time when an entire country and a nation can turn so corrupt and cock-eyed that they just are not able to see any other wiser way of thinking and deciding. The recent three elections country-wide, the Presidential election, the parliamentary general election and the local government elections that followed give us a fair idea of how politicians are hawks at the game. What a pity! Where is the spirit of statesmanship exhibited by our great fore-fathers of the calibre of Hon. D.S. Senanayake, the first prime minister of independent Ceylon and Sir Baron Jayatillake, a great politician-philosopher, the noble rank and file of statesmen and national leaders who knew how to wage a commendable fight and struggle for Independence? Where have all the decent politicians and national leaders gone? Are the politicians on stage at present without exception just power-hungry selfish individuals who at whatever price are bent on after capturing power or how many of them are true statesmen genuinely committed to build up this country along the three-way path of political stability,national harmony and a strong economy. This is all this country needs to be assured of a better and prosperous future devoid of this harangue of party turmoil and lack of political vision in all the major parties at play today.? ?
?
The 1980s witnessed the volcano of ethnic conflict that engendered a fierce and destructive armed struggle soaking this nation in blood and hatred
?
A Nation in Crisis?
It is true that Hon.S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake broke away from the capitalistic, imperialistic and aristocratic UNP (so he thought in his radical political thinking) to unleash the five-great-revolutionary forces galvanizing the monks, the farmers, the teachers, the workers and the ayurvedic physicians to launch an unprecedented people?s political movement, thus winning the hearts of simple rural Buddhist populace and bringing in a ?People?s Government? (Ape Anduwa). Mr. Bandaranayake was not left in peace to bring in his socialistic vision into the soul of the nation. Strike after strike followed suit buckling his plans, communalism began raising it head, the signs of the impending not too distant catastrophe and national decadence were to follow. The 1960s betrayed a lamentable instability that hit the economy rock hard. No one forgets the economic depression of the 1970s, the dent on foreign currency, lack of basic nutritional needs and the acute ratio of unemployment.? ?
The 1980s witnessed the volcano of ethnic conflict that engendered a fierce and destructive armed struggle soaking this nation in blood and hatred. Since the historical events of the triple colonial aggression on our country, the thirty-year ethnic war could be considered as our history?s next most national tragedy, the difference being that it brewed from within our national ranks. The efforts of the governments were inept and impotent to quell this move towards a war. The expenditure incurred in fighting a world?s worst terrorist outfit sucked the country off its financial resources and left a country battered and bewildered. However, with the defeat of terrorism, there opened a new page for treading new paths for national unity, economic progress and social integration. In no time, the raw greed for power from the rulers and political immaturity of leadership, there dawned a period of political instability marked by race for power and the dashing of people?s aspirations to zero. This is the drama at the present time. The speech from the President and the opening of the second session of the nation?s eighth parliament gave us some idea of the state of confusion that has engulfed our country. Even at this eleventh hour, the opportunity for saner political leadership and the more enlightened understanding of the people at large can bring in some light at the end of this dark tunnel to which we have been led. Politics in this country unlike that of countries like Singapore, Switzerland and Finland has proved itself to be a disastrous national exercise.?
?
The national government which held out many a hope for the people who voted it to power unfortunately could not attain its targets and accomplish its due tasks to full satisfaction
?
There seems to be a relentless greed to grab political power and once won, bribery and corruption had crept in at all levels into the sacred sanctuaries of public trust to dampen and poison their undertakings and responsibilities. No one doubts today the utterly miserable condition Sri Lanka is being subjected to by politicians.?
Recent events and revelations give ample proof to the despicable extent the State machinery has been vitiated. It is a wholly crooked system of public life that prevails in the country where even the civil organizations and citizens? movements appear powerless to stem this cancerous tide. Our politicians are experts in the disastrous skill of lambasting ruling governments while proclaiming their self-justified stance that they instead can rule better. They never get tired of asking for newer elections of all kinds and begging for newer mandates from the people! We cannot lay aside the political manoeuvring that introduced the office of the Executive Presidency that brought in five presidents. This has by now created an hornets nest and is a continuous bone of contention, confusion and instability in today?s Sri Lankan politics.? ?
?
Then there is the constant rising cost of living that is our bee in the bonnet
?
National Politics?and People?s Cry
Fishing in troubled waters is what is plainly going on in our political arena at the moment under the fake cover of concern for the future well-being of the nation. It is the ardent plea and the honest desire and hope of all concerned citizens who have at heart the well-being and the good name of the motherland to raise a cry for change and conversion of heart and mind in the life of politicians and those who dabble in politics. The power struggle of the political parties and their despicable greed had wreaked the hopes and aspirations of the people, especially the middle-class, the rural and urban poor. Which political authority in the future and political leadership will at long last relieve their long-standing sufferings and woes, we still yearn to see. Who will succeed in solving the national problem of ethnic reconciliation, turn around the economy down-turn and succeed in establishing an effective political and social order with a stable economy? We do not need astute politicians who can hoodwink but eminent and noble statesman of character and of the calibre of Hon. D.S.Senanayake, the father of the nation, Dudley Senanayake who was the epitome of honesty and sincerity and Ranasinghe Premadasa, the leader of the common man. Party politics need not be a shameful political rivalry for grabbing power by hook or crook. It must contribute towards a complementary vision of both the ruling government and a mature opposition. It appears as if there is a subtle form of tricking people and de-conscientizing them of the real status quo of the country. The dignity of the people is trampled and denigrated by those who use them as tools for their hidden agendas and personal benefits.? ?
The national government which held out many a hope for the people who voted it to power unfortunately could not attain its targets and accomplish its due tasks to full satisfaction. Instead, a tide of confusion has resulted where everyone is lost in the blues! The political life of the country seems to have boiled down to a game that is incessantly being played by heartless politicians who do not seem to care a tuppence for the good of the people and their immediate needs: cost of living that has to be lowered, fertilizer for the farmers, facilities for rural people for travel and school amenities for their children and of course creation of jobs. The question of decent salaries has propped up every now and then for various categories of workers. The frequent strikes are a sign that not everything has been settled regarding the anomalies of salaries. The farmer and the middle-class worker are at pains to make their ends meet in their day to day struggle to live and be content. Our traditional exports, tea, rubber and coconut products bring in poor foreign exchange. There is foul-play even in these sectors. Remittances from migrant workers are being threatened with the challenges facing their very lives and their unwillingness to venture into these employments abroad. Factories are grinding to a slow halt. Investors are having second thoughts opening up enterprises in the country because of the political instability and financial uncertainty. Then there is the constant rising cost of living that is our bee in the bonnet. What about the colossal losses incurred by the state enterprises such as Sri Lankan Airlines. The post-war rehabilitation and the missing persons issue are still fearful challenges hurled at us by the human rights organizations It is indeed a sad scenario! As it is said, the ship is sinking but the merry-making is going on!? ?
?
Not all hope?needs be lost?
In the light of the three urgent issues at stake at the moment, namely political stability, stable economy and national reconciliation, what is needed today is a disciplined breed of politicians who love the country, its people and are ready to transcend their personal gains with determination to do their best to work together for the progress of our dear motherland.?
Despite ideological differences that might be legitimate in a atmosphere of freedom of thought and expression, they must be noble-minded and motivated to work hand in hand for a Sri Lanka, a country well-stabilized, a socially integrated nation with everyone focusing on one single aim of facing the challenges at hand and capable of coming out of the darkness and uncertainty of the present.? ?
What is at stake is the morality in political and public life and the maturity and sense of responsibility of those in high public office in their being accountable to the people and manifest a clear sense of transparency devoid of hidden agenda when dealing with national issues and people?s problems. The lessons of the failures of the so-called unity-government carry many a lesson that can give wise guidance for the ventures of the future. All politicians of whatever hue in this country, must give up their philosophy of politics that makes them unstable and unsteady themselves like the lizard that changes colours. Instability and rattling movements in the noblest of our democratic institutions such as the Parliament means in the final analysis, destabilization of the country which affects the civility and the economy as everyone knows. It does not augur well at all for us in the international scene. It is the very earnest and sincere desire of every enlightened Sri Lankan citizen that we emerge from the present impasse and be well on the way to a period of political stability and economic prosperity with national reconciliation soon achieved to make of our motherland truly the impeccable Pearl of the Indian Ocean.? ?

Tanzania ferry disaster death toll doubles
	
?
Tanzanian rescue workers scrambled Friday to find scores of people feared drowned after a ferry capsized in Lake Victoria, Africa?s largest lake, killing at least 79 people.? ?
The MV Nyerere may have been carrying as many as 200 passengers double the ferry?s capacity when it capsized close to the pier on Ukara Island on Thursday afternoon, according to reports on state media.? ?
?At the moment the death toll is 79,? said Mwanza governor John Mongella, quoted on state television on Friday.? ?
The number of those found alive after Thursday?s disaster remained at 37, with no more survivors found since rescue operations resumed with police and army divers Friday morning.? ?
Rescue operations were suspended overnight and hopes are fading that more survivors might still be found, more than 18 hours since the vessel sank.? ?
The state broadcaster cited witnesses reporting that over 200 people had boarded the ferry at Bugorora Island where it was market day when locals said the vessel was commonly packed with people and goods.? ?
?I have not heard from either my father or my younger brother who were on the ferry. They had gone to the market in Bugorora to buy a school uniform and other supplies for the new school term,? said Domina Maua who was among those seeking information about loved ones.? ?
Sebastian John, a teacher, said such tragedies had become part of life for those living on the lake.? ?
It remains unclear how many people are still missing.

3 traits of successful people
	
?
They are all around us ? those individuals who always seem to be in complete control of their lives and at the top of their professions. They are paragons of success who seem to think on a different wavelength and have achieved great things in their lives. The world calls them ?successful?: they belong to the Top 5%, those who have set themselves apart from the rest. Certain characteristics and personalities have helped them produce epic results, where others have failed.??
So let?s take a look at some traits of these ?successful? people, those who seem to produce amazing work in various aspects of life.??
?
Focus inward??
Successful people spend a large amount of time focusing on their personal growth and upgrading their skills / competencies - this increases their value proposition in the competitive job market to ensure they demand a higher salary. They are ?Lifelong learners? and invest heavily in their education, learning and skill development.??
Successful people also develop a growth mindset. In their book Peak Performance by Brad Stulberg & Steve Magness, the authors talk about how the brightest intellectual minds spend much time intensely studying their industry and chosen fields, in order to surpass competition. The authors explain that fully absorbed intense learning in the area you are interested in will result in the individual doing his best work and achieving an ideal state of the mind that psychologists call the ?Flow State?.? ?
Research has shown that this ideal state is where people in various fields, ranging from sports to entrepreneurship to creative work, actually grow their minds and creativity through highly focused, concentrated learning experiences (under the right environments - free from all distraction and noise)??
?
The right habits and routines ensure successful people are always on the right path to their destinations, whether in thei?r personal lives or professional careers
?
Daily habits and routines
The right habits and routines ensure successful people are always on the right path to their destinations, whether in thei?r personal lives or professional careers. In his best-selling book The Power of Habit?, author Charles Duhigg talks about habit formation through the Habit Loop - Cue, Routine?and Reward.? ?
For example talking about a bad habit such as smoking, the ?Cue? for lighting up the cigarette might be stress. The ?Routine? would be the stimulation through the nicotine and the ?Reward? will be the temporary good feeling for the smoker after having a smoke. A good habit can be formed by keeping the Cue and the Reward, but changing the Routine.??
In this manner successful people can separate the Good habits and Bad habits in their daily routines - ensuring their lives are automated by Good Habits which make them run on auto-pilot. This allows them to devote brain-power / mental focus to more crucial decisions and activities, which affect success in their industry.??
?
Successful people also develop a growth mindset. In their book Peak Performance by Brad Stulberg & Steve Magness, the authors talk about how the brightest intellectual minds spend much time intensely studying their industry and chosen fields, in order to surpass competition
?
Deep work Vs. shallow work??
Successful people have the ability to focus intensely on assigned tasks to ensure completion by a given deadline. In his book Deep Work: Rules for focused success in a distracted world, author Cal Newport explains that amidst the various distractions we now face (in this era of internet and social media technologies) in the work place, going deep will become a key differentiator for success in?
modern society.??
The author goes onto define Deep Work as ?professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit?. We now see a trend in people resorting to more Shallow Work, work which is not cognitively demanding (demanding to the brain) and which can be easily replicated by others (even machines / automation).??
Successful people have mastered the art of Deep Work (freeing themselves from distractions) by carrying out cognitively demanding tasks which produce quality epic work ? this sets them apart from the rest of the crowd in the marketplace.??
Success can be a long journey - hopefully these tips will help you get to your desired destination!?
