JVP vows to build new political camp to defeat govt.
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will soon build a new political camp to defeat the present government which had pushed the country into a huge debt trap of Rs 5,000 billion and put a huge tax burden on the people, its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday.
There will be only two political camps. One is Ranil - Maithiri Camp and the other will be one which is led by the JVP. There wont be a third camp, Mr Dissanayake said told a protest march organized by his party against the increase of taxes.
The Ranil-Maithri government is not firm. Maithri tries underhand tricks to dislodge Ranil and Ranil tries underhand tricks to dislodge Maithri . People only voted for this government just to defeat the Rajapaksa regime therefore this government does not have any other mandate. the JVP will begin a progressive struggle to send them home. We managed to win a Rs 10,000 salary increment to public servants through a struggle. Likewise we can win this struggle as well. We will fight for a social economy which ensures justice to people, he added.
He said the two main political parties were responsible for the huge debt trap of Rs.5, 000 billion. This is a country which did not owe a single cent in 1950. Today it owes Rs 5000 billion to the world. Those who ruled this country then and now have brought the economy to a standstill. , he said.
There are no funds to run the government. If Sri Lanka is unable to secure a loan this year there won't be enough funds to pay the monthly salary of the Prime Minister, to pump fuel to President Sirisenas helicopter, to pump fuel to the Prime Ministers vehicle, to pay the electricity Bills at Temple Trees and Presidents House. Now the government is trying to put a tax burden on the people and trying to borrow more," Mr Dissanayake said.
If you spend Rs 400 to get a urine test done you will have to pay Rs 150 to the government in the form of tax. The price of a three-wheeler had gone up to Rs 1 million from Rs 550,000 as a result of the new taxes he said.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the government should acquire all assets owned by the former rulers - the Rajapaksas - to pay back the loans obtained by them. (Yohan Perera)

President to visit China again
	
President Maithripala Sirisena will soon visit China again on an invitation extended to him by President Xi Jinping, Skills Development and Vocation Training Minister Mahinda Smarassinghe said yesterday.
He told the media that President Sirisena had cultivated what he called an unparalleled prestige and respect among the global community and as a result he was held in high esteem by world leaders.
He said the canard being spread by the joint opposition that Sri Lanka under the consensual government was aligning with the West was baseless and malicious. The minister said the Maithripala Sirisena government followed a foreign policy based on mutual respect, understanding and non alignment.
"China has been Sri Lanka's friend in good times and in bad and has never done anything hostile to Sri Lanka. Therefore, we always treat China as one of our best friends, investors, entrepreneurs and Chinese tourists are always welcome.
The invitation President Sirisena received to participate in the G7 summit in Japan was a reflection of the confident and respect bestowed upon Sri Lanka led by him. They appreciate the efforts taken by him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to restore the rule of law, strengthen democratic institutions and human rights, end to corruption and mismanagement. They regard President Sirisena highly for voluntarily pruning his executive powers through the 19th amendment to the Constitution which is a rare and magnanimous act on his part, the minister said.
He said the President took a personal interest in passing the 19th Amendment by a two-thirds majority.
As a person who directly interacted with the global agencies on behalf of Sri Lanka under the previous administration I know how Sri Lanka was treated by the international community. The current President and Prime Minister have totally changed that hostile and invasive attitude towards Sri Lanka and the people are reaping the benefits now. The EU has lifted the ban fish exports from Sri Lanka while the GSP+ facility is expected to be revived before the end of this year. The Japanese government recently granted Sri Lanka 44 billion Yen," the minister said.
He said Sri Lanka would receive the first tranche of the US$1.5 billion IMF loan this month and the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (IDB) would follow suit and offer further financial assistance to Sri Lanka.
The minister said two teams of investors had already visited Sri Lanka from Germany and Austria following the President's visit to those countries while the international community no longer accuses Sri Lanka human rights violations. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The achievement by Maldives and Sri Lanka demonstrates the resolve of these countries and the Region as a whole to eliminate all neglected tropical diseases [NTD], which have no reason to continue and mar the lives of people, Poonam Khretrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, said.
Eliminating NTDs is also critical to sustainable development goals which emphasises on no one being left behind, the WHO release added.(The Hindu)

Weliwita writes to Singapore Immigration Authority
	
Carlton Sports Network (CSN) Chairman Rohan Weliwita who was deported from Singapore on Tuesday morning, had written to the Singaporean Immigration and Checkpoints Authority requesting the reason for refusing him admission to that country.
Mr. Weliwita was deported from Singapore after three hours of interrogation when he arrived there to attend the Broadcast Asia Exhibition.
In a letter to the Singaporean Immigration Authority on Friday, he said he was in possession of a confirmed return ticket and a confirmed hotel reservation for his stay.
I am the Chairman of CSN TV in Sri Lanka. The Immigration Authority did not allow me to enter the country. I was deported to Sri Lanka on the same day and was not given any reason for deportation, he said.
Mr. Weliwita said he treated Singapore his second home as he was a regular visitor and that he had never violated rules and regulations of Singapore.
I have never faced a situation like this before. I believe you will understand the embarrassment I faced at the airport he said.
