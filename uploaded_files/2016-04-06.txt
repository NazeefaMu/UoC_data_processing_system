?A bull, sorry, a heifer in a China shop?
	
There is a purohita in yahapalanaya who does not attend his office these days.
In the absence of the purohita, a close fair relative of the purohita has taken over the business of running the office. And no responsibility in respect of any of the functions assigned to this office has been delegated to the deputy purohita, they say.
The fair one now occupying the purohita?s chair is said to be running the affairs with an iron hand and has already made a veritable mess of it as a result. While exercising her powers indiscriminately like the proverbial monkey armed with the barber?s razor blade, she has gone to the extent of ordering the withdrawal of the monthly fuel allowance being paid to the secretary. ?She is a bull, sorry a heifer, in a China shop,? an employee said.?
The working of the entire office may grind to a halt soon, if this fair one continues to helm the administrative machinery, they say. ?

A land deal that marks a milestone in the history of prime estate business
	
?
If you heard that a 53-perch block of land had been sold for a price as high as Rs.530 million, you would surely presume it should be a block located in a commercial centre or a precious residential area in Colombo!
?
Well, if you presumed so, you are mistaken.
This precious piece of land is situated in a city in our upcountry renowned for its scenic beauty and cool climate.?
The tycoon who readily purchased this land which is currently the premises of a fuel-related business venture is said to be a member of a very high political family in the country. ?He has picked this land as the site for a multi-billion venture he has planned to launch, they say.
According to the leaders of the country?s prime estate business, this land deal marks a historic occasion where a perch of prime land had fetched the highest ever price in our country!

This town off Giruwapattu where the racket is being operated is also well known as a hub of tuition classes. And the decoys employed by the kingpin of the racket lure the young girls attending the tuition classes to rest houses and hotels where they are seduced and forced to pose in the nude before video cameras.?
This racket is no longer a secret to the people in the area. But they hesitate to stage an open protest against it for fear of retaliatory action by the sons of the powerful politicians, reports say.

AR Rahman?s Colombo Concert postponed
	
Music sensation 'Isai Puyal' AR Rahman?s Colombo concert scheduled for April 23 has been postponed indefinitely following protests from anti-Sri Lanka groups and posters being stuck outside his Chennai residence, Indian media reported.
However, the organisers say that the postponing has nothing to do with the posters.
The composer recently performed 3 shows back-to-back in Chennai and for the first time in Madurai and Coimbatore.
The grand show in Colombo was to witness AR Rahman and nineteen of India?s best male and female artists on one stage, for the first time in Sri Lanka.
In the past few days, posters were put up outside the Chennai residence of Rahman, asking him how he can shake hands with the government which is accused of killing Tamils.
When The News Minute contacted the organisers HALS Studios, they said that the reasons cited for postponing are rumors and it is only due to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays, because of which there are administrative and logistical difficulties, that the show was postponed.
Rahman has announced his next Concert in Malaysia on May 4, 2016.

The purohita handling foreign affairs is an unhappy man these days because high political authorities in yahapalanaya keep on making announcements running counter to the promises held out to certain foreign countries which are keen on granting economic and other aid to this country.
?
The manner in which probes are being conducted into wrong-doings by powerful authorities under the previous regime too have come in for flak from both the ?powerful Union in the West and Uncle Sam and they have also asked the purohita to account for this situation, they say.
The purohita is said to have expressed his regret to these world powers that the authorities above him have made it a habit to contradict the policy stances on certain issues he had already made known to the international community much to his embarrassment.?
The purohita has also reportedly complained that his request to have a dialogue with him before making public announcements on matters coming under the purview of his Ministry has been studiously ignored.

With reference to the No-confidence motion against Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, his media secretary Danushka Ramanayake said yesterday that his minister has not been named as the accused in the hit and run accident either by the courts or the police.
Mr. Ramanayake said the aggrieved party did not mention Mr. Ranawaka as the suspect in the original complaint. He said the second complaint had been made by a group implicating his minister?s name.
However, police investigations were in progress. ?My minister?s name has not been indicted or named as an accused in the case. Therefore it is totally unwarranted to implicate his name,? Mr Ramanayake said.
Further, he said the current situation of making allegations against his minister had arisen after the two young men who gave evidence on February 29 had come up with a different story five days later.
Also Mr. Ramanayake said the courts had given an order to the police to investigate mobile phones of MP Udaya Gammanpila and former MP Tiran Alles. He said such an investigation will help reveal true facts on the incident. (Kelum Bandara)

The leaders of the Betel leaf party held a series of propaganda meetings at the grassroots level across the country in the recent past. ?Some of these meetings held to strengthen the party organization at the periphery ended in chaos when organized attempts were made to sabotage them by interested groups from within the party.?
?
At several meetings, speakers billed to speak slipped away instead of facing noisy protests, boos and catcalls.
A meeting held in the Galle area the other day too ended in a big commotion when organized groups succeeded in sabotaging it the usual way. As sections of the crowd began hooting and jeering at the organizers and guest speakers, some people started hurling stones and other missiles at the stage. A deputy purohita, incidentally, the Diyawanna member functioning as the party?s organizer for the area, made several appeals to boisterous crowds in vain to stop the ruckus they were raising... And when the situation took a turn for the worse, the organizers decided to call it a day and leave the scene unscathed.
The ring leaders of the mob attack on the meeting remained at the venue of the meeting to share the fun of having successfully carried out their plan. ?
They had brought some bottles too to celebrate the occasion and some of them were already drunk and boisterous.?
?Macho, didn?t we carry out our job to the letter?? ?One mob leader exulted.?
?But I feel we have done a dirty thing, Machang. We hooted at our own party leaders,? another party supporter repented.
?What are we to do? Our own man who organized the meeting wanted us to organize the ?boo squad? and break it up. And we did our part well!? the first mob leader replied.
?But our man won?t get the blame. He will continue to be in good terms with the party leaders. We become the culprits at the end of the day,? an elderly man moaned.
