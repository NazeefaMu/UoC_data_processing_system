Ranil vows to rescue country from debt trap
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government would rescue the country from the debt trap without leaving the challenge of resolving it to the future generations.
We will not leave the challenge of resolving the issue of debt to the future generations. We will resolve it in this generation, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Speaking at the UNPs 70th anniversary celebrations today, he apologized to the nation for whatever wrong his party had done to the nation in the past.
I am proud as a UNPer for the lot of good things the party had done to the nation. But as a party, we have taken wrong decisions as well. I apologize for all the wrong things the UNP has done, he said.
This is not the time to talk about the past as the county should go forward steadily. It should go forward to fulfill the aspirations of the people, to rescue the country from the debt trap, he said. (Yohan perera)

Sri Lanka national with LTTE links deported from India
	
The Indian police yesterday deported Sudhan Subbiah (37), a Sri Lankan national having LTTE links.
Subbiah was picked up from Lohegaon airport on September 1 while he was trying to fly to Germany on a fake Indian passport.
A police team handed over Subbiah to immigration officials at the Sahar international airport in Mumbai on Thursday night. He was put on a Colombo-bound plane around 3.10am.
Subbiah had allegedly tampered with the passport of one Marimuthu Raju, a resident of Alangottal in Tamil Nadu, and pasted his own photograph. He was detained by the Intelligence Bureau at the airport here on suspicion before he could board a Frankfurt-bound flight on September 1.
Subbiah was under the observation of the Airport police station after the foreigners registration office restricted him from leaving Pune. The Sri Lankan embassy in Mumbai confirmed that Subbiah was a resident of Tiruvelli East, near Jaffna, and issued ham a temporary passport as he had lost the original one in Tamil Nadu.
A police officier said, "After completing Class XI at Songuda Hindu College in Jaffna in 2000, Subbiah completed an automobile mechanic course at Kokwil Technical College, Jaffna. He worked at an LTTE army unit camp and received arms training before leaving it in 2005."
The officer added, "Subbiah used to ferret out landmines and undertook house painting contracts before leaving for Dubai where he worked as a supermarket salesperson till 2014. He came to Chennai in June last year on a tourist visa and lived in Valasaravakkam. He began looking for opportunities in Europe and, finally, landed a job in Germany."
Subbiah was sent back as senior police officials decided not to register a complaint against him as he would end up staying in India for an indefinite period, the official added. (Times of India)

We should rise up for unity: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today all Sri Lankans should rise up for unity just as late Anagarika Dharamapala said Sinhalese should rise to save their nation from the colonial powers.
The vision of unity was the policy of the UNP when it was first launched in 1946 but we have not been able to fulfill it so far. We still talk about unity 70 years later, he said.
President Sirisena expressed these views while speaking at the UNPs 70th anniversary celebration at Campbell Park this morning.
He said the dream of United National Party founder leader and countrys first Prime Minister DS Senanayake to achieve political and economic freedom through unity was yet to be fulfilled.
We have yet to realize UNP Founder Leader DS Senanayakes mission of achieving political and economic development through unity and to prevent the international forces from intervening in the countrys sovereignty, to safeguard the heritage of majority community, and the heritage of others and to safeguard Buddhism while giving the freedom for other religions. This failure had resulted in a 30- year-old war, President Sirisena said.
All Sri Lankans should rise to fulfill this dream. Late Anagarika Dharamapala said Sinhalese should rise to save their nation from the colonial powers. I call all Sri Lankans to rise up for unity, the President also said.
He said majority of the 6.2 million votes he received at the last Presidential elections were from the UNPers. I thank you for inviting me for the 70th anniversary of the party which gave me majority of votes at the presidential election, he added (Yohan Perera)
