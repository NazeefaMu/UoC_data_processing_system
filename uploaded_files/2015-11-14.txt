JVP has control in country?s political sphere: Anura
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday said it was in control in the country?s political sphere and the resignation of Minister Tilak Marapana and the President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to handover the responsibility of defending the seas outside Sri Lanka were ample proof of it.
These sentiments came from Party leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and General Secretary Tilvin Silva at the ?Il Maha Samuruwa? - a ceremony held to commemorate the party?s slain leader Rohana Wijeweera and others who were killed 26 years ago.
He said the party would engage in lobbying in the strongest way in the near future against some government moves as it had become a dire need of the hour. He said the situation would be the same with regard to the midterm economic programme of the government.
?The midterm economic programme of the government cannot be allowed to go ahead as it is out to sell off state entities to the private sector and suppress the working class by merging the EPF and ETF and its administration into a private body while bringing in unfriendly reforms to the present pension scheme. ? We will lobby strongly against these moves using our present political strength,? he said.
Mr. Silva said the decision by President Sirisena to handover the responsibility of safeguarding the seas of Sri Lanka came as a result of JVP?s say in the political arena today.
Referring to the drama regarding Front Line Socialist Party Leader Kumar Gunaratnam, his abduction and his return to the country during the previous regime was part of a political gimmick. Mr. Silva denied the allegation made by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa that the JVP leader had requested the then government to abduct Mr. Gunaratnam.
?The JVP had no reason to get Mr. Gunaratnam abducted as neither he nor his party was ever a threat to us,? he said. Also he played down the alliance between JVP former Leader Somawansa Amarasinghe and former Minister Wimal Weeraansa stating that it was just a game of survival in the backdrop of political bankruptcy.

Paris attacks: ISIS claims responsibility;128 killed
	
	ISIS claimed responsibility for gunfire and blasts that targeted six sites Friday night in Paris, killing 128 people in one of Europe's deadliest massacres in?recent years.
	In an online statement distributed by supporters Saturday, the terror group said eight militants wearing explosive belts and armed with machine guns attacked precisely selected areas in the French capital.
	In addition to the people killed, 180 others were injured, according to the Paris Police Prefecture. More than half of them are in critical condition.
	President Francois Hollande blamed the attacks on ISIS, calling it "an act of war" by the militants. He said it was planned from the outside -- "with inside complicity."
	"When the terrorists are capable of doing such acts, they must know that they will face a France very determined," he said.
	In the chaotic aftermath of the attacks, there was no clarity on the number of casualties.
	Earlier, the Interior Ministry put the death toll at 153 people Friday, but a day later, the Paris police lowered it to 128 people.
	Gunmen hit Friday night when bars and restaurants were bustling with residents and tourists. When they stormed in, glass shattered under the rage of bullets. Excited weekend chatter turned into panicked screams.
	One of the targets was near a soccer match as France played world champion Germany. Terrified fans huddled together and streamed onto the field after blasts went off. Others hugged.
	At the Bataclan, a concert hall where most of the fatalities occurred, fans were listening to American rock band Eagles of Death Metal when the blasts started.
	"People yelled, screamed," said Julien Pearce, a radio reporter who was there. "It lasted for 10 minutes. Ten horrific minutes where everybody was on the floor covering their head."
	Eight terrorists are dead following the attacks on six locations in Paris and nearby areas, prosecutor's spokeswoman Agn?s Thibault-Lecuivre said.
	The prosecutor's office said it cannot confirm whether all terrorists have been killed because it has not determined the total number of attackers.
	Of the eight, seven died in suicide bombings, officials said.
	Most of the deaths were inside the Bataclan concert hall, where a witness said gunmen stormed in, firing rifles and shouting, "Allah akbar." At least 80 people died in the attack there.
	Earlier Friday, the Interior Ministry had put the death toll at the concert hall at more than 100.
	Later, the Paris prosecutor said the number of dead at the hall was "around 80." The death toll is expected to rise.
	Witness describes concert 'bloodbath'
	"We lay down on the floor not to get hurt. It was a huge panic," Pearce said. "The terrorists shot at us for 10 to 15 minutes. It was a bloodbath."
	The gunmen seized hostages before French police stormed in and rescued dozens of people.
	Four attackers were killed at the concert hall, including three who were wearing explosives belts, police spokesman Michel Cadot told France Info radio.
	Michael Dorio, brother of Eagles of Death Metal drummer Julian Dorio, said he spoke to the musician after the attack.
	Dorio said when his brother and his band mates heard the gunshots, they stopped playing, took off backstage and exited.(CNN)

Paris has been rocked by a string of deadly attacks, leaving at least 120 people dead in several locations. President Fran?ois Hollande has declared a state of emergency.
The death toll in attacks across six sites in Paris could exceed 120, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on French television early Saturday. He said at least five assailants have been neutralized.
At least 100 people were killed at the Bataclan theater in Paris' 11th arrondissement, where scores of hostages had been held. Police in Paris told NBC News that several people had also been shot at a restaurant in the nearby 10th arrondissement in Paris.
Death toll reports varied in the confusion of the immediate aftermath of attacks.
Earlier, Paris police officials said that security forces killed at least two attackers in the theater, ending the siege.
French President Fran?ois Hollande ordered a state of emergency in Paris and closed the country's borders after the violence broke out.
A police union official told the AP that there were two suicide attacks and a bombing near the Stade de France, north of Paris. At least three people were killed near the stadium, Gregory Goupil of the Alliance Police Nationale told the AP.
"Terrorist attacks of an unprecedented magnitude are in play in Paris. It's horror," Hollande said.
"I've asked for military reinforcements to make sure that no other attack can happen," Hollande said.
Hollande traveled to the Bataclan theater early Saturday morning.
"For all those who've seen these atrocities, rest assured ? we want to say that we will bring the fight against terrorism and will be without pity because when terrorists are capable of such atrocities, it will certainly be faced with a determined France, a united France." he said from the site of the carnage.
Hollande would stay in Paris and wouldn't attend the G20 summit in Turkey, according to the French government. An additional 1,500 soldiers had been mobilized, the government said.
Police in Paris urged people in the city to stay inside.
Officers were being dispatched to sites around the 10th arrondissement, which is about five miles from the Stade de France, police told NBC News. It was unclear if the incidents were related.
A Europe 1 journalist who was in the concert hall said there were two or three unmasked attackers with automatic weapons. He said they "began to fire blindly in the crowd," and the attack lasted at least 10 minutes.
"Everybody ran to the stage, there were scenes of stampeding," he said. "The assailants had time to reload at least three times."
Alexandre Bims, 18, was entering Stade de France when he heard an explosion. "We thought it was a gas leak, but then we saw people on the floor that were not moving," Bims told NBC News. "The police officers did not know what to do, they were choked and dizzy," he said.
"There was a second explosion, we saw someone who lost an arm," Bims said, adding that after the second blast, he started running.
"After five minutes, we heard a third explosion," he said.
"This is an attack not just on Paris; it's an attack not just on the people of France. But this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share," President Barack Obama said in response to the violence.
"We're going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice," Obama said, adding that he did not want to speculate about who was responsible for the attacks.
"It appears there may still be live activity and dangers that appear as we speak," Obama said at about 5:45 p.m. ET (11:45 p.m. ET in Paris).
British Prime Minister David Cameron said, "I am shocked by the events in Paris tonight. Our thoughts and prayers are with the French people. We will do whatever we can to help."
France has been on edge since Islamic extremists attacked the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store early this year. Twenty people, including three attackers, were left dead in the slaughter.
The Bataclan theater is about a miles away from the Charlie Hebdo offices. The American band Eagles of Death Metal were scheduled to play at the theater Friday night.
JoEllen Hill-Hughes, the mother of lead singer Jesse Hughes, said on Facebook that all of the band members were safe.

Rajitha retaliating: Wijeyadasa
	
Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe claimed Minister Rajitha Senaratne was accusing him falsely that he was protecting Avant Garde, as an act of revenge as the latter lost his parliamentary seat in 1994 as a result of a case filed by him in the Appeal Court.
Minister Rajapakshe said he never appeared on behalf of Avant Garde but he only spoke of the appropriateness of the Attorney General?s decisions.
"Rajitha Senaratne is always blaming other ministers when speaking as the cabinet spokesman and the President had advised him on such matters. He was appointed as a national list member in 1994 by the present Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Then he was a consultant to the Health Advisory Committee. During this period he continued to supply dental medicine and equipment to the army," he said.
The Minister also said he filed a case against corruptions committed during this period. He was found guilty and expelled from the parliament membership.
He said a cabinet spokesman should be intelligent and speak decently. (Diana Udayangani)
