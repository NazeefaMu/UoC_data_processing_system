AIA Insurance helps Nuwara Eliya community live healthier, longer, better lives.
	
AIA Insurance held a Health Camp in Nuwara Eliya recently as part of an effort to promote health and wellness in the community. The camp was conducted at a public school and was open to the students, their parents, teachers and the community, providing them with health assessments and access to important information regarding health and wellness. Medical testing, onsite doctor consultations and virtual consultations with specialists were operationalised, in addition to a session on ?healthy living for kids? by a specialist doctor. AIA?s team also handed out apples and oranges to the students, so as to encourage a healthy diet.?
In addition to the Health Camp, over 50 of AIA?s employees from Colombo and other regions colour-washed two of the school?s buildings which had depleted over time, so that the students had a clean and conducive learning environment, which is a key part of healthy living. The labour and effort put by AIA?s staff into adding a new coat of paint is reflective of their commitment to making a positive difference to the lives of the school?s 160 students. Notably, AIA?s CSR initiatives are intended at bringing together AIA?s staff in fulfilling AIA?s mission to help the communities we serve live longer, healthier, better lives.

An ultimatum, ?Do the job  or get out!?
	
?
Yahapalanaya coalition partners from time to time in the recent past had met the Betel Leaf secretarial one and presented to him numerous proposals designed to add muscle to the tottering alliance.
?
The secretarial one had received the files containing these proposals with a show of much enthusiasm and the party leaders had presumed that Number One would soon summon them for deliberations given the obvious urgency in translating these proposals into action with a national poll around the corner. Realizing that they had been waiting too long for a response from Number One, these leaders had decided enough was enough and had called on Number One for a direct exchange of views. ?We hope that you have received and gone through the proposals we have already submitted,? they had told Number One.
Number One had looked surprised and asked, ?What proposals?? Then only it had dawned on party leaders that the documents that they had given to the secretarial one should be still gathering dust in his office. Furious that they had been let down, the party leaders had later issued an ultimatum to the secretarial one, ?Either do the job or get out!?`

Auditor General only draws a salary of Rs. 69,000
	
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, who is also the Chairman of the National Audit Commission, said yesterday that he was drawing only a monthly salary of Rs. 69,000 which is sufficient only to foot his monthly electricity and telephone bills.
He said he was not paid the salary increment due to him for the past three months.
Mr. Wijesinghe stated that although he was not working as the Auditor General and the Chairman of the National Audit Commission for financial gain it was only right that he be an acceptable salary.
While a motion for the payment of a salary increment with retrospective effect from November 23, 2015 and other relevant remunerations to Mr. Wijesinghe had been included in the Order Paper in Parliament for the approval of the House, it was withdrawn by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella on the day it was to be taken up on August 23 with the hope of re-submitting it for approval on a later date.(Shiran Ranasinghe)

Bond scam gets a mate!
	
?
A story that has gone viral in political circles says that an advisor of a Ministry has received a massive commission and this bonanza has been shared by three to four persons involved in a tender affair, they say.
?
The tender that brought a fortune to these people is related to the construction of a highway, sources say.
According to the sleuths who uncovered the scam, the company that offered the hefty commission is from a country that has become a benefactor in recent times.
Earlier, when the awarding of the tender was getting stalled, certain parties had intervened to iron out the problems impeding the process and had thereby earned an ?award? for themselves.
Some JO members who first smelled a rat are said to be planning to bring the scam to the centre-stage with a big bang. ?This one equals only the Treasury bond scam in enormity,? a JO member remarked.??

Cases to be filed in Special HC against the Govt.: Susil
	
A number of cases were waiting to be filed in the recently established Special High Court, against the incidents of financial misappropriation occurred during the incumbent Government?s tenure, MP Susil Premajayantha said today.
Addressing the Joint Opposition?s weekly news briefing, the MP said there was ample evidence to prove the financial frauds which had been taken place under the present Government.
?The Special High Court is good. We too know how to file cases. More cases are waiting to be filed in this court when the Government?s tenure ends in 12 to 14 months.
?Not a single probe had been launched by the FCID or any other entity so far over the incidents of financial frauds of this Government,? he said.
He said the new building for the Agricultural Ministry was rented at a cost of Rs. 2.5 million per month and the rent had been paid for at least 10 months even before the Ministry moved into the new building.
He also said the Government had to pay a penalty of USD 98 million when the agreement to purchase four Airbus aircraft was cancelled.
?This Government accused the previous Government of paying Rs.1.5 million to the then SriLankan Airlines? CEO. However, the new CEO has been paid a salary of Rs.3.5 million. These are only a handful of financial misappropriations committed by this Government,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the MPs who recently defected and joined the JO would take part in the protest organised by the JO on September 5.
?All of us decided to pledge our support and join this protest which will be held against the Government,? he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Clinical waste accumulates in Colombo National Hospital
	
Clinical waste were dumped behind the Epilepsy centre in Colombo National Hospital since last month causing health issues, Daily Mirror learned.
It was observed that among the clinical waste there were body fluids and surgical waste such as gauze and cotton filled with blood.
When contacted National Hospital Acting Director Dr. W.K Wickremesinghe said that a tender has been granted to a private firm by the Health Ministry to transport the waste and incinerate.
However, Dr. Wickremesinghe said that following a Court order the waste disposal site owned by the private firm was banned therefore the company had faced difficulties in finding a suitable location immediately.
?The company however, did not stop collecting the trash but their daily collecting quantity had reduced. So the waste is now accumulating in a larger quantity than the company takes away,? he said.
Dr. Wickremesinghe said the matter was already refered to the Health Ministry as the Hospital authorities does not have any link with the company.
He also explained that the matter was a common issue among the Government Hospitals in Colombo District as it was the same company which collects clinical waste from all the hospitals in the district.
However, Dr. Wickremesinghe added that the hospital authorities had found several temporary locations to store the waste to minimise the health hazardous caused by the waste until the company resolve the matter.
Meanwhile, Speaking to Daily Mirror, All Ceylon Nurses? Union (ACNU) Acting President H. M. S. B. Madiwatte charged that the Health Ministry had not taken sufficient effort to resolve the matter.
He said that there is a risk of spreading severe diseases especially if these waste mix with the drainage water and contaminate with the river water.
?ACNU would like to convey our strong displeasure to the health authorities including the subject minister over the lethargic attitude to resolve the issue,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

German police under fire after far-right protests leave six injured
	
?
DPA, 28th AUGUST, 2018- Police in the eastern German state of Saxony came under fire on Tuesday for failing to contain rival far-right and left-wing protests the night before that culminated in violent clashes.
The death of a 35-year-old German man - allegedly at the hands of two asylum seekers from Iraq and Syria - in the early hours of Sunday sparked two days of protests that were partially fuelled by the false claim the victim had intervened to protect a woman.
Police later denied this claim, which had been disseminated by right-wing groups on social media, saying only that the man had been involved in a verbal altercation with the two suspects, who have since been remanded in custody.
The protest on Monday drew some 5,000 far-right demonstrators and around 1,000 counterdemonstrators. Six people were injured.
A police spokesman later admitted that the deployment of officers to Chemnitz had not been large enough to separate the camps. Oliver Malchow, head of police union GdP, told German newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung that thousands of police staff cuts in recent years were responsible for the lack of control over right-wing violence.

God Skanda?s servants in legal tussle
	
Chief Kapurala Somipala Ratnayake sees summons being issued on him despite seeking the assistance of the law to block? kapurala Padmasiri Ranjith Adikaram from performing duties at the Kataragama Devale
?
Acting Basnayake Nilame and the Chief Kapurala of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya are to face charges on contempt of court for attempting to block the effect of a court order which had been given by the District Court and the Supreme Court on multiple occasions.? ?
Padmasiri Ranjith Adikaram, who possesses hereditary rights, was duly inducted as a kapurala in 1960. His hereditary right through his grandfather Manisappu, who was the Chief Kapurala of the devalaya, hasn?t been bestowed upon him by respective Basnayake Nilames since then.? ?
?
Finally, the DC Mount Lavinia issued writ of execution on 07/06/2017 on the request of the present acting Basnayake Nilame
?
As he wasn?t given a ?thewawa? (service) month to perform devala rituals, he had to seek legal action (case no: 258/97/SPL) against the Basnayake Nilame, who was vested with the powers to allocate thewawa months to kapuralas. After more than two decades of multiple legal battles, the District Court (DC) of Mt. Lavinia in May this year ordered the acting Basnayake Nilame to allocate a ?thewawa? month for the plaintiff- Adikaram- and hand over the keys to him.? ?
Despite the court directives, the acting Basnayake Nilame deliberately failed to take over the keys from self-proclaimed Chief Kapurala, Somipala Ratnayake, when Padmasiri Adikaram went to the official residence Basnayake Nilame on August 12 to take over duties for the month of August (Nikini) as per the judgement. DC Mt. Lavinia also ordered the Government Agent of Monaragala, Deputy Inspector General of Police and Superintendent of Police Monaragala to facilitate the handing over of the functions of kapurala to Adikaram.? ?
Although allegations have been made by Somipala Ratnayake against Adikaram, for not being eligible to perform rituals as a kapurala, which was the reason for him (Ratnayake) not to hand over the keys, it is known that the latter has received proper training by going through the sacred ritual ceremony known as ?gewadduma? by his grandfather Manisappu, the then Chief Kapurala. Although he has performed the rituals together with his grandfather, he has not been given a separate ?thewawa? month to perform his duties and rituals of his own from the time he was inducted nor after his grandfather?s demise despite many requests being made to the respective Basnayake Nilames.? ?
This led Adikaram to seek legal action against the Basnayake Nilame and the other parties involved. The case was filed in October 1997 (No: 258/97/SPL) in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia against the then Basnayake Nilame Yasasiri Kasturiarachchi. The case concluded on December 13, 2005, as the plaintiff, Adikaram, and the respondent (by which time Nilanga Dela was the Basnayake Nilame) entered into a settlement.? ?
?My father too was a kapurala, but resigned from office in 1955 to contest for the post of Basnayaka Nilame with W.A. Ratwatte, but was unsuccessful. As my grandfather was the chief kapurala during this time, many requests were made thereafter to re-instate my father as a kapurala which was never allowed by Ratwatte and his successors with the influence of few other kapuralas till his demise in 1994. Although I have the hereditary rights to perform the rituals alone, the respective Basnayake Nilames never allocated a ?thewawa? month for me citing varied reasons which led me to file legal action in 1997 against the then Basnayake Nilame Yasasiri Kasturiarachchi at District Court, Mt. Lavinia,? Adikaram told the Daily Mirror.? ?
Following the settlement, Nilanga Dela was replaced by Shashendra Rajapaksa as the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya. After taking over the custodianship of the devalaya, Rajapaksa together with Somipala Ratnayake reportedly made futile attempts in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court to block Adikaram taking over as a kapurala for one month.? ?
Since then, several legal actions had been instituted by subsequent Basnayake Nilames and kapuralas in collusion with each other in order to prevent the execution of writ. Adikaram had to face lawsuits to obtain his lawful hereditary rights which had been denied of over the years, and which he claims are lawfully his.? ?
Subsequent to the settlement entered in 258/97/SPL, Somipala Ratnayake filed an application in terms of section 18 of the civil procedure code seeking an order to intervene in the settlement case which was dismissed by the DC Mt. Lavinia on July 28, 2006.? ?
?
On July 26, 2018 the district court of Colombo refused to grant an interim injunction sought by the petitioners
?
Failing to thwart Adikaram being given a thewawa month, the chief kapurala, without any hesitation filed an appeal against the said order in Court of Appeal (case no: CA/ LA/ 318/ 2006). The Court of Appeal by order dated January 12, 2007 too, dismissed Ratnayake?s application claiming that once a judgement is pronounced and the decree is entered, the Court no longer has the power to adjust an order given.? ?
However, before the Appeal Court order was delivered, in August 2006, a writ had been issued by the District Judge Mt. Lavinia (258/ 97/ SPL) to which Somipala Ratnayake filed objections. As a result, the DC recalled the writ on September 11, 2006.? ?
As it was a surprising turn, Adikaram had no other option, but to file a revision application (WP/HCCA/MT/13/2007) in Civil Appellate High Court, Mt. Lavinia, and the application had been allowed by the order dated July 15, 2009 and the writ re-issued on September 2009.? ?
Meanwhile the former Basnayake Nilame Yasasiri Kasturiarachchi, against whom Adikaram first filed the case, which was later entered into a settlement during Nilanga Dela?s tenure, filed another application in terms of Sections 839 and 344 of the civil procedure code to recall the writ claiming that Shasheendra Rajapaksa, who was the Basnayake Nilame at that time, was not bound by the settlement that was entered on December 13, 2005. But that application too was dismissed by the District Judge of Mt. Lavinia on March 31, 2010. Hence, by letter dated July 29, 2010, Shasheendra Rajapaksa allocated the month of March (2011) for Adikaram to discharge his rituals.? ?
Despite the allocation made by him, Rajapaksa once again filed an appeal (WP/HCCA/MT/14/2010) in the Civil Appellate High Court Mt. Lavinia, but that too was dismissed on February 9, 2011.? ?
This made Rajapaksa to file an appeal in the Supreme Court (SC/Appeal/ 116/2011) and the SC too dismissed the same with cost on April 4, 2014 claiming the appeal had no merit.? ?
Before Adikaram started performing the rituals in the allocated thewawa month, a third party to the dispute, Mahabethme Secreatary of Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya- Dayananda Dissanayake- in an agreement with some of the kapuralas, made an application (SC/ FR/ 189/ 2014) against Basnayaka Nilame Shashendra Rajapaksa and others seeking to sidestep the Judgement delivered in SC/ Appeal/ 116/ 2011. Ironically SC 189/2014 was a Fundamental Rights application. This application changed the landscape of Hulftsdorp by a bench presided by Hon. Mohan Peiris with an interim order preventing Adikaram from taking over as kapurala. However this interim order too was dissolved by the Supreme Court by a bench presided over by then Chief Justice K Sripavan on October 28, 2016. Upul Jayasuriya PC appeared for Adikaram and was opposed by several President?s counsels.? ?
It was Shasheendra Rajapaksa, through other kapuralas, who got Dayananda Dissanayake to file the lawsuit seeking to circumvent the SC judgement given in October 2016,? Adikaram claimed.? ?
?
Never allowed?to rest?
The Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya was never allowed to rest. Interested parties got him to file another matter in the Court of Appeal and obtain an order preventing Adikaram from taking over as kapurala for a period of one month as per the order of the District Court of Mt. Lavinia.? ?
Meanwhile Adikaram sought a writ naming the then Basnayake Nilame D.P. Kumarage (Shasheendra Rajapaksa?s successor) as a party by application dated December 14, 2016 made by way of a motion to which the DC Mt. Lavinia issued on January 17, 2017.? ?
As a result, D.P. Kumarage filed an application in the DC Mt Lavinia seeking to recall the writ issued by the DC on 17th January 2017. The application was dismissed by the DC Mt. Lavinia on June 5, 2017.? ?
Kumarage thereafter filed a revision application and an Appeal against the order given in case No. WP/ HCCA/ MT/ 10/ 2017 (RA) and WP/ HCCA/ MT/ 25/ 2017 (LA), and the Court issued a stay order upon hearing both parties.? ?
While proceedings were pending in the above revision and appeal applications, Kumarage also preferred a restore to the original application in CA/ RI/ 12/ 2017. The Court of Appeal issued a stay order on August 2, 2017 by Judge of the Court of Appeal Justice Nawaz which prevented Adikaram from taking over. This application was supported by Romesh De Silva PC and an array of juniors against Adikaram.? ?
Subsequent to these moves, Kumarage had issues with the rest of the kapuralas which led him to withdraw all the applications filed by him in September 2017.? ?
According to Adikaram, when the writ was still in force, Buddhist Affairs Minister Gamini Jayawikrema Perera and the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs Nimal Kotawalagedara in September 2017, allocated five months to five trainee kapuralas, contrary to law.? ?
Adikaram further claims that although the power to allocate thewawa months are vested with the Basnyake Nilame, on the request of the self-proclaimed chief kapurala and his supporters, the Minister and the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, allocated months to perform thewawa to these trainee kapuralas who are relatives of Somipala Ratnayake. ?When we filed a case against the Minister and Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs on charges of contempt of court for having bypassed the court ruling, Buddhist Commissioner accepted in courts that he acted against the court ruling?. There again Upul Jayasuriya PC appeared for Adikaram.? ?
?
According to Adikaram, when the writ was still in force, Buddhist Affairs Minister Gamini Jayawikrema Perera and the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs Nimal Kotawalagedara in September 2017, allocated five months to five trainee kapuralas, contrary to law
?
Finally, the DC Mount Lavinia issued writ of execution on 07/06/2017 on the request of the present acting Basnayake Nilame and due to further delaying tactics adopted by the kapuralas, who sought to thwart the execution of writ, the District Judge Mt. Lavinia gave a subsequent order on May 23, 2018 instructing the acting Basnayake Nilame to allocate the thewawa month to Adikaram.? ?
It was at this time that four out of five trainee kapuralas- Saman Priyantha Munasinghe, Lalith Anuruddha Munasinghe, Sanath Premakumara Ratnayake and Anura Thimbalath Ratnayake, who were allegedly illegally bestowed with thewawa months by Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera and Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, filed a case in the DC Colombo (SPL/106/2018) supported by the chief kapurala seeking an order to prevent the execution of writ which would hamper the operation of lawful orders given by the DC Mt. Lavinia in case 258/97/ SPL. This application too was supported by Romesh De Silva PC.? ?
?
Interim injunction refused
However on July 26, 2018 the district court of Colombo refused to grant an interim injunction sought by the petitioners. Romesh de Silva PC appeared for the plaintiffs while Upul Jayasuriya PC appeared for Adikaram.? ?
Being aggrieved by the said order, the four petitioners then filed a leave to appeal application in the High Court of Civil Appeal the same day which was supported on July 30, 2018 and the two Judges Justices Manilal Waidyasekera and D.M.R. Samarakoon issued an interim order to prevent Adikaram from being allowed to perform his functioning as a kapurala.? ?
Adikaram said that the order given on August 1, 2018 has not analysed the reasons given by the District Judge for having refused the Interim Injunction which was based on issues of legality having considered the order of the District Judge Mt Lavinia and the order made by the High Court of Civil Appeal Mt Lavinia.? ?
?As the judgement given was not acceptable, I made an appeal to the Supreme Court a few days later. The three-member bench that comprised Justices Eva Wanasundare PC, Prasanna Jayawardena PC and Nalin Perera annulled the order on August 10, 2018 which was given by the High Court of Civil Appeal on August 1, 2018.? ?
Manohara De Silva, appearing for the respondents opposing Adikaram, told the court that there were many reasons why the Civil Appeal judges issued the stay order preventing Adikaram from taking over for one month. It was at this stage that Justice Nalin Perera asked as to why the Civil Appeal judges failed to state the reasons behind issuing the stay order if there were so many reasons for it rather than giving the judgement in one paragraph.? ?
Meanwhile Adikaram affirmed that he would not take the money the devotees place in the pooja wattiya (offering basket), but will use that for the development of the sacred Kataragama Devalaya. ?Neither my grandfather nor my father took a cent from what the devotees kept in the pooja wattiya, although there is no rule that the kapuralas should hand over the daily collection towards the development of the devalaya. The reason why the present kapuralas are obstructing my path from taking over during the Nikini month to perform my rituals, is in fear of losing their daily collection which exceeds more than Rs.2 million a day. It?s a colossal amount of money. If I am given the thewawa this month, they are losing their ?income? from this month?s puja watttiya which would be in the region of Rs 60 million.? ?
?When I went to take over the keys of the devalaya to perform my rituals on August 12 as per the court order, the acting Basnayake Nilame handed over the letter of appointment to me and the salary (Two rupees and eighty two cents) allocated to perform the rituals. But he failed to handover the keys to me. When asked why he did not hand over the keys, I was told that they are with Somipala Ratnayake. Ratnayake who came to Basnayake Nilame?s official residence said that he cannot hand over the keys as he was not a party named in the case nor was he aware of any court order.
Astonishingly when he was showed the respective court orders, particularly the order issued by the District court of Colombo- where Somipala Ratnayake the self-proclaimed chief kapurala was a party to it- he was numb. He did not wish to look at it, but simply ignored our requests. The OIC Kataragama Police, who was present at the scene, refused to intervene to facilitate us to obtain the keys although the court had directed Monaragala DIG and SP to facilitate the handing over of duties to me through the Basnayake Nilame,? Adikaram further claimed.? ?
Although a police complaint had been lodged by Adikaram, he alleges that the Kataragama Police has so far failed to conduct an inquiry.? ?
When the OIC of Kataragama Police was contacted as to why the police has so far failed to conduct an inquiry and the reasons for why he could not intervene when acting Basnayake Nilame and Somipala Ratnayake did not hand over devalaya keys, despite there being a court order, the OIC said that the police did not have any authority to intervene in issues of the devalaya and can only provide security.? ?
?The power to hand over the keys is vested with the Basnayake Nilame and the police has to provide security to him. According to devalaya traditions we cannot enter the devalaya nor take the keys. We will inquire into this and report to the court. If the court sends the fiscal to implement the court order, then we will support him, till then we do not have any authority to intervene,? the OIC said.? ?
When contacted Somipala Ratnayake said that he was not a respondent to any law suit and was unaware of the fact that the court had given an order. Adikaram has not performed the sacred rituals ? gewadduma. So how can I hand over the keys to such a person? Once undergoing the gewadduma ritual, that person is given a letter of appointment by the Basnayake Nilame or the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. The Supreme Court order which is with me clearly states that I (Somipala Ratnayake) am not a party in the case and that I cannot hand over the keys to any person other than one who has undergone the gewadduma rituals. Whatever I have to say, I will tell in courts,? Ratnayake said. He did not comment on whether the handing over the key was the traditional responsibility of the Basnayake Nilame as stated by the Commissioner of Buddhist affairs.? ?
Although Ratnayake says that he is not a party to the case, this newspaper is in possession of court documents in the DC Colombo case (SPL/106/2018) to show that Somipala Ratnayake offered support to the four trainee kapuralas.? ?
When contacted acting Basnayake Nilame, Dilruwan Rajapaksa said that he had lodged a complaint with the Kataragama Police regarding this issue and added that he has no power to take the keys forcefully from Ratnayake. ?I am the acting Basnayake Nilame and there is a limit to discharging my duties. If the court hands over the keys to me I can give them to Adikaram, if not I do not have the power to take them from Ratnayake forcefully. Since this matter is in court, I cannot make further comments. Whatever information I have, I will present it in courts,? Rajapaksa claimed.? ?
In the order issued by Justice Buvenaka Aluvihare in the fundamental Rights application filed, seeking to stop Adikaram from taking over for one month, he has opined that if there is no finality to legal proceedings there will be chaos in the administration of Justice. What he said regarding this matter has been repeated many times and is a cardinal principle in legal parlance.? ?
Meanwhile District Judge of Mt. Lavinia last week issued summons on Chief Kapurala Somipala Ratnayake on contempt of court and the case will be taken up on August 30 at the Mt. Lavinia District Court.? ?

Hidden agenda in appointing commission on salary issue: Gammanpila
	
The decision to appoint a commission, supposedly for the purpose of solving the salary issues of railway employees, was a tactic to kill time until military personnel sent to India to be trained as train drivers, get back to fill in the void that is created when railway unions go on strike in the future, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) alleged.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his discussion with railway trade unions had assured them that the salary anomalies that exist would be rectified before October 31 by appointing a commission.
PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said this Government was fully aware that the commission was a red herring and would not produce any solution before the due date.?It is only a tactic being used until the army personnel sent to India return and are available to the government in case of an emergency,? the MP said.

Kamani is a 34-year-old mother of three from Bandarawela. Following a surgery for a brain tumour she was partially paralyzed. A distraught husband who is a farmer then took her to an Ayurvedic doctor. The treatment took a few months. However, it helped the poor woman to walk around once again.? ?
Clarence is a sub editor at a newspaper. A cardiologist at a private hospital recommended him a coronary bypass surgery after having found that his arteries were blocked. Clarence was distressed as he did not have the money to do the surgery immediately. Meanwhile, a friend suggested he should consult a well-known Ayurvedic practitioner in Anuradhapura. He did and following the treatment Clarence again did the tests at a hospital to see his condition and found that his arteries were clear.? ?
Varuna, an executive at a five star hotel in Colombo, met with an accident. One of his legs was broken as a result. A surgery was performed by a renowned doctor. However, much to the disappointment of this executive, the surgery was a failure and his leg kept dangling sideways after the operation. Varuna?s hopes of resuming work at the hotel were shattered. His family took him to an Ayurveda practitioner in Divulapitiya. He said he would fix the mistake of the surgery and make the patient walk again but that may take time. Varuna was asked to be warded at the Ayurveda hospital. Now the young man is receiving treatment at the hospital with a ray of hope.? ?
We could give a long list of instances where Ayurvedic practitioners have proven their versatility over western medical practitioners. That is why there is a need for a national health policy through which the government will give equal status to western medicine or allopathy, various forms of ayruveda, homeopathy and acupuncture. At present western medicine is given the highest priority and that may be one of the reasons why it is not a vocation but a big profit-making business, specially in the private health sector.? Furthermore in public hospitals, Ayurvedic doctors do not go on strike and cause suffering to tens of thousands of people, as does the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). Ayurvedic doctors also carry out humble and silent service.? ?
Most of us know the story about how the Buddha told his physician Jiwaka to go throughout the country and find even a single plant that did not have some medicinal value. The physician came back and said every plant he found did have some medicinal value. The same is true in Sri Lanka today but we have not allocated enough financial and human resources to find and develop these medicinal plants.? ?
Not only at government level this also need to be done at the home or family level. As we pointed out last week, despite urbanization and hundreds of apartment complexes coming up, there are several thousands of hectares of home gardens where people could grow not only grains, vegetables and fruits but also medicinal plants.? ?
We need to go into the highest stage of home gardens producing Green Medicine. By this way we could bring in powerful herbs that supercharge our health and target our most persistent issues such as stress, mental focus, hormone imbalances, energy levels, even ?incurable? chronic diseases.

Looking beyond leopards and their spots

Nature Interpretation Programme for jeep drivers
	SL visitors do not value our own resources
?
Although Sri Lanka is blessed with many national parks, that stand out as potential tourist attractions, lately they have discouraged foreigners from visiting them owing to various reasons. While the mushrooming number of jeeps inside national parks and the unruly behaviour of jeep drivers have been major concerns among visitors and environmentalists, much hasn?t been done to curb this menace. A total wildlife experience is much more than chasing after a leopard or a bear. But visitors experience the opposite inside most national parks in Sri Lanka. As a result, the number of visitors interested in seeing wildlife is on the decline. Foreign tourists bring massive revenue to national parks daily and this decline is a huge blow to the tourism industry and the economy on the whole.? ?
Identifying the need to discipline jeep drivers and encourage them to interpret the nature, the Federation of Environmental Organisations along with the Department of Wildlife introduced a Nature Interpretation Programme. This programme brings together conservationists and environmental experts who focus on educating jeep drivers and tourist guides on the flora and fauna, mammals and their behaviour while also teaching them to maintain park discipline along with etiquette and personal presentation.? ?
Hence the? DailyMirror spoke to Rohan Wijesinha, former Secretary of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) and Jehan Canagaretna who was also a member of the WNPS to find more about this initiative.? ?
?
Federation of Environmental Organisations? ?
The Federation of Environmental Organisations (FEO) was setup as a trust to work with other organisations on conservation issues. In total they have around 30 organisations which are affiliates of FEO. ?One major factor that influenced us to commence this initiative was a survey done on visitors to the parks,? said Wijesinha.?Foreign visitors contribute the biggest income to national parks. What influenced us was the fact that although 70% of the visitors saw a leopard, bear or an elephant, the experience they had was bad. This is a black mark not only against national parks, but the entire tourism industry. We need people to come back and tell their friends. So it?s a question of providing visitors with a quality service and not just quantity which we are doing now,? he said.?
A message sent by a foreign visitor read : A majority of foreign tourists have visited parks in Africa and have voiced their concerns over the unruly behaviour of the jeep drivers when spotting tuskers, bear and leopard. Some of them have visited and hoped the situation would improve, but alas they had not and definitely we are not coming again.? ?
?
Hence the jeep drivers are being trained to create a story around each park. Some of them don?t know the archaeological history of the parks
?
?These are the reasons why we came up with this idea,? Canagaretna added. ?Everybody criticizes the jeep drivers, but in reality nobody has told them that they are killing their own livelihood. The jeep drivers have not been trained and it is also the tour guide?s fault. Based on that we came up with this concept and we also got a few panelists who had much knowledge about conservation-related areas. For example Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya is doing the elephant conservation aspect of the programme and talking about the human-elephant conflict etc. Depending on the parks we have different experts coming in to talk to the jeep drivers. If we take Wilpattu for instance it has a history of itself. But the jeep drivers are more concerned about the leopard and they drive past these archaeological sites which the tourists would be interested to see. Hence they miss out on other things in the park while they chase after the leopard. Most foreigners haven?t seen the barking deer and other species we could see at Wilpattu and if it could be interpreted properly, it would add more value to their ride. There are many other small animals and birds that are in a national park, but they are often missed,? added Canagaretna.? ?
?
?
The? Programme? ?
Speaking further, Wijesinha said that taking all this into consideration the FEO started off with locations that are easier to handle. ?For example, Yala is a challenge as there are over 1000 jeep drivers at present and it would be too much of a task. Therefore we started off at Wilpattu and conducted one programme and it entails a couple of different aspects to the park. We speak about the park itself and for that we get an expert who knows the park well. Then we talk about the flora and fauna, mammals, reptiles, bird life etc. Through this we explain to the jeep drivers what they should be explaining to the tourists. For example if they see a painted stork they must talk about a key feature about it etc. Then we also teach them how to behave, how they should dress and how they should be addressing people etc. Here the biggest challenge is the language. Some of them would know German or Italian but they wouldn?t know English. In addition to that the Warden at the Park does a presentation about the DWC side of it. He speaks about the rules of the park, why they are there and how the drivers should behave keeping with the rules. From the feedback we received, we realized that it was the first time that the jeep drivers had participated in?
such a programme.
We also had an opportunity to show them our concerns as well. From our first programme we learned something for the second programme. After the first programme we gave them a questionnaire so that they could tell us what they thought about the programme. The second time we gave the questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the programme. As a result we were able to find out how the answers differed. We give them a certificate and we work with the DWC and the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) who endorses the certificate. So they will only use people who have followed the programme as they control 70% of the inbound operators in the country,? said Wijesinha.? ?
?
Hence the jeep drivers are being trained to create a story around each park. Some of them don?t know the archaeological history of the parks. It?s an easy option for the youth in these areas to become jeep drivers, similarly to the places where young people become three-wheel drivers
?
Hence the jeep drivers are being trained to create a story around each park. Some of them don?t know the archaeological history of the parks. It?s an easy option for the youth in these areas to become jeep drivers, similarly to the places where young people become three-wheel drivers. As you start offering a quality service one can easily start charging.? ?
?
Feedback process? ?
Such programmes require a feedback process to ensure that the drivers have adhered to what they have learned. But the programme is organised as and when funds are available. ?It?s difficult for us to monitor and it would be better if the DWC could do the monitoring,? Canagaretna said. ?We also can obtain feedback through the SLAITO companies. We tell the jeep drivers that we are monitoring their performance. We are trying to implement this programme in all the national parks in the country. With this programme we are also trying to impose a limit. The visitation to some parks needs to be regulated. For example the visitation to Udawalawa is similar to Yala. Most of the jeep drivers realised the importance of preserving the park because at the end of the day it?s their livelihood. What?s happening at Yala has come as a huge warning. The message is also going out to tourists and we are trying to encourage a total wildlife experience,? he added.?
?
??Speeding Jeeps within national parks have created much chaos Pic: AFP
?
Challenges? ?
The exorbitant rates charged by the travel guides are another issue. In most instances, tourists don?t get an experience worth the cost. Wijesinha further said that such exorbitant rates wouldn?t have been an issue if they give an experience worth the cost, but at the end of the day tourists don?t get either. One of the panelists is from SLAITO and he gives an input about how the tourists feel and the chaos going on in Yala. ?We are showing that the tourists are not coming for the chaos but to get a good experience. Another problem that the jeep drivers encounter is that they are allowed to go on their own with the tourists. This is due to the lack of rangers. So they have a language barrier and they are scared to talk in English because they feel ashamed. Another issue is that there is a glass partition that separates the driver from the tourists at the back. So they anyway can?t talk anything,?said Wijesinha.? ?
Sri Lankan visitors also create problems. As in most instances, they merely do not realise the value of our own resources. ?They go and pollute the place,? Canagaretna said with much disgust. ?If we go to India and Africa we wouldn?t drink the whole night and go for a safari ride the next morning. After all it?s your hard-earned money that you are spending. But this may not be so for locals. They would find the place fairly cheap enough and they would have a drink and go on the ride. So there are reasons why jeep drivers haven?t been behaving in the proper manner. Through this programme we are trying to tie it altogether. The more tourists say that they will not come, the jeep drivers should realise the risks they have in losing their jobs,?he reasoned.? ?
?
Yala is a challenge as there are over 1000 jeep drivers at present and it would be too much of?a task
?
Speeding jeeps within national parks have created much chaos, some even killing leopards and other mammals. According to Wijesinha the trackers and jeep drivers have mobile phones and when one of them spots a leopard, they will alert the others. ?So once another jeep driver is tipped they charge with the hope that they too would spot it,? he added. ?But obviously the animal doesn?t stay in one place. We want to change this thought-process and make it a total wildlife experience. We want them to think about the other mammals and birds other than only the leopard. It?s fun to watch elephant behaviour. One should go with an open mind to experience the park itself. Chasing the leopard is the biggest issue and that creates a lot of issues. It?s important to interpret nature around them and we hope we could slowly change their mind-sets through this programme,? added Wijesinha.? ?
?
A total wildlife experience is much more than chasing after a leopard or a bear
?
?
?We knew very little about wildlife?
The Daily Mirror also spoke to Asanka, a jeep driver, who participated in the programme. According to him this was the first time he got involved in such a programme. ?The session on elephants was very interesting. Dr. Sumith taught us about the behaviour of elephants. I started this job back in 2003 and we knew very little about the wildlife aspect of it. It is important that all jeep drivers attend this programme as we could gather more knowledge about various aspects of wildlife,?said Asanka.? ?
?
?
?Training should be mandatory for all jeep drivers??
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya said that through this programme jeep drivers will be taught how to park the vehicles without disturbing the animals. ?I focus on the elephant conservation aspect on a voluntary basis. Through this we train jeep drivers to observe and interpret what?s happening at an elephant gathering. If you observe a herd, many things are going on. So we want the jeep drivers to create a story around this event. They could observe the behaviours of males, how they behave during the musth season, how they choose a female etc.
We also discuss briefly about elephant communication. This programme will be quite effective and already the response has been positive. It should expand beyond Minneriya and we want to ensure 100% participation as we proceed with this initiative. In the long run we want to make sure that the DWC makes training a mandatory aspect for all jeep drivers and make this programme a monthly or a yearly workshop,? said Pilapitiya.?

A yahapalanaya bigwig had revealed a top secret to a JO heavyweight the other day.??

It was about why and how the no-confidence motion brought against Number Two, with much fanfare, fizzled out like a damp squib.
The yahapalanaya bigwig had confessed that a section of Blue Party members backing Number One was forced to give up the fight when their party senior, who figured in the latest Premier Stakes, announced his decision to beat a retreat at the eleventh hour.
The Blue Party senior?s about-turn after his earlier appeal for support to the former boss had come as a shock to the Diyawanna Blue Group.
By the way, the yahapalanaya bigwig had even confided in his JO colleague the million-dollar reason why he decided to back out at the last moment.
The secret had passed from ear to ear since its disclosure and the Blue senior finding that the jig was up had begun telling all and sundry that he had decided to quit politics and he would be out of the scene by the time of the next national poll, they say.

Operations of Galaha Hospital suspended
	
The operations of Galaha Divisional Hospital had been suspended because of the damages caused to the hospital after it was attacked by an angry mob yesterday in the wake of the death of a child in the hospital, Provincial Director of Health Services (PDHS) for Central Province Dr Shanthi Samarasinghe said today.
Dr Samarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that two medical officers attached to the Galaha Divisional Hospital had been transferred to the Provincial Directors? Office temporarily following the protests by residents.
?No doctor is prepared to go there at the moment for the hospital. The hospital has also been largely damaged due to the attack.
?No medical officer is ready to take on duties because of the tense situation followed by the child?s death,? she said.
She also said a team had been sent to the hospital yesterday in to determine the nature of the damages.
Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday urged Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera to conduct an impartial investigation into the incident and to immediately arrest the suspects involved in the attack.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Naveen de Soyza told a news conference that the doctor, who treated said the child had been obstructed from performing his duties by the relatives of the child.
He said the other Registered Medical Practitioner had engaged at the clinic at that time.
?When the only doctor who was available at the hospital had started treating the child, another two women in critical condition were admitted following a road accident.
?The doctor has treated them and sent them to the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital by the only ambulance at the Galaha Divisional Hospital,? he said.
?The doctor attended to the child again and had made arrangements to get an Ambulance from the Deltota Hospital to send the child to Peradeniya.
?Then, the relatives of the child have turned violent and attacked the doctor as well as the property,? he added.
He said there were around 200 hospitals across the country with only one doctor, similar to the Galaha Hospital.
He said that the situation would be more critical if people behave so during emergencies. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Suranga Rajanayake)

However as an adult, Megan took on the path of advertising and primarily worked as an art director, moving onto writing TV and print campaigns.? ?
Megan?s debut collection of poetry and prose titled Poison Apple will be launched by the British Council today. She defines this collection as a poetic journey of forbidden or unrequited love. ?We meet the characters in the beginning of the book, learn how they view love and lust as a male and female, and watch how they both deal with the eventual parting from different points of view. It is a wildly passionate relationship that is portrayed, so even the smallest of emotions is magnified manifold to make for better poetry!? she explains.? ?
Asked why she chose this particular style of poetry and prose, Megan admits that the style is simple but wouldn?t call it simplistic. She has chosen a much debated and unapologetic style for her literary pursuits. Brevity is key. ?The themes are dark and visually vivid. I?ve always found it hard to relate to heavy language, so I preferred to use an approachable, short style when writing. It also makes it much easier for my preferred publishing medium which is instagram.?? ?
?
Poison Apple will be officially launched by the British Council, Colombo today (August 29 )with a reading by the author at Orion City?All are?welcome.
?
Megan believes that the reader is free to interpret her work as it may have different connotations to different readers. She describes it as a story of two broken people --broken in their own ways-- who are drawn to each other because of, or despite their circumstances. Even though they know that their courtship is just that - a courtship. We see them wanting and hating each other, heightened in their feelings either way: Almost a doomed relationship from the onset and therefore tumultuous.??
Fitting her description, Poison Apple is presented in four parts, which accompany the reader through the ?befores?, ?durings? and ?afters? of a passionate relationship, likened to the bite of a forbidden fruit.? ?
?Memories of her were places??Sprawling vineyards and barren plains??On a shrinking planet??Within my veins???
Her style is nuanced, simple, explorative yet powerful as she converses with the reader. She is not an avid reader of poetry save Rumi and Cohen. Yet some of her biggest sources of inspiration are J.K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman and Haruki Murakami. Perhaps this reflects in her fresh and honest prose. ?I can never read heavy stuff, and therefore don?t write them either. Inspiration for this book in particular has come from a few ?adult? writers like Anais Nin & Leonard Cohen,? she says.? ?
Asked of any message that she wished to communicate through her work, Megan simply says: you?re never the only one. ?A recurring comment I received from those who have read the book, is that though they may have not related to the theme as a whole, there were at least three or four instances in which they felt like I?ve read their mind. It?s common for people to feel like they are the only ones going through something, until you find a whole universe of others who feel exactly as you do.?? ?
The young poet has no immediate projects in the pipeline and is uncertain of what the future holds. True to her style, she may take us all by surprise with her next venture. The book is currently available at Barefoot and on line at thelibrary.lk.? ?

## Title: Rethinking Anagarika Dharmapala?s Mindset and Activity

Rethinking Anagarika Dharmapala?s Mindset and Activity
	
?
Dharmapala?s large-scale global institution-building programmes were focused on the larger project of realizing his dream of a united Buddhist world
	?
	The material within the diaries, in Sinhala and English, enabled me to highlight the dual dimensions of the Dharmapala?s missionary and political zeal
	?
	It was a magical destination: by restoring Buddhism in this primordial spot Dharmapala hoped that the wonderful messages of Buddhism would conquer?the world
Sasanka Perera has recently introduced readers to a new book by Steven Kemper entitled Rescuing Dharmapala from the Nation (University of Chicago Press, 2015) ? a book which surveys the socio-political activities of the Anagarika Dharmapala in a refreshing manner. I have yet to get hold of the book, but Sasanka provides enough commentary to provoke a discussion.? ?
Within a context where Dharmapala aka Don David Hewavitarne is regarded as an influential Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist by many social scientists analysing Sri Lankan history and politics, Perera indicates that Kemper provides broader dimensions by re-situating Dharmapala ?within the Buddhist world of his time by ? focusing on his international activities in aid of Buddhist causes and cross-faith discussions.? Kemper?s new work, therefore, is a modification of the Protestant Buddhist thesis popularized in social science circles by Gananath Obeyesekere?s writings in particular.? ?
?
Perera underlines these points:? ?
?What manifests in Kemper?s descriptions of Dharmapala?s relentless travels and consistent speeches and writings are the dynamics of a tireless and almost single handed universalizing mission undertaken by an obstinately passionate man.?? ?
?Dharmapala?s large-scale global institution-building programmes were focused on the larger project of realizing his dream of a united Buddhist world? ? one which privileged Theravada Buddhism.? ?
Thus, says Perera, Kemper ?presents this enigmatic historical character in the complexity he deserves? ? while adding, here, his (Perera?s) own caustic side-shot at the deficiencies in Amunugama?s recent compendium The Lion?s Roar.? ?
During this welcome introduction to Kemper?s work, Sasanka Perera makes an important point: he highlights ?the enormous power vested in private capital in spearheading [Dharmapala?s] religio-political mission.? Furthermore, this funding was not from NGOs, but ?from individuals, which often meant himself.?? ?
?Himself,? I add, meant the fortunes built up by his father Don David Hewavitarne and his brothers in the contracting, merchandising and furniture building trades during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ironically, but not unusually, this means that the channels of capital formation and educational advancement in the English medium developed by the British colonialists in the nineteenth century paved the way for both Dharmapala?s world missionary outreach and his anti-colonial drive within Ceylon and India. These pathways have been illustrated previously in the researches of Ian Vandendriesen, KM de Silva, Kumari Jayawardena and others ? including here my researches on elite formation.? ?
Perera stresses that a ?significant portion of the material used by Kemper to weave his narrative comes from Dharmapala?s unpublished notes and diaries collecting dust and disintegrating in neglected archives in India, which many Sri Lankan researchers hardly know of.? This comment is on the mark ? but only partly. Perera does not seem to be cognisant of the fact that many of Dharmapala?s diaries are available in the Department of National Archives and the Maha Bodhi Society in Colombo.? ?
The diaries are indeed a treasure trove. Working on the diaries for the period 1890-1915, I was able to fashion two articles in the late 1990s. As indicated in the title of one of these essays, viz., ?For Humanity. For the Sinhalese. Dharmapala as Bosat Crusader,? the material within the diaries, supplemented by Dharmapala?s writings in Sinhala and English, enabled me to highlight the dual dimensions of the Dharmapala?s missionary and political zeal.? ?
?
FOR THE SINHALESE? ?
?For the Sinhalese? marks Dharmapala?s pro-Buddhist and pro-Sinhala endeavours together with their considerable chauvinist extremism. Both in his public canvas and in his diaries Dharmapala viewed the British and Christians as brutes, savages, demons, pagans and heathens. This was an inversion: he was deploying some of the verbal weaponry utilized by the British evangelists and ruling class in their readings of the ?natives.?? ?
However, in keeping with some of the writings in Sinhala in his day, Dharmapala also railed against the demala. the marakkala and the kocci. Rather innovatively, on one occasion he disparaged those whom he identified as ?hambamarakkala? and on another occasion in 1911 even directed a diatribe at the kocci demala. Restrained to Calcutta during World War One, he fired off two virulently anti-Moor letters to the Colonial Office in London as soon as he heard of the tough measures the British took against the Sinhalese in suppressing the riots of mid-1915. This line of bias was set within a critique of British rule.? ?
A striking strand in his thinking was a tendency to treat the subjectively-meaningful collective noun ?Sinhalese? as equivalent to the category ?Ceylonese.? In brief, the major part of the island?s population ? that of his ethnic group ? was rendered equivalent to the whole -- often in an unthinking and embedded manner. When associated with the prominent place commanded by the Sinhalese in the standard readings of the island?s history conditioned by the Mahavamsa and many school texts in the British period, the political implications were deadly.? ?
This thinking came to the fore in the ?revolution of 1956? and subsequent island politics. Dharmapala?s political writings (in English and Sinhalese) and such texts as DC Wijayawardhana?s The Revolt in the Temple embodied the ideologies driving these politics. As we well know now, these currents, in their turn, heightened the collective identity of the Sri Lankan Tamils and eventually spawned the militant movement for Eelam in the 1970s.? ?
?
Moreover, the diaries reveal that Dharmapala?s adoption of the Anagarika path of a Brahmacharya was linked to a self-perception of his life-path in the steps of the Buddha
?
My academic interactions at Peradeniya informed my pessimistic readings of the situation THEN in the early-mid 1970s. I was among those in Ceylon Studies Seminar circles at Peradeniya University who organised a full-day conference in Colombo entitled the ?The Sinhala Tamil Problem? in early October 1973. That gathering only deepened my pessimism. In my reasoning the equation of ?Sinhalese? with ?Ceylonese? embodied previously in Dharmapala?s writings and holding sway among significant sections of the Sinhalese populace in the 1950s-70s was a fundamental factor bedevilling political compromise and promoting Tamil extremism. I drafted an essay in Heidelberg in 1976 which eventually appeared in the journal Modern Asian Studies in 1978 and indicated that Tamil militarism was around the corner. It gives me little pleasure to point to this article and tell people today: ?I told you so.?? ?
?
FOR ?HUMANITY?? ?
In this segment of my article I deployed the material Dharmapala?s diaries in several ways. I showed that the influence of Orientalist thinking and Protestant values in Dharmapala?s thinking argued for by Obeyesekera et al was, indeed, powerful. For instance, Dharmapala valued ?science,? espoused a work ethic and railed against the ?uncleanliness? of the Sinhalese and their attachment to yaktovil (exorcisms).? ?
But the diaries also reveal his engagement with such Buddhist texts as the Visuddhimagga and the jataka stories over the course of time. They display the emergence from 1899 of his intellectual dissension from Colonel Olcott?s line of emphasis and his hostility to Annie Besant?s interpretations within the world Theosophy movement.? ?
?
?
THE PATH OF A BODHISATVA? ?
Moreover, the diaries reveal that Dharmapala?s adoption of the Anagarika path of a Brahmacharya was linked to a self-perception of his life-path in the steps of the Buddha. At his first visit to Buddha Gaya on 27th February 1891, he wrote: ?This morning at 4 I pledged myself to work for Humanity.? ? and a little later he records this commitment: ?I have to decide on the 17th inst. as to what life I should take and I decide it now. Bodhisatva life. Pure life and work for Humanity? (d/e 4 Sept. 1893) This meant a rejection of renunciatory asceticism in favour of bosat work in the world. It meant an emphasis on ?purity? and a rejection of ?selfishness.? It involved a constant inner battle with his own sexual desires ? such as those instigating masturbation.? ?
?May I remain pure, pure, pure. There is much work to be done and I must be consciously pure in my thoughts? (d/e 26 July 1909, emphasis his)? ?
?Last night [my] mind was disturbed by polluting sensual thoughts. When will this filthy body become emancipated from low desires? There is no possibility of my ever taking the sensual life. Nevertheless, disturbing tendencies at times overpower the higher nature? (d/e 14 June 1907)? ?
As I argued then, the terms ?pure? and ?morality? in Dharmapala?s usage can be considered renderings of the Buddhist concept of Suddha, which denotes virtue in thought, word, and deed. Linked to this tenet is (was) the concept of sila, the externalization of Suddha through injunctions supporting purity in word and deed.? ?
Studying the Dharmapala diaries was a revelatory and educational process for me as researcher. Though his terminology presented a Victorian and Orientalist flavour, it became clear that his readings of the world were directed by Buddhist ethics more than Protestant puritan values.? ?
?
This was one of my conclusions:? ?
?Dharmapala set forth on the Bosat path of the Buddha to reclaim Bodh Gaya, to spread the Dhamma in India and the world, to serve ?Humanity,? and to revive Sinhala Buddhist society: ?My life is pledged to the Cause of Humanity. May I be born again and again to help the Sasana. I will follow the footsteps of the Lord of Compassion? (d/e 18 July 1894, emphasis added). The reiteration is worth reiteration: his mission for humanity was to be in ?all [his] incarnations,? ?life after life? (d/e 27 Feb. 1891; 5 June 1894). ?? ?
In brief, this line of argument would seem to complement Kemper?s apparent emphasis on the importance of Dharmapala?s overseas engagements and his missionary zeal towards spreading the Dhamma. The diary data also enables one to identify the thinking that underlay such massive efforts.? ?
In my reading the seminal moment in his career arose during his first visit to Bodh Gaya in February 1891. To repeat: ?This morning at 4 I pledged myself to work for Humanity . . .? (d/e 27 Feb. 1891). It was then that he committed himself to the path of a homeless (anagarika) celibate missionary -- that is, a brahmacharya.? ?
?
BUDDHAGAYA? ?
In a speculative leap, I go further. I suggest that Bodh Gaya (or Buddhagaya) was not merely an inspirational driving force for Dharmapala. It was a magical destination: by restoring Buddhism in this primordial spot Dharmapala hoped that the wonderful messages of Buddhism would conquer the world. Plant that wonderful seed in its birthplace and, hey presto, Buddhism would be disseminated throughout the contemporary world. This wonderful faith would be a world conqueror like Asoka. Mount Meru would be reincarnated.? ?
This is a thought that I cannot substantiate. My work on the diaries was way back in time and the material is not at my fingertips. But it is a thought that has been lurking in the recesses of my brain. I present it to provoke. The ?provocation? is directed at Kemper in particular: he has been one of the few to work on the Dharmapala diaries and he has done so recently. I await his response eagerly as I venture out to get my hands on his book.? ?

Russia to hold biggest war games in nearly four decades
	
?
REUTERS, 28th AUGUST, 2018- Russia will next month hold its biggest war games in nearly four decades, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday, a massive military exercise that will also involve the Chinese and Mongolian armies.
The exercise, called Vostok-2018 (East-2018), will take place in central and eastern Russian military districts and involve almost 300,000 troops, over 1,000 military aircraft, two of Russia?s naval fleets, and all its airborne units, Shoigu said in a statement.
The manoeuvres will take place at a time of heightened tension between the West and Russia, which is concerned about what it says is an unjustified build-up of the NATO military alliance on its western flank.
NATO says it has beefed up its forces in eastern Europe to deter potential Russian military action after Moscow annexed Ukraine?s Crimea in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.
The war games, which will take place from Sept. 11-15, are likely to displease Japan which has already complained about what it says is a Russian military build-up in the Far East.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to attend a forum in Vladivostok over the same period, and a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday Tokyo always paid attention to shifts in Russian-Chinese military cooperation.

SF devoid of STF security
	
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka is reported to have been denied security by the Special Task Force (STF) triggering concerns whether it was linked to his criticism of the elite police force in Parliament last Friday.
He had launched a scathing attack on the STF last Friday and claimed that the STF was harassing his supporters over baseless charges.
Sources close to the minister said, the STF had not deployed its personnel assigned for his security both on Friday and Monday resulting in the minister complaining to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about this citing it as a breach of his parliamentary privileges.
When asked about this turn of events, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said he had directed Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara to investigate this matter. (Kelum Bandara)

SO MANY PROBLEMS, NO SOLUTIONS!
	
The world is upside down, utter confusion everywhere, everything around us in chaos, devastation and destruction!!! It honestly seems like the end of the world is near!!! There isn?t a day we don?t hear of some gigantic natural disaster, California fires that have hardly abated, Kerala floods leaving 800,000 homeless, the pictures of the floods were horrendous, multiple quakes rock Indonesia, 350 families displaced in our own country in Nuwara Eliya!!! Into all this devastation and destruction ride the Sri Lankan heroes!!! First, we are told that MR cannot even remember who Keith Noyah is; perhaps MR needs a brainwash to help him remember or more correctly a magnified picture of Keith so the grey matter in MR?s brain can start functioning!!! That is if he has a brain!!!
?
Amidst all this devastation, we have our ?ME ONLY? heroes and heroines thinking only of themselves!!! Regardless of what other people in the world are going through, it is ?ME? and only ?ME? that matters!!! We cope with a train strike, a bus strike and even a prison strike of the female prisoners!!! Into this melee comes the increase in train fares!!! After 8 years they suddenly decide it is time to raise the train fares by 15%!!! Strangely, most commuters are not against it BUT they very correctly ask why the facilities that train passengers to have to contend with are also not simultaneously improved!!! The trains themselves are filthy dirty, there is absolutely no ventilation, not a fan is working and even in an emergency, the toilets are inaccessible!!! Commuters are hanging on for dear life due to lack of compartments; more often than not, a train scheduled to come in at 1:30 p.m. would likely be there 40 minutes later and that too if you are lucky!!! The commuters GRIEVANCE is there is no balance, we can accept the raise in train fares, but by the same token, give us also A PROPER SERVICE FOR THE MONEY WE ARE PAYING YOU!!! THEIR CONTENTION IS THAT BECAUSE THE DRIVERS WENT ON STRIKE TO DEMAND MORE PAY, THE POOR COMMUTERS ARE BEING ASKED TO PAY INCREASED FARE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE DRIVERS!!!
?
?
Strikes are not all we have to contend with in this ?INORDINATELY SELFISH? country of ours!!! Instead of sparing a thought for the plight of people devastated and suffering in other countries, countries that have helped us when we were dealing with devastation and destruction; our Mayor is asking for salary increases for her minions, perhaps to divert public attention away from the fact that apart from having her toilet rebuilt, she also has 18 people working for her when her predecessor managed with 6!!! What benefits has the common man, like you and I derived from the Municipal Council to which so many taxes are paid???
Additionally, we have to pay to use a public toilet, what of the poor man on the street who cannot afford to pay??? Is this what she came decked out in all her glamorous sarees for???
?
?
Adding to all this confusion and chaos, our Minister for Transport says we have to get a new fleet of buses!!! Perhaps you and I should take a walk around ALL our Bus Depots to see THE NUMBER OF BUSES LYING THERE, MOST OF THEM WITH ONLY A SMALL REPAIR NEEDED, BUT WHO NEEDS REPAIRS WHEN THE COMMISSION ON THE NEW ONES IS GREATER, SO MUCH GREATER!!! WE ARE SO SELFISHLY CONSCIOUS OF OUR COUNTRY?S NEEDS THAT WE PUT OUR OWN GREED FOR MONEY BEFORE OUR COUNTRY!!!
?
?
While looking around us, let us take a little time to look at the bigger picture too!!! In the next 10 years, the earth will become 4 degrees hotter than it is now!!! Apparently, the Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rapid rate, therefore it is vital for all of us to lend a hand in the fight against global warming!!! Currently, computer simulations predict an increase in temperatures of over 3 degrees!!! Forest restoration is central to climate resilience!!! We need to plant more trees, NOT waste water, NOT use or burn plastics and have a clear understanding that no country in the world can fight global warming ALONE; we all have to contribute our share and that contribution and realization start now!!! We need forest conservation, preservation of the environment and careful use of water to help keep the sinister sceptre of global warming at bay!!!
?
Today, we are living in a world where everything is CHEAP, FAST AND FAKE and I would like to reproduce here (not ad verbatim) some of the thoughts sent by a friend, which are mandatory for the benefit of planet earth!!! Society is brainwashed to admire fake bodies, just to fit into the current fashion trend, instead of appreciating the bodies we have!!! We count calories instead of counting chemicals, we don?t like to be labelled as cheap, but we certainly like buying cheap food with little or no nutrition values at all to feed our bodies!!! Without our even realizing it, we continue to slowly kill ourselves and the next generation with highly processed fake fast foods!!! Our kids today only recognize apple juice or orange juice in boxes instead of freshly squeezed juice, and they grow up knowing only all the Fast Food joints instead of Fresh Farm Foods or home cooked meals.!!! We question why REAL FOOD IS EXPENSIVE INSTEAD OF ASKING WHY FAKE FOOD IS CHEAP!!! We applaud what is termed ?COOL? instead of recognizing the effort that farmers work hard to give us good fresh food!!! As technology gets more advanced, people keep steadily deteriorating and getting sick!!! The majority of people around the world are dying of disease today instead of old age!!! We take medicine as food instead of food as medicine!!!
When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. And when the diet is right, there is no need for medicine!!! Spend some quality time to make a home-cooked meal; start making the right choices, practice mindful eating habits because there is no point comparing our bodies to the ones in beauty magazines, we have to start living right because each of us is unique and beautiful in our own way!!! Nutrition is the fuel and source of energy for our body!!! Don?t wait to start making changes when death is at your doorstep!!! Our body is the only temple we live in, so let?s try to make the world a better place by starting with ourselves and living healthier lives!!!
Today, we need to continuously overcome challenges in an ever-changing world; we need to readjust, to constantly redefine our own sense of values and bear in mind always the significance of contributing to saving planet earth individually and with a coordinated togetherness!!!

Some Saudi-led coalition air strikes in Yemen may amount to war crimes: UN
	
?
Air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen?s war have caused heavy civilian casualties at marketplaces, weddings and on fishing boats, some of which may amount to war crimes, United Nations human rights experts said on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015.
Fighters of the Houthi movement have fired missiles into Saudi Arabia, blocked delivery of supplies to Taiz and shelled the strategic city from the highlands, the panel said. They have also committed torture, a war crime, it said.
Coalition forces have imposed severe restrictions on Red Sea ports and Sanaa airport, depriving Yemenis of vital supplies which may also constitute international crimes, the independent experts said in their first report to the Human Rights Council.
The coalition?s additional inspection procedures at Hodeidah port have had a ?chilling effect on commercial shipping?, although no U.N. or coalition searches had discovered weapons being smuggled into Yemen where 8.4 million people are on the brink of famine, it said.
?Coalition air strikes have caused most of the documented civilian casualties. In the past three years, such air strikes have hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and even medical facilities,? the panel said.
Its investigation of 11 incidents raised ?serious concerns about the targeting process applied by the coalition?. Strikes that fail to spare people or structures protected by international humanitarian law would be unlawful violations.

The young Pohottuwa Diyawanna member from the ?Tourist City? in the Gampaha district had received an order from the party high command to look after the neighbouring ?watte? too in addition to his home turf.
?
However, Diyawanna member ?Weere? ruling the roost in Kelaniya, despite being a thick chum of the Tourist City man got highly upset over this arrangement as he had his own interests in the ?Watte? area.
So, he promptly went into action using his ties with some heavyweights in the party to stymie the order from the party high command.
A Pohottuwa high-up who learnt about Weere?s underhand move immediately sent for him and gave him a tongue lashing warning him to mind his own business.
Thus chastised, Weere has again begun moving closely with the Tourist City colleague as if nothing untoward had happened to sour their friendship, they say.?

?Twin leadership? move gets a beating!
	
?
It is no longer news that a prominent member of the Group 16 now reduced to 15, has begun promoting the idea of starting a new political journey led by the incumbent Number One and the former strongman from the top two positions.
?
However, this proposition is being frowned upon by practically all other members in the group, they say.
Most of the group members, who prefer to follow in the footsteps of the former strongman, have already rejected the idea of a twin leadership.
Meanwhile, a gabby heavyweight from Uva challenging the twin leadership proposition had declared point blank that they had no choice other than to put forward a ?marketable? candidate at the upcoming big poll and the others had readily endorsed the view.
The general opinion about the group members is that the former strongman may not like the idea of playing the second fiddle to another person.Nevertheless, the advocate of ?twin leadership? continues to canvass support for the move undeterred, they say.

Twitter is purging accounts  and it?s a good thing
	
?
During that purge Twitter itself lost around 12% of its followers
	Twitter is nowhere close to the influence that Facebook enjoys
	Twitter said that this was an important step in managing the fake account menace
?
The second week of August witnessed another episode of sudden loss of twitter followers. Between August 16 and 17 twitter users reported sudden loss of followers, the second time in as many months that this happened.? ?
In mid-July, Twitter announced that it was purging locked accounts. What that meant was that accounts that had been previously been locked due to suspicious activity and had not been reactivated by their owners were taken down. Twitter said that this was an important step in managing the fake?account menace.?
During that purge Twitter itself lost around 12% of its followers or around 7m. The July purge saw Twitter losing as much as 70 million accounts. And the trend seems to be continuing with the latest bout this month.? ?
While I did not lose that many followers during the July purge, this month, within 24 hours, around 10% of my followers were gone. Others also reported?
such losses.? ?
?This week, we are suspending accounts for attempting to evade an account suspension. These accounts were previously suspended for abusive behavior or evading a previous suspension, and are not allowed to continue using Twitter,? Twitter said just before the latest purge began and added ?we will continue this work in the coming weeks as we identify others who are attempting to Tweet following an account suspension. If you believe your account has been suspended in error, please let us know.???
Since the last US elections, Twitter and Facebook, the latter much more than the former, have been trying to reinvent the wheel in tackling fake accounts and artificial amplification of accounts, ideas and events.? ?
It is a fight that is going to be long and arduous. Facebook is already under severe criticism that it has not done enough even after one scandal after another.? ?
While Twitter is nowhere close to the influence that Facebook enjoys, it too does have a sizable social media footprint.? ?
It is used a lot of by socially influenced people such as politicians, policy makers, celebrities, journalists and others. For many journalists I know Twitter is the first place to go to when news breaks and it has become an invaluable tool to gather news, interact with your audience and also to monitor the news temperature.? ?
In the narcissistic social media cauldron, the number of followers one has is generally considered by many as a?status symbol.? ?
That number also acts as an authenticity of the account. If your account is followed by dozens of verified accounts, that itself acts as a vector for others to consider you as someone who needs to be taken seriously or is being seriously. So losing followers is not necessarily a good thing ? but in this case it is. These purges are likely to continue, and just as well. But can they by themselves effectively deal with fake content and those that are filled with hate and aimed at incitement.? ?
Fake content can be detected most of the time. The difficulty is when this is all about opinion. Opinion is by nature filled with subjectivity and humans tend to rally around those that echo their?own sentiments.? ?
In the algorithm-dominated social media world machines detect what you like, or more precisely what you frequent and keep sending you content that matches your surfing habits, without any kind of moderation and users end up in echo chambers that mirror a false reality. Even now, as right-wing extremism gets targeted there are accusations that liberal voices are being allowed to pedal opinion unhindered.? ?
The other difficulty is to prove that hateful content did in fact lead to violence or possibly could. Where there is no ambiguity is that as the reach of social media spreads, so does it potency.? ?

US hands over High Endurance Cutter to SL
	
e US Coast Guard handed over a high endurance cutter to the Sri Lankan Navy in a ceremony presided over by Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe and Rear Admiral Michael Haycock of the US Coast Guard in Honolulu. ?
The US Embassy on Wednesday said the cutter which is formerly known as the USCGC Sherman, will be the largest ship in the Sri Lankan fleet and strengthens defense cooperation between the US and Sri Lanka. ?
The ship will increase Sri Lanka?s ability to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone, providing additional security for ships from all nations that transit the busy sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.
For over a month, 110 Sri Lankan sailors have been training with the Sherman?s crew on operating the vessel. The handover builds on Sri Lanka?s first-ever participation in the US Pacific Fleet exercise ?Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018? in July, 2018.
?The sail-away date for the cutter will be in February 2019. Overhaul and maintenance, as well as the training of the crew, will continue until then. The new ship will join the SLNS Samudura, also a former US Coast guard vessel that was gifted to Sri Lanka in 2004. The US remains committed to our enduring friendship with Sri Lanka and we will continue to work together to advance prosperity and security for people in both our countries, the region, and beyond,? the US Embassy said in a statement.
