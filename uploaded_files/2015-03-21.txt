Excise Department Spokesman Prabath Jayawickrama said 8,758 bottles of 49 brands of Belgium beer were discovered making it the largest ever detection of beer by the Sri Lanka Excise Department.
Cases contained bottles of 330ml and 250ml under the brand name La Trappe, Leffe and Bar Bar which had been sold defying the license regulations of selling unauthorized imported beverages.

China eyes more infrastructure projects in SL
	
Despite concerns over the suspension of the Port City Project, China is eying more investments on infrastructure development projects in Sri Lanka with one Chinese company having submitted a US$760 million proposal for the upgrading of the railway track from Colombo to Kandy.
Shandong High-Speed Group Co. Ltd. has in its proposal said the travel time between Colombo and Kandy or vice versa could be reduced to one hour and 35 minutes when compared with the excess of three hours now necessary for a train trip from the same distance.
Company officials said the proposal was submitted about a year ago, and still held hopes of securing the project.
Company's Deputy General Manager Zhang Jingping told Sri Lankan journalists who visited Jinan that his company sought to modernize five railway stations including the Colombo Fort Railway Station situated along the rail track.
He said his company would also bid for the construction of the northern expressway.
Both India and China have invested in railway projects in Sri Lanka. The reconstruction of the northern railway line was carried out as an Indian Government-funded project. The train service came to a halt during the height of the armed conflict in the North and East.
During his state visit to Sri Lanka, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged US$380 million under an Indian Line of Credit for the development of the railway sector in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, another Chinese company has invested in the ongoing extension of the Southern railway line up to Beliatta.(Kelum Bandara)

Ex-diplomat Tamara to take legal action against Mangala
	
		Former Ambassador Tamara Kunanayakam today said she is currently seeking the possibility of taking legal action against Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera against the statements he had made concerning her, alleging the former diplomat was one who ?came forward on behalf of the LTTE?.
	?
	Kunanayakam held a special press conference this morning in order to respond to the accusations allegedly made against her by Minister Samaraweera during a TV program on March 17, where he had said that its necessary to ?find out? about her as it is she who continuously highlights the controversy surrounding the audit report on the renovations of the official residence of Sri Lanka?s High Commissioner to Geneva. She claims he also accused her of coming forward on behalf of the LTTE at the UN and in the Human Rights Council in 1989 -1990.
	?
	Vehemently rejecting the allegation and the other comments the Minister has allegedly made against Kunanayakam, she noted the following:"- ? ? ? ? ?My reasons for requesting an audit into the functioning of the Permanent Mission in Geneva was not, as alleged by Minister Samarawera, due to a personal dislike for Ambassador Kshenuka Senevirathne. I had no reason to like or dislike her since I had never met her before and had no personal or professional contact with her
	- ? ? ? ? ?I categorically state that I have never ever spoken on behalf of the LTTE - not in 1989 -1990 and not before and not after. In fact I have worked closely with the Mothers? Front Movement of which, the Minister was a co-convener.
	I have denounced the violation of human rights by the State as well as by the LTTE. It is for this reason that I was branded a ?traitor to the Tamil cause? by the LTTE beginning as far back as 1987. I have also been subjected to written and physical threats by representatives and sympathizers of the LTTE.
	- ? ? ? ? ?Contrary to the allegation made by Minister Samaraweera, I was not a ?member? of the World Council of Churches. Members of the World Council of Churches are church institutions around the world to which also belongs the protestant churches in Sri Lanka and to which the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka is affiliated."
	?Kunanayakam went on to state the Minister has ?misused the fact that she is Tamil to automatically brand her? as being an advocate for the LTTE while overlooking her consistent and relentless fight against the LTTE and the criticisms she leveled at the terrorist group throughout her private and professional life. ?
	?
	She went on to state that as a former Ambassador of Sri Lanka, it appalls her to think that Sri Lanka should lose its credibility internationally its Foreign Minister makes false statements and is ?playing on racist and chauvinist anti-Tamil sentiments?.
	?
	?In my mind, such a person is unsuitable to represent us internationally,? she said.
	?
	Former State Minister of Higher Education and MP Professor Rajiva Wijesinghe who also commented at the media briefing said that he is extremely disappointed by the statement made by the Foreign Minister that implicated Kunanayakam and said this government too has adopted the same policy followed by the previous regime, of branding any individual who is a Tamil or is criticizing the government policies as a ?LTTE-er?.
	?
	Meanwhile, former diplomat and political scientist Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka who also expressed his views at the press conference this morning said Minister Samaraweera?s statements on Tamara has undermined the credibility of the Sri Lankan state and said that he also suspects whether a need has emerged from within the new government to go out of the way to protect Ambassador Senevirathne, as she provided misleading and damaging advice to former President Rajapaksa on matters of significant concern.

<U+200B>India assisting SL to trace MR money-report
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lanka has sought India's assistance in tracing $2 billion, allegedly stashed away in three accounts in Dubai by family members and aides of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Sri Lankan investigators who began an investigation into financial deals sealed by the Rajapaksa government had traced $2 billion in Dubai banks, an official source from Colombo said. Of this, one account of a Rajapaksa family member allegedly has $1.064 billion, other two by two different persons have $500 million each in two separate accounts, the source said.
India along with the US have been approached to assist in the investigation to trace this huge amount. Both New Delhi and Washington are assisting with the probe, an Indian official source added. The Dubai money is estimated to account for 20% of the total amount Lankan authorities allege has been illicitly stashed abroad by the former president and his family. The family, however, has denied any wrongdoings and described the allegations as baseless.
Sirisena had during his visit to New Delhi last month shared details of the amount allegedly stashed away by Rajapaksa family in St Martin Islands, Hong Kong, Macau, Seychelles. He had also shared details about the huge investments allegedly made in real estate projects in Dubai, Uganda and Kenya.(economictimes)

<U+200B>Lankan girl, refused visa due to Down syndrome-family
	
		 		 
		 
			
A Sri Lankan family who want to work in a Christian crisis centre in remote Australia say their daughter was refused a temporary visa because she has Down syndrome.
The Immigration Department issued a temporary work visa to eight-year-old Eliza Fonseka's parents, but not to the child, because she was considered to be a "significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care".
Eliza's father Angelo Fonseka said his daughter was in good health and not on medication, and the family had Australian private health insurance to cover any medical costs.
"We have given in writing that we will take responsibility for Eliza, she doesn't need any support from the government," Mr Fonseka said.
"In Sri Lanka we are not relying on any government benefits. As parents we are supplying everything. If we migrated to Australia we will do the same thing."
The family plans to move to Shark Bay, 800 kilometres north of Perth, to work at a Christian crisis centre that provides food, accommodation and support to people in need.
"We want to help them. My wife is a worship leader, she wants to be [on] the worship team in Shark Bay some day," Mr Fonseka said.
In a statement, the Department of Immigration said it could not discuss the specific details of the case, but said the visa assessment process was extensive.
"If an applicant has a significant medical condition, their medical reports are referred to a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth (MOC)," the statement said.
"A MOC is required by law to take into account the health care costs and community services likely to be required by a person with a condition of the same level and severity as the applicant.
"A person with a medical condition may fail to meet the health requirement if a MOC assesses their condition as likely to result in significant health care and community service costs to the Australian community or prejudice the access of Australians to such services during their stay in Australia."
The Immigration Department said health waiver provisions exist for certain subclasses of visas and the family could consider investigating that option.
The West Australian Premier Colin Barnett responded to the Fonseka's plea.
He wrote to them and said he had personally contacted Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and hoped they would be "successful in obtaining a favourable outcome".
'This is so hurtful, it is a harsh decision'
Mr Fonseka said the Immigration Department's decision to refuse his daughter's application was upsetting.
"I would say as parents this is so hurtful, it's a harsh decision," he said.
"She's an innocent child, an eight-year-old child and I believe whatever God created, no man has authority to destroy, reject or discriminate.
"She does swimming, dancing, everything and according to psychologist reports and even the doctors, school reports, everything is perfect.
"They have clearly said she doesn't need residential or institutional care. Only thing is we need to guide her and give her the best to improve her skills."
The family's sponsor Pastor Tim Hargreaves runs the Shark Bay Crisis Centre mostly by himself.
Mr Hargreaves, 77, said he badly needed the help of the Fonseka family.
"I'm pretty fit and able ... but it's hard yakka and I need a younger couple to give me a hand," Mr Hargreaves said.
"I'm appalled. It's heartless and I'm ashamed for my own Australian Government to be a party and identify with such a decision."
The Fonseka family are appealing the Immigration Department's decision to refuse Eliza's visa application.(ABC News)

## Title: Lankans slam bid to invite Dalai Lama

Lankans slam bid to invite Dalai Lama
	
		 		 
		 
			
The reported bid by a leading Sri Lankan Buddhist monk to invite the Dalai Lama to the island nation, has received flak from official as well as non-official quarters in Sri Lanka.
?It will stir up a hornet?s nest, as it goes against Sri Lanka?s time honored ?One China? policy. Lankans are acutely aware of the fact that China does not like any country inviting the Dalai Lama,? said a senior official of the Lankan Foreign Ministry, requesting anonymity.
Ven.Banagala Upatissa Thero, President of the Mahabodhi Society of Sri Lanka, had expressed his wish to invite the Tibetan spiritual leader to his country at a conference organized by the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi ?this week. ??
?The timing of the monk?s announcement is most inappropriate as the Lankan President is to visit China on March 26. We wonder if someone is fishing in troubled waters,? the official said.
According to another official, the move reflects India?s bid to establish ?civilizational links? with Buddhist countries to counter China?s World Fellowship of Buddhists.
The majority Sinhalese community in Lanka views China as a firm and consistent friend, always coming to the island nation?s help in times of distress. When there was a severe rice shortage in Lanka in the 1950s, China agreed to barter its rice for Lankan rubber. Later, when Western nations and India refused to sell arms to Lanka to fight the LTTE, China sold weapons. China has pumped in billions of dollars into post-war infrastructure development projects. And all this, without making any political demands or raising human rights issues, Lankans point out.
In return, Lanka has refrained from inviting the Dalai Lama. Attempts by Buddhist monks to invite him in 1999 and 2006, were shot down by governments of the day.
?The Bodu Bala Sena wanted to invite him last year but the Chinese told the Rajapaksa government that it should not allow it,? ?said BBS CEO, Dr.Dilanthe Withanage.
However, former Ambassador Dr.Dayan Jayatilleka said that given the pronounced pro-West leanings of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, government might allow the Lama?s visit. At any rate, the government has already alienated China by stopping its projects.(New Indian Express)
