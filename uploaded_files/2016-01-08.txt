Appointing Constitutional Assembly against people?s mandate: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa today alleged that the government was planning to introduce constitutional reforms which include the scraping of the unitary state and the priority given to Buddhism.
He said such a move would violate the current constitution, parliamentary tradition and the peoples? mandate.
Mr. Weerawansa said at the presidential election,the government had pledged it would not amend any constitutional clauses,which had to be put to a referendum.
?The Government has broken its promise made to the people at the presidential election on upholding the unitary state and priority given to Buddhism. Minister Champika Ranawaka was very vociferous about these matters at the time but today he is nowhere to be seen or heard these days,? Mr. Weerawansa said.
He told a news conference that the government was also planning to convert parliament into a Constitutional Assembly instead of appointing a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) and said that this too was contrary to the people?s mandate. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Chris Gayle was unprofessional -Mahela
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lanka great Mahela Jayawardene says Chris Gayle did not handle himself well when he made suggestive comments towards a female TV presenter.
Gayle was slapped with a $10,000 fine from Melbourne Renegades over his comments to Channel Ten's Mel McLaughlin, which he described as a "simple joke" with no offence or disrespect intended.
Speaking after the Adelaide Strikers' BBL win on Tuesday night, Jayawardene said the big-hitting West Indian should have acted more professionally.
"I've known Gayle for a long time and he's a funny guy," Jayawardene said.
"I don't think he takes that many things seriously but obviously people react differently as well. I reckon we could probably tone it down a bit.
"At the same time, Chris should've realised that it was a much more professional situation and handled himself a bit better."
Gayle's comments provoked widespread condemnation as sexist and inappropriate, with former Test opener Chris Rogers saying he was concerned for the example his former Thunder teammate set for younger players.
But Jayawardene said the cricketing world should move on from the incident.
"I think we can move on from that - what has happened has happened," he said.(The Sydney Morning Herald)?

Ekneligoda case; Solicitor General says Rajitha is lying
	
		 		 
		 
			
Solicitor General of the Attorney General?s Department Mr. Suhada Gamalath yesterday denied an allegation made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne relating to the criminal investigation and court proceedings relating to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
?This is complete and diabolical lie and I deny this totally,? Mr. Gamalath told the Daily Mirror.
There were several media reports that Solicitor General Gamalath had allegedly negotiated a meeting with the investigators of the case relating to Journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda disappearance and had inquired from CID officers whether a negotiation on the ongoing investigation was possible.
Explaining the background to Minister Senaratne?s allegation, the Solicitor General said that Attorney General Yuwanjan Wijethilake had wanted him to inquire about the ongoing inquiry from the Prosecuting Counsel of the Attorney General's Department. ?This was because Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi has complained to the AG that prosecution counsel was allegedly harsh in his comment against the Army at the inquiry into the journalist?s disappearance case and the army had been disturbed by the certain comments that the prosecution counsel was making,? the SG explained. Subsequently the SG had summoned a meeting with the Prosecution Counsel Dileepa Peiris and CID investigating officer Shani Abeyratne with regard to the inquiry and the problems they encounter in conducting the investigation in the proper way.
SG Gamalath said subsequently he has suggested to the Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi to find out through the army what causes them to adopt a lackadaisical attitude towards the inquiry into the disappearance of the journalist and to make it possible for the army?s cooperation to be obtained to conduct a proper inquiry.
Mr. Gamalath also requested the President to call for a full report into the case.
The attack on the SG Gamalath has come in the wake of the retirement of the present Attorney General Yuwanjan Wijethilake today. According to seniority Mr. Gamalath is next in line for the post of Attorney General.
?Apart from that there had never being any attempt to scuttle this inquiry and bring a mediator between any party involved in this matter,? Mr. Gamalath said. He stated that it is extremely unfortunate independent profession of the government servants who had no any recourse to depend themselves are vilified and treated so shoddily over the media by any person with or without authority and the people holding the reign of government should take serious note of this and adopt measures effectively to protect the government servants and its officials and otherwise government servants discharging their duties honestly and diligently will find it extremely difficult to function for the purpose of progressing the concept of Yahapalanaya.
During his 33-years in the public service Mr. Gamalath, who began his career as a State Counsel reached the second senior most position in the Department and had also served as the Justice Ministry Secretary.(Susitha R. Fernando)

It's nothing but political revenge: Gota
	
Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said on yesterday that he was summoned by the FCID, PRECIFAC, Bribery and Corruption Commissions last year not to investigate fraud and corruption but to take political revenge.
Mr Rajapaksa visited the PRECIFAC yesterday as well and recorded a statement for several hours.
Mr. Rajapaksa said if they really wanted to find out any fraud and corruption, it would not have taken a year to do so and that what they should have done was to check my assets and liabilities from the day I assumed duties as the defense secretary till I left the post.
?They can check what I have earned since I assumed duties and left the post and find out whether I have deposited funds in foreign banks, bought any land, built any houses or bought shares in companies. I think that is how they should probe frauds or corruption,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he had not earned a cent illegally and that he did everything according to the law.
He said he set up Rakna Lanka with the objective of earning several benefits to the government, the company earned foreign exchange and provided lots of jobs to retired security personnel. (Ajith Siriwardana)

But I must tell them that I never worry about my position after five years. I am always concerned about the position of ?Mother Lanka? after five years. My only desire, hope and expectation is to build a strong, highly developed clean and beautiful country in a five years,? the President stressed.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Talks with Live Events fails, CMC goes ahead with lawsuit
	
The Colombo Municipality has decided to take legal action against 'Live Events', the company which organized the Enrique Iglesias concert at the CR&FC Grounds in Colombo after both parties failed to reach a settlement even after several rounds of talks, officials said.
An investigation carried out by the Municipality's Treasury Department had exposed a tax fraud amounting to some Rs.30 million on the revenue earned by Live Events.
The company was also blacklisted recently by Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) on the basis that taxes owed by the company to the Municipality was not paid.
Municipal Commissioner M.K.V.Anura said the several rounds of discussions held with Live Event officials ended inconclusively.
?They denied that an entertainment tax fraud of Rs.30 million was committed by them. They wrote to us saying that the proper taxes had been paid by them and that they owed nothing more to the Municipality. But, we stand by our investigations. It appears that the organizers are also keen to take this matter up in Court,? Mr. Anura said adding that a lawsuit would be filed on January 20 against Live Events.
Meanwhile, Municipal Treasurer K.D. Chitrapala said a complaint would also be lodged at the Fraud Bureau against Live Events.
He said the company had earlier admitted that they had sold tickets which did not have the seal of approval from the Municipality and highlighted that fact Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil had requested the organizers to settle the outstanding amount without having to resort to legal action.
The Municipality confirmed that the tickets had to be approved and sealed by it but that only a part of the tickets had been handed over to the Municipality for approval.
The main stakeholders of the company are former cricketing stars Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardane. (Piyumi Fonseka)
