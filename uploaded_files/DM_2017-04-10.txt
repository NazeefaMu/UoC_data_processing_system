China, SL good traditional neighbours:  Chinese top advisor
	
China and Sri Lanka are traditional good neighbours and their people have enjoyed long history of exchanges, Chinese top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng has said.
According to Chinese Media, he had expressed these views when he met President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday.
Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), visited Sri Lanka from Thursday to Saturday at the invitation of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 60 years ago, China and Sri Lanka has supported each other on the issues concerning their core and significant interests, with mutual beneficial cooperation bringing substantial benefits to the peoples of the two sides, the Chinese top political advisor said.
For his part, President Sirisena has said Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed long history of friendship and friendly people to people exchanges.
China has given strong support to Sri Lanka in peace realization and economic recovery, and Sri Lankan people love and respect China, the president said.
As the development of bilateral ties has entered a new stage, Sri Lanka will continue to uphold the one China policy and is looking forward to maintaining frequent high-level exchanges, deepen and broaden economic and trade cooperation and strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in international affairs, he added.
During his meeting with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday, Yu said the China-Sri Lanka relations have witnessed comprehensive development in recent years with deepening pragmatic cooperation, and positive achievements have been scored in major cooperation projects.
Both sides should give play to their own advantages, exploit cooperation potential and jointly build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Yu said, adding that they should also push for the steady development of key cooperation projects including the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota harbor.
Meanwhile, China and Sri Lanka should speed up negotiations on the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), and expand their cooperation to new areas such as ocean, tourism and industry capacity so as to achieve mutual benefits and common development, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is in the process of industrialization, modernization and urbanization, and that his country looks forward to boosting cooperation with China in the fields of trade, finance, ports and transportation infrastructure.
Sri Lanka is willing to join hands with China to build the Belt and Road so as to speed up the island country's economic development and boost regional economic integration, the prime minister said.
Also on Friday, the Chinese top political advisor met with Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, saying that China is very happy to see social stability, economic development and continuous improvement of the people's living standard in Sri Lanka.

Egypt declares state of emergency
	
Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has announced a three-month state of emergency after attacks on two Coptic churches that left at least 44 dead, the BBC reported today.
The measure allows authorities to make arrests without warrants and search people's homes. It needs to be approved by parliament before it is implemented.
So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the blasts in Tanta and Alexandria on Palm Sunday.
The group has targeted Copts in Egypt recently and warns of more attacks.
Mr. Sisi made a defiant speech at the presidential palace after a meeting of the national defence council to discuss the explosions.
He warned that the war against the jihadists would be "long and painful", and said that the state of emergency would come into force after all "legal and constitution steps" were taken. The majority in parliament backs Mr. Sisi.
The president had earlier ordered the deployment of the military across the country to protect "vital and important infrastructure".

Fmr SL cricketer Bertie Wijesinhe passes away
	
Former Sri Lankan cricketer Bertie Wijesinhe passed away at the age of 96 on Saturday, the Cricket Country reported today. 
He was born to former Trinity cricketer Alexander Wijesinha, and was the oldest living Thomain cricketer before his passing away.
Wijesinhe played his club cricket at Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC). However, Wijesinghe played his first national game for Ceylon in 1949 against a visiting Pakistan side at Colombo Oval. Even though Ceylon was thrashed in the match, Wijesinhe ended up scoring 59 runs in the match.
Wijesinhe, after his international retirement, took up Journalism in London in 1952, while continuing to play for local club named West Indian Wanderers. Aged 57, Wijesinhe played for Nottinghamshire.
Wettimuny brothers  Sunil, Mithra and Sidath were coached by him.
Whatever skills we learnt from cricket we owe it to him. He was a fabulous coach, the best in the business. His knowledge and the way he transferred that knowledge to us was fantastic. Bertie lived a full life and was one of the greatest cricketers produced by SSC and one of the best coaches the country has produced, Sidath Wettimuny has said.
Another Sri Lankan captain Anura Tennekoon has said Bertie Wijesinhe helped him to brush up his technique from school to club level. He was very good at putting the basics right of a cricketer whether it be batting or bowling, that was his main strength, he said.

Gazette notice will intensify protests: GMOA
	
The Health Ministry had taken steps to publish a Gazette notification of minimum standards for Medical Colleges, according to sources.
The Gazette Notice would be issued in response to a condition laid down by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
When inquired, the Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Nalinda Herath said the SAITM issue would be aggravated in the event of a Gazette Notice being issued ignoring the recommendations of the Medical Council.
If the intention of the Gazette Notice was merely to protect the SAITM private medical institute in Malabe, that would intensify the protests by the medical students, he said.
That will also intensify trade union actions by the GMOA, Dr. Hearth said. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)

GMOA has no right to interfere in SAITM issue: Kiriella
	
Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kirella criticized the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) saying it had no right to interfere in Sri Lankas medical education.
He told Daily Mirror that the matter connected to the provisional registration of medical graduates, who passed out from SAITM would be addressed by the government in consultation with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
He said the GMOA was merely a trade union and had no right to interfere in this matter and neither was it a party to the Court case filed by the aggrieved parties.
The GMOA staged a token strike on Friday demanding the closure or nationalization of SAITM, the only private medical degree-awarding institution in Sri Lanka
However, GMOA Secretary Navin de Zoysa said the GMOAs role, on similar matters had been recognized even in a previous court ruling and as such its involvement in the SAITM controversy could not be disputed.
He said the government should nationalise SAITM instead of bring the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital under the purview of the Health Ministry.
In that case it will only be an additional cost for the government to maintain this hospital. SAITM authorities profit by conducting degree programmes unlawfully. The government is allowing SAITM to prosper further by taking over the hospital, Dr. de Zoysa said. (Kelum Bandara)

Htota Port deal amended again
	
The Cabinet Sub Committee appointed to work out guidelines for leasing out the Hambantota Port, had taken up for consideration, among others, a proposal to reduce the lease term from 99 years to 50 years, it is learnt.
The committee headed by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama met last week.
There were a number of proposals put forward to the committee seeking to amend the original draft of the agreement to hand over an 80 percent stake of the port to China Merchants Ports Holding Company.
In addition to reduction of the lease period, it has also been proposed that the Harbour Master should be responsible to Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Sources close to the Committee said the agreement should be signed, once finalised, between China Merchants Ports Holding Company and a local company registered under the Companies Act here.
That decision has been taken because it is legally impossible to do so with Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
If we are to do it, we will have to amend the Act concerned, the source said.
The source said President Maithripala Sirisena also wanted the reduction of lease period to 50 years.
Also, it is proposed that Sri Lanka Navy should provide security to the Port having a base there. In equity sharing, it has to be 60-40 not 80-20 as in the original draft.
All these proposals are under discussion now. The final draft should be worked out after further deliberations, the source said. (Kelum Bandara)

Immigration nabs five Russian women in escort service raid
	
A high profile Russian escort service carried out via the internet, serving the rich, was busted by the Immigration Department special unit who also took five Russian female sex workers into custody in Colombo last week.
The officials of the Monitoring, Intelligence and Investigation Unit of the Department of Immigration and Emigration had launched a probe into a website that was said to provide escort services to the wealthy in Colombo.
The sleuths used a decoy to order five girls online and requested that they be brought to a leading residential hotel in Slave Island.
The five girls, who were between the ages of 20 to 30, were taken into custody by the Immigration officials when they arrived at the hotel.
A senior official told Daily Mirror that the escort service had received orders from many wealthy clients in Colombo, who they say were charged $500 (Rs.75,000) for two hours with one of the sex workers.
After gathering information from the five women who were arrested, the sleuths raided a condominium in Kirulapona where they were based. Out of three apartments rented by them the sex workers and their male Russian manager were living in one.The other two had been used to serve their clients. Apart from receiving clients at their apartments the Russian women also used to visit any other place to which their customers requested them to come.
The manager of the escort service had however managed to escape capture.
The escort service had been operating for over eight months and all the women had arrived in Sri Lanka on tourist visas and had extended them from time to time.
The women were temporarily transferred to Immigration Department Detention Centre in Mirihana. They will be deported thereafter.
This was the second such online based escort service that had been raided after "Banana Escort" was raided about six years ago.

Lankan cleared of murder charges, faces deportation
	
A Sri Lankan man who had a murder charge dropped last week after a judge ruled it took too long to bring him to trial is facing deportation from Canada because he has a criminal record, Montreal Gazette reported.
Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingham, 31, is scheduled to have an admissibility hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board on Monday afternoon.
Thanabalasingham was charged in August 2012 with the second-degree murder of his wife, 21-year-old Anuja Baskaran.
His trial was supposed to begin at the Montreal courthouse on Monday. But last Thursday, Superior Court Justice Alexandre Boucher ruled that the Crown took too long to start the trial. The request for a stay of proceedings was made by Thanabalasinghams lawyer, Joseph La Leggia. The judges ruling was based on a Supreme Court of Canada decision last July that set new limits on how long a person accused of a crime should expect to wait to have a trial in Canada.
The limit was set at 30 months for Superior Court cases. Thanabalasinghams trial would have started 57 months after his arrest.
In his ruling, Boucher criticized the Crown for trying to change the second-degree murder charge to one of first-degree murder based on weak evidence. This meant the preliminary hearing, which was scheduled for 10 days, ended up being held over 20 days spread out over a course of a year.
The Canadian Border Services Agency arrested and detained Thanabalasingham while he was at a Montreal detention centre after his murder charged was dropped. He has a criminal record for assaulting his wife on three occasions between December 2011 and May 2012.
Baskaran was killed inside the couples home in August 2012, according to evidence presented during the preliminary hearing.
At an admissibility hearing, the CBSA will likely present evidence to the IRBs immigration division stating that Thanabalasingham is inadmissible to remain in Canada, said Christian Tessier, a spokesperson for the IRB.
The CBSA can detain someone if they feel there is a flight risk, theyre unsure of someones identity or because a person is a threat to public safety.
In Quebec City, the provincial government is calling on Ottawa to appoint more Superior Court justices to try and reduce the backlog of cases in the criminal justice system.

## Title: Significance of Bak Full Moon Suffering is a creation of the mind

Significance of Bak Full Moon Suffering is a creation of the mind
	
Bak Poya is important due to a number of significant events in the life of the Buddha. After attaining Enlightenment at 35, the Buddhas intention was to travel from place to place and preach the Dhamma, and to help people to be free from suffering. The Buddha was born not for the sake of a particular community but for all mankind  irrespective of their religion, race, caste, and creed. He treated all alike. He was a great teacher who showed the right path. 
The Buddha visited this island on three occasions at Mahiyangana, Nagadeepa and Kelaniya. Buddhas second visit was on the Bak Full Moon Day. During the fifth year of his Enlightenment the Buddha saw with His divine eye that a dispute had arisen between two Naga kings Chulodara and Mahodara. 
According to the Mahavamsa, Mahodara was a king in Nagadeepa. His younger sister, Thirachchika, was married to a Naga king. Chulodara was their son. Thirachchikas father gave her one of his most valuable jewels  a gem-studded throne prior to his death. 
To settle the dispute between Chulodara and Mahodara who were uncle and nephew, the Buddha appeared in the sky under the shade of a kiripalu tree. They were fighting over the ownership of a gem-studded throne. Nagadeepa in Jaffna has become a common place of worship for devotees of all religions in Sri Lanka. Buddhist pilgrims visit Nagadeepa and Hindus too visit the Kovil in the vicinity. Chulodara and Mahodara built Nagadeepa Stupa stands magnificently even today at Nagadeepa, which is 30 kms from Jaffna. Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya stands at the very site where the Buddha preached his message of peace. This Viharaya has two shrine rooms constructed in the traditional Jaffna architectural style. The smaller shrine houses a Bronze Buddha statue gifted by the Burmese government, while the ancient Bodhi tree nearby spreads its branches in every direction. To protect from the salty sea breeze, the Stupa is painted in silver. 
One countryone nation and one people; Sri Lankans. 
Understanding Dhamma is a study of the mind: Suffering is a creation of the mind. 
Suffering and pain are two different things. Pain is a natural fact of life and suffering is a creation of mind. 
Using a simple example to demonstrate  you have headache and feeling of this pain is playing in the field of your consciousness. The mind looks at this sensation of ache and complains. The first, the reality of pain, is a natural part of life. Given the nature of the body, there will be pain. The next part, which is suffering, begins when the mind looks at what is happening (it is the feeling of pain in this example) and suffers. Suffering creates its own pain. Now you have double discomfort, one, of the pain and the second is that of the suffering. 
Can the mind look at what is going on and not suffer All pains go away after some time and if a painkiller needs to be taken, so be it. This is taking care of it, without going through it. If one could do that, there is no waste of energy in suffering it. Now life can take care of the fact with a smile and not suffer. As you observe your consciousness in action, when fear, irritation, anxiety, desire and frustration appear, how do you look at it  Is suffering also a natural fact As you have been observing, your own mind in action and are now familiar with the common paths that thoughts take. There are fundamental forces that are universal in nature and they have given rise to the entire structure of human consciousness. They dictate the human world. These forces are not specific to your mind or my mind, they are universal and hide deep beneath the outer layers of the mind. 
If you realize these facts, you would have realized the forces behind most human actions on this planet. The key is to not merely gain memory of knowledge, the key is to realize it within your self by observing the movement of your own mind. Keep observing your mind and use the teachings merely as a guide of where and how to look to make sense of what you see. 
Green and Blue; Insanity 
There lived a man who looked healthy and sane on the outside. One day, he had the strange idea that leaves of trees and plants should be blue in colour. Next morning he woke up, looked around and found that all leaves were green. His anger and irritation knew no limit, he picked up a bucket of blue paint and painted all leaves blue. He truly believed this was how the world should be. Next day when he woke up, he saw that new leaves had come up and they were green. Wherever he went, he was annoyed, irritated and angry. He wasted all his life energy fighting against a natural fact. Would you tell him, if he stopped fighting with the natural fact, just looked at the natural fact with a smile, whatever it was that it would end his sorrow 
What this story has to do with your sorrow and my sorrow 
As you observe your mind in action, does it trouble you to see that your thoughts never seem to stop racing Is fear a natural fact Is desire a natural fact Are you really looking at what is naturally taking place inside you with a smile Or is your mind busy with an endless internal fight to change something that is naturally going on Stop fighting with it, just look at it with smile, all of your sorrow may be over. 
Nibbana through Choiceless Observation 
Automatic forces of mind create conflict inside and outside. At this stage, many seekers wonder if they can see the subconscious world inside, whether internal peace still remains out of reach. One may wonder where the freedom is in all this. Before moving forward, have you been able to observe the root source of conflict inside yourself yet The moment you realize the source, all your conflicts are over that very instant. To reach there, you must drop all ideas of reaching some imaginary experience or state. In short, one needs to first learn to observe and experience the actual fact that is taking place in the moment. Several seekers have found these tools very effective. Slowly but surely, the root of mind and all the conflicts become visible during this choiceless observation. Awareness comes into being. Awareness is the foundation of peace and joy. 
As a religious tradition dedicated to overcoming human suffering and achieving emancipation, Buddhism is relatively unassuming in terms of the scope of the discussion it offers on social composition, particularly on matters related to governance, economic production and resource distribution. In the age of a more globalized economy and modern state structure however, the established Buddhist belief that mindfulness and good intentions are a guide to both inner and outer peace is critically challenged. 
Buddhist-majority societies that place the Buddhist viewpoint at the heart of nation-building must exercise a great degree of caution, because their religious beliefs can make it difficult for them to see how their well-intended actions could mistakenly harm others. To react to this challenge, there is a need to build structural awareness or educated consciousness that seeks to recognize both visible and invisible causal chains of action and inaction that transform structural roots of human suffering. 
May all beings be happy!

The Power of Loving Kindness- Teachings of Ajahn Brahm
	
Ajahn Brahmavamso, also known as Ajahn Brahm, left an indelible impression in my mind. He has my greatest respect and Ive learnt so much from him. Im going to devote todays article to some of the wondrous stories recounted by Ajahn Brahm and his teachings on loving kindness in my own words, which I will share with you here. 
The story of the king cobra- I heard this story while listening to one of Ajahn Brahms talks. He related how a group of monks were seated in a circle, meditating in the forests of Thailand. The Thai jungles were infested with snakes, king cobras among them. Suddenly a king cobra appeared. It made a beeline towards the head monk and raised its hood, put out its venomous tongue and was ready to strike. This cobra was ready to strike when the head monk raised his hand and started gently stroking the cobras head. And miraculously enough, the cobra lowered its hood and left the group of monks. This is a true story which goes to show the power of loving kindness. The head monk had so much loving kindness in him that even the cobra could feel it and was moved by it. 
Then theres the story of the thief who broke into a temple. Once inside, he broke the donation box and started emptying the money into his pockets. The Abbot arrived and the thief pointed his gun at him, ready to shoot. The Abbot gently asked the thief not to be afraid. He said, please take all of it. You must be hungry. Theres some food over there, please take it. The thief immediately ran to the food and stuffed his pockets with it before leaving. After some time, he was arrested and put in jail for other crimes. Many years later, the same thief returned to the temple. He was a changed man. He met the Abbot and said, Many years ago, I came to steal money and food from the temple. But I could never forget your kindness to me. All that time in jail, I kept remembering it and thats what sustained me. My sanity. Today Ive come to steal your love and kindness. This story is yet another incident of the power of loving kindness. It can truly change people. 
Theres yet another story with supernatural undertones. At NASA, one of the main computers stopped working. Top engineers and technicians in the US tried their utmost to repair the computer but nothing worked. Finally, one of the staff remembered that there was a Buddhist monk (not Ajahn Brahm- another monk) nearby and asked him to come to NASA in the hope that the computer would repair itself when the monk chanted. The monk arrived and did so. Sure enough, the computer started working!
Ajahn Brahm recounts how one day when he was in his teens, his father said to him, son, the door of my house is always open to you. Ajahn Brahm wasnt sure what exactly his father meant but as he matured, he realised what his father wanted to say was, son, the door of my heart is always open to you, no matter what you do in life or who you become. And Ajahn Brahm was to apply his fathers loving words to his own future and make a huge impact on other lives. We could all be like this, opening the door of our hearts, especially to our loved ones and to all of life. 
Ajahn Brahm recounts a story of a bad toothache which was giving him immense pain. He tried meditating but was unable to because he was in so much pain. Finally, after nothing worked, he opened up his heart to the pain and said to himself, Pain, the door of my heart is open to you. He kept experiencing the pain without rejecting it. And sure enough, the pain lessened and eventually left him.
In life, one should not only have loving kindness in the present but also in the past and future. Its important to forgive oneself for ones past. To accept oneself and embrace oneself. Its important to accept all that has happened. One should practice loving kindness and remember the good things that happened in the past. When coming home after a days work, forgetting what went wrong at work and remembering all that went right is worthwhile. This however does not mean that we should entirely ignore what went wrong. However, its important to bring the good things home to your spouse rather than the unpleasant things. We must learn from the past and from our mistakes and not think about the people who wronged us. Its important to forgive others. Forgiveness leads to freedom and to happiness. It is senseless to want to hurt for hurt caused. It just perpetuates suffering. Anger, according to the Buddha, is temporary insanity. 
Its important to have metta for oneself as well as for others. Its important that compassion is directed at the correct place. Its not about you or me. Its about us. Compassion for oneself without compassion for others is not enough. Compassion for others without compassion for oneself is not enough. The door of my heart should be open to all beings. I need to have compassion for myself so that I can be of greater help to other people. 
Metta can be associated with all religions. The heart is where loving kindness comes from. 
Loving kindness is embracing the diversity of human beings. Human beings are not perfect. According to the Buddha, there is nothing, absolutely nothing that cannot be forgiven. 
Having a positive outlook for the future is important. Whatever happens to us, we should deal with it in a positive way. Always hope for the best without giving into despair. 
Life is a bundle of experiences. How we react to each situation is what matters. Normally we react with attachment, aversion or ignorance. If we just experience life as it unfolds and be mindful from moment to moment, thats what matters. Its also important to have a sense of gratitude in life. To live with grace and harmony with whatever is happening.
Above are some of the teachings Ive learnt from Ajahn Brahm. I hope theyll be of great value to you too. With Metta, Namali.

The government will be in a position to set up the Truth Commission soon and to gazette the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) under a selected ministry, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva said today.
He said reconciliation was not an easy task but assured the Government would go ahead despite obstacles by 'racists and those with petty political agendas'.
We are moving ahead as fast as we can to achieve reconciliation. As a sovereign country and people, we have taken steps within a democratic setting, he told Daily Mirror.
He said there was no pressure from the international community on Sri Lanka though Sinhala and Tamil extremists in the country were attempting to ignite racism by provoking religious leaders and people on the UN resolution and Constitutional amendments.
They are hell-bent on misleading the people and sabotage reconciliation efforts. These groups are sowing seeds of disharmony by the lucre amassed in the past, the deputy minister said.
When asked about the two-year-extension given by the UNHRC to implement the UN resolution, he said the Government has given a timeline to the people of the country.
Constitutional amendments are part of this timeline. Our stance is to move ahead while protecting our identity, the deputy minister said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Love of life, with the exception of an Arahant in whom the notion is non-existent, does not extinguish with ones death. Hence the endless process of recurring existence. 
As Ven. Rerukane Chandawimala Mahanayake Thera notes in his masterly rendition on intricacies of insight meditation, this primordial love of life in man called sakkaya ditthi requires that he continue to remain a distinct individual in the world, whereas in reality he is a mere collection of the four mental factors and the four great elements (maha bhootha), the quintessence of existence. Comprehensive realization of this salient truth is termed ditthi visuddhi. A gross manifestation of the notion of self is when one feels that remaining a mere individual is monotonous and humdrum. Rising above others, they demand to be heard, sung of in praises and held in adulation. Primus inter pares, the primitive instinct at play. At the other end of the spectrum are the sublime heroes of seclusion, embarking on a path or having reached its end, withdrawn, reserved and shunning publicity. A few such characters who adorn the scriptures will be a subject of discussion here. 
A group of elderly bhikkhus was once dwelling in the Mango Forest in Majjimasanda during the time of the Blessed One when the erudite Gokula householder, Citta invited them to his residence for a meal. He personally served them with milk rice cooked in ghee. When the monks began leaving after the meal, he followed closely behind, having instructed the inmates to clear the remaining food. In the sweltering heat outside, they felt they were almost withering. The Mahaka Thera, the youngest among the gathering of bhikkhus, opined that it would be nice if a cold wind blew, some clouds hovered overhead and a few drops of rain came down. The venerable elders agreed. 
Mahaka Thera then performed a spiritual wonder where a cold wind blew, clouds drifted above and drops of rain came down. It occurred to the householder that such were the miraculous powers of the young Bhikkhu Mahaka. 
On arrival at the hermitage, the several monks went to their respective dwellings and Mahaka Thera to his. Citta the householder, followed Mahaka Thera, worshipped him and said Venerable Sir, may the noble Mahaka Thera be kind enough to show me a superhuman feat of miraculous power. The monk replied, then householder, spread your shoulder cloth on the verandah and scatter some grass on it. The householder did as was told. Thereupon, the bhikkhu entered his dwelling, closed the door and sent flames through the keyhole and the space between the door and frame that turned the grass to ash but left the shawl intact. Having shaken out the shawl, Citta stood to a side, terrified. Mahaka Thera emerged from the room and said Is this enough, householder Venerable Mahaka, it is enough, it is adequate. Much was done. May noble Mahaka Thera delight in the magnificent Mango Grove and continue to live here. I will not fail in providing Ven Mahaka Thera with robes, alms food, lodgings and medicines. That is kind of you, householder the noble Thera said. He set his room in order and left Majjimasanda, taking with him his bowl and robes, never to return again. 
The case of Haththaka Alawaka is equally sensational, in different mode and tenor. In his young days, he was saved from an unimaginably horrific death through the intervention of the Buddha. 
Many years on, when the Blessed One was residing at the Aggalawa shrine at Alaunuwara, he had occasion to address the bhikkhus, Monks, bear in mind that young Haththaka Alawaka possesses seven amazing, astounding qualities. He is endowed with faith, he is virtuous and is possessed of a sense of moral shame. He has a sense of moral fear. He is learned, generous and he is wise. You have to remember that Haththaka Alawaka is one with these seven qualities. 
The following morning, one of the monks approached Haththaka Alawaka and repeated exactly what the Buddha had said of him. 
Said Haththaka Alawaka, Venerable Sir, was there a white-clad layman present when the Blessed One said it 
No friend, there was no white clad layman present when the Blessed One said it 
Venerable Sir, it is good there was no layman present there 
When the monk narrated the conversation he had with young Haththaka Alawaka, the Blessed One pronounced Bhikkhu, sadhu sadhu, that clansman of minimal desires wishes not even his wholesome qualities become public knowledge. Therefore bhikkuhs, bear in mind that he possesses an eighth amazing, astounding quality, that of fewness of desires. 
Fewness of desires and wants termed Appiccatha is a sine qua non for progress on the path, as enumerated in the marvellous teaching. A foremost figure in the assembly of the Buddhas noble disciples renowned for extreme frugality and incredulously solitary lifestyle was Maha Arahant Manthanipuththa Punna, peerless in the wondrous art of proclaiming to the world the dasakatha, the ten exemplary qualities of detachment, morality, energy, isolation and contentment, among others. 
Each Arahant in the immaculate Bhikkhu Order was a remarkably exceptional personage. Majjantika was the Maha Arahant assigned to officiate at the offering ceremony of a stupa to Sangha by Emperor Asoka. People gathered asked the noble Bhikkhu to move away, seeing the coarse, worthless robe he had worn for such a solemn occasion. Who else other that an Arahant like me should assist the Emperor in an event as this he thought, and disappeared into the earth to reappear near the stupa to perform his function. 
Again, Bhikkhu Sosanika Maha Kumara lived in the cemetery for sixty years engaged in the most harsh, spine-chilling form of meditation known to man without anyone coming to know of it. The particular ascetic practice is awe-inspiring, he said later. Vissuddhi Magga discloses, at a point of time, certain meditators feel as though the corpse actually keeps walking behind them- the moment of reckoning for the recluse, for there is no cadaver that ever rose from the grave. 
Sakethatissa Thera was averse to his erudition and declined to preach or to answer questions put to him by monks on the pretext that he was hard pressed for time. The monks sallied him whether he had arrived at deaths door. He left his accusers, came to Kihiriwela Ocean Shrine, where on the day ending the rainy retreat (Vas) he delivered a sermon that lit up the entire state. These noble bhikkhus did proud the great religion whose cornerstones are simplicity, honesty and humility. 
Diametrically opposed to the ethos above, is the taint of Mahecctha, wanting to display ones knowledge and being limitless in ones wants and requirements. The inferno, the ocean and the mahecca individual are not appeased even with many possessions, states the commentary. 
Athriccatha is defined as discontentment with ones own gain and the desire to acquire equal gains as of another. Papiccatha signifies display of qualities which one does not possess and accepting more offerings than the actual requirement. 
Finally, in an era where mankind is in relentless pursuit of insatiable fame, power and material acquisition, the five great bhikkhus and the lone layman named above, cast an ethereal spell on the whole of humanity which wittingly or unwittingly is drawn towards a fantasy world that has miserably failed in its promise of Utopia.
