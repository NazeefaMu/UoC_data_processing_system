A purposeful approach to Labour Law and Relations
	
Labour Law and Relations: A Human Resource Management Approach written by Dr.Arosha S.Adikaram is yet another successful book which contains a wealth of information on labour rights and relations. Written in simple and lucid English the book aims to address almost all issues that employers and employees come across in the work place. From describing how relationships should work to how rights are protected by justice mechanisms the book is a detailed hand book which can guide both employers and employees. 
In short the book, as the title implies, is a complete study of labour law and relations. The book explores diverse topics within the scope defined, such as employee relations, terms and conditions of employment, trade union activities, employee benefits, health and safety at work etc. The book goes on to describe the boundaries within which employers can exercise their power. For instance, employers cannot terminate the work of pregnant women simply for being pregnant. Their rights are protected by the Shop and Office Employee Act and the Maternity benefits Ordinance. Similarly the book lays down the laws pertaining to handling different types of employees such as fixed term contract employees, probationers, casual employees, apprentices, temporary employees and seasonal employees. The writer shows how coordination and effective management can prevent unpleasant situations at the workplace. 
The writer also compares the available judicial remedies with those of other countries. For instance, the writer points out how sexual harassment can cause companies in other countries to bear high cost fines, whereas in Sri Lanka the penalty is a maximum of a mere Rs.10,000! 
The writer has critically evaluated the important legislations found in labour law. Facts beneficial to employees, such as the stipulated number of working hours, are clearly depicted. Accordingly employees cannot be employed for more than eight hours a day. Companies are allowed to employ workers for an additional hour in, instead of the weekly half-day.
The special provisions related to employment of female workers and young persons in shops and offices, rules regarding the hours of interval, calculation of overtime, leave and holidays, remuneration, are also described. In terms of trade union actions, the writer points out the legal and illegal aspects of it, and how such actions should be dealt with both from the perspectives of the employer and the employee. Further the writer also makes note of progressive steps in employment such as establishing day-care centres and
elder-care facilities. 
The author also discusses the role of Labour Tribunals set up under the Industrial Disputes Act. Labour Tribunals, which function on a district basis, deal with matters such as the termination of service of employees by employers. The writer points out that there is a backlog of cases in Labour Tribunals which delay justice being served. The book comprises 24 chapters. Each chapter starts off with a summary of what the chapter entails and a set of questions. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the topic. The answers to the questions are given at the end of the chapter. The theoretical knowledge imparted in the chapter is tested by the interesting case studies and questions found at the end. Hence each chapter is shaped for readers to grasp the theories fast and easily, so as to apply them effectively in their day to day lives. 
Though the book primarily caters to the needs of students and practitioners of Human Resource Management, it is a book that could be read by anyone interested in gaining knowledge on the subject. Information is presented in a very reader-friendly manner. Concepts are explained through diagrams, tables and graphics which are appealing and easy
to grasp. 
Labour Law and Relations published by Stamford Lake (Pvt) Ltd is available in all leading
book stores.
About the writer...
Dr. Arosha S. Adikaram
Speaking of her latest endeavour of releasing the second edition of this book Dr. Adikaram, a senior lecturer in Human Resource Management at the Faculty of Management and Finance of the University of Colombo, said that the most challenging aspect of compiling the book was to make sure that the book was easy to understand while its content was unharmed. When I was studying the subject, most books on labour law were difficult to understand. Later, I started on a guidebook for students in my university. I received very good feedback from students and lecturers and they suggested I wrote a book. The first edition of this book was a result of five years of work, said Dr. Adikaram, recalling the journey she undertook to compile the book. She is the writer of many acclaimed books including Contract of Employment and Employment Law: Questions and Answers and Dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace.

A Salute to a Centenarian
	
A century, whether it be at a cricket match or a break on the billiard table is an event which calls for publicity and celebrations. 
I consider it a great honour and privilege to send this congratulatory message to my very dear sister-in-law, Mrs. Sumana de Silva, my husbands sister, on her one hundredth birthday which will be on the 8th of May. 
Sumana Akka, as we all affectionately call her, was born on May 8, 1917 in Ambalangoda. She was the eldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Patuwatha Withana Thomas de Silva. She started schooling at Girls High School, Kandy and later when her father joined Government service, she joined Southlands College, Galle, where she was a boarder at the Hostel. She joined the Govt. Training College in 1941 when it was situated at Thurstan Road and passed out as an English teacher in 1942. After training, she joined Prajapathi Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda and later taught for a short time at Mahabodhi College, Colombo. She spent 27 years of her teaching career at Ananda College, Colombo from 1948 to 1975. During her tenure as a teacher, she was sent on a scholarship to the University of Michigan to study English as a second language. 
As a teacher, thousands of students have passed through her hands and Im sure she still remembers each and every one by name. Many of her students have become leading doctors, lawyers, engineers, administrators, academics, officers of the Armed Services, Police, businessmen, planters and so on. 
She always practised what she preached and left an indelible mark on everyone who came into contact with her. She was a much-loved teacher, who rendered almost 35 years to education. She never sought publicity but went on in quiet efficiency throughout the years, giving of her best at all times. Generations of young men have surely reaped the benefits of her high ideals and values. 
Sumana Akka is very kind-hearted and possessed a sense of fair play and justice. Simplicity was the hallmark of her personality. She possesses many admirable qualities  patience, integrity, amiability and honesty. 
She married Mr. Donald de Silva who worked at the Department of Fisheries. Her husband passed away in 1994, just a couple of months before their 50th wedding anniversary. She was the pivot around which her family unit revolved. Her family always came first. She symbolized the quintessential qualities of motherhood and was an exemplary mother whose devotion and concern for her children extended beyond their childhood years. Her unconditional love and understanding allowed her children to make their own way in life and today all of them are doing extremely well. 
She is the mother of four children. The eldest, Dr. Lal de Silva, is a consultant surgeon. The second, Dr. Iyanthiemala Abeywickreme is also a consultant physician and was the former President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association. Tissa de Silva, the third is an engineer and is the Director of Intelligent Systems (lBl) Group in Canada. The youngest, Channa de Silva who captained the Ananda College Cricket team was an officer in the Air Force and migrated to Australia after marriage. 
Although Sumana Akka is a centenarian, she has her wits about her and is interested in all that is happening around her and in the country. Very great indeed! Till recently she was an avid reader and is still an ardent cricket fan and a champion at Scrabble. She is a very good seamstress and has done exquisite cross-stitch embroidery on her own clothes as well as household linen. She is an excellent cook and can turn out tasty dishes in a jiffy. All these activities have slowed down gradually due to failing eyesight. She is a true Buddhist and lives by the principles she upholds. After her retirement it was her practice to visit the Kuppiyawatte Temple regularly. She lives with her daughter at Fifth Lane, Colpetty. 
Heres wishing her a very happy birthday and may the Noble Triple Gem bless her with good health, happiness, peace and contentment, all of which she richly deserves.

Britain says will not be bullied in Brexit talks
	
Britains Brexit minister David Davis warned Wednesday that it would not be bullied in upcoming negotiations with the EU, and rejected a report that its exit bill could reach 100 billion euros. 
We are going into this negotiation not as a supplicant, but as a negotiator, Davis said. 
He dismissed a report in the Financial Times suggesting Britain must settle bills of up to 100 billion euros ($109 billion) before leaving. 
The figure is significantly more than the 60-billion-euro figure previously mooted, and Davis told ITV televisions Good Morning Britain programme: We will not be paying 100 billion. But he added that in financial terms, we will obey our international obligations. 
He also dismissed a report in The Times that the European Commission would stop Prime Minister Theresa May negotiating with other EU leaders. 
There are two sides to the negotiation and the other side will not determine who does what. She will be leading our negotiation. I will be supporting her, Davis told BBC radio. 
The EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will on Wednesday unveil recommendations for the talks, as tensions rise between the two sides. 
May, who is in the middle of a general election campaign, was put on the defensive this week by leaks about a disastrous dinner with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. 
In response, she boasted Tuesday that she would be a bloody difficult woman in the talks -- a description that had been used about her by a former colleague. 
Davis on Wednesday dismissed the various reports as a mixture of gossip and spin and said the British public should take them with a pinch of salt. 
The leaders of the other 27 EU nations on Saturday unanimously agreed a tough set of guidelines for the talks with Britain, covering issues of money, trade and the rights of EU citizens. 
They talk about negotiating guidelines, theyre sort of demands that have been lined up... this has to be by agreement, Davis said. 
He added: We are full members of the European Union until we leave... and were going to use our rights under the rules.

CB bond issue: PT makes profit of Rs.14,845 Mn: JVP
	
Testifying before the Presidential Commission on on the Central Bank bond issue, JVP provincial councilor Wasantha Samarasinghe said yesterday Perpetual Treasuries (PT) had made a profit of Rs.14,845 million on the sale of bonds from February 27, 2015 to May 26, 2016.
He said according to his calculations the Central Bank had suffered a loss of Rs.55,000 million during this period.
Mr. Samarasinghe said the decision to increase the interest rate to 12.5% before the acceptance of the bids amounting to Rs.10.058 billion bids on February 27 had affected the countrys economy with the State incurring a loss of more than Rs.144,000 million.
When asked how he obtained the details to prepare his reports, Mr. Samarasinghe said several primary dealers had provided significant details on this matter.
The Commission of Inquiry said the identity of those primary dealers would be vital to the inquiry and will undertake to record their evidence in camera as such asked him to reveal the names of the primary dealers who gave the details.
Yes, I can identify the primary dealers who provided these details on the assurance of protecting their identity, Mr. Samarsinghe said.
Mr. Nihal Fernando PC, who appeared for the Perpetual Treasuries and Counsel Chanaka de Silva who appeared for Arjun Mahendran cross examined the witness.
Some contradictions came to light during the cross examination on the yield rates and the interest rates cited in the drafts prepared by the witness raising doubts to the accuracy of the reports.
Meanwhile, in his evidence MP Weerakumara Dissanayake, who was a member of the two COPE committees told the Commission yesterday that during the COPE inquiries it was evident that the Central Bank had disregarded the advise of the Auditor General.
The Commission comprised Supreme Court Judges K. T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai. They will resume the inquiry today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

CPC not involved in tomorrow's strike - JSS
	
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Unions today denied their involvement with the countrywide strike to be launched tomorrow by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), as lengthy queues were forming up with panicked motorists around the city filling stations this evening.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, CPC Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya (JSS) Secretary Ananda Palitha said there was no need to develop any hoax-fear on fuel shortage.
He said according to false news spreading, people had been panicked and seen rushing towards filling stations to refuel their vehicles causing long queues outside the filling stations.
Palitha said a minimum of 13,200 litres of fuel which is received by a filling station would be sufficient for a couple of days. However, the stocks could be drained rapidly due to long queues and unnecessary panic.
He said there is no need to go for a trade union action as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given a written assurance saying no decision on the Trincomalee China Bay Oil Tank Farm will be taken without discussing with the trade unions.
No need to panic because CPC employees are not on strike. The false rumours has been aired. We request the public to stay calm, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Downsizing security poses life threat to MR - JO
	
The Joint Opposition said today that the curtailing of the security provided to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was a well-planned conspiracy hatched by several national and international forces in an attempt to eliminate him from politics.
JO member and MP Prasanna Ranatunga told a media briefing that a group of security officers who were assigned for VIP protection with foreign training of Mr. Rajapaksa had been re-called under immediate service requirements on last Tuesday, just after the May Day rally.
In several instances during the May Day rallies, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne have hinted on some sort of danger which could risk the life of Mr. Rajapaksa in the future, he said.
He also said that the trimming of Mr. Rajapaksas security was a serious matter of concern and added that it was a huge threat to his life. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Dual citizenship: Law should be equal to all: JVP
	
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said today the law with regard to dual citizenship should be equal to both government and opposition MPs.
He told parliament that there could not be three laws - one for Geetha Kumarasinghe, one for government members and one for members of the Rajapaksa faction.
He said the court had unseated Ms. Kumarasinghe for being a dual citizen of Switzerland while some Ministers who held dual citizenships of Switzerland were without any legal action as alleged by Ms.Kumarasinghe.
"Ms. Kumarasinghe has alleged that there are ministers in the government who hold dual citizenship of Switzerland. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera also had alleged that there are some members who held American dual citizenship in the Joint Opposition as well. People want to know who they are The law cannot be implemented selectively," he said.
Mr. Herath said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution clearly specified that anyone with dual citizenship could not contest parliamentary elections and get elected.
He said the law should apply to both government and opposition members reasonably. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Free Out-patient care at NFTH tomorrow
	
The Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) in Malabe, which currently operates under the management of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will open its Out Patient Department (OPD) to the general public, free of charge tomorrow (May 5) in view of the islandwide strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the hospital announced today.
SAITM and NFTH Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said, The GMOA strikes are launched against SAITM, supposedly in the interest of the publics health and well-being, which they claim are at risk because SAITM students do not have enough clinical exposure. Regrettably their strikes are taking place at a time when the nation is facing grave health issues and the general public is in need of all healthcare professionals in the country. Its nothing short of tragic that the GMOA is holding patients at ransom to pursue selfish personal agendas and political schemes.
Dr. Fernando reiterates that the NFTH was established in 2012 after SAITM MBBS students were refused access to state hospitals for clinical training by the GMOA. Then too the GMOA threatened strike action and halted SAITM MBBS students from undergoing clinical training at state hospitals, even after these students were officially directed to the Homagama Base Hospital and Talangama Hospital by the Government.
He strongly condemned the GMOAs rejection of the Government stand on SAITM, which aims to standardize medical education in Sri Lanka, subject SATIM students to further clinical training and examinations as per the formalized standards of medical education in Sri Lanka and align the NFTH under the Ministry of Health, the NFTH said in a statement.

Speaking to journalists outside the EC office, Ms. Kumarasinghe said that she had handed over the documents pertaining to the appeal to EC.
I informed the Speaker of the House and the General Secretary of Parliament about my decision to appeal against the AC ruling. I hope justice will be served by the Supreme Court, she said.
She said she could have kept her seat in parliamentary if she had no self-respect and joined hands with the government.
However, she said she could still serve the people as she had not lost her seat yet. We have lodged an appeal against the verdict. Therefore, I still have time and will not lose the seat until the Supreme Court delivers its ruling on the appeal, she said. 
The Appeal Court issued a verdict on Wednesday, disqualifying MP Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding on to her seat in Parliament as she has violated the Constitution by failing to notify Parliament that she had dual-citizenship. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Parliament Secretary General Dammika Dissanayake said today his office would consult the Attorney General on the legality of MP Geetha Kumarasinghe's parliamentary seat once the Court of Appeal notified him of its ruling in this regard.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Tuesday disqualifying Ms. Kumarasinghe to remain in her capacity as MP because of her dual citizenship.
However, she informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Mr. Dissanayake through her lawyer that she would appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling, and therefore asked the parliamentary authorities to withhold deprivation of her from her seat.
Asked about the situation, Mr. Dissanayake said he would seek the Attorney Generals opinion once the ruling by the Appeal Court was communicated to him through the formal channel.
Meanwhile, former Minister G.L. Peiris, who spoke on behalf of Ms. Kumarasinghe said the appeal papers would be lodged in the Supreme Court early next week.
To prevent any kind of action being taken in the meantime, we are informing all the relevant authorities. We are asking for nothing to be done until the appeal is heard and disposed of. Otherwise, the right of appeal is nugatory.
When the High Court announces a death sentence on a person, he has the right to appeal in the Court of Appeal and then in the Supreme Court. If the sentence is executed, the right to appeal will be of no use, Prof. Peiris said. (Kelum Bandara)

ITAK willing to include former militants: Mavai
	
The ITAK is willing to absorb the rehabilitated former militants into mainstream politics, Leader of the ITAK and Parliamentarian Mavai Senathirajah said.
He said this at the TNA May Day rally held in Alayadivembu Dharmasangari playground in Ampara.
Mr. Senathirajah said that the former militants had collectively formed a new party and since they had been rehabilitated, the ITAK wished to absorb them into democratic politics.
Despite the fact that the TNA made a public announcement during the last EPC elections that their cooperation would be extended to elect a Muslim Member as the Chief Minister, the Muslims failed to comply with. We made the announcement as a gesture of goodwill to lay the platform to a merged North-East. The TNA was voicing against repressive measures and injustice and was fighting for the legitimate rights of the Tamils, he said.
ITAK Leader said that the TNA was making all possible efforts to evolve a political solution to the Tamils and was also determined to attain the objective of a merged North-East.
"The Tamils cautiously worked to defeat Mahinda Rajapakse and form a new government and as a result the new government headed by Maithripala Sirisena is wielding power now.
Thanthai Chelva launched peaceful protests then to win over our legitimate rights. Thereafter, an armed conflict took place and the TNA was working hard now to evolve a solution democratically. Our strength is your valuable votes. Hence, the TNA is working towards evolving a solution with the strength of your votes and with support and assistance from the international community, Parliamentarian Senathirajah said.

Keeping siblings together Advocacy effort by SOS Sri Lanka
	
In the absence of parental care, siblings often become the most important people in each others lives... The most cherished memories that are often treasured are those that lie within ones childhood. Reminiscing and reliving the moments spent amongst laughter and happiness with family is a common pleasantry that the best of us may be charged guilty of. But not everyone holds the fortune of experiencing a happy childhood. Childhood treating them cruelly, from a very young age a handful of children are orphaned due to the demise of parents, abandonment by parents, poverty or disharmony at home which may include domestic violence, alcoholism and land disputes. 
That is where SOS childrens villages Sri Lanka (SOS CVSL) steps in. Established in May 1980, under the agreement of SOS Kinderdorf International and the Ministry of Social Services, government of Sri Lanka, SOS CVSL is committed to the welfare of these children who are orphaned, abandoned or neglected and deprived of a happy childhood, giving these children the opportunity to build lasting relationships with a loving family by placing them in homes that are part of an actual village in a family-based long term care with individualized attention, helping them to shape their own futures. Currently there are 6 SOS villages in the country and around 40 other SOS projects being managed. SOS CVSL supports children and adolescents by providing day care, education, vocational training opportunities and medical services. Through their most valued family strengthening programme, SOS CVSL provides direct support, education and counseling to families experiencing hardships, so that parents can cope up with their burdens and the ultimate goal being that the children continue to grow up in their own families, preventing the misfortune of these children losing parental care and thus leading to the worst case scenario i.e. institutionalization. Their vision is that every child belongs to a family and should grow with love, respect and security. Their mission is to build families for children in need, to help them shape their future and share in the development of their communities. Children whose families cannot take care of them can find a loving home in one of the SOS families. 
Sibling relationships are emotionally powerful and to be separated with siblings, the only bridge to the natural families of these children in need, can add to the trauma that they undergo through the separation with their parents prolonging their distress. In the absence of parental care, siblings often become the most important people in each others lives Hence in the efforts of avoiding such emotional upheaval, keeping siblings together was initiated under never give up on a child advocacy programme of SOS CVSL which can be regarded as yet another endeavor by SOS village in ensuring the best interests of the child. To shed more light on the initiative, keeping siblings together for public awareness, the Daily Mirror spoke to Ms. Chathuri Jayasooriya, national advisor-advocacy, SOS CVSL.There is no smoke without fire and when asked what led to the initiation of keeping siblings together she related a heartfelt tale that dated back to November 2014. The Juvenile Courts in Battaramulla gave an order for a child to be given in adoption where the child concerned was one of a pair of twins who were living at SOS CV Piliyandala. The child was 11 years old and did not wish to be adopted by being separated from his siblings, yet in April 2016 the relevant District Court Judge gave an interim order for the adoption regardless, claiming it to be in the best interest of the child, violating both the law and the rights of the child. The children were greatly affected emotionally following the adoption process as they did not want to be separated.
The child didnt settle down with the adoptive parents. This caused distress not only to the separated sibling but also to the adoptive parents as well and finally the child was reunited with his siblings and the SOS family in August 2016 as he was unable to adapt to the new family. Ms.Jayasooriya described the moment of the twins reunion as a heart-rending moment. She further pointed out that the only biological link that these children have in the absence of parental care is with their siblings and separation can cause immense emotional dilemma on the children. The importance of the bond between siblings is strongly highlighted through what a child from SOS CVSL had to say regarding this matter. It is such a blessing that I get to live with my elder sister. We have a strong bond between us. I wont be able to bear it if I ever have to send her to a different place. I wont be able to express that pain with words. If something like that happens,either I will go with her or I will find her somehow.We can never be away from each other.And so the initiative keeping siblings together was born. 
According to the UN guidelines of 2010, the UN provisions articulate that, siblings with existing bonds should in principle not be separated by placements in alternative care unless there is a clear risk of abuse or other justification in the best interests of the child. It is further stipulated that every effort should be made to enable siblings to maintain contact with each other, unless this is against their wishes or interests. The issue of sibling separation has also been addressed by the national child protection authority in the draft, guidelines and standards for child care institution in Sri Lanka (2013) which states, Priority should be given to children with siblings when allocating them to institutions and efforts should be made to keep the family intact as far as possible. But this issue has not been addressed in any of the key laws and policies pertaining to alternative care of children ordinance and the orphanage ordinance. Miss. Chathuri remarked on this by saying, However the above guidelines are not commonly known, referred or adhered to by child care institutions or relevant government officials including some probation officers and judges, who routinely separate siblings owing to current practice.The advocacy programme, keeping siblings together has also developed a policy brief which includes recommendations pertaining to this matter which has already been presented to the government and civil society stakeholders which has been received positively, and is to be extended shortly to the public and child care institution owners, managers and caregivers. 
It has also been stated that SOS CVSL is lobbying with the ministry of women and child affairs for a circular to be issued in order to solidify the efforts of keeping siblings together. The circular is expected to be issued to all relevant stakeholders including law enforcement authorities.SOS CVSL is also lobbying with the provincial commissioner to issue circulars and incorporate it into existing provincial laws and policies. However, Miss. Jayasooriya stresses on the fact that all their hard work will come out meaningless without the infrastructure and the resource basis to implement them. 
Although as a country we still do not have sufficient infrastructure to accommodate the siblings, especially sisters and brothers, together in the same child care institution except SOS CVSL and a few others. This circular is expected to raise awareness among relevant authorities on prevention of possible sibling separations until such facilities are made available island wide. Siblings placed in alternative care are separated primarily on the basis of gender. Only 19% of the child care institutions accommodate both girls and boys while some of them admit both genders only up to a certain age due to cultural and systematic issues. The govt should take measures and invest resources as there is a resource issue that exist within children homes and the accommodation of both boys and girls is not possible. I am only requesting the renovation of existing homes to accommodate siblings of both genders, improving the facilities as well as the capacity of caregivers in at least one chosen child care institution in each district to accommodate and care for natural siblings of both genders.
Ms. Jayasooriya noted that the heads of both the NCPA and the National Department of Probation and Child Care Services (DPCCS) have agreed to this proposal and they are currently continuing discussions in this regard to explore ways in which this can be done practically.

Namal rebuffs SF
	
Responding to Minister Sarath Fonsekas statement that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should be hung by his saatakaya, Mr. Rajapaksas son Namal said yesterday it would not be that easy as long as the former presidents three sons and the people were with him.
The MP told a media briefing that Mr. Fonseka should hang the former presidents sons and his supporters before hanging him.
Unfortunately, Mr. Fonseka, the same person who is in need to hang the former president of the country, has been appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to discipline the people, he said.
Meanwhile, the MP said the former president was the main focus at several May Day rallies. He said the government had challenged them to fill the Galle Face Green with people at the joint oppositions May Day rally and had successfully met that challenge.
The MP said it was now the turn of the government to take up the challenge of holding elections without further delay. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Prince Philip to step down from carrying out royal engagements
	
The Duke of Edinburgh is retiring from royal duties this autumn, Buckingham Palace has announced.
The decision was made by Prince Philip himself and is supported by the Queen, a palace spokesman said.
The duke, who turns 96 next month, will attend previously scheduled engagements between now and August but will not accept new invitations.
The Queen "will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements", the palace said.
The duke carried out 110 days of engagements in 2016, making him the fifth busiest member of the royal family, according to Court Circular listings.
He is patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations and will continue to be associated with them, but "will no longer play an active role by attending engagements", Buckingham Palace said.
In the statement, the spokesman said the duke "may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time".
BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the duke "clearly feels he now wishes to curtail" his "familiar role" in support of the Queen.
He added: "The Queen is going to continue, of that there is no doubt. She will continue, albeit with a somewhat lightened workload."
The duke attended Lord's Cricket Ground to open a new stand on Wednesday and was heard joking at the event that he is the "world's most experienced plaque unveiler".
He is famed for off-the-cuff remarks he has made at royal engagements around the world over the years.
Prime Minister Theresa May said she offered the country's "deepest gratitude and good wishes" to the duke following his announcement.
She added: "From his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen to his inspirational Duke of Edinburgh Awards and his patronage of hundreds of charities and good causes, his contribution to our United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the wider world will be of huge benefit to us all for years to come."
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wished the duke "all the best in his well-earned retirement", saying: "He has dedicated his life to supporting the Queen and our country with a clear sense of public duty.
"His Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme has inspired young people for more than 60 years in over 140 nations."
Prince Philip set up the awards in 1956 and they have become one of the UK's best-known youth programmes, with young people carrying out challenges to earn bronze, silver or gold awards.
The duke and the Queen celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary - their 70th - in November.
They have called a halt to long-haul travel in recent years, with younger royals carrying out those duties.
On Thursday, he and the Queen are due at a service for members of the Order of Merit at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace before hosting a lunch for those attending.
Royal commentator Dickie Arbiter said the duke is in "robust health", adding: "He is not giving up on life, just stepping [down] from full-time public engagements". (BBC)

SLTB, private buses not supporting strike
	
The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) and the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Service today said they would not participate in tomorrow's trade union strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
LPBOA chairman Gemumu Wijerathne told journalists that there was no need to support the doctors because they never supported any other organizations and most of the time they used to criticize bus drivers and conductors.
Mr. Wijerathne advised the public to not to trust mafia strikers like GMOA and there was no need to fear of any bus shortages.
As a private bus association, we will support the GMOA strike if the GMOA agrees to three conditions proposed by us. The doctors should stop their private practice, should provide ten year continuous service in the government sector and should not appoint doctors with foreign medical degrees to the government service, Mr. Wijerathne said.
If GMOA agrees to these three conditions the LPBOA will definitely support their strike.
Even the President Maithripala Sirisena issued a notice about the governments status about SAITM. The doctors union is trying to go beyond the presidents decision, he said.
While addressing media Sri Lanka Transport Board Trade Union Federation Secretary Ranjith Wijesiri said that they also decided not to support today's GMOA strike.
Every SLTB employee will be on duty, he said.
Meanwhile, Inter Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said that would support the GMOA strike by hoisting black flags on buses but will not stop their service. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

TNA urges govt. to reconsider and reformulate proposals
	
While expressing its concern over Cabinet approval for a policy and legal framework relating to the proposed Counter-Terrorism Act, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today urged the Government to reconsider and urgently reformulate its proposals.
We have not been consulted on the terms of the draft framework, which has recently appeared in the press and appears to be a Cabinet memorandum approved on 25th April 2017, TNA Spokesman MP M A Sumanthiran said in a statement.
We urge the Government to reconsider and urgently reformulate its proposals in light of the fundamental need to avoid torture and enforced disappearance, prevent abuse and effectively investigate actual threats to terrorism, he said.
The statement said;
We are shocked by the extent to which the draft framework curtails civil liberties, erodes judicial control over the state security apparatus and the staggering potential for abuse and torture. We are unequivocally committed to supporting a legal framework that would prevent and punish acts of terrorism in a manner that is lawful, in compliance with fundamental rights and the rule of law. To this end, we have engaged constructively in Parliament. We are therefore deeply perturbed by the turn the governments latest draft has taken.
We observe that the proposed definition of terrorism would extend far beyond activities defined internationally as terrorism, replicating restrictions on free speech that have previously been used to punish dissenting voices including politicians and journalists such as Asath Salley and J. S. Tissainayagam among others. The definitions are also exceedingly vague and indeterminate, and would have a chilling effect on advocacy in favour of greater diversity in Sri Lanka.
Moreover, the proposed framework envisages the unconstitutional stripping of judicial discretion even where a suspect is produced before a Magistrate after arrest, and renders the judge a virtual appendage of the executive arm. The safeguards which we believe are essential to prevent torturesuch as eliminating confessionswere initially assured, but have since been reversed. The present framework envisages the admissibility of confessions under certain conditions, which are deeply inadequate to prevent torture and abuse given the widespread and continuing practice of torture in Sri Lanka. Moreover, the Act also permits the extensive violation of the rights of those wholly unconnected with terrorism.
We urge the Government to reconsider and urgently reformulate its proposals in light of the fundamental need to avoid torture and enforced disappearance, prevent abuse and effectively investigate actual threats to terrorism. The proposed framework neither ensures the security nor the liberty of Sri Lankans. Instead, it represents an attempt to enlarge the scope of unchecked executive power over the citizen, stifle freedom of speech and diversity, and provide the necessary loopholes for continued torture and abuse. We wish to reiterate that the protection of the rights of our citizens--particularly given the legacy of horrific past abuses--should not be sacrificed on the altar of trade concessions.
