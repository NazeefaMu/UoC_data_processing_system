Blanket amnesty for money repatriated from Swiss Banks: FinMin
	
The government extended an olive branch to all Sri Lankan nationals, allowing them to repatriate all foreign investments with no questions asked.
?Please bring back your money to Sri Lanka. We won?t ask any questions and we will guarantee safety. We have already instructed the Exchange Control Department, the Central Bank and the commercial banks,? Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He said that the government took the decision after the Union Bank of Switzerland downgraded Sri Lanka and two other countries and ordered the closure of all accounts of these countries in its banking system.
?If the Swiss are asking you to leave, bring them here instead of taking them to Dubai or Singapore. You can put them in a current account, or invest in bonds, the stock market, or put them in savings,? Karunanayake said.
He added that the Sri Lankan Diaspora alone had foreign investments of US$10-15 billion, and the government expects US$2-3 billion in inflows in the next 6 months.
?We already have the confidence of the world with the outcomes in Geneva and New York. So place your confidence in us. You?re getting zero percent interest there. Come and get 3-4 percent interest here,? he said.
He went on to say that this would be the solution to the low local savings which is stifling local investments.
??Instead of paying foreigners interest on bonds, we want local funds,? he said. Nearly 50 percent of the country?s debt is from foreign sources.
Karunanayake expressed that this would be the first step in creating a financial hub in Sri Lanka, and said that Indians too will be requested to bring their savings here, capitalizing on the close working relationship between the Prime Ministers of the two countries.
He added that success from this exercise would strengthen the rupee. The rupee has fallen 7 percent
against the dollar this year after the Central Bank decided to stop intervention to maintain foreign reserves.
Karunanayake was unable to comment on the current strength of foreign reserves.
?We are not desperate. If we are desperate, we can take more drastic measures,? he said.

Central Bank effects more transfers
	
	On top of the transfers of some senior officers that caught media headlines early this week, the Central Bank (CB) yesterday effected further transfers, Mirror Business learns.
	Central Bank sources said over 100 officials from below senior management levels to minor officials were transferred from their positions. The transfers were effected without any prior notice, as the officers were notified of their new responsibilities only yesterday morning.
	Mirror Business learns that transfers have also taken place at the Centre for Banking Studies at Rajagiriya.With no statement being issued, it was unclear whether these were routine transfers. The Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran was unavailable for comment. At a press briefing held at the Central Bank this Monday, Governor Mahendran maintained that transfers that had been carried out earlier were routine.
	He said that this year?s rotational transfer procedure was delayed due to the elections. He noted that those officials who had completed five years in one department were eligible for transfers.

Video: Digital technology for child protection
	
In an effort to protect children through digital technology, the Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Ministry is seeking a relaxation of the current regulations barring students from taking mobile phones to school.
The ministry said it would pave the way for the introduction of a special mobile phone device to protect them.
Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando told a media briefing that this system would be in place by next week.
He said recent rape and killing of the little girl at Kotadeniyawa, the killing of a 10-year- old boy in Athurugiriya and several other crimes against children had influenced the ministry to introduce this new devise.
Explaining about this system, the minister said a child will be given a personnel mobile phone through which he or she could dial his or her parents' numbers or dial the police emergency.
The phone will not have other facilities such as games or internet with the service providers being in a position to control the network.
?We know there will be shortcomings and loopholes in the system. These will be rectified in time to come. What is important is to get started at some point or the other,? he said and assured that the shortcomings would be addressed as soon as possible.
The devise will be launched by two main mobile phone service providers Mobitel and Dialog which will introduce another innovative system named ?I card? which is a tracking devise where a parent will have a track of their children.
Meanwhile plans are afoot to appoint an inter-ministerial committee to prepare a national cyber policy especially aimed at fighting cyber crime.WATCH ?

Video: Domestic mechanism a big lie: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa today challenged the government to prove that the unanimously adopted UNHRC resolution did not contain a proposal for the setting up of a hybrid court as claimed by the government.
He said it was a big lie to describe the proposed investigative process as a domestic mechanism because the resolution clearly mentioned that foreign experts comprising investigators and judges would be involved in this mechanism.
?Even though the word ?hybrid? has been removed in the adopted resolution, the mechanism proposed remains the same. Participation of foreign experts including investigators and judges has clearly been mentioned in the resolution. It is better to describe it as a foreign judiciary than to say a domestic mechanism,? Mr. Weerawansa said.
He said the foreign experts were expected to arrive in the country to question the heads of the security forces and to punish those who were responsible for giving orders.
Mr. Weerawansa said the government had prevented the media from revealing the truth behind this investigation process and was influencing the media heads to project it as a domestic mechanism.
??We ask Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to mislead the people by hiding the truth. He should apologize to the people for telling lies. If they are not afraid of this, why are they trying to hide it,? he asked.
Mr. Weerawansa said they would not allow the government to conceal this huge betrayal despite its attempts to do so.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH ?

## Title: Domestic mechanism in accordance with Constitution-President

Domestic mechanism in accordance with Constitution-President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said his government's policy is to have a domestic mechanism in accordance with the country's Constitution to look in to human rights allegations.
Making a special statement the President also said an all party conference would soon be convened along with all religious leaders to discuss finding solutions to the resolution on Sri Lanka, that was adopted at the UNHRC session in Geneva a few days ago.
Soon after arriving home after a hectic but successful tour in the US to address the 70th UN General Assembly, President Sirisena told the media at President?s House last afternoon that the government faced the UNHRC boldly and was able to remove the proposal to conduct an international probe by a hybrid court that would ultimately take the perpetrators if found guilty to the electric chair.
?We did not achieve this under any pressure, stress or arm twisting. We told the global community in no uncertain terms that an international probe was unacceptable to us. We also told them that we were ready for a domestic probe within the constitutional framework of Sri Lanka. There will be no orders, no decrees in this exercise from any one. Therefore, Sri Lanka now can face the challenges and charges against her in a positive and optimistic frame of mind,? President Sirisena stressed.
However, President Sirisena maintained that the objective of the global community was to stabilize Human Rights, Fundamental Rights, Rule of Law and Democracy in Sri Lanka.
In this endeavour of domestic probe under International standards, the government was ready and keen to obtain the help, consultation and goodwill of all concerned and would closely study the UNHRC report, the Nissanka Udalagama Report, Sir Desmond De Silva Report, the LLRC report and the Armed Force Reports that carry information pertaining to alleged war crimes. The UN Human Rights Council had compiled reports on war crimes in other countries and it had taken more than 20 to 30 years to complete such probes and for remedial and punitive actions. But Sri Lanka would not take such a long time to bring this entire process to a positive and satisfactory conclusion, he emphasized.
He said the indigenous mechanism that would be set up on the International standard and guidelines would definitely give the opportunity to all accused if any including ex-LTTE cadres to prove their innocence before such court or panel.
President Sirisena said a special legal panel would be appointed to go through the alleged violation of the International Human Rights Law, Fundamental Rights and War Crimes and also to make recommendations on how those issues could be addressed in accordance with the law of the land.
?As the President of the country, I look at all these developments in an unbiased and impartial manner. There is no doubt that there will be many a problem when we put these measures into practise. If and when we find obstacles to take the programme forward we will consult the UN General Secretary for consultation and further action. Whatever action we take, they must not be a hindrance or affect the people of the country negatively. The government is fully resolved to protect peace, reconciliation and ethnic harmony as it is the government policy,? he added.
He said the National Unity Government headed by him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was fully committed to promote peace, reconciliation, inter-communal harmony as it was the declared policy of the government and added not only the people in the North-East but those in the South who were affected and harmed during the ethnic conflict would be compensated, resettled and returned the lands to their rightful owners.
President Sirisena pointed out that the government?s resolve and objective was to take all possible action to prevent a repetition of past mistakes.
All these were possible as a result of the January 8 regime change that brought him to power and the formation of the National Unity Government on August 17. The government has scored a major victory following his address at the 70th UN General Assembly and new approach taken in Geneva at the 30th UNHRC sessions.
All great leaders in the past who have waged wars have become great rulers with compassion, love and humility after realizing the merits and demerits of war. That was how Chandashoka in India became Dharmashoka and spread Buddhism and friendship in Asia and in Sri Lanka in particular.
In our war, Sri Lanka obtained help against separatist terrorism from many friendly nations like US, Britain, India, China and Pakistan. Interestingly, it was some of these cou8ntries who brought war crime charges against us after the war. When Sri Lanka failed to respond to these allegations positively and in a pragmatic manner, the Tamil Diaspora took the issue into their own hands and agitated for action against Sri Lanka. We must not forget that though the separatist terrorism was physically defeated in May, 2009, the ideology and the concept of the Tamil Eelam had not been defeated. That was why the Global agitation against Sri Lanka was able to withdraw the GSP+ facility from Sri Lanka and fish exports to the EU.
?When I, try hard to save the country from this predicament, my opponents brand me a ?Stooge of the America. But I will prove them that they are wrong and it was I and my government that saved them from the electric chair and the country from the international blacklist of war crimes,? he said.
President Sirisena said the Mahinda Rajapaksa government antagonized Sri Lanka?s friends by humiliating them. Once, foreign dignitaries were summoned down South and boasted that they were sent back by making them to eat Maniocs. Then again there were pseudo fasting before the UN office in Colombo that distanced Sri Lanka from the UN member countries and made them think about Sri Lanka in a negative manner.
However, this government has been able to retrieve Sri Lanka from this predicament and restore its good name and turn our those who acted against us our friends. they are keen to help Sri Lanka's progress and see Sri Lanka become a country that uphold reconciliation, Reparation, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Fundamental Rights.
President Sirisena paid a special tribute to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and the Cabinet of Ministers for their unstinted support to restore Sri Lanka's good name among the global community and save Sri Lanka from a so called international war crimes probe.Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana

Govt: to start dialogue on lifestyle change
	
The government will soon start a dialogue to change people's lifestyles which might include changing school hours, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Thursday.
Speaking during the annual academic sessions of Endocrine Society of Sri Lanka, he said a national dialogue on changing the lifestyle of the people was essential to prevent diseases such as diabetes which he pointed out was spreading rapidly in Sri Lanka.
"The spread of the disease among the schoolchildren is becoming a great worry," the Prime Minister said.
He said some have suggested that changing of school hours was necessary to change the lifestyle of schoolchildren to prevent diseases such as diabetes.
The Prime Minister asked whether changing school hours was enough to change the situation. He said one needs to keep a watch on the growing urbanization which changes lifestyles.
?Urbanization has made people go to fast food outlets instead of eating a wholesome meal cooked at home like the way we did during out school days and this situation too should be noted," he said and added that a public dialogue was necessary to address all these issues before coming up with solutions.

The loan-to-value ratio on vehicle imports has been increased to 90 per cent from Monday, October 5 from the earlier 70 per cent, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
?Too many vehicles are on the roads and we?re being criticised, but it?s an individual freedom,? the minister said.
The artificially created low-interest regime had allowed financial companies to provide 100 per cent lease financing on motor vehicle imports until the Central Bank intervened in September.
The minister said customers must deposit 90% of the value of the vehicle in a non-interest bearing and non-refundable account when opening a letter of credit so as to prevent excessive ad-hoc buying which usually takes place before a budget.? (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) said today the information it had obtained on the young woman attacked by two youth, as seen in a video gone viral in social media websites, would be sent to the Police Child and Women's Bureau for further investigation.
On Wednesday which was also the World Children?s Day, a video showing two young men assaulting the young woman while another person was recording the incident went viral on Facebook.
The NCPA official who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Mirror that according to the information they had collected, the girl was over the age of 18 and therefore the NCPA was not authorised to take legal action regarding the incident.
Police requested public assistance to identify the girl who was attacked so that they could investigate the incident.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekarra told Daily Mirror that at the moment police does not have any information about the incident or the identity of the girl and therefore they are unable not initiate an investigation.

Probe mechanism must be domestic: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would keep an open mind on a war crime tribunal and make sure it was in keeping with Sri Lanka?s Constitution.
In an interview with the newspaper in New York, the President had said the mechanism to probe war crime charges must be domestic. ?Excerpts of the article
Mr. Sirisena, over tea at his hotel in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon, said the court would be established after what he called careful consultations with religious leaders, politicians and military officials.
Setting up a war crimes tribunal, involving foreigners no less, is a highly delicate matter. It follows a report by the United Nations, which concluded that both sides had likely committed war crimes and that an independent judicial process involving foreign judges was needed, with the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra?ad al-Hussein, saying bluntly that Sri Lanka is ?not currently equipped to conduct an independent and credible investigation.?
The report described extrajudicial killings and disappearances, and gave accounts of torture and sexual violence. (Sri Lanka is not a party to the International Criminal Court.)
?I took over a country isolated by the international community,? Mr. Sirisena said, after a marathon set of speeches and meetings. ?The main challenge I faced was to win over the international community. I believe these efforts have borne fruit.?
Asked for evidence, his ambassador to the United States, Prasad Kariyawasam, jumped in to say that the president had been offered a seat at the head table at lunch with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, along with Mr. Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Sirisena said his offer of assistance in peacekeeping efforts had been welcomed.
Mr. Sirisena promised to help with more soldiers, including Special Forces units and experts on clearing unexploded ordnance. It put the onus on the United Nations system to carefully vet those soldiers, and roles they might have played in Sri Lanka?s own war.
Mr. Sirisena?s challenges are significant, both politically and legally. He was elected in January, defeating the incumbent, Mahinda Rajapakse, with a promise to heal the wounds from the civil war.
In the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sirisena was unwilling to commit himself to any particular judicial mechanism, saying he would keep an open mind and make sure it was in keeping with Sri Lanka?s Constitution.
Sri Lanka does not allow foreign lawyers to practice in its courts, an aide to the president said later, and it was not possible for the country to set up a new international court without amending the Constitution, which would be extremely difficult politically.
?The mechanism must be domestic,? Mr. Sirisena said. In a measure of the lingering distrust, Kasippilai Manoharan, the father of one of five students killed by security forces on a beach near the port of Trincomalee in 2006, said he was skeptical of any judicial process that was not truly international. ?I trust the international community and the Human Rights Council, but I?ll never trust Sri Lankan courts,? he said in an interview.

Tragic phenomenon of  forcible recruitment  of Tamil civilians by the LTTE
	
By D.B.S. JeyarajThe Human Rights Investigation ?report on Sri Lanka compiled by the Office of the United Nations ?High Commissioner for Human Rights released last month ?has revealed ?much information about the alleged activities of the Sri Lankan armed forces, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and state affiliated para ? military outfits such as the Eelam People?s Democratic Party(EPDP) and Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal(TMVP) during the final phase of South Asia?s longest war. While overseas members of the ?LTTE demonstrate in Geneva with tiger flags and portraits ?of LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran, those who read the UN report are appalled and horrified by the acts of cruelty perpetrated by the LTTE on its own people. Among the many aspects focused upon by the UN investigation ? report on Sri Lanka - abbreviated as OISL report ? is the tragic phenomenon of forcible recruitment of Tamil civilians by the LTTE.
In earlier times the LTTE had not engaged in the exercise of forcible recruitment or conscription. It was in fact organizations such as the Eelam People?s Revolutionary Liberation Front(EPRLF) and Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front(ENDLF) who pioneered forcible recruitment during the days of the Indian army ?deployment in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.The LTTE campaign of ?forced recruitment on a massive scale ?began in June 2006 and ? accelerated from October onwards. One of the factors contributing to this was the split ?caused in the LTTE ?by the revolt of its former eastern regional commander.
The LTTE breakaway faction led by former tiger eastern region commander Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan alias ?Col? Karuna was ?actively engaged in child conscription and forced recruitment in the East after his defection. Security forces were allegedly ?complicit in this campaign undertaken by the Karuna faction known as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP). The Eastern Province thus became ?the focus of attention in the sphere of abductions, conscription and forced recruitment in those days.
Apart from the TMVP involvement and complicity by the security forces the ?mainstream? LTTE was also engaged in abductions and conscriptions. The Eastern province saw much activity in this regard after the split in the LTTE in 2004. Thousands of cadres who dropped out or escaped from the LTTE after the split were targetted again by both parties. Also both the LTTE and TMVP began abducting and forcibly recruiting new persons into their respective organizations. Some instances ?were reported in the media .
While the focus was ?on the volatile east, ?the actions of the LTTE in the north did not ?receive the same glare of publicity. Lack of access to the LTTE dominated regions in the Northern mainland was the chief contributory factor to this state of affairs then. The unwillingness of many Tamil people to publicly articulate their grievances against the LTTE was another reason for the situation. The Tamil community grapevine was humming with tales of tiger abductions but few Tamils ?were willing to come forward and say so openly.Fear of repercussionsThe main reason was fear of repercussions at the hands of the LTTE and its minions. Another reason was the feeling that the Tamil cause would be weakened if accusations were levelled against the LTTE. Family members of those conscripted were also afraid to speak out because the lives of those abducted may have been ?in jeopardy. Families were ?explicitly warned of such consequences if details of abductions leaked out.
Besides ?many ?families ?concerned were ?also residing in LTTE controlled areas and ?themselves were in danger.The prevailing totalitarian control of society by the LTTE prevented ?people speaking out except for communicating their distress to trusted persons. All these reasons helped the LTTE to get away with continual abductions and forcible recruitments in those years.
The scale and intensity of forcible recruitments increased in 2006 as the fighting escalated. It was always the LTTE position that the movement faced a shortage of personnel because enough people were not volunteering. If enough numbers were forthcoming the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam would be a reality they used to ?say then.There was ?also much talk of a massive counter ? strike against the armed forces by the LTTE. Additional cadres were necessary for this it was argued by the LTTE then.
While the military priorities and objectives were given pride of place the human dimension was once again lost sight of by the LTTE . The sad irony was that ?the war was ?being supposedly fought for the liberation and upliftment of the Tamil people! What was happening however was that of ?the position of the Tamil civilians ?worsening day by day.?
The LTTE may have wanted ?more and more people to join up and fight but the ordinary Tamils were in no mood to oblige. They simply wanted ?to be left alone to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives and get on with living. This ?war was not their war any more. The tigers may have celebrated ?death but the ordinary Tamil ?people wanted ?life no matter how miserable it may have been ?under prevailing ?conditions.They did not want their children to die as cannon fodder in what was clearly an unwinnable war.. Which parent would ?want that?Civilian arms training
The LTTE had earlier started the process of civilian arms training. All able bodied persons from 16 to 45 were required to undergo some physical training and learn techniques of self ? defence. Those willing to go the extra ? mile were given more intensive training and forged into an auxiliary outfit known as ?Ellai Padai? or border force. They functioned ?mainly as helpers to the LTTE cadres in border areas.Another category of persons was selected out of the original batches of trainees and given further training. They were supposedly reservists and called ?Makkal Padai? or peoples force.These people were allowed to get on with normal civilian life but were required to show up whenever necessary or required. Most members of these civilian militias were not willing to fight or die. But they had no choice and were reluctantly compelled to go along with tiger diktat.
These ?enlistment practices were overshadowed by a new direct campaign of forced recruitment that began in 2006. The intensification and acceleration of the LTTE campaign to forcibly recruit ?Tamil civilians directly ?into their ranks ?caused much resentment amid the Tamil people then. However they had no way to resist or protest. Some ?went ?into hiding. Others ?found ways to leave or escape from those areas. Those detected while trying to escape ?were punished. The LTTE ?also infiltrated the Govt controlled areas of Mannar , Vavuniya and even Jaffna districts and abducted people. However the full force of tiger conscriptions ?was ?faced by the people of Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu districts.

The LTTE which was running ?a parallel administration then ? set up its monitoring apparatus in the areas it controlled. There were two or more LTTE operatives functioning as ?grama sevakhas? in each village. They were in possession of all family details in every household in their areas of authority. LTTE operatives armed with such particulars visited ?each home and ?press ganged? the reluctant young men and women into joining them. If unsuccessful at day ? time the tigers returned at night. Nocturnal raids were a regular feature.
All students in the Advanced level classes were ?compelled to undergo training in self ? defence and first ? aid. The training period was between two to four weeks.The bright ones were identified and brainwashed or forcibly recruited as permanent cadres. Initially ?the ?families of ?fallen tigers or ?great heroes? and serving LTTE members were exempted. Later they too were targeted.Many of the parents stopped sending children to schools. Young people seldom moved around publicly. If they were seen the chances of being ?taken? away were very high. Some parents avoided going out to work and stayed home under the impression that they could prevent their children being taken.Pathetic predicament
An incident in Kilinochchi ? illustrates the pathetic predicament of ordinary people then. A family of five in Aanandapuram in Kilinochchi was killed in bombing by the Air Force. Two of those killed were boys aged 18 and 20 respectively. The boys were kept at home to avoid being conscripted by the LTTE at school. Tragically ?Yaman? came for them at home ?via an Israeli K- fir. Students of that particular school were afraid to attend classes because the principal of that institution was allegedly helping the LTTE to ?identify and abduct students. The ?principal? who was a close relative of a top tiger commander is today holding high political office as an elected representative of the people.
One way of avoiding conscription was to resort to matrimony ?since married persons were not forcibly recruited when the conscription campaign commenced. So many people in tiger controlled areas began marrying early. With the ?recruitment drive being launched in June 2006 ?the rate of marriages shot up among young people. The LTTE then ?declared that all marriages after August 2006 were null and void. Regardless of marital status the new grooms and brides were ?conscripted. The LTTE ?also went to the extent of declaring a moratorium on marriages till a particular age was reached. Males could not marry till they were 40 and females till 35 was the new commandment. This was only a temporary measure assured the LTTE then.
An ? incident of suicide that occurred then was pathetic. ?On January 22nd ?2007 a schoolmaster from Uruthirapuram married an employee at the Mallavi hospital. Both were in their mid ? twenties. Two days later on the 24th, LTTE operatives came to the newly married couple and insisted that the groom give up ?marital bliss? and join up with them. The ?wedding? was not valid they pointed out because the ?legal? marriage ages were 40 and 35. The distressed couple pleaded with the tigers and obtained a few days ?grace? to complete wedding rituals .The tigers agreed and went away.?
The groom and bride ?escaped? and hid themselves elsewhere. The tigers returned and were infuriated at this defiance. They abducted the groom?s sister and the bride?s brother and took them away. The groom was asked to present himself within a week. Otherwise the siblings would not return, warned ? LTTE.The groom was extremely agitated and worried. After pondering the situation for days in a frustrated and confused mental state the man committed suicide by hanging on February 5th 2007. He died exactly two weeks after his marriage.
This woeful tale was ?talked about widely in the LTTE areas and elsewhere .Many people were highly critical of the LTTE for this act which encapsuled the predicament faced by ordinary Tamils under the jackboots of the LTTE. In a bid to counter this resentment the LTTE ?put a counter spin by spreading the rumour that the man was diagnosed with terminal cancer and therefore had taken his own life .Detained and punished
The LTTE ?also banned the movement of people to Govt controlled areas. People were allowed out only for specific reasons on a very strict basis. In most instances someone living in the Wanni had to stand surety. If the person who exited ?did ?not return ?on time the person who stood surety would ?be detained and punished. The LTTE was very strict in disallowing juniors between 12 and 17 from leaving the Wanni in those days.
The people particularly the mothers ?resisted ?as much as ?they could. But most efforts were futile. Some of the stories related ?about those dark days are pathetic. One mother fell on the ground in front of a tiger vehicle in a desperate attempt to block it from driving away with her son. The LTTE driver callously drove over the woman?s leg crushing the bone. In another incident the frantic mother tried to cling on to her son but was pushed away roughly. She fell down and hit her forehead on a stone. Seeing the wife bleed the elderly husband/ father got angry and slapped the tiger cadre. The tigers were enraged.?Engalukku Kai Neetta thuninjitiyo?? (Are you brave enough to raise your hand against us?) they shouted. Thereafter the old man was given a merciless thrashing and was hospitalised.
In one case the 21-year-old brother was given permission to go to Colombo ?to welcome an uncle who was visiting from abroad. His family guaranteed his return in three months. While he was in Colombo the LTTE recruitment drive escalated. Family members urged the son not to return but stay in Colombo and try to go abroad. When the LTTE went to the house the family said that the young man was sick and needed medical treatment in Colombo.?
The tigers took away the 16-year-old sister and said she would be released if proof of the brothers medical condition was furnished. The brother got himself admitted to a private hospital and after some ?doctoring? with some sympathetic help by those concerned sent the necessary ?paperwork? to convince the LTTE of his medical condition. The LTTE rejected the documents and wanted ?the family to give them medical records from a Govt hospital!. The sister was ?under tiger custody for many months and finally co- opted into LTTE ranks.She was killed in the fighting.
The LTTE slogan for recruitment was ?Veetukku Oru Veeran Allathu Veeranganai? ?( One hero or heroine from each house). The tigers began ?strictly enforcing this . All households were ?forced to send one member. If those eligible escaped or avoided ?being recruited another was taken away as ?hostage?. Those protesting or objecting were assaulted severely. Some were detained for indefinite periods.Face consequences
Some of the persons taken by the tigers ?managed to escape and went into hiding. The LTTE sent letters to the families saying the ?escapees? must surrender themselves before a particular date. Otherwise family members would ?have to face consequences the tigers warned.In another incident on Feb 9th ?2007 ?in Vattakachchi an elder sister was taken in place of a younger sister who went into hiding. The protesting parents were kicked and pushed aside.
An LTTE member had absconded from the tigers after being sent to Vavuniya to do political work after the ceasefire. He came to Colombo and then went abroad. This was in 2003. After making inquiries from the family the LTTE did not do anything. But ?in 2006 ?the LTTE came to the house and wanted the ?escapee? to return to the LTTE again. When told that he was now abroad the tigers took away his younger sister aged 15. The family was told that the girl would be sent home if the brother returned to the Country and the movement.
Some people ?sent their children or even moved out of the LTTE controlled areas through circuitous jungle routes. There was much hardship and danger but people risked ?it rather than see children being conscripted. The LTTE?s elite ?leopard? commano unit also prowled ?these jungle routes keeping up vigil. While some people ?managed to escape many ?were caught and punished.One family had twin sons in their twenties. The LTTE wanted one to join up. The family tried to escape through a jungle route and was caught. As punishment both sons were taken away.
One particularly sad incident was about a young girl in Puthukudiyiruppu. She was the only daughter in the family and very clever in studies. Her elder brothers had either died as LTTE ?Maaveerar? or gone abroad. The family was however worried because the girl did not attain ?age? for many years. Finally she became a ?periya pillai ? (loku lamaya) at the age of 18. The parents were so happy that they had a comparatively grand celebration on the ?day of pouring water?. (thanni vaarkum naal). Two days later the tigers came and took her away leaving the parents devastated.Fences devoured crops
Some families from Allaipiddy and Mankumban ?had relocated to the Wanni after the spate of killings by the Navy and EPDP in ?May 2006. They felt the LTTE controlled Wanni was safer than their own villages. In 2007 ?some youngsters from these displaced families went missing. Family members rushed to the LTTE ?Kaavalthurai? (Police) run by Nadesan. The Eelam ?cops? promised to inquire into the matter. It was only some days later that enlightenment dawned on the families that the ?fences had devoured the crops.?Among those taken away by the LTTE were some girl students staying with Catholic sisters at a nunnery and attending a convent. The tigers took those over 17 years of age forcibly. Church leaders ?appealed to the LTTE hierarchy but did ?not publicise the incident for obvious reasons.The LTTE also ?abducted ?young persons in the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna. Age or marital status was not a bar when it came to abducting those in Govt controlled areas. They were taken to LTTE controlled areas clandestinely and forcibly inducted as tiger cadres. It was alleged then ?that most incidents of youths abducted in Jaffna during daytime and then going missing were perpetrated by the LTTE. As the conflict intensified the use of mobile phones by members of the public ?was banned by the LTTE in the Wanni. Anyone found using one was penalised.All foreign calls could ?be taken only from LTTE run communication centres. The numbers had to be registered in the mornings. The calls limited to 5 minutes per call were allowed in the evenings. The time in between is used by the LTTE to verify details about those ?being called.
There ?were ?however many ?who managed to come out of the Wanni in that period. This was mainly due to nepotism and/or corruption. High ranking tiger leaders who had sent their own children abroad for higher studies were known to have intervened in some instances and ensured the ?sending away? of close relatives. In other cases massive donations were ?paid ?officially? to the LTTE and ?unofficially? to tiger officials for people to get away. The sad irony was that ?some of these escapees were treated as LTTE suspects ?when they came to the Govt controlled areas.Grim gloomy scenario
This then was the grim, gloomy scenario ?that unfolded ?in the LTTE dominated north during the days of war. The so-called liberators of the Tamil people were intensely ?recruiting people forcibly to be conscripted into tiger ranks. The rationale being, ?manpower requirement ?was necessary to ?continue the ?Por? (war). All oppression was ?justified as being necessitated by the Tamil cause.
Ordinary Tamil civilians however ?wanted ?no part of this war being fought in their name. They only wanted ?to be left alone so that they could ?get along with their life. Sadly that was being denied to them. ?That ?was the Tamil tragedy!
After some more years of terrible suffering the war was finally over in May 2009!D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Video: Two new national parks to be declared this month
	
The banks of Kala Wewa and Balalu Wewa are to be declared as national wild life parks by the Ministry of Wildlife on October 17.
The area has a high density of flora and fauna and a number of tourists visit the area on a daily basis.
It is reported the banks are home to some of the largest elephant herds in Sri Lanka. At least about 50 tuskers are among those herds.
It is also said that Minister Sajith Premadasa who is a frequent visitor of the area had named each and every tusker in the herd. (Tex and Video by Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)
