?
REUTERS, 03rd JULY, 2017-Chinese President Xi Jinping set off on a visit to Russia on Monday stressing the grave threat a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea poses to both Chinese and Russian interests.
China has repeatedly stated its opposition to the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system and has called for its deployment to stopped, and the missiles already installed to be removed.
China says the system?s powerful radar can probe deep into its territory, undermining its security and a regional balance while doing nothing to stop North Korea in its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
?The U.S. deployment of an advanced anti-missile system in South Korea gravely harms the strategic security interests of China, Russia and other countries in the region,? China?s state Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying.
The United States and South Korea say the THAAD is solely aimed at defending the South from North Korea.
China and Russia have maintained close communication and coordination on the issue and held very similar views on it, Xi said in an interview with Russian media.
?Beijing and Moscow are steadfastly opposed to the THAAD deployment and seriously suggest that relevant countries stop and cancel the installation,? Xinhua cited xi as saying.
China and Russia would take ?necessary measures?, either together or independently, to protect their interests, Xi said, without elaborating, according to Xinhua.

Garbage crisis bursts into heated arguments in Parliament
	
Heated arguments broke out at the start of the parliamentary sessions today when the joint opposition raised a question on the garbage crisis.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene who raised this matter said garbage was piling up on roadsides as a result of garbage disposal coming to a standstill.
"Collecting and disposing of industrial waste and garbage is far from satisfactory because garbage was piling up on roadsides giving off a unbearable stench," he said while highlighting that there had been human body parts among the piles of garbage in some areas in the Gampaha District.
He urged the government to heed the requests made by Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith to search for body parts among the piles of garbage.
The MP asked what short and long term measures had been taken by the government to resolve the garbage crisis.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiser Mustapha in his response vehemently denied there being human body parts among the garbage.
He said all local bodies had been asked to develop environmentally-friendly disposable sites in every district. The minister said recycling plants will be set up based on private-public partnerships and that three compost plants would be set up at Muthurajawela.
There were heated arguments when some joint opposition MPs tried to raise some issues pertaining to garbage disposal in the Gampaha District and were prevented from doing so by the minsister, who said other MPs could not raise sub questions when a question is raised under standing order 23(2).

NDB Securities forecasts slow but steady growth for banking sector
	
?
Pioneer stock-broking and equity research firm NDB Securities Ltd (NDBS) published an update on the outlook of the banking sector along with an analysis on nine listed licensed commercial banks.
This report comes as an update to a comprehensive banking sector report done earlier by NDBS. The update delivers better data, analysis and strategic direction on the overall banking sector environment coupled with CBSL stringent requirements laid out by Basel III. The sector update used publicly available data and expert opinion of industry stakeholders to provide information on one of the key sectors listed on the CSE.?
NDBS CEO Prasansini Mendis said, ?The industry is slowly regaining momentum after a challenging year. We withstood 2016 and many more challenging years in the past through best industry practices, expert knowledge on the industry, time efficient service models, in depth risk management and compliance framework. We are now further equipped to serve our clients betterwith the relocation ofour company to a plush new premise at 135, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 4 from this month.? She added, ?We as a company strongly believe that in depth research will continue to add value to the investor.Going forwardwe expect to deliver similar updates in addition to our in-depth macro, sector and counter publications that will complement services delivered by our experienced advisory arm and state of the art IT and back office system.?
NDBS Head of Research Sidath Kalyanaratne said, ?This update is released at a time where CBSL has imposed further stringent capital requirements that?s compliant with BASEL III guidelines.Under the new Basel III guidelines, in addition to the stringent regulations imposed on all LCBs and LSBs, the domestic systematically important banks (with assets over Rs. 500 billion) have been imposed tighter capital requirements to further strengthen the banking system. Most of the banks are in the process of raising equity to strengthen capital ratios and buffers. Despite the strengthening of the regulatory framework, above measures are expected to change the competitive landscape of the banking sector significantly.?
?We won the best stockbroking research team award last year at the capital markets awards 2016 organised by CFA Sri Lanka. Since, we have worked even harder to improve our depth, breadth and quality of research and made increased efforts in sharing our knowledge with the current and potential investment community in our country. We believe this sector update will reflect the industry trends in terms of growth, profitability, risk, stability etc. over the short to medium term,? he added
Manager? Research, Dhinali Peiris said,?The loan growth of the banking sector recorded 17.7 percent in 2016. The banks with higher loan share to SME and retail witnessed higher NIM expansion with AWPLR gaining 441 basis points (bps) during 2016. However, going forward we expect a slowdown in demand for new loans due to the impact of monetary and fiscal measures taken by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) in 2016. The banking sector deposits grew by 16.5 percent in FY16 whilst the average weighted deposit rate (AWDR) increased by 197 bps compared to 2015 where the AWDR was mostly stagnant. This increase caused the CASA of the banking sector to decrease from 40.3 percent in 2015 to 37.1 percent in 2016.Further, with the increased consumption taxes, we expect demand for deposits to slow down.?
Dhinali added that ?In terms of profitability, we do not expect NIMs to further improve from FY16 levels due to reduction of upward pressure on interest rates coupled with declining CASA and increased competition for deposits. Therefore, with restrained forecasted net interest income growth, we estimate the growth in profitability to be rather moderate over the short term.?
Sheconcluded saying, ?High competition, additional capital and leverage requirements amongst smaller banks will threaten their return on equity in the short run. Hence, we continue to support the banking consolidation which will further strengthen the system and improve banks? access to financing via international capital markets.?
NDB Securities is a fully owned subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings, the capital market arm of the NDB group.?

New SOs on criteria for removing a CJ or other judges
	
Parliament will approve a fresh set of Standing Orders which, among others, will change the present criteria stipulated for the impeachment of the Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme Court or the President of Judges of the Court of Appeal.
Currently, a Parliamentary Select Committee is appointed to inquire into allegations in the event of an impeachment motion being handed over to the Speaker after an inquiry by MPs. However, the SOs are to be amended to include a panel of inquiry comprising officials instead of MPs. However, parliamentary sources said the amendment of SOs alone would not suffice in this case but that a supplementary law should be introduced to give it legal effect.
Parliament is expected to finalize its new SOs today at a meeting of all the MPs.
According to the new SOs, 84(1) where notice of a resolution for the presentation of an address to the President for the removal of the Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and Judges of the Court of Appeal from office on grounds of misbehavior or incapacity is given to the Speaker in terms of Article 107 of the Constitution and shall be place in the order paper of the House.
According to 2(a) the Speaker in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, shall appoint a panel of inquiry consisting of three retired Judges of the Supreme Court to investigate the alleged misbehavior or incapacity of the Judge concerned.
The Speaker shall appoint one of the members of the Panel of Inquiry as the Chair of such panel of inquiry. According to the SOs, the panel of inquiry shall require the judge concerned to submit a written statement of defense within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of the said resolution.
A panel of inquiry shall permit the MPs who have signed such a resolution or their legal representatives to adduce evidence oral or documentary to prove the alleged allegations.
If a Judge is the subject of the investigation by a panel of inquiry, he or she shall have the right to appear before it and to be heard by such panel of inquiry in person or by representatives and to adduce oral or documentary evidence.
The panel of inquiry so appointed shall conclude the inquiry within a period of two months. However, The Speaker at the request of the panel of inquiry may extend such time for further periods not exceeding one month at a time.
After conclusion of the proceedings of inquiry, the panel of inquiry so appointed shall report its findings together with the minutes of evidence taken before the Panel to the Speaker and The Speaker shall present findings of the Panel of inquiry to the House only if the panel of inquiry has found the Judge concerned is guilty. If the panel of inquiry has found a judge not guilty, he must inform the House and terminate proceedings. If the panel of inquiry has reported that a judge is guilty, the Speaker shall present it for approval by Parliament. If such resolution is passed by a majority of MPs, the Speaker shall forward the same to the President for the removal of the Judge concerned on the ground of proved misbehavior or incapacity.
The panel of inquiry may continue its functions notwithstanding a prorogation or dissolution of Parliament.
The procedure in removing a judge is being changed under the powers vested in Parliament under Article 107 of the Constitution under which the House is given the right by law or by standing orders relating to such a matter. (Yohan Perera)

Projects to check growing garbage crisis
	
Garbage is not a problem only in Sri Lanka, but also in the rest of the countries. What is vital in this case is not how muck is collected in countries, but how the collected garbage is properly managed and recycled. It is evident how the garbage issue has affected our people and the country owing to the lack of management mechanism to utilize garbage.?
?
I don?t want to reiterate the tragedy and the trouble caused to the people. It is pointless to claim how much garbage is collected. The governing body and its institutions should address the issue positively and take prompt actions to manage and recycle garbage. ?
It is in fact heartening to say that the Western Provincial Waste Management Authority (WPWMA) has been vocal on this issue and has launched two major projects to recycle garbage and generate electricity. In a discussion with Daily Mirror, the Director of the Western Provincial Waste Management Authority Nalin Mannapperuma said that there has been a drastic change during the past few decades in the physical environment in the country especially in the Western Province. He highlighted that one of the main reasons for this transformation is garbage. ?
?The main factors that relate to garbage generation are the population and the economic status. It has been analyzed that the economic status of the people living in the Asian and the Asia-Pacific regions will enhance in few decades; consequently there will be a boost in the resource consumption. Hence, there is a tendency for the considerable inclination in the garbage generation in a few decades. It has been estimated that in lower /lower middle income countries (which includes many Asian Countries) waste generation rates will more than double over the next 20 years. We as an Asian country have to face this situation. We can?t avoid it. The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in Sri Lanka has been estimated at 7000 Metric ton per day. The contribution from the Western Province to the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is 60% (3500 Metric tons per day). The annual growth rate of garbage generation in Sri Lanka is regarded as around 1.2-2.0%,? the Director said. ?
"The main factors that relate to garbage generation are the population and the economic status"
The fact is coherent that Sri Lanka is experiencing a massive garbage crisis and therefore productive actions need to be taken before the condition worsens. Moreover, it is identified that there are 25 dumpsites in the Western Province which are piled up with various types of dirt without a solution for the recycling process. At the same time, it is pleased to know the mapping of a master plan known as the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management which will be set to embark in 2018. Until it will be put it to practise, there are ongoing waste management practices as follows.?
?
	Reduction of garbage generation ??
	
	
	Source segregation ??
	
	
	Reusing ??
	
	
	Recycling ??
	
	
	Collection ??
	
	
	Transportation ??
	
	
	Small /Medium Scale Composting (140 IN SL, 25 in WP) ??
	
	
	Small/ Medium Scale Bio gas production (no of units 150,000 unit in SL) ??
	
	
	Small/medium scale Recycling centres ??
	
	
	Turnkey basis ??
	
	
	Public Privet Partnership basis
	
When considering the above actions, we can see that the Western Provincial Waste Management Authority (WPWMA) as a supporting agency to the Local Authority has done a sensible job in monitoring effective methodologies to find solutions to the garbage crisis. ??
?We have tried on several occasions to find solutions for the garbage issue. But our attempts were unsuccessful due to public protests and the high capital cost. Then we have to seek private and public aid. Therefore, we have endorsed two agreements with Fairway Waste Management (pvt) Ltd which will merge with Germany and Denmark companies and Trilogy ETC (pvt) Ltd. which will merge with OPUS Clean Energy Alliance.? The Director said. ?
He said that the fist company will commence the project with the garbage capacity of 500mt per day in Karadiyana which would generate 11.5 megawatt (MW) and this will release 89mn kilowatt to the grid per year. As a result of that, it will be adequate to generate electricity for 35000 families. Apart from the generation of electricity, the project is also equipped to generate 41000 tons of liquid fertilizer and 75000 tons of solid fertilizer. The total investment on this project is 73 USD. ? ?Then the second company will commence the project with the garbage capacity of 95mt per day at Gampaha, Dambuwatta which would generate 3.4 megawatt (MW). The technology which is to be used for this project is gasification i.e. burning the garbage. The total investment on this project is 30 USD. ??
In conclusion, the Director of WPWMA expressed his thanks on behalf of the authority to Isura Devapriya, the Chief Minister of the Western Province for the instructions given and the support rendered towards the upcoming project proposals and the issue of garbage. Nevertheless, the Director requests the general public to cooperate with local authorities in segregating and disposing their garbage at appropriate places, so that the muck collectors could collect them conveniently. ??

SL to move embassy in Seychelles to Madagascar
	
In an effort at rationalising our foreign missions, Sri Lanka will relocate its embassy in Seychelles in Madagascar.
The government has decided to focus more on a foreign policy based on commercial diplomacy. The Foreign Affairs Ministry has prepared plans for our new missions to attract more and more foreign investment to the country.
The mission in Seychelles was opened during the tenure of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
According to ministry sources, a new mission will be set up to cover the countries in the West African region, which are former French colonies. It has also been decided to shut down the mission in Poland and open a new mission in Czechoslovakia.
Sri Lanka has 63 missions overseas in different parts of the world and this is likely to increase under the proposed rationalization policy. (Kelum Bandara)

The Gar(b)age Show: Where does it really end?
	
Review of ?The Garage Show About Living on Garbage?, unveiled at No 12, Grenier Road, Off Cotta Road, Colombo 8 on June 16, 17, and 18.
The title misleads. It makes us think that it?s an underground theatre movement, shirked by many and patronised by a few. But it?s not. The organisers derive flesh and blood from their performances. They instil some sense of realism, of verisimilitude, with what they do. They?ve been doing that for the past few shows, ever since they began last year. With four shows now complete, it seems therefore that IdeaCouch, far from receding to the background like much of the English (and even Sinhala) theatre does nowadays, has gained a fresh lease of life every time its founders give us its showcase item, the Garage Show. The fourth show was held last month.
The most interesting aspect of these productions, the way I see it, has been its use of space. To be sure, they have all been staged (though that?s not quite the correct term) in spacious homes. The Garage Show About Living on Garage, unveiled on June 16, 17, and 18 (from Friday to Sunday), took place in the biggest such house thus far, in a comfortable lane off Cotta Road, around Borella (the residence of President?s Counsel Mr Chandana Liyanapatabendy). To use what little they have, and to ensure that their skits are seen and even read from every angle, has been the objective of those behind IdeaCouch. Whether they like it or not, the discerning audience will take that as the yardstick to measure the standard they have created?for themselves.
So how did About Living on Garage fare? First and foremost, it reeked of energy. After a point I didn?t bother counting the skits, so enthralled was I by the clarity and vividness that went into them all. They opened up, I remember clearly, with a meditation on the garbage that surrounds us, sometimes between and even within us, by Lakshitha Edirisinghe. ?I was angered by the garbage problem,? he says rather furiously, and then reverts to his former joviality, ?So I shared a post on Facebook about it.? That provocative fissure between anger and pathos, which has made up our collective attitude of disgust towards the recent spate of rainstorms, garbage dump collapses, and deteriorating cityscapes, was summed up succinctly in those two lines. To my relief, that balance was kept right throughout.
There were skits I took to at once and skits that took time to get to me. They delved into diverse individuals, issues, and milieus. Right after the second skit, about a forgetful old man (Rehan Amaratunga) fretting over his piano and his dead wife, there was a sustained, tortured conversation by a woman (Ruwendi Wakwella) with herself (Shalini Corea), less a soliloquy than an incomplete catharsis over her going out with a shady man (Sachi Gamage), in turn followed by a light-hearted banter between four co-workers over a presentation on insensitivity. The mood, in other words, was never static, never confined: it liberated itself throughout.

"After a point I didn?t bother counting the skits, so enthralled was I by the clarity and vividness that went into them all"
?
We live at a time when everything and anything is condemned to the dustbin and the dump. But one man?s trash is another man?s treasure, as that oft-quoted clich? goes, so what one milieu considers as garbage can be a luxury for another. There was, for instance, a hilarious if not pathos-ridden skit about what a young woman (Shalini) should wear: her mother (Dmitri Gunatilake) bemoans her lack of interest in her own wardrobe, which leads to a laughable encounter with the father (Vishan Gunawardena) upstairs. But then a few skits later, we have two ?garbage men? (Lakshitha and Haseeb Hassen, the former bitter and angry, the latter amicable and content) reflecting on their sorry lives. This contrast, which isn?t so much a contrast as it is a reality, was what I liked best about this Garage Show compared with its previous instalment, About Celebrating This Season (presented last December).
For that reason, the performances were somewhat uneven. I saw Vishan play a confused, shell-shocked husband and later an ill-tempered father. But this wasn?t true of everyone. Eraj Gunawardena played a clumsily dazed everyman in every skit he was in (so dazed, in fact, that when he?s a soldier contemplating on war, he seems less interested in himself than the fact that he is contemplating on something), while Lakshitha, who moved me over his barely concealed, sour rage at the Ananda College production in Drama Comp 2017, was infuriated, resentful, pursed up. The same could be said of arguably my favourite performer, Dmitri Gunatilake, who in skit after skit made us laugh with her dexterity in both Sinhala and English.
Sometime back (writing on Drama Comp) I contended that the Sinhala theatre focuses on open characters that have something to hide, while the English theatre focuses on repressed characters that want to get out. This was, I daresay, partly true of About Living on Garage: even in those skits that were played out in Sinhala, we felt the poignancy, the pathos, and the urgency of the characters in their attempt to escape from and be done with their troubles.?
Lakshitha as a garbage man, for instance, nurses a swollen foot: he has diabetes and needs to see a doctor. Sachi, an ?migr? stationed in Australia, has to pay his bills while working as another garbage man, though his predicament is different: he is also an Engineering student. The milieus that the English theatre subsists on generally are sympathetic towards these characters, though their sympathy is tempered by the luxury of time and ease that?
they possess.
?They are moved to extremities of pity, but at the end of the day they are forced to repress them when the show is over. I was not surprised, therefore, when Asoka Handagama, in a Facebook post, had to say this about the production: ?It reminds me of the Street Theatre by Haththotuwegama and (Parakrama) Niriella in the 70s and the early 80s. They brought theatre to the streets and in contrast to them, this group brings theatre home. Home Theatre??
?
?
"Sometime back (writing on Drama Comp) I contended that the Sinhala theatre focuses on open characters that have something to hide, while the English theatre focuses on repressed characters that want to get out"
.
That unnerves me. Handagama has brought up Haththotuwegama and Niriella. The alternate space that these men created in the Sinhala theatre, away from the Wendt, the Navarangahala, and the Lumbini Hall, catered to a group of people who hailed from a different social background. They were conditioned differently, largely left-of-centre, if not leftist, and were emboldened by Brecht and the culture of social realism that invaded our halls in the second half of the 20th century.
If the English theatre is to occupy an alternate space in that context, and given the social conditioning of its patrons (you and I, men, women, and children who lead fairly comfortable lives), will it remain estranged from our streets and substitute, for the Wendt, an overwhelmingly spacious Colombo house? Does it recede away from its surroundings under a different garb? I believe Handagama has said a lot in what he has not said, and that he has opened up a fresh debate.?
Whether it should trouble us, of course, is for another article altogether. But consider that quality of much of what goes for English plays today (i.e. their focus on repressed, often hysterical characters who want to unleash themselves) and the conservative streak apparent in them, and you can understand why I am happy with and provoked by The Garage Show.
Is this a critique, though? By no means. I concede that the social conditioning of theatregoers isn?t something the playwrights can change. The most they can do, given that, is to force them to think differently, to deliver them productions that delve into ideas and issues.?
The pace at which the skits in About Living on Garbage alternated helped in that respect: it helped us see the multidimensionality of a problem which has forced our country to suffer in silence. By doing away with the need for a stage and proscenium, by compelling us to see the items from nearly every conceivable angle (in an almost Rashomon-like manner, making us question the veracity of what we saw), IdeaCouch has unleashed a veritable revolution in the?
English theatre.
So yes, I liked this Garage Show. I liked the setting, the fact that the players and the director had to work around certain limits they had no say in shaping (with respect to the house), and how they worked around and despite them.?
That alone, I believe, can transform an essentially uprooted theatre form into something that is more relevant, more conscious of its surroundings, and therefore more relatable.

A very high political authority has informed a head of an establishment responsible for keeping law and order that it was high time for him to go home with grace.?
?
The high authority had conveyed this message at an official conference held to discuss a recent assault on varsity students.?
Meanwhile, this establishment head had become the butt of ridicule of his own subordinates when he was found in a deep slumber at a key seminar when the chief guest was addressing the gathering.?
The high official has now incurred the displeasure of all high authorities for the woeful lack of gumption he had demonstrated time and again when faced with the task of handling a difficulty situation.

Trump accused  of encouraging violence against reporters
	
President Donald Trump is being accused of encouraging violence against reporters after he tweeted a bizarre edited video clip of himself ?beating up CNN.? ?
The video appeared to be a modified version of a 2007 appearance by Trump at World Wrestling Entertainment?s WrestleMania 23 promotion, in which Trump ?takes down? WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. In Sunday?s video, McMahon?s head has been replaced with the CNN logo. ?
After Trump appears to beat on the CNN effigy, a logo, ?FNN Fraud News Network? appears at the bottom of the screen in script similar to that of CNN. ??
The 71-year-old president captioned the tweet he sent around 9.45am with ?#FraudNewsCNN #FNN?. ??
The official @POTUS handle also retweeted the video that appears to be a literal embodiment of his assault against the media. Just three days prior, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed ?the President in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.? ??
The Cable News Network?s PR Twitter account responded to the president?s tweet via Twitter by quoting Sanders. ??
They also tweeted: ?It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters. ?
?Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the President had never done so.??
