Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya will remain open: Thera
	
Despite the announcement by the Archaeological authorities that the Rangiri Dambulu Rajamaha Viharaya or the Dambulla Cave Temple has been closed for renovation, the custodian of the Temple Ven. Ambagaswewe Rahula Thera said under no circumstances would anybody be allowed to begin restoration work after closing the Viharaya or to stop the issuing of tickets to foreign tourists.
The Thera who is also the custodian of the Sri Visnu Devalaya and also the Chief Incumbent of Dambulla Rajamaha Meda Pansala and Director of the Walgamba Maha Pirivena expressed these remarks yesterday (11) to the media at the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya.
This statement was made in reply to the decision taken to close the Rajamaha Viharaya and begin restoration work thereof and to stop the issuance of ticket to foreign tourists.
In fact many devotees and foreign tourists were seen as usual yesterday at the Damulla Viharaya despite the announcement by the authorities that the temple had been closed.
Ven. Thera and a group of Buddhist monks of the temples affiliated to the Walagamba Pirivena of the Meda Mahapansala gathered at the premises of the Dambulla Temple and stayed there for several hours.
The Thera urged the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs to intervene to settle this problem and expressed his regret over the statement made by the Education Minister.
He said they had never interfered with the restoration work of the Dambulla Temple. However, nobody would be allowed to pilfer the temple income collected from foreign tourists under the pretence of restoration.
He invited the devotees to the temple and attend to the religious performances.
The Thera said he met the President on Monday and handed over a letter seeking a solution to the problem. However, after few hours Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam made the announcement of closure of the Viharaya for restoration work and to issue the tickets by them, he added.
"They are trying to impose restriction on a place of Buddhist heritage, not on a world heritage, and this is a plan to destroy the temple".
Ven. Ethabendiwewe Upali Thera said people are coming to Dambulla Temple to worship the sacred place but not only to view the paintings. People in the area are prepared to face threat of closing of the temple, he said.
Ven. Ambulugala Vachiswara Thera, the chief attendant of the Dambulla temple - Visnu Devalaya and Dambulla SLFP chief organiser U.R. Dayanandasiri were also present at the occasion. (Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)

?Dear Children Sincerely?  Reflections on hatred and apathy
	
The play is directed by Ruwanthi de Chickera and unveiled on July 5 and 6 at the Lionel Wendt.?
?
Should 1956 have happened, or should it have not? This question, which everyone claims they have the answer to, is frequently touted by our liberal intelligentsia. What is forgotten is another, as valid question: was it inevitable, or was it not? The critic isn?t obliged to answer either, because that?s the artiste?s job. He or she is, however, obliged to assess how well they are answered and whether the standard the artiste has created for himself/herself is achieved when projecting those answers to the audience. I believe the playwright is best equipped to undertake this task, at least after the novelist. The problem however is that while many contemporary novels have touched on this theme, only a few contemporary plays have. ?
?
?Dear Children Sincerely?, staged at the Lionel Wendt last Wednesday and Thursday, tried to convey to its audience the trauma this country has experienced during seven decades, from the thirties to 1956 and all the way to the new millennium. Contemporary theatre is about raking up private, as opposed to public, hells (as Susan Sontag put it), so it conveys that trauma through the personal reminiscences of actual people, from those decades, in voice-overs which exude their presence. ?
?
"Barring a few exceptions, those who patronise the English theatre at Lionel Wendt are indifferent to the social relevance of that theatre"
?
Most critics will lavish praise on Ruwanthi de Chickera?s imaginative use of space and lighting, the way her actors (I saw, to my astonishment, how agile and flexible they could be) displayed their acrobatics while still conveying the smallest nuance of emotion, and of course how ably she eats into the optimism of the first few decades (until the sixties) before moving into the more cynical seventies. They will praise her for the themes she has chosen (the forties for independence, the fifties for Sinhala Only, the sixties for the attempted 1962 coup, the seventies for the insurrection, the eighties for Black July, the nineties for the civil war, and the first decade of the new millennium for 2009 and Menik Farm), and we will agree. ?
But I don?t subscribe to the notion that one should qualify a production?s content by form alone. How one says something matters, but so does what one says, and for me, Ruwanthi?s production, commendable though its grasp of the medium is, provokes me more over how she has used her players to articulate its politics. There is an emphatic appeal to our conscience, to be sure, but was my conscience moved? ?
Ruwanthi is assured in how she gets her actors to articulate the sentiments of those elders throughout the decades. It can be through a word, a sentence, but she does it, and as far as the projection of ideas is concerned, she has achieved what she?s trying to get at. You may agree or disagree with the politics her skits espouse, but her method of articulation is almost effortless. The rift between the skits of the first three decades and the subsequent decades is essential to our understanding of how we, as a people and country, have moved on. ?
?
?I don?t understand why children today take things so seriously,? the old lady in the sixties skit tells us. The reason for that, which we discover as the play moves on, is that we have subsumed the personal for the impersonal. The 1971 insurrection was a whole new world to the attempted coup of 1962; the latter could have belonged to an Alistair MacLean thriller, while the former was harder, tougher. The eighties were much darker; it showed us how one collective waging war on another could be both absurd and terrifying. It took two decades for us to de-sensitise ourselves in the face of such tragedy, which is why the nineties, with all its carnage, is presented as a cricket match, with the scores representing the number of the murdered. ?I think I?d be doing both Ruwanthi and her group a disservice if I don?t point out a contradiction at the heart of her production, though. In the first skit, we laugh at our own independence, echoing the popular notion (which I personally concede) that we never won independence, only got it because (as one actor puts it) we were so good and well behaved. We hear a portion of Nanda Malini?s deliciously notorious ?Master Baila? as another actor tunes a radio (this crisscrossing of several decades, even for one instant, is jarring), and we realise the pathos behind our bitter laughter. ?
?
"In productions like this, it?s not up to the playwright to shove opinions down our throat. Rather, they should let us see what might have been"
?
Now pathos on this scale has its reasons. Those reasons are behind every tragedy we face, throughout history, as they follow us. In the case of Ruwanthi?s tragedy, which is really our tragedy, the reason (which I again concede) is that the corridors of power were never opened to the people. Our independence struggle was a movement sustained from above. It never trickled down to us. The ethnic fissures that were to surface two decades later were forcibly repressed. Logically, therefore, if one condemns or depicts our inability to clinch our own independence, one has to condemn and depict the milieu to which our founding fathers belonged to. ?
?
?
Whether or not 1956 should have happened is an entirely different debate altogether. But one can?t have the cake and eat it too. One can?t depict the insensitivity of our leaders and then condemn the inevitable. That old lady was a caricature of the class to which those leaders and their cohorts belonged to, yes, but in what she said and didn?t say about those emancipated by 1956, at least temporarily, I inferred a direct contrast to the mood of the preceding decades. For how can one condemn what transpired after 1956, if one caricatures those who were repressed so much that it was made possible? How can one condemn the consequence, if one condones the cause? ?
It was the insensitivity and the apathy of the landed aristocracy that led us to 1956 and 1983. They were insensitive because they came from an insensitive background; conditioned by a privileged childhood and education, they saw no differences, only an uprooted world in which dinner parties, unfinished puddings, and nostalgia for the past flourished. Sinhala Only wouldn?t have been Sinhala Only, and July 1983 wouldn?t have been July 1983, if the leaders elected for their times were sensitive. In both instances, our leaders were so cut off from their own people that they were like dinosaurs, bewildered by what was unfolding before them, so much that they could only cave into extremism. The Sinhala Only skit has the person who was interviewed bringing up an extraordinary observation; that the British brought the Sinhalese and the Tamil together. Historical texts, however, tell us a different story. ?
?
	Whether or not 1956 should have happened is an entirely different debate altogether
	
	
	How can one condemn the consequence, if one condones the cause?
	
?
In productions like this, it?s not up to the playwright to shove opinions down our throat. Rather, they should let us see what might have been. Notwithstanding that contradiction I have outlined above, Ruwanthi triumphed in that respect, particularly with how she depicted how we have numbed ourselves to tragedy. In that sense, however, she picked the wrong crowd. Not hard to see why. ?
Barring a few exceptions, those who patronise the English theatre at Lionel Wendt are indifferent to the social relevance of that theatre. They are moved to pity, intense anger, and profound sorrow, but the minute the curtain falls they return to their comfortable lawns. ?5,000 enforced disappearances?? a rather young lady, surprised and not a little repulsed, asked her friend as they walked away. (She was referring to an observation made in the final skit.) The oohs and aahs provoked by these statistics were, not surprisingly, tempered by their milieus. ?
What a play like ?Dear Children Sincerely? deserves isn?t apathy, or oohs and aahs, but genuinely felt, genuinely articulated contemplation. That is why I thought that Ruwanthi did a commendable job in inviting Saumya Liyanage to moderate a discussion that followed her play. Despite that, however, I was dissatisfied. When that old woman ridicules the Sinhala teachers recruited by Mrs Bandaranaike after her government took over several private schools (housed their milieu, by the way) with a scathing remark (?Our children were taught that eggs were hatched by lightning!?), for instance, the audience laughed. ?
I believe DCS is an ongoing project, that more shows are to come, and that more people have been interviewed. They will need an entirely different audience for their impact to truly seep in. And they will need to resolve the following question and dilemma; if the result was inevitable, and if you think it was undesirable and unbecoming, shouldn?t you find out what caused it in the first place? ?
The fact is that chauvinism and terrorism weren?t just products of our hatred. The fact is that all those were also products of the apathy of our leaders. As far as the politics of ?Dear Children Sincerely? is concerned, that is my two cents. ?

Donald Trump Jrs stunningly incriminating statement to the New York Times
	
?
Donald Trump Jr. has made a potentially damaging New York Times report much, much worse. ??
The Times on Sunday reported that the president?s eldest son was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York on June 9, 2016. ??
As Times reporters Jo Becker, Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman explained, Trump Jr.?s motivation for agreeing to the meeting ?points to the central question in federal investigations of the Kremlin?s meddling in the presidential election: Whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. ??
The accounts of the meeting represent the first public indication that at least some in the campaign were willing to accept Russian help.? ??
Paul Manafort, the campaign?s chairman at the time, and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump?s son-in-law and adviser, also attended. ??
The report looks bad for the president, even though his private legal team told the Times that Trump did not participate or even know about the meeting. Trump has a go-to playbook in situations like these: cast doubt on the credibility of unnamed sources (five, in this case) and cry, ?Fake news!? ??
But Trump Jr. took that strategy off the table with a stunningly incriminating first response. ??
The rest of Trump Jr.?s statement is an attempt to minimize the value of what the lawyer actually told him. The outcome of the meeting is beside the point. ??
Trump Jr.?s attempt to obtain information from a Russian lawyer that could harm Clinton seems likely to alarm investigators, regardless of whether the effort proved successful. ?

EPF officer who dealt with PTL interdicted
	
A senior officer of the Central Bank's EPF Department, Saman Kumara, who dealt on behalf of the EPF in secondary market transactions with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., (PTL) has been interdicted by the CB, the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) today confirmed to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI).
This was revealed when SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned ASG Dappulada Livera on media reports regarding the interdiction.
Questioning about the interdiction, Justice Jayawardena emphasized the significance of Mr. Kumara?s involvement saying, ?he played the star role as revealed in the Pan Asia Bank DGM's evidence so far?.
Mr. Kumara was the dealer for the EPF in secondary market transactions with PTL, where Pan Asia Bank (PABC) had acted as an intermediary for both, due to regulatory counter party restrictions.
According to the testimony of Deputy General Manager of Pan Asia Bank, R. A. Benedict Dias, earlier it was revealed that on the instructions of the former chairman of PABC, Nimal Perera, the decision to act as an intermediary was made.
The evidence of Mr. Dias transpired that he had two meetings with Arjun Aloysius in the presence of the former chairman in June, 2015 and March, 2016.
The first meeting was in relation to the PABC?s role to act as an intermediary in secondary market transaction between EPF and PTL, while the latter was in connection with whether to facilitate PTL with ?intraday inject of cash' to settle payments regarding the bonds that they had obtained at the auctions that took place on March 29 and March 31, 2016.
Earlier, it was also revealed in his evidence that Saman Kumara had obtained a loan of Rs. 25 million for private purposes from the Pan Asia Bank when Nimal Perera was the Chairman.
Reliable sources said that CBSL officials are not permitted to obtain loans from other banks without special permission.
Meanwhile, Kalinga Indatissa PC who appeared on behalf of Arjun Aloysius today cross examined the witness regarding the allegations made against his client over interfering with the witness.
During the cross-examination, the witness assured that after the meeting he had with Mr. Aloysius on June 30 prior to him being summoned to give evidence, Mr. Aloysius and himself had no mobile conversations even though Mr. Aloysius had made several ?WhatsApp calls?, which were not answered deliberately by the witness.
When President?s Counsel asked the witness whether he had a fear of losing his job at the time he was meeting Mr. Aloysius, witness replied saying yes and that there was a concern.
It was revealed when the commission questioned, that there was a fallout between the former chairman of PABC and the largest share holder of PABC, Dhammika Perera in March 2017, and subsequently, two officials of PABC were sacked.
The witness explaining to the commission said that those two officials who had been sacked recently were following instructions of the former chairman, Nimal Perera.
?So, I was worried because I also acted according to the instructions of the former chairman over the decision to act as an intermediary?, he said.
According to the witness, after a briefing given to Dhammika Perera by the current CEO of PABC regarding the situation, Dhammika Perera had phoned the witness and had asked whether he had committed any illegal act.
?I said no, and assured that I never even had a cup of tea with those people who were involved in the transactions. We got only a nominal amount of profit in acting as an intermediary.?
After that conversation, the witness said he received a call from Mr. Aloysius questioning whether the profit gained by PABC in the intermediary role was nominal or considerable.
?I doubted why Mr. Aloysius phoned me and questioned about profit soon after the conversation I had with Mr. Perera, therefore I was also in need of meeting Mr. Aloysius to clarify important things. Hr phoned me on June 30 and was pleading to meet me, and I also wanted to meet him to get clarifications," he said
Earlier the witness said he was asked to support in PCoI proceedings by Mr. Aloysius when he met Mr. Aloysius at his house on June 30.
Further examinations of the witness will continue on Wednesday. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

GMOA threatens to reveal 'true' situation on Dengue
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) is to complain to foreign embassies about Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne?s inability to find a solution to the dengue outbreak in the country which had now reached epidemic proportions.
Addressing a press briefing, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said if the present government was unable to control Minister Senaratne the GMOA would have to request the international community to intervene to save the country?s health service.
Dr. Aluthge said Minister Senaratne?s actions has violated the norms of the medical education and had resulted in dengue now increasing to epidemic proportions.?The negligence shown by the minister and the authorities had helped in increasing the mosquito density in almost all the districts," he said. According to the Parasitologist?s report this hyper-epidemic situation would prevail for another two months,? he said.
He also said the Health Ministry had so far ignored announcing the dengue patients? count to the respective area medical officers which is an important step of controlling the situation.
Dr. Aluthge also said there was a lack of facilities to conduct the ?NS1 Antigen? test that allows rapid detection on the first day of fever to ascertain if a patient has Dengue.
Therefore, he urged the authorities to take all possible measures to control the situation or the GMOA would reveal the true situation to the entire world for the benefit of patients. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

He was left holding the plate
	
How a certain prominent purohita had to undergo a brief but a very embarrassing moment at an outstation public function recently has gone viral in political circles.
?
The purohita was among the distinguished guests who attended the opening of a rehabilitation centre in the East. A foreign organization was the main sponsor of this centre and a female representative from the organization was also present as a guest of honour.
The guests at the function were served with a fried fish, a delicacy this area is well-known for, ahead of the formal opening and when the time came for observing the traditional rites associated with the ceremony, the foreign lady was invited to cut the ribbon. And an organizer was seen extending a pair of scissors to her. However, she found herself still savoring the fried fish and she handed the unfinished plate to the purohita who was standing by her side to have her hand free to do the honours.
The purohita gallantly took over the plate with a partly eaten fried fish. However, if he thought he was to hold the out-of-the place- object only for a few seconds, he would have been sadly mistaken. For the foreign lady was again invited to light the traditional oil lamp as well. The purohita who continued to hold the plate of fried fish was now conscious of furtive glances being cast his way and ripples of amusement passing through the gathering. Some agonizing seconds for him ticked away as the foreign lady was going about lighting the traditional oil lamp and he was almost in a sweat with unease by the time the lady returned to relieve him of the ?burden?, they say.?

Memories of a gentleman police officer
	
My one and only brother Sanaraja Banda Senaratne passed away one and half years ago. His Birthday fell on 10th July. He was a friend and a brother whom I will never forget. We normally had tiffs over various subjects, but anger was absent, because that was his way. ?
Whenever I met him in Colombo, generally at least twice a month, I used to tell him to recall his experiences, which are many, and put them down on paper so that other Police officers could get a glimpse of what Police can do for the betterment of the department. He told me one day ?Aiya, what is the earthly use? I have done my duty for the country, the people and above all served in one of the most honourable positions that one can be employed that of a Police Officer during my 30-year career. I have no regrets ?. I never spoke about the subject, because that was what he wished. ?
After he passed away, his room was tidied and it was found that he had jotted down a few important facts in a book which he may have perhaps intended to publish some day. But he couldn?t. That?s the nature of life. I quote a few lines from the many he has penned. Some I really don?t understand. ?
He commences his story with the background of his parents. ?We once lived in Colombo 7 and attended St. Joseph?s College. During the war we shifted to my mother?s home in Kandy and joined Kingswood College; where gentlemen are made. Both of us received that grounding, more to fit into society rather than canter for examinations. ?
My brother forsook a University education and opted to join the Police Service, when Sir Richard Aluvihare was the Inspector General of Police. My brother says that he joined the Police when Sir Richard took out the ? Force ? and made it a ? Service ? and instructed that police must have a mirror in the Police Reserve. He said that this will help Police Officers who go out on duty see for themselves who they are. Well there is a point in that system. ?
He puts it down that when the Board interviewed him at the stadium at the Police ground, Sir Richard himself was present which suprised the Senior Officers serving on the Board; including the most feared Sydney Soyza. Sir Richard sat as the President, he writes. He was asked only two questions by Sri Richard himself. He was asked what school he attended and what was his position? That ended the interview for him. Nine young men from all ethnic groups were selected, including a Burgher citizen. ?
As a Senior Prefect at Kingswood, he on his own used to stop vehicles on the road for students so that they could cross the road. Then as a Rover Scout he got a brilliant idea. ? ?
The then Principal of Girls? High School, which was a sister school, coming under the Wesleyan Mission, called the Senior Prefect of Kingswood through the Principal and told him to organize one for her Girls? who were Guides. This was done and Kandy Girls? High School became the second to form the ?Road Safety Squad? ?
When he joined Police Service, he promoted this idea and it became a National Institution. He writes that his first appointment was at the Pettah Police. Here he had to do the ? Paper Inquiry?, a subject that is given to ? rookie ? Sub Inspectors. With this he came across most individuals who became politicians later and served the country. ?
While serving at Pettah, the famous ?Emergency? was clamped down. He was on duty at Boodhi Junction, when an acid bottle was thrown at him. The acid bottle hit his nose and then fell on to his feet, burning his shoe. ?
Then he relates how the Home Guards were formed. Having had to sleep sometimes in schools, without proper facilities, because the police didn?t have the resources nor funding.?
He writes about one ASP. Aiyer was the ASP in charge of the division which covers Pettah. He adds, ?Our father knew Iyer and told him one day that his son is at Pettah Police?. From here onward he says that he was under his thumb. One day he called me and said ? See that you make entries whenever you go out and keep the pocket note book up to date. This you will never regret ? What he said was true. ?
In short, he was transferred back to Colombo Police Headqauarters to the Crime and Information Division. He had no vehicle. So he told the IGP that he had no vehicle and that was soon after he was appointed. He told him ? take my car ?. It was one of those rare cars in the department which was red in colour. ??
Anyone who knew him during his times with the Police, would tell that he lived a good life and was helpful to anyone who he came across. He was well connected with temples. ?He had close ties with Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya. There was a reason why he was so connected with the Maha Sangha. It was because of his father?s brother, our uncle. He was a Buddhist monk. He later served as the Trustee of Hantane Raja Maha Vihare. ?
My brother lived a full life. He left without the knowledge that he was departing ?

New Syrian ceasefire offers a test of Trump?s friendship with Putin
	
The first attempt by the Trump administration to cooperate with Russia on an international crisis got underway on Sunday, with the implementation of a ceasefire in southwestern Syria that appeared to be widely holding. ??
If the truce can be maintained, it could open the door to deeper cooperation between the United States and Russia on ways to quell the violence and to progress on other ceasefire deals being pressed elsewhere in Syria . ??
The guns fell silent well ahead of a noon deadline, residents in the ceasefire zone said, lending hope that it would stop the violence for at least a while and save lives.?

Painful journeys at sky-high fares
	
The minimum bus fare was increased from Rs. 9 to Rs. 10 in this year?s amendments. The Cabinet approved a 6.28 price hike on June 20 both in private and government sectors. The amended bus fares were enforced on July 1. An expert committee was appointed to formulate a national policy to revise bus fares. 
?
Noisy and distracting music and musical shows broadcast in private buses that disturb peaceful travelling???
?
The annual bus fares were revised by 6% in 2016, effective from August 1. The minimum Rs. 8 rose to Rs. 9, according to the Sri Lanka Central Bank Annual Report. It denotes that the private sector ran19,614 buses by 2016, which is higher than the 19,397 buses that were in operation in 2015. The average of daily private bus transportation was marked as 17,131 in 2016 compared to 16,942 recorded in 2015. According to the statistics given in the 2015 annual NTC report, 38.2% of the total motor vehicle transportation demands were for the private buses. It is obvious that private buses have more passengers than SLTB (Sri Lanka Transport Board) buses. The SLTB operated 6178 buses last year, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation official website reveals. The government policy on public and private bus transportation is that 60% of all travel terms are for the private sector while 40% relates to the government. The 2015 NTC report says a considerable decrease in luxury buses is recorded while the use of semi-luxury buses is on the increase. An estimated 7.7 million people have used the private bus service. ??
?
?The Government is responsible for not regulating the bus service.? - Gemunu Wijerathne, President of Lanka Private Bus Owners? Association (LPBOA)?
?The Transport Commission increased the bus fares based on 12 indexes. The price of engine oil, cost of the bus, interest rate, cost of spareparts, refill charges, raw materials, service charges for repairs and most of all, inflation have contributed towards the rise in bus fares.? Gemunu Wijerathne, President of Lanka Private Bus Owners? Association (LPBOA) explained the underlining causes. ??
?But we insist not to increase the bus fare annually. This increase started in 2002, and now it?s time to stop. If this continues, people will get rid of public transport and use three wheelers and motorcycles that will further worsen the situation,? he said.?
?And however much the fares were increased, the drivers and conductors will take advantage of it. We have already proposed to the government to introduce a new method called ?paying per kilo-meters scheme?, but they haven?t taken it into consideration yet. We proposed the travel card and it was approved by this year?s budget. If the government implemented the travel card, the raising of bus fares could have been avoided. It?s the failure of the government in not regulating the bus service which had caused this,?he said.?
The LPBOA had been trying to raise bus fares. they had been demanding for a 15% fare hike in July 2016 and were planning a strike on July 3. The strike was halted with the government?s intervention. ??
Efforts to obtain a comment from Eng. M.A.P. Hemachandra, chairman of National Transport Commission (NTC) were unsuccessful. ??
?
?Seat dimensions of buses don?t comply with the anthropometric data? Ranjith Withanage, Chairman of National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP)?
?The passengers have many rights due to them with regard to public transport. They possess the right to travel in a peaceful environment which is not disturbed by loud noise. Every passenger has the right to travel in a manner that his mentality is undisturbed. What the buses play on TV or Radio are musical shows with poor taste. The mentality of passengers differ from one another. People who witness those shows are those who love that type of music. We need to keep in mind that every passenger has a different mindsets and taste. ??
Most of the buses currently operating possess engines and chassis imported from India. These have been manufactured by TATA or Ashok Leyland. The lorry engines haven?t been made to suit the configurations of a bus. Therefore, travelling in such buses isn?t comfortable. The real buses that are built to carry passengers are the ones used in expressways. ??
Commenting on the subject of receiving the due balance, he said, ?It?s the right of passengers to be given their change monies, even if it?s just a rupee or or two. If 2000 passengers are denied receiving two rupees change, the conductor will collect 4000 rupees. It boils down to the ignorance of the passengers regarding their own rights. The fares are exhibited in every bus. If passengers are charged more than the actual price, they should make a complain with the Road Passenger Transport Authority. Above all else, passengers should speak up for their rights. ??
Countries like Malaysia have developed transport facilities. They use a card system. Semi - luxury bus fare is one and half times the normal rates while travelling by Intercity buses costs double. The full description regarding these categories is unclear and has led to problems. Semi - Luxury buses can?t carry passengers exceeding the seating capacity. ??
The 54-seater buses (2x3 seats) imported from India are give a painful physical and mental travel experience to passengers. SLTB officials opine that those 2x3 seater buses are suitable for long distance semi - luxury service only. ??
They have revealed that the seat dimensions in buses currently used don?t match with the anthropometric data with regard to the shoulder and hip breadth of Sri Lankans. This situation puts the passengers in great discomfort and difficulty. ??
We made a request to the Ombudsmen last year regarding the safety of women passengers. The Ombudsmen called the SLTB officials (delegates came instead of the Chairman). They said that they will use 2x3 seater buses only for long distance travel. They aren?t following the recommendations of the Ombudsmen. ??
?
"If passengers are charged more than the actual price, they should make a complain with the Road Passenger Transport Authority. Above all else, passengers should speak up for their rights"
?
The bus seat dimensions are decided on by the Motor Traffic Act gazetted on 1983.06.03. The dimensions now in use are based on outdated data collected in 1980?s. According to the gazette, the seat head per passenger is 382 mm. It should be made 450 mm. We Sri Lankans have broad shoulders and hips and are fatter compared to other Asians. The Consumer Rights Organisation is suggesting a revision in both the seat dimensions and regulations in keeping with the recommendations made by mechanical engineers and Health Ministry officials. They have found through another research that the dimensions of buses have been decided without taking into consideration the average size of passengers. The luxury buses have been made taking into consideration the correct measurements and therefore are comfortable. ??
?Raising fares can be accepted only if they improve the facilities and service. There are rules imposed on loading cattle into lorries, but none regarding overloading in buses. NTC has the authority to bring in new rules, hence they must consider comments before doing so. We informed the NTC to conduct a survey regarding public opinion, but they turned a deaf ear to us. It would have been better if they considered our opinion. Motor Traffic Transport Commission has the authority to decide the width, length and dimensions of seats regarding vehicles used for public transport. ??
?
Well known irregularities ? ?
Refuelling on the way is common. According to NTC staff, refuelling while transporting passengers is prohibited. ??
?
Keeping the change ??
Luxury and semi-luxury buses are charging fees, depending on the passenger?s general appearance and personality. ??
?

SL condemns terror attack on Amarnath Yatra pilgrims in India
	
Sri Lanka today condemned the terror attack on Amarnath Yatra pilgrims in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India, where seven pilgrims were killed and another 19 were injured on Monday.
?Condemns in the strongest terms the attack on peaceful pilgrims on Amarnath Yatris and our hearts are with those affected? External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne tweeted.
At least seven pilgrims returning from the Amarnath shrine were killed on Monday night in Jammu and Kashmir?s Anantnag district after terrorists opened fire on their bus and a security vehicle.
The attack occurred at Batengoo when 60-70 pilgrims were returning from Baltal, one of the base camps of the pilgrimage, to Jammu. Deputy chief minister Nirmal Singh said the bodies of the victims ? all of whom were from Gujarat ? would be airlifted to state on Tuesday.
Political leaders condemned the attack, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying India would not be ?bogged down? by such ?cowardly? acts. In a joint statement, separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik expressed grief over the killings, saying the incident ?goes against the very grain of Kashmiri ethos?.

Sooriyawewa ground staff: Their trousers for their wages
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today an investigation would be launched into the incident where temporary ground staff at the Sooriyawewa Stadium in Hambantota were asked to hand over their uniform before being paid their daily wages.
He said he was informed about this incident this morning and would never endorse such action.
?I cannot agree with it at all. What is the use of taking back a trouser worn for six days? I will conduct an investigation into this matter,? he said.
It was reported that about 100 workers who were recruited as ground staff on a temporary basis had gone to obtain their salaries after six days of work at the Sooriyawewa stadium during the Zimbabwe tour and were asked to hand over the trousers given by the SLC before being paid their wages.
The workers were disappointed at this request because they had not taken an extra trouser to wear not expecting to hand over the one given by the SLC. Some of them had no other choice but to return home in their underwear. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Tobacco giant ordered to pay  legal bill estimated at $50 million
	
Cigarette company Phillip Morris may soon have to cough up $50 million in legal fees after losing its bid in getting the Australian government to get rid off plain packaging laws. ??
The Permanent Court of Arbitration?s new ruling delivered over the weekend, had brought the six-year legal battle to an end with the huge payout favouring the government. ??
In 2011, former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard had introduced the world?s first plain packaging laws.Her efforts received a huge backlash with many tobacco companies taking the matter all the way to the Australian high court. ??
However, the bid failed and a verdict favouring the government was handed down in 2015. ??
Fast forward two years on, the court now wants Phillip Morris to cover the legal costs of the case, which includes an undisclosed amount in arbitration fees as well.The Sydney Morning Herald said while the legal cost was a ?closely guarded secret?, it estimates the amount to be around $50 million. ??
In its defence, the Australian government said that its claim was justifiable to cover cost of its lawyers, outside counsel, expert reports, witnesses, and travel and accommodation.
