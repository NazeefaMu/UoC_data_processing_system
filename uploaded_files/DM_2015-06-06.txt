India, SL fishermen issue needs lasting solution: Envoy
	
The long-drawn fishermen problem between India and Sri Lanka  that has often threatened to spoil ties  needs a bottoms-up solution rather than one imposed from above, Sri Lankan High Commissioner in India Sudharshan Seneviratne said.
The fishermen problem, that has recently seen some harsh language used by Sri Lankan Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera  with India voicing its displeasure  can only be solved through earnest dialogue, says Seneviratne.
In my opinion, both parties are trying to talk. The government of Mr. (Narendra) Modi is very concerned to try and work out a solution. But it has to be a short-term, mid-term and long-term process, with an understanding on both sides of the modalities, he said.
Unless you can carry out an earnest dialogue in good faith, the problems will continue, the envoy, who has been recalled just one year into his term, told IANS.
Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj during her recent press conference had commented that sometimes very provocative statements come from Colombo, which can vitiate the atmosphere.
She said that both sides need to keep the atmosphere conducive before discussing the fishermen issue.
Seneviratne says both sides have to understand the needs of the people, based on the old cultural, economic habits and the flexible way of people in using the resources.
He says a qualitative change seems to have occurred on the old flexible ways of fishermen when the LTTE was dominating the area. The envoy said the mechanised way with bottom trawling of fishing is unacceptable for Sri Lanka and India. The bottom trawling, followed by Indian fishermen, is a very destructive process; it is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg, says the envoy.
He said the bottom-trawling by the larger and heavy-built Indian fishing vessels is leading to the total destruction of the marine ecology, the marine plants and breeding area of fish.
He said according to marine ecologists, In the next 6-8 years, the total marine ecology will be destroyed for South India and Sri Lanka.
Seneviratne points out the contradiction in the way the Tamil Nadu fishermen and others in the state get hyped up about problems the Tamil people are undergoing and the bottom trawling by Indian fishermen which is depriving the Tamil fishermen of Sri Lanka of their livelihood. The practice also destroyed the nets laid out by Sri Lankan fishermen.
He stressed that the issue has to be resolved through dialogue. We cant put barriers. There is a historical connectivity between these people  there are inter-marriages that took place. There has to be a bottoms-up solution rather than a solution imposed from above, he stressed.

SL refugees in Indonesia plead NZ for help
	
	Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Myanmar refugees ended up shipwrecked on an Indonesian reef earlier this week said that they were heading for New Zealand.
In a letter seen by Radio New Zealand, the refugees had made a collective plea to the New Zealand Government for asylum, saying it was unsafe for them to return home.
Radio New Zealand has made attempts to verify the letter, which bears the signatures of 65 people.
Nazmul Hassan, who identifies himself as one of the 65 in a Kupang detention centre, said they just wanted a peaceful life."We leave our country because of some problems and political violence and too many problems. We are really in trouble and under pressure now."
He said they were all confined to one room at the centre in West Timor and that the group was mentally and physically exhausted.
Meanwhile, New ZealandImmigration Minister Michael Woodhouse said he had not received any requests for help.

## Title: SLC knocks out highest bidder for local TV deal

SLC knocks out highest bidder for local TV deal
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) interim committee which is reeling under one mighty financial blow they received on Wednesday when they learnt that the bid for the forthcoming three test matches against India could only bring them US $ 1.4 million, have committed further financial hara-kiri by opting to offer their local TV rights for the next three years to the state owned Sri Lanka Rupavahini (SLRC) at a rate of at least Rs. 35 million below the figure quoted by top bidder Carlton Sports Network (CSN).
An SLC interim committee member revealed that Rupavahini who made an official bid of Rs. 110 million has agreed to increase their offer to Rs. 130 million, a figure which is still a staggering Rs. 35 million (more than 21 percent) less than the figure of Rs. 165 million offered by CSN.
Interestingly, all these squabbling over alleged three wrong points in the document provided by CSN had come to a halt last morning when CSN issued SLC a written assurance and agreed to pay the total of Rs. 165 million upfront, but SLC Interim Committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny said that assurance was too late as they had taken the decision to award the rights to Rupavahini on the previous night.
A financial expert expressed surprise at that excuse, saying it was unbelievable that SLC couldnt communicate the development immediately to the interim committee members and taken a decision that was worth Rs. 35 million.
We sat in the evening and made the decision. There is a limit. They delayed it by a week. The bank guarantee did not come at the deadline we gave them. Thats the bottom line said SLC Interim Committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny.
Both Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake and Wettimuny insisted that their decision to kick away the higher bid was over technical issues in a Bank Guarantee they asked from CSN. 
Bank guarantee has to carry the words unconditional and irrevocable. Those conditions were not there in the bank guarantee (CSN provided). So we couldnt accept that bank guarantee Minister Dissanayake told Daily Mirror.
We basically looked at financial capabilities, and looked at the long term situation. Committee came to the conclusion (that) safer option is to go with Rupavahini said Wettimuny.
Asked what was wrong with the finances of CSN as the committee felt, Wettimuny refused to go into details. I dont think it is fair me to talk about the details, I wouldnt be fair by CSN. We have looked at financial situations, as per the information given to us. We extended the period and asked them for a bank guarantee. We didnt receive it when we should said Wettimuny.
Wettimuny however revealed that they did not bother to ask for a similar bank guarantee from Rupavahini. No Rupavahini didnt give a bank guarantee. It is government owned. We feel we dont need to worry about state television station said Wettimuny, himself one of the leading businessmen of the country.
Asked why they didnt have the same confidence about CSN who had been faithful partners of SLC for the past three years and whether CSN had defaulted due payments in the past, Wetimmunys answer was rather vague.
No. They havent defaulted payments. But looking at what we have in hand, we made the decision. We had to look at every aspect and come to that conclusion said Wettimuny.
They sent us a draft (of Bank Guarantee) which had three errors. We corrected them and sent but they never sent it back to us. Even they had got SLC name wrong. They have called it an incorporated company. SLC is an association added Wettimuny.
We have written to them on the 27th. We gave them plenty of time. We have gone through the due process. We wanted to be fair assured Wettimuny.
But CSNs Director of Sports Gihan Samaranayake revealed that theres more to Wettimunys description of events.
It is a lie to say that they asked for a bank guarantee on 27th. That day, they only asked us if we could provide a bank guarantee for a hundred percent of our bid. Then after consulting our bank, we informed them we can.
Then on Sunday evening, they suddenly informed us that they needed a specimen of the bank guarantee on the following day. When we asked the bank, bank asked us to get a document called letter of intent from SLC in order to issue a bank guarantee. But SLC completely ignored it said Samaranayake.
Asked about this, Wettimuny said they were not obliged to issue letters like that.
I cant comment on that at the moment. We dont need to ask them for anything. We asked them for a bank guarantee, unconditional bank guarantee. It didnt come said Wettimuny.
As they did not issue the letter of intent, we told them that we would get the required specimen of the guarantee on Wednseday as Tuesday was poya day and we gave them the specimen issued by the bank on Wednesday said Samaranayake.
Interestingly, the specimen CSN had been issued by Bank of Ceylon, SLCs main banking partner who is recently reported to have issued a further overdraft of Rs. 450 million to the cash strapped institution.
CSN sources said that the company management would discuss the issue on an urgent basis and said that there was a possibility of seeking legal redress against SLC who would face the possibility of spending a few more million Rupees in legal fees not to mention the damages they would have to pay in case CSN winning the case.
Samaranayake also added that the word unconditional had specifically been mentioned in the specimen they provided while a top bank official from Bank of Ceylon told Daily Mirror that the word could mean little as bank guarantees are always unconditional. (Channaka de Silva)
