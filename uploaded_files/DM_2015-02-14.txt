SF gets seat if Ketagoda resigns-Elec. Chief
	
	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday confirmed that General Sarath Fonseka was person entitled to be appointed as a Member of Parliament in the event national list member Jayantha Ketagoda resigned.
Of course I will recommend General Fonseka to the Secretary General of Parliament as the proper person to replace parliamentarian Jayantha Ketagoda of the Democratic Party in case he relinquishes his parliamentary seat, Mr. Deshapriya told Daily Mirror.
Mr. Ketagoda, a former Western Provincial Councillor replaced Democratic Party Leader General Sarath Fonseka in Parliament after he was convicted of trumped up charges that he had employed army personnelas his personal staff.
On January 21, President Maithripala Sirisena granted former Army Commander General Sarath Fonseka a full presidential pardon and restored his civic rights, privileges and military decorations and thereby removing the obstacles he faced in re-entering Parliament.
On January 23, Mr. Deshapriya told journalists that General Fonsekas voting rights would be restored after obtaining legal advice and added that former DP member and MP Jayantha Ketagoda had written to him asking whether General Fonseka could replace him in Parliament if he relinquished his seat.
On January 18, Mr. Ketagoda had said he would resign from Parliament to make way for General Fonseka to re-enter Parliament but since then he has opted to maintain a mysterious silence on this matter and had even not answered any calls directed to him.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

UN rights chief should decide on SL report delay: US
	
The US says it is up to the UN human rights commissioner to determine when a UN report on alleged war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil conflict is released.
Sri Lanka is requesting a delay in the report's publication for several months, while it sets up its own judicial mechanism to probe rights violations during the war that ended in 2009.
The UN investigation, mandated by a US-backed resolution last year, was discussed Thursday by Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Samaraweera amid warming ties between the US and Sri Lanka's newly elected government.
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday that the US has ``absolute confidence'' in the UN commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein in this matter.
Samaraweera expressed optimism Thursday in the report being delayed. (The Economic Times)
