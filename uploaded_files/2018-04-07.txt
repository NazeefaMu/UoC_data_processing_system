A true gentleman and officer par excellence
	
It has taken me six months to muster enough courage and get into the right frame of mind to pen a few lines in memory of my late father, Major General (Retd) Duleep Justin De Silva Wickremanayake psc. rcds.?
My father passed away peacefully in Sydney, Australia on September 29, 2017. He lived a life full of joy, happiness, care and integrity. Thatha would always remark that his biggest achievement and best asset in life was his family. He loved his wife, his children, grandchildren and one great grandchild.?
Although we were blessed to have our father with us for 87 years, my father never enjoyed the love of his own father. My grandfather, Justin De Silva Wickremanayake, passed away when Thatha was only 10 months old. After his demise, my very young grandmother, Violet De Silva Wickremanayake, remarried a wonderful man who became a surrogate father to Thatha. Kaleani Seeya, Uyanage Robinson De Silva as we used to call him, was a gentleman who made sure Thatha never felt the loss of his father. He ensured his love and support to Thatha at all times.?
?
Thatha, as I see your smiling face looking down at me across my work desk, my heart is heavy with pain and my eyes are filled with love and admiration for you
Despite the loss of his father at such a young age, Thatha was an absolute role model when it came to fatherhood. He was a great provider, mentor and motivator for all of his children. We were fortunate to grow up under the love and guidance of our father and mother. We enjoyed our younger days roaming carefree around the various Army quarters in Panagoda and Diyatalawa. Thatha ensured we learnt the basics and encouraged us to follow our dreams and passion in whatever we did. Thatha made sure we grew up appreciating what we had and instilled in all of us the values of humility, respect, honesty, integrity and above all, love.?
Thatha enjoyed his life but always made sure we were taken care of. We were never left wanting for anything, as he would make sure we had everything we needed.?
As for every child, to me my father is my hero and he could do no wrong. I remember waiting for him to come home so I could try his uniform and walk around the Army quarters parading in my father?s cap and uniform tunic top. I am sure my mother would agree that it?s an understatement to say I was a handful when I was growing up. As a result, my mother would pack me off to the camp for the day with my father on most days, also whenever he visited outstation camps. I loved it! Thatha was a great host and he took good care of me allowing me to roam around the camp under the watchful eye of his driver or a nominated soldier. Needless to say, they took good care of me and the highlight of the day was riding in the back of Army trucks, watching the parades and of course having lunch at the Army Officers Mess.?
?
These are some of my most cherished memories which contributed to me wanting to emulate my father and follow his footsteps in joining the Sri Lanka Army.?
This dream came true when I joined the Sri Lanka Army in March 1984 as a young Officer Cadet with my father?s blessings, encouragement and support. Unfortunately, I left early and I am sure, although my father never said it, he was happy to see me do well in my chosen field; though he would have liked to have seen me as a senior officer in the Sri Lankan Army.?
?
Thatha was a fierce fighter for justice and he fought and won many benefits still enjoyed by our gallant officers and soldiers in the Army
My father unconditionally loved his Army, his regiment (4th Artillery) and everything to do with the Army. Thatha was the ultimate officer and gentleman who was renowned for his no-nonsense approach, logical thinking, dedication, loyalty and calmness. Recently, I met a retired Army General who was full of praise for Thatha and referred to him as their God at the time. This was because of the trust they had in my father as a man who always did the right thing by everyone. This officer was not alone, as we have had many touching tributes paid to my father during and after the funeral by many retired and serving senior Army officers and others.?
As a family, we were immensely proud of Thatha and his many achievements during his distinguished career at Ananda? College, in the Army and in Australia. He was a humble man who, after leaving Sri Lanka, managed to join the Veteran Affairs Department in Australia. Thatha was sharp and intelligent; he used to get 100 out of 100 for most of the public-sector exams he participated in at the department. As a result, he rose to the top as one of the highest ranking public service officials. In my view, this simple act showed great character for a man of his stature to pursue another career after a stellar 29-year career with the Sri Lankan Army. He showed us that nothing is impossible and Thatha worked till he was 65 years old; the official retirement age in Australia.?
This article is not intended to highlight my father?s many accomplishments. As his son, it is simply my way of expressing the love and gratitude I have for my father and to help us with the grieving process in coming to terms with the loss of such a wonderful husband and father.?
Having said that, I want to conclude this article with a small reminder of the type of man my father was and how respected he was as an Officer and a Gentleman.?
Thatha was a fierce fighter for justice and he fought and won many benefits still enjoyed by our gallant officers and soldiers in the Army. In fact, at my father?s funeral, the following was mentioned in the Part 1 Order issued by the Adjutant General of the Army (my friend and batch mate Major General Shavendra Silva) and which, in my view, encapsulates what a brilliant man my father was.?
?Maj. General Wickremanayake was a source of encouragement and inspiration to the Officers and Other Ranks of the Army. He was always held in high esteem by his peers and colleagues for his absolute integrity and honesty. His name is written in the history of the Regiment of Artillery as the 5th Commanding Officer of the 4th Field Regiment of Sri Lanka Artillery. Apart from that he commanded the Corps of Military Police as the 3rd Commanding Officer of the 1st Ceylon Corps of Military Police. He, as the Director Personnel Administration and Director Operations and Training of the Army had enormously contributed in formulating many Training Programmes, Regulations and Orders for the smooth functioning of the Army. Further, his visionary thinking as a field commander and a principal staff officer, contributed immensely to uplift the state of morale and wellbeing of the members of the Army?
?
Thatha was the ultimate officer and gentleman who was renowned for his no-nonsense approach, logical thinking, dedication, loyalty and calmness
?
Thatha, as I see your smiling face looking down at me across my work desk, my heart is heavy with pain and my eyes are filled with love and admiration for you. I want you to know that you were and will always be my hero! Thatha, I wish I was half the man you were and I, along with Amma, Roshan Aiya, Deso Akki, Ingi Akki and Hiran will miss you and remember you every day for the rest of our lives.?
Thank you for making me the man I am today and the life you provided for us.?
?
?May you Attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana?
Your loving son Dinesh?

Ability to see through the eye of technology
	
At a time when technology has reached its peak, all eyes are on efficient and intricate IT systems. Technology is imperative and inevitable despite where you are or what kind of work you are involved in. In fact, IT systems are the drivers of the world economy. It was announced at the Web Economic Forum in 2015 that, ?Everything is coming online and we are connecting more of our world every day. At this very moment, over 12 billion devices are connected to the internet, and that number is expected to increase to over 20 billion by 2020.?
But have you ever wondered who the stakeholders of these complex networks are? Have you heard of stakeholders who are differently-abled? How eager are you to know how technology assists them??
The WHO said in 2016 that, ?Over a billion people are estimated to live with some form of disability. This corresponds to about 15% of the world?s population. Between 110 million (2.2%) and 190 million (3.8%) people, 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning.? The word ?disability? is an umbrella term covering impairments such as difficulty in hearing, eyesight (0% sighted, low-vision, colour blindness), cognition (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions) and mobility (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs).?
Understanding the significance of IT systems results in building, designing and creating an application which is available at all times. This article highlights the importance of enabling access of IT systems to the differently-abled.?
Does it bother you to ask how people with physical impairments use tech systems? Different user groups have their own Assistive Technology when using IT systems. For instance, a visually-impaired person may use screen-readers and a person with hearing difficulties will require textual illustrations.?
The ATIA said last year that, ?Any item, piece of equipment, software programme or product system used to increase, maintain or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities is identified as Assistive Technology (AT).?
Assistive Technology can be used in three platforms; laptops and desktop? computers, mobile devices including smart phones and tablets, and Chromebooks (laptops using the Chrome browser for most of their functions). The extension Chrome Vox can also be used to launch the Chrome browser in a device.?
Assistive Technologies can be used for reading, writing, math and auditory processing disorders. This article will focus on the various Assistive Technologies for reading. Users with 0% eyesight or low-vision can use text-to-speech (TTS) or audio and digital TTS books to read content aloud with a computer generated or human voice. Similarly, for users with reading (low-vision, 0% eyesight) and cognitive impairments, optical character recognition (OCR) and graphic organisers can help by reading images and pictures from web pages using a computer generated voice. Further, graphic organisers allow for the understanding of ideas and concepts by visual representation such as diagrams and mind maps. Users with low-vision and colour contrast are given the opportunity to change the font type, font size, colour and spacing of text by using display control.
Users with 0% eyesight use screen-reading software with TTS embedded. The main task of a screen-reader is to read the screen of a particular website or computer. The salient question is, have you ever considered making your IT system available for screen-reader? Do you know how screen-reader interprets web content?? ?
Screen-reader tools interpret the code from document object models (DOM) and application programming interfaces (API). Windows uses APIs, Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and IAccessible2, and iOSuses Universal Access (UA) APIs to integrate with the browsers to expose information objects in the DOM. Therefore, the code needs to provide accurate, relevant information to be interpreted appropriately.?
To learn what needs to be added to the code, it is essential to understand how it gets interpreted by Assistive Technology and also to fathom how visually-impaired persons associate with it.?
It is vital to understand that enabling websites or IT systems to be accessible for differently-abled users should start with the design phase. Accessibility comes as a legal requirement for certain countries. The World Wide Web Consortium has an entire set of guidelines called Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with different levels as A, AA and AAA, which needs to be complied with by each system.?
As individuals interested in IT, consider treating everyone equally by enabling every form of web content.?

China vows to fight Trump tariffs ?at any cost?
	
?
DPA, 06th APRIL, 2018- China vowed to fight ?unilateral US protectionism at any cost? on Friday after US President Donald Trump ordered officials to examine posing an additional 100 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods.??
?On Sino-US trade, China has made its position very clear. We don?t want a trade war, but we are not afraid of such a war,? a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce told state-run news agency Xinhua on Friday.??
The ministry also vowed to take ?comprehensive countermeasures,? according to Xinhua, although it did not add further details.??
The comments echo the fiery rhetoric in state and Communist Party-backed publications over the past week as the standoff with the US escalates into a possible all-out trade war.??
In a statement on Thursday, Trump said he had ordered the move ?in light of China?s unfair retaliation? to US tariffs of 25 per cent on 50 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods he announced earlier this week.??
?Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,? Trump said.??
?I have instructed the USTR [US Trade Representative] to consider whether 100 billion dollars of additional tariffs would be appropriate under section 301 and, if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.???
He also said he had ordered the secretary of agriculture ?to implement a plan to protect our farmers and agricultural interests.???
The retaliatory tariffs ordered by Beijing this week targeted 50 billion dollars worth of US goods including key exports like soybeans, wheat, aircraft and chemical products designed to hit the rural regions where Trump is particularly popular.??

Fear, solidarity drive migrants to stick with Mexico ?caravan?
	
?
REUTERS, 06th APRIL, 2018- Impoverished Central American migrants travelling in a ?caravan? through Mexico that angered U.S. President Donald Trump said they would stick together for safety even though the group will end its journey in Mexico City rather than at the U.S. border.
Sinces peaking at around 1,500 people, the caravan has dwindled under pressure from Trump and Mexican migration authorities, which vowed to separate those migrants with a right to stay in Mexico from those who did not.
By issuing permits to the migrants, authorities shielded them from imminent deportation from Mexico.
By Thursday morning, migrants were boarding buses to leave the town of Matias Romero in the southern state of Oaxaca, where their journey was held up by authorities at the weekend.
Salvadoran Andres Rodriguez, 51, waited with a small backpack and a gallon of water in a field sprawling with men, women and children, mulling over a document that gave him 20 days to reach any border out of the country.

GMOA urges Prez to intervene to resolve health crisis in East
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday in a letter urged President Maithripala Sirisena to intervene in the unrest created among doctors in the Eastern Province due to what it called sluggish and arbitrary nature of the Eastern Province Governor.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the health service in the Eastern Province had been disturbed due to the irresponsible actions of the Governor and some other politicians.
He said the governor had continuously avoided holding discussions with them and added that following the request they made to President Sirisena, the Governor had given a discussion for them.
?It was also a failure due to the arbitrary and threatening nature of the Governor who had left the meeting,? he said.
?The land belong to a hospital in the area had been forcibly acquired by a group of politicians by threatening the Director of the Hospital. Several attacks have also been made on doctors in the area ,? he alleged.
He said several Indian medical officers who had visited the country had conducted mobile clinics in the Eastern Province risking the lives of patients and added that due to these reasons the doctors in the province were in an unrest.
?The President should intervene in this matter in order to avoid further inconvenience,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. rejects administering contraceptives to female migrant workers
	
The government said yesterday no contraceptives were administered to Lankan female migrant workers and added that only a medical check-up would be conducted prior to leaving the country.
'The Guardian' reported yesterday that Lankan women who take up domestic work in the Middle East to support families were being targeted by recruiting agents who order them to take contraceptives before leaving and six recruiters licensed by the government had said they could provide an employer with a ?three-month guarantee? that a maid would not become pregnant.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara rejected these allegations.
?If a woman was found pregnant following a medical check-up, she would not be permitted to go abroad for employment. However, the Ministry would inquire into the said allegations,? he said.
The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said they had not given any instruction to administer contraceptives for Lankan female migrant workers and added that there was no such requirement to be fulfilled by them to obtain employment overseas.
SLBFE Internal Affairs Additional General Manager W.M.V. Wansekara said they had not been informed of such incidents so far.
Meanwhile, the Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (ALFEA) said those allegations were baseless.
ALFEA President A.L.A. Hazzam said it was unethical to administer such contraceptive medication to Lankan female migrant workers and added there were no such mandatory requirements to fulfill.
?Prior to travelling overseas for employment, there is a medical check-up to ensure that female recruits are not pregnant,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Israelis and Palestinians brace for fresh violence at Gaza protests
	
?
DPA, 06th APRIL, 2018 - Both sides of the Gaza Strip border were preparing for large Palestinian protests on Friday, a week after clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces saw the region?s single bloodiest day in years.
Palestinians camped along the border planned to set thousands of tyres ablaze and use the thick smoke and mirrors to blind and confuse Israeli army snipers, protesters said.
Israel has warned that it has not changed its policy of firing on Palestinians who approach the Gaza-Israel border fence.
Human rights groups have criticized the response as disproportionate to the threat posed by Palestinians throwing rocks, burning tyres and lobbing Molotov cocktails. Since last Friday, 21 Palestinians have died from Israeli gunfire. The majority of the fatalities occurred during the Gaza border protest, while hundreds more were injured.

PAFFREL urges EC to take legal action on LG polls violations
	
The People's Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL) yesterday urged the Election Commission (EC) to take legal action on reported election law violations during the last Local Government (LG) Elections.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi in a letter sent to the Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya had stated that although due to immediate intervention of relevant authorities most of shortcomings were prevented it was appropriate to probe and take legal action over the complaints received.
It further said though the LG election ended as a comparatively free and fair election it had received several complaints over candidates who sealed the victory via inappropriate election campaigns.
?PAFFREL forwarded such complaints to the Election Commission. Accordingly we believe that the EC and Police also received complaints on election law violations. Therefore we request the commission to seek swift legal action over the received complaints,? he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PM agrees to TNA conditions to please Tamil Diaspora: Sarath Weerasekera
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe has given his consent to ten conditions proposed by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), to apparently please the Tamil Diaspora, former MP and retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera alleged yesterday.
He told the Daily Mirror that one of the main conditions was to draft a new constitution which would make Sri Lanka a federal State.
?The tactics of the PM would divide the country and Mr. Wickremesinghe is betraying the country by giving priority to condition put forward by the TNA. It became evident how strong the relationship between the TNA and Premier Wickremesinghe when the TNA voted against the no-faith Motion against him,? Mr. Weerasekera claimed.
?It is a shame to say that TNA being the official opposition party in Parliament, is voting in favour of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe against whom several allegations have been levelled pertaining to the controversial Central Bank bond scam,? he added.
Meanwhile, he said all the members of Parliament who voted in favour of the PM, should bear the responsibility for any actions of the Mr. Wickremesinghe in future.
?All the members who voted against the No faith motion are not honest and if there had been enough honest politicians in Parliament, the PM should have been removed,? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

?This is a coalition government. The SLFP is a party to it. The President, as the party leader, should decide on our stance and not the UNP,? he said.??(Kelum Bandara)

South Korea?s ex-leader jailed for 24 years for corruption
	
?
A South Korean court jailed former President Park Geun-hye for 24 years on Friday over a scandal that exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and the country?s conglomerates.
Park became South Korea?s first democratically elected leader to be forced from office last year when the Constitutional Court ordered her out over a scandal that landed the heads of two conglomerates in jail.
The court also fined Park, the daughter of a former military dictator, 18 billion won ($16.9 million) fine, after finding her guilty of charges including bribery, abuse of power and coercion.
?The defendant abused her presidential power entrusted by the people, and as a result, brought massive chaos to the order of state affairs and led to the impeachment of the president, which was unprecedented,? judge Kim Se-yoon said as he handed down the sentence.
The court ruled that Park colluded with her old friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive 23.1 billion won from major conglomerates including Samsung and Lotte to help Choi?s family and bankroll non-profit foundations owned by her.
Prosecutors sought a 30-year sentence and a 118.5 billion won ($112 million) fine for Park.
Park, 66, who has been in jail since March 31 last year, has denied wrongdoing and was not present in court.
