Brig. Priyanka fiasco: UK says taking the incident very seriously
	
A minister of the United Kingdom has spoken to Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana regarding the incident involving Sri Lankan Military Attache Brigadier Priyanka Fernando who displayed his shoulder flash bearing the national emblem to pro-LTTE protestors in London on February 4.
The Brigadier displayed this as a warning, during a demonstration on February 4 by LTTE activists in front of the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. The incident led to controversy, with pressure for removal of the Brigadier from office.
Against the backdrop, Spokesman of the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) Suren Surendiran wrote to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson asking for the naming of the Brigadier Persona Non-Grata (A person not allowed to stay in that country).
The Foreign Office, in response to the GTF, assured that the UK government was taking the incident seriously.
Subsequently, the Foreign Office made immediate representations to the Sri Lankan government, and the Minister for South Asia has personally spoken to Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana in this regard.
We have been left in no doubt that the Government of Sri Lanka also takes this incident very seriously. As the Minister explained to the House on February 20, the Government of Sri Lanka has ordered their Defence Attache to return to Colombo, while the incident is being thoroughly investigated, the UK Foreign Office wrote to Mr Surendiran.

Kuwait extends amnesty period until April 22
	
The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) yesterday said the Kuwait government had extended the general amnesty period for illegal expatriates in Kuwait until April 22.
The SLBFE in a statement said earlier that Kuwait had declared a general amnesty period from January 29 to February 22 for expatriates who did not possess residency permits and for those with expired residency permits, to rectify their status or leave the country.
The amnesty will permit illegal residents to leave the country during the amnesty period without paying penalties. Those who leave the country during this amnesty will be allowed to enter Kuwait again in a lawful manner, it said.
It said however, residency violators who were banned from travelling out of Kuwait or subjected to court cases were not eligible for this amnesty and they should visit the Residency Affairs Department to sort out their issues.
It also said if an illegal resident was caught during the amnesty period, such a person would be arrested and deported.
There are 15,447 Sri Lankans living illegally in Kuwait. Among them, as of now, more than 4000 Sri Lankans have registered with the embassy over there to leave the country, the SLBFE said in its statement. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SL reconciliation; Explore other avenues- Zeid to Member States
	
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called the Human Rights Council to continue to play a critical role in encouraging progress in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka and also calls on Member States to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction that could foster accountability.
In his report on "Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka" to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, which will be held from 26 February to 23 March 2018 in Geneva, the High Commissioner reiterated his appreciation for the constructive engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka with OHCHR and United Nations human rights mechanisms since January 2015.
However, as he noted in March 2017, this constructive collaboration must be accompanied by the implementation of key commitments. The fulfilment of the transitional justice commitments made under Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 has been virtually stalled for more than a year. Progress with some confidence-building measures has often been insufficient and inconclusive, and the structures set up to coordinate implementation have not consolidated enough or did not receive sufficient political support to move things forward, he noted.
Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 34/1, the report is an update on progress made in the implementation of resolution 30/1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka during the period from March 2017 to January 2018, in particular with regard to the Government's commitment to put in place transitional justice measures.
In the present update, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also looks at the general human rights situation in the country, including with respect to accountability.
In statements and reports issued since 2015, the High Commissioner, while expressing concern over the lack of progress on accountability and reforms, was encouraged by the positive improvement of the general human rights situation. However, 2017 was marked by intermittent inter-ethnic tensions and attacks on minorities which are unlikely to dissipate completely, the report said.
"While the Government has managed to steer many of these worrying events in a positive direction, this type of violence in a country that has experienced cycles of extreme violence roughly every 10 years is deeply troubling, particularly when accompanied by hate speech, misinformation and agitation through social media and political manipulation," the report emphasized.
The continuing allegations of torture and surveillance and the lack of sufficient progress in implementing critical confidence-building measures, such as the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the solution to the pending cases under the Act, have antagonized key constituencies that could be instrumental to the Government's reform efforts, he stated.

A national of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Ms. McCauley, was the loving mother of two sons.
"The United Nations Family will miss her dearly, especially her sense of humour, humility, passion, energy, and unwavering commitment to make lives better for all. Our deepest condolences are shared with her family," the UN team in Sri Lanka said.

Water in Kalu Ganga unfit for human consumption
	
The water in the Kalu Ganga was unfit for human consumption as it was mixed with sea water, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said yesterday.
It said the saltwater intrusion had taken place following the prevailing dry weather and had inconvenienced residents living along Kalu Ganga.
The NWSDB said the people in Wadduwa, Waskaduwa, Kalutara North, Nagoda, Bombuwala, Piliminawatte, Payagala, Maggona, Beruwela, Aluthgama, Dharga Town and Benthara, should abstain from drinking water from the Kalu Ganga but can use it for other purposes.
It said residents would be supplied with drinking water using water bowsers that would be kept in public places in those areas and requested the general public to consume water sparingly until the water in the Kalu Ganga recovers from its current state. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

WB praises Sri Lankan health service
	
The World Bank (WB) praised the public health service in Sri Lanka by saying that there are few if any other low or middle-income countries that have public health service like in Sri Lanka, simultaneously achieved strong health outcomes, good financial protection and low cost.
In a publication on universal health care study series titled Sri Lanka: Achieving Pro-Poor Universal Health Coverage without Health Financing Reforms, says that many countries are lauded for achieving two out of three, but few can claim to have done as well as Sri Lanka on all fronts, especially considering that it is still classified as a lower-middle income country.
Sri Lankas health system has a long track record of strong performance. For at least 50 years it has achieved much better outcomes in maternal and child health and infectious disease control than would have been predicted by its income level. Health financing indicators also indicate that the health system is both pro-poor and efficient, it said.
