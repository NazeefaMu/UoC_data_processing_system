Pray, thou shalt be served!
	
Five Blue Diyawanna members called on the new Big Boss at his official residence in Colombo the other day.
From Galle, Matara, Matale, Mahanuwara and Puttalam, they were among the Betel leaf members who campaigned hard for the former strongman at the January 8 Presidential poll and later formed the vanguard of the intra-party operation launched to promote him as the Prime Ministerial candidate. One of them was a hero who disdained a yahapalanaya Ministerial office in a show of solidarity with the former strongman.
The one time aggressive quintet, now a picture of subservience greeted the new Big Boss respectfully and explained to him the purpose of their visit. Sir, we had to campaign under the leadership of the former boss at the general election because we wanted to win. Please think of us also when making ministerial appointments
The new Big Boss who greeted their appeal with a guffaw said: Sorry, you have come a little too late.
Disappointment was clearly written on their faces as they bade adieu to the new Big Boss, they say.
However, their visit was not entirely in vain. Three of the five members were appointed Deputies later.

A lady in the running for city mayoralty
	
Now that the elections to the local bodies is round the corner, there is much speculation in political circles as to who would be the Green partys Mayoral candidate for the city.
According to our reports, two Green party stalwarts are already in the running for the Mayoral seat -- one is the incumbent Muzza and the other one is Rosy who failed to make it to Diyawanna at the recent general poll.
Despite there being miles to go before crossing the bridge, the duo, they say, have begun canvassing in earnest, each trying to get the better of the other.
Whether Colombo will get as its Mayor an ever-young beauty or the familiar Muzza is something time will tell.

A scramble for the hot seat!
	
There is a rumour making rounds in political circles these days that the chair of the main secretarial one at the countrys main office is about to fall vacant. 

The incumbent has already consented to serve as the countrys envoy in a cool clime somewhere Down Under.
The rumour has already triggered a big scramble for the hot seat. The most enterprising of all hopefuls is a white-collar one with close ties to powerful authorities, currently linked to public administration, they say.
However, the new Big Boss who is the appointing authority has already set his eye on a former GA hailing from the South, known for his integrity.

Amna Bank expands ATM network to Addalachenai and Maruthamunai
	
Amna Bank recently expanded its ATM network with the opening of two off-site ATMs on the same day in Addalachenai and Maruthamunai in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka.
With the addition of these two ATMs, Amna Banks ATM network has expanded to 26 ATMs, which includes 3 off-site ATMs in addition to the 24 branches the Bank has Island-wide.
Amna Banks Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer ceremonially opened the two ATMs located at New Shopping Complex, Pradeshiya Sabha Building, Addalachenai and Abdul Aziz & Sons Ceypetco Filling Station, 69A & 70 Main Street, Maruthamunai. 
Sharing his views on the two new ATMs, CEO Mohamed Azmeer said With these two new ATMs our customers in the Eastern Province will have greater access to withdraw their funds and will also give us the opportunity to expand the reach of our unique and people friendly concept of banking.
Having commenced banking operations only four years ago, Amna Bank has made strong strides in the competitive banking landscape in Sri Lanka. With a customer base of over 160,000 and growing, Amna Bank has introduced many initiatives to improve its accessibility including off-site ATMs, extended banking hours and Saturday banking.
Amna Bank is the first Licensed Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka to operate in complete harmony with the non-interest based Islamic banking model and is listed on the Diri Savi Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Fitch Ratings recently assigned the Bank a National Long Term Rating of BB(lka) with a Stable Outlook. The Bank was also recognized as the Worlds Best Up-and-Comer Islamic Bank by Global Finance Magazine at the 18th Annual Worlds Best Banks Award Ceremony 2014 held in Washington DC, USA.

CB sets maximum loan-to-value ratio on vehicles at 70%
	
In a bid to clamp down on the vehicle imports weighing on the countrys Balance of Payment (BOP) the Central Bank sent directions to all banks and finance companies imposing restrictions on loans and leases to vehicles.
The directive, which comes into effect from today (September 15), the regulator bars the commercial banks and finance companies granting loans and leases in excess of the 70 percent of the value of the vehicle.
This sets the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on vehicles at not more than 70 percent.
While the directive is by no means welcoming for the financial institutions as it could restrict growth in their leasing and vehicle lending books, which by far the driving force behind many of the financial institutions, this is a much-awaited measure to curb the menace being created by the unsustainable level of vehicle imports.
However, analysts opine the measure by the Central Bank is too  little, too late as it has already caused much damage to the economy and caste their doubts if the measure will in fact achieve the intended objectives.

Even at present, in most instances, the LTV for vehicles hovers around 70 to 80 percent level.
Therefore, they believe the government most likely will be compelled to increase the import duty on the vehicles either in the November budget or before.
Under these circumstances, according to currency dealers, the impact of capping the LTV on vehicles could achieve very little in terms of reducing the pressure on the rupee because seasonal imports are about to kick in from next month onwards.
Even today the Central Bank was seen intervening in the foreign currency market through the state banks as the rupee hit an all-time low of Rs.140 per US dollar.
Hence, unless the strong dollar flows by way of foreign direct investments materializes during the remainder of the year, the rupee will continue its slide and the BOP will most likely end in a huge deficit.
Last week the Central Bank decided to float the rupee when it realized it could no longer prop up the rupee by selling the countrys reserves.
Since the decision to float the currency, the rupee has fallen over 4 percent by now. 
Sri Lankas expenditure on vehicle imports during the first six months of 2015 virtually doubled to US $ 600 million.
Sri Lankas vehicle imports had been hitting record highs every month till July 2015.
In July, the number of registrations peaked to 62,221 units before it slowed down in August to 50,555 vehicles, largely due to fall in two-wheeler registrations.
Sri Lankas vehicle imports have become a bane socially as everyday road congestion creates mental trauma among the road users while the economic loss has already caused much pain to the countrys external account.

Fitch withdraws Ceylon Income Fund rating; CAM says funds assets of investment grade
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka yesterday withdrew Ceylon Income Funds (CIF) National Fund Credit Quality Rating of A(lka). CIM is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM).
Following the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka not renewing the licence of Lanka Rating Agency (LRA), in July 2015 Fitch placed the fund on rating watch negative.
Fitch said the proportion of the funds assets that used to be rated by LRA was 32 percent at 9 September 2015.
Fitch has withdrawn the rating due to insufficient information as assets previously rated by LRA are no longer monitored. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings for Ceylon Income Fund.
However CAM in a separate statement said the funds assets are of investment grade and the LRA suspension is beyond the control of the fund, the fund manger and the underlying listed company. 
The assets of the fund continue to be listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), despite the LRA suspension by the SEC. Under the CSE listing rules it is mandatory for listed debentures to have a valid rating in order to be listed on the CSE.
Ceylon Asset Management assures investors of the Ceylon Income Fund that the fund continues to invest in investment grade securities that are listed in the CSE, the CAM statement said.
Fitch continues to rate the Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (BB-/V5), which is managed by CAM.

The former strongmans stock reply to all these inquisitive ones had been that he was not prepared to accept such office. What Committee Chair for me who occupied the highest chair in the country for 10 years at a stretch! Dont they know that I declined even when the main chair in the opposition was offered to me  he had asked.

He reveals his true colours the first day itself!
	
It is a well-known secret that this particular Blue party stalwart who once briefly occupied the main chair in the opposition expected a key portfolio of his choice, but finally he had to settle for one with a single subject connected to roads.
However, this Blue stalwart had called at his new office the same day he was sworn in. And the activists of the trade unions affiliated to the two main political parties had decorated the Ministry premises in both Blue and Green in anticipation of the visit of the new Ministerial one. 
On arrival at his new office, the Ministerial one observed that Green was more conspicuous than Blue and that got his goat. He ordered that all Green pennants and streamers be removed immediately leaving only the Blue decorations.
Thereafter, he ordered the Green party trade unionists to leave the premises and asked the Blue party counterparts to present their pressing problems to him. He made critical remarks about his predecessor and also pulled up the secretarial one present on the occasion before leaving the office, they say.
Meanwhile, the Green trade unionists who were chased away had made a beeline to the Green party headquarters where they had planned to stage a protest against the shabby treatment meted out to them.
However, the former Ministerial one who rushed to the scene had with great difficulty dissuaded the TU activists from taking any rash action that could cause embarrassment to the yahapalanya administration.

In a situation where many Betel leaf Diyawanna members were in a mad scramble for portfolios, the new Big Boss found selecting a few suitable persons from among them for Ministerial office a challenging exercise. 
However, there was one particular Diyawanna member whom he wanted to honour with a key portfolio whether the latter asked for it or not. His special choice was none other than the former Chair of the Diyawanna House, who remained simple and unassuming even in those days when his younger sibling was the uncrowned king in the country.
So the new Big Boss had invited the elder sibling to take over the Irrigation portfolio in the new Cabinet. The response he got from the simple sibling was something the new Big Boss had hardly expected. Thank you very much for your kind offer, the former Chair had replied. We are now old people. Why dont you offer this portfolio to a young member keen on getting a portfolio
The new Big Boss had then appealed to the former Chair to at least preside over the District Development Committee when it is formed.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today an Act of Indemnity (AoI) would be presented in parliament as a private member's motion in case the OHCHR report calls for war crimes charges to be levelled against security forces personnel.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report on Sri Lanka will be published tomorrow. If the report calls for war crimes charges to be levelled against our war heroes, we will present an Indemnity Act in parliament to provide them legal immunity, he told a news conference.
Mr. Gammanpila said an Act of Indemnity was presented by the British Parliament in 1700s to prevent government officials from being questioned in case they had taken measures to protect the country and to maintain law and order.
"South Africa and Bangladesh has also adopted such an Act to protect their officials," he said.
This Act is not something new. Even Sri Lanka has implemented it at least thrice to protect our officials. Once it was brought in 1915 by the State Council with regard to the Sinhala, Muslim riots and twice by UNP governments to protect officials from being questioned for any action taken during the 1977 and 1987 riots."
Mr. Gammanpila asked security forces personnel to remain calm and assured that the PHU's Ranaviru Legal Aid Foundation was ready to protect them. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pan Asia Bank in green lending push
	
	Completes US $ 20mn funding from Europe based financier
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (Pan Asia Bank) in its mission to contribute towards helping to create a climate-friendly economy has embarked on a green lending drive to fund small, medium and large scale renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, according to a senior official of the bank.
To this end, the bank has completed a funding arrangement with the Europe based green financier, the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) to obtain a refinancing facility of US $ 20 million (Rs.2.8 billion) for green lending activities.
In view of our strong balance sheet and also proven ability to focus on funding small, medium and large scale green projects, they (GCPF) have indicated willingness even to commit much larger refinancing facilities to us (Pan Asia Bank), said the Deputy General Manager, Treasury, Richie Dias. 
As a responsible corporate citizen, the bank is of the belief that they can make a significant contribution to reduce the negative impact on the environment through its green lending activities.
Apart from that, the green lending drive is also expected help assist the government to achieve its national energy objective of increasing the share of renewable energy up to 20 percent of the energy portfolio by 2020 based on power generation.
Based on the Ceylon Electricity Boards power generation statistics for 2014, the renewable energy sources, barring hydro power contributed just below10 percent to the total national energy mix.
The bank has been working with the Sri Lankas apex government agency for renewable energy, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, the private sector energy producers and other stakeholders to identify and promote financing for such renewable energy generation projects.Foray in to larger greenenergy financing
According to Dias the bank is now fully geared to fund larger renewable energy projects and few such hydro power promoters are already in discussion with the bank to secure funding.
Feasibility studies have already been carried out and the bank is in the verge of disbursing funds for the identified projects.
In recent times, the private sector power producers in the country have shown strong keenness in investing on generating renewable energy and many small and large corporates have announced their foray in to renewable energy generation projects.Diversifying green portfolio
Pan Asia Bank was a pioneer in introducing green lending in Sri Lanka when they commenced offering preferential rates for hybrid leasing in 2013. Expanding their mission to further reduce Sri Lankas carbon emissions, Pan Asia Bank has now diversified its green lending portfolio in to areas such as solar, wind and hydro power generation.
According to Dias, any energy saving project or a trade which minimizes the carbon foot print significantly, could now apply for facilities under this loan scheme.
When we initially started green lending few years ago, the biggest challenge we had was to design products which are in line with green concept and to educate the market on the availability of green financing because this was something new to this market back then. Today the hybrid market is matured but the renewable energy generation financing market is still in its infancy. So, now we are looking at diversifying our portfolio in to these areas which have a significant potential, he added. 
The success of Pan Asia Banks hybrid leasing product can be attributed to the preferential interest rates offered as well as the fuel efficiency of the vehicles themselves.
According to GCPF, the annual CO2 reduction for Pan Asia Banks hybrid car portfolio is estimated to have come down significantly. Borrowers are at ease
One significant benefit that the borrowers receive from green lending is the lower interest rates that they can enjoy compared to conventional borrowing. This special benefit is offered in view of the fact that funds are expected to be used in environmentally friendly projects which have minimum environmental impact.
Meanwhile the borrowers also have the option of choosing between fixed rates and floating rate depending on their risk appetite.
The bank hedges the foreign exchange risk in obtaining refinancing from the GCPF in order to be safeguarded from any fluctuations of the foreign exchange rate.
This is a prerogative available only for licensed commercial banks. Therefore if any corporate looks to fund its green project in foreign currency, it is advisable for them to borrow through us because we only can hedge the foreign exchange risk, Dias remarked.Strong investor confidence
The continuous willingness and commitment from globally acclaimed funding agencies such as of GCPF to provide financing to Pan Asia Bank is clear indication of the the foreign investor confidence placed on Pan Asia Bank, Dias said.
Pan Asia Bank was the first to receive a funding line from the GCPF in the whole of South East Asia among a host of other banks, he further said.
Among the institutions backing the GCPF fund are the World Banks private sector financing arm, The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the German Federal Governments Development Bank, KfW Bankengruppe and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.
We are currently negotiating to further extending our relationship and we are confident that we can secure more funds for furthering our green lending initiatives, Dias added.
Currently the bank is also designing an Environment and Social Policy and a Management System benchmarked to the international best practices. Once operational from the end of this year, the bank is expected to evaluate the environmental and social impact of its lending portfolio more accurately.
Being true to its ethos of driving sustainability, the bank recently converted lighting at its head office in to an energy saving, high efficient LED lighting system.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, Pan Asia Bank posted an after tax profit of Rs.451 million recording a growth of 156 percent from the same period last year.
During the same period the bank expanded its loans and receivables by as much as 14 percent to Rs.72 billion and operates with an asset base exceeding Rs.85 billion.

They expected thanks, but got a harangue!
	
Soon after the August 17 general election Mangi called a special meeting of the village-level party organizers.
These organizers naturally expected a big Thank you from their leader, but what they got was a searing harangue from him.
The way we campaigned putting our full strength into it, I thought I could easily top the preference list. But Puncha beat me again! Mangi said. Now he faced the organizers no longer concealing his anger: What on earth were you doing when you were supposed to be campaigning for me
Have all those chaps who came here begging for my help to get some job or other voted for me he asked again.
All party activists quietly listened to Mangi and none of them ventured an answer to any of his questions.  
The brainy Puncha who heard what had transpired at the meeting had remarked with a sardonic smile: This is good news. I hope better news is on the way!

Patience is a virtue: UN on Sri Lanka
	
	The United Nations remained tight lipped on the contents of the report on war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka and on the UN stance on the mechanism to be adopted in addressing the issues.
	Responding to a question posed by a journalist during the daily media briefing at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Monday afternoon, Secretary General's Spokesman Stphane Dujarric asked for patience.
	The report will be out on Wednesday. We will have more to say on that day, he said.
	The OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka was based on a US-sponsored resolution approved at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions held last year.
	The UN also remained non-committal on the mechanism to be set up to address the issues raised in the report.
	I think the Secretary-General's position on that has been expressed in the past Mr. Dujarric said without reference to the shift in the political environment in Sri Lanka.
	Earlier, several countries led by the United States called for an independent investigation into allegations of war crimes allegedly committed during the final phase of a bloody civil war which lasted 30 years.
	The report is to be submitted in the backdrop of a shift in the political atmosphere in the country following the shock defeat of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in January this year.
	The calls for an international investigation were heavily resisted by the former regime led by Mr. Rajapaksa. The nationalist Rajapaksa-led government, was opposed to any western interference into the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
	The stance resulted in successive resolutions and soft economic sanctions imposed on the country.
	The United States have sponsored successive resolutions at the United Nations Human Right Council (UNHCR) calling the government to address the allegations through a credible mechanism.
	However, the US softened its stance following the change of government during the presidential elections and the subsequent parliamentary election in which the pro-western United National Party (UNP) emerged victorious.
	Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Nisha Desai Biswal during a visit last month to Sri Lanka said that it supported an Internal mechanism to address the allegations.
	The report was to be submitted in March 2015 but was deferred following the change in the political climate in Sri Lanka.
	The UN Human Rights Chief in February said the deferral was due to the changing context in Sri Lanka, and the possibility that important new information might emerge which would strengthen the report". (Hafeel Farisz in New York)

When manape rivalry enters through the door, kinship flees through the window!
	
A scrap between two former Ministerial ones from Sabaragamuwa, a fair one and a dark one (in a literary sense) had created a sensational diversion at the Blue party convention held in Polonnaruwa.
The former Ministerial duo, incidentally close relatives, had fallen out over manape at the recent general poll. However, the immediate cause for the verbal war between them was some issue related to the portfolios they were to get in the new government.
The dark one, generally mild-mannered and soft-spoken, had wanted to call it quits at the initial stage of the heated exchange, but the fair one, normally belligerent and garrulous, had harangued the dark one non-stop throwing restraint and modesty to the four winds.
The fair one was at her vocal best both in sound and fury when an irate former Blue party secretarial one warned her to shut up. This stern order had produced an immediate effect for the belligerent fair one had quietly returned to her seat.
