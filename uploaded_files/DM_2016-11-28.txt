A FAREWELL TO FIDEL: THE LAST OF THE EPIC HEROES
	
Fidel was the last of the epic heroes. Whatever our travails, our generation and the ones before us were fortunate to live in the decades in which there were great leaders, visionaries who combined their ideal with action and changed the world they inherited. Our generation and one, perhaps two before that, lived consciously in the twentieth century which was inhabited by such heroes. My own generation lived at the time of Mao, Ho Chi Minh, Tito, Fidel and Che Guevara. We were lucky to have read of and watched these Homeric heroes as they fought colossal enemies against incredible odds; led and changed reality and became legend. 
With Fidel gone we are almost at the end of an age, perhaps a cycle of Historythe age of modern heroism, but with a continuity going back millennia to the dawn of the hero. I say almost because the Moncada and Granma generation is not dead, the companeros of Fidel and Che, namely Raul and Ramiro Valdez, are still alive and active, as are Fidels Latin American political sons such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Salvador Sanchez of El Salvador. 
It was almost sixty years ago (Dec 2, 1956) that Fidel, Che and Raul landed on the shores of Cuba in the leaky yacht Granma, to start the revolutionary guerrilla war that led to victory two and a half years later. 
One would expect that it would be fairly easy for someone such as myself who has authored a book on Fidel, published in the UK/ US, to write a short article on him, but it is actually quite difficult. There is so much to say about Fidel because he did so much, tried to do so much, and meant so much to so many of us, that it is difficult to isolate just a few aspects or points for a short reflection. 
There will be a huge sense of irreplaceable loss most palpably in Cuba and the whole of Latin America, but it will range wider, throughout the Global South and even in the First World. No country will be untouched. Before Fidel, Cuba was the playground of American gangsters and gamblers, as depicted in so many movies, most memorably Godfather II. After Fidel and because of Fidel, a vote in the United Nations every year for the last quarter century against the embargo imposed by the USA won near unanimity. Fidel gave Cuba dignity as a nation and respect throughout the world, even in the ranks of his enemies. 
In his The Rebel, Albert Camus drew a distinction between a revolutionary, who was one who used unlimited violence to change the whole system and a rebel, who used limited and selective violence to oppose wrongs and injustice. Camus opted for the rebel over the revolutionary. Fidel was a rebel and a revolutionary. He opted for revolutionary war to overthrow a system and build a new one but his use of violence was selective and discriminatory in the best sense. 
Fidel also transcended another seemingly unbridgeable gap. He was a revolutionary as well as a statesman. He led a revolution and supported, defended and inspired others, but he also piloted the Cuban state through the most dreadful dangers and against the worst odds. Che Guevara refered to Fidels leadership which he said no one could have matched, during the sad and luminous days of the Cuban Missile Crisis where it lived under the shadow of a US military invasion and perhaps global nuclear war, but did so unflinchingly, unblinkingly. 
Fidel was a patriot, steeped in the Cuban national spirit and heritage, while also being an internationalist on a grand scale. Mere months after the victory of the Cuban revolution he sent tanks to defend Algeria which had just achieved its liberation.
Nelson Mandela went on the record to credit Cuba with the decisive role of defeating the powerful (nuclear armed) South African military in the battle of Cuito Cuenevale in Angola in 1988, which shattered the myth of white South African military invincibility and opened the prison door for Mandela and a negotiated end to apartheid in South Africa. Fidel personally oversaw the Angolan campaign from across the Atlantic. 
Angola also shed light on what I was the first to identify in the academic literature as Fidels greatest single contribution, namely his evolution and practised of a humane and humanitarian ethics of violence. Three hundred and fifty thousand Cuban volunteers rotated in and out of Angola over twelve years of war and there was not a single allegation of atrocities against them in the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, even by the United States. Just as the Catholic saints Ambrose, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas evolved and codified the Just War theory for rulers and states, Fidel, who had a Jesuit education and formation, practiced and developed Just War in both anti-state liberation struggle as well as when he led the Cuban state in fighting against domestic terrorism and imperialist oppression throughout the world. 
Fidel stood for independence, Fidel felt it was necessary to fight for the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation state as a bulwark against imperialist domination and state segmentation (as in Yugoslavia). 
Fidel Castro was an anti-imperialist who was never a fanatic. He always combined his anti-imperialism with a sense of the welfare of humanity and the planet as a whole, and he put forward proposals for global structural reform which could ensure the welfare of all. While a militant anti-imperialist he was not an advocate of war for the sake of war, polarization and radicalization. 
From his earliest interview with Herbert Mathews of the New York Times while fighting in the Sierra Maestra mountains, to the famous, almost seductively cinematic mid-1970s interviews with Barbara Walters, to the documentaries by Vietnam war veteran and famous Hollywood filmmaker Oliver Stone, Fidel always reached out to the American public. He was Cubas best lobbyist, simply by charm of personality and force of argumentation. 
Thus Fidel was the great synthesizer or was himself the great synthesis, fusing factors and attributes that were regarded as unbridgeable antinomies. Fidel taught us all, a way to be. The way of the fighter, the warrior, the hero. Fidel was, to borrow the title of Brazilian author Paul Coelhos book, a great Warrior of Light. But his was not merely or primarily a martial heroism. Fidel Castro was a global guerrilla commander, the commander-in-chief, in the battle of ideas. 
Looking back on my life as one who was lucky enough to have been born in the year, the month and around the time that Fidel, Raul and Che were landing on the shores of Cuba in the Granma, I am glad to have been able to make a modest contribution to the theoretical comprehension of Fidels contribution. TeleSUR, the Venezuela based Latin American TV station interviewed me on Fidels 90th birthday this last August and interviewer Naomi Cohen summarized my perspective as follows: The liberation fighter loyal to Fidels teachings can ultimately overcome and vanquish imperialism through weapons of ethics and morality. I told her in that interview that Fidel proves that you can fight without losing your soul. Even if you lose militarily, you win morally and eventually politically. Fidel has universal value wherever people and movements are struggling. I also explained that it is not merely a Latin American phenomenon, still less a merely Cuban phenomenon, still less a 20th century phenomenon. Fidel has contributed to universal values. 
Naomi Cohens TeleSUR interview with me included the following idea from my book on the Moral Dimension of the Political Thought of Fidel Castro:According to Fidels logic, the liberation and revolutionary fighter must exercise conscious restraint, writes Jayatilleka in Fidels Ethics of Violence while simultaneously drawing on a moral philosophy that does not rest on culturally specific and circumscribed notions (such as those that inform many jihadist groups) or claims of self-evident (actually, self-referential) systemic superiority, as is the case of western imperialist states. Instead, Fidel calls for an ethics that springs from the wellsprings of modernity and universalism but stands for an alternative modernity. 


The Latin American progressive audience apart, my theorizing of Fidels singular contribution made its way into rigorous western scholarship and will now be engaged with by every serious student of Castro.Nick Hewlett, D.Litt, author of a book on the French philosophers Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere (Bloomsbury 2007) has just put out his volume Blood and Progress:Violence in Pursuit of Emancipation(Univ. of Edinburgh Press, 2016) in which he has a Chapter on Fidel Castro which concludes: 
Most importantly, for our purposes, Castro is deeply reflective on the ethics of violence in revolt and offers the most developed morality in relation to violence in pursuit of emancipation of any revolutionary leader. We might say that Castro and the practice of the Cuban revolution offer the spirit with which we should approach the question of violence in revolt, which promotes the importance of the life and well being of all human beings, with the regretful acknowledgement that fighting and loss of life in pursuit of a substantially more just and less exploitative society is sometimes necessary. This is, at the very least, a highly inspiring way to approach the question. 
Prof Hewlett summarizes what I concluded was Fidels abiding contribution, in my book on Fidel: 
In an insightful study, Dayan Jayatilleka (2007) examines Castros ethics of violence, suggesting that the Cuban leader resolved the disagreement between Sartre and Camus regarding violence and morality, namely where Sartre was critical of Camus for Camuss disapproval of the violence of the oppressed. Castros main contribution to Marxism, Jayatilleka argues, is the way in which he introduces an ethical and moral dimension. Jayatilleka suggests there are three possible approaches to violence: by those who contend that violence is always wrong, by those who defend it if it is in pursuit of a just end, and by those who argue that not only should the end be a worthy one but that the means of achieving this end must be subjected to ethical scrutiny. It is this last position which he argues is the correct one and the one which Castro embraces. Jayatilleka argues convincingly that neither Sorel nor Fanon nor Sartre: 
went beyond the understanding of the effect of dehumanization of the violence of the oppressor on the oppressed and the effect of humanization on the oppressed of the exercise of counter-violence, to an understanding of the effect of dehumanization of violence on the oppressed (which the Gandhians and other pacifists understood), when used by them without limits. There is no dialectical understanding of the violence of the oppressed, encompassing its contradictory aspects, both liberating and dehumanizing... 
Winston Churchills famous lines of praise for the RAF flyers applies, with slight modification, several times over to Cuba and Fidel Castro: never in the field of human conflict and contemporary history have so many owed so much to one country and one man.

Attack on media: Dangerous trend by Govt.: JVP
	
The present government has set in motion a dangerous trend by threatening and attacking the media, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament today.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had resorted to such threats.
Mr. Dissanayake said the recent statement by President Sirisena that front pages of newspapers were destroying the country was on such example. The rulers are the ones who are destroying the country," he said adding that the statement made by Mr Wickremesinghe on July 23 that the Daily Mirror Editor would be taught a good lesson also amounted to an indirect threat.
Mr. Dissanayake said there were issues pertaining to ethics in media institutions and journalists but there were ways to criticize them.
He spoke on behalf of the journalists saying their salaries should be increased and described the incidents of killing, abducting and assaulting journalists as those which had taken place during a 'black decade'. (Yohan Perera)

The supplementary estimate presented in Parliament on Saturday seeking Rs. 790 million as expenditures for vehicles and foreign tours showed the Government was suffering from a vehicle mania (Ratha Gaya) and a foreign tour mania (Rata Gaya), the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said it was acceptable to present a Supplementary Estimate to cover up essential expenditures such as salaries, fuel and extra allowances but it was absurd to present one to purchase vehicles, furniture and to pay for foreign tours of the Government MPs.
Ministers should clarify as to why they cant utilize the furniture and vehicles they have till the end of the year. If the allocations for foreign tours have been drained, embassies could be used to execute a specific task, he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lankan jumbo's life in danger in a Pakistani Zoo
	
Now that winter has set in, the management of the Marghazar Zoo is worried about the fate of Kaavan, the lone elephant, who requires special arrangements during the winter months. Kaavan belongs to Sri Lanka, where the temperature does not drop below zero degrees Celsius.
A letter has been moved to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to hand over the services of the elephants caretaker, currently working in the human resources department, to someone else, to ensure that the elephant remains safe and sound during the winter.
CDA Member Administration Mohammad Suleyman Khan Warraich told Dawn that because of the current caretakers behaviour, he had been trying to hand over the elephant to the Lahore zoo.
Kaavans partner, an elephant named Saheli, died in April 2012, and Kaavan has remained in the national and international news since due to a lack of facilities for him.
According to a letter written by Zoo Director Mohammad Irshad, available with Dawn, CDAs management have been informed that although several zoos have been contacted for a qualified and experienced caretaker who can handle the aggressive male elephant, they have been unable to find one. The authority was also told that efforts are underway to hire an experienced caretaker on a contractual basis, to end the monopoly of the current caretaker.
As the winter season has started and we must make the arrangements to protect the elephant from severe cold weather as per prevailing Standard Operating Procedure. If agreed, we may therefore transfer back Mr Muhammad Bilal, head Mahawat to Zoo and a separate case be initiated for the engagement of new Mohawat on contract basis as per availability, the letter states.
A zoo official who was not authorised to speak on the record said problems were exacerbated because of the availability of the caretaker.
He added: Each year a proper fencing and arrangement is done to keep the animal safe from the cold, which could not be done this year. Moreover, there is no proper arrangement to clean areas, as it is difficult to control the animal. We fear the animal will fall sick and meet the fate of the female elephant.
Mr Warraich of the CDA said there were two brothers who did not train Kaavan properly, because of which it was decided to send one of them to the human resource department.
I went to the zoo with my family and they demanded money from me. When I informed them that I am the member administration, the mahawat said he only takes money if someone willingly gives it to him, he said.
I am aware that problems for the animals will increase in the winter, so I have been making an effort to send Kaavan to the Lahore zoo. Once the arrangements are completed for the animal in Islamabad, the elephant will be brought back.
In response to a question, Mr Warraich said if the Lahore zoo refuses to accept Kaavan, he will look for other options to ensure the elephant is provided facilities. (dawn)

Lend Us Your Ears to Help Hearing Impaired Children
	
The Centre for Education of Hearing Impaired Children Centre (CEHIC) which during the past few decades has trained hundreds of hearing impaired children to move into the mainstream of education and employmentis making an urgent appeal for funds from well-wishers to continue this noble mission.
or the past few months the Dalugama based multi-religious centre has run out of funds even to pay the salaries of teachers and other staff and to maintain basic facilities. In an appeal on behalf of the hearing impaired children, CEHIC is appealing to you to join the Donor Club of benefactors by donating Rs. 1000/- (One Thousand Rupees) at least per month by Bank Standing Order for the purpose of running the Centre situated at Lumbini Mawatha, Dalugama, Kelaniya. Tel: 2910623 
The appeal state, at the CEHIC, children who are ignored and marginalized as deaf and dumb are educated and trained using the Auditory  Verbal Method to hear and speak from the youngest pre-school age so that the child enter the mainstream of education. 
The CEHIC bases its work with hearing impaired children on five principal areas- 

"The driving force of CEHIC is the hope it instills in every hearing impaired child that they too have a positive future as equal partners with every other member of society in building a just, prosperous and peaceful Sri Lanka"

1) The use of the Auditory Verbal Method of Education (and not sign language). 
2) The morning Pre School education programme which sets the deaf children and their families on the path of becoming creative and full members of our society from the earliest age. 
3) INTEGRATION into the mainstream educational system in Sri Lanka at the school-going age and conducting extra daily classes in the afternoons in the key subjects of the national curriculum for the integrated children from YEAR ONE To YEAR 13 (University entrance) 
4) Providing a holistic education which includes training in music, dancing, arts and craft , home science, sewing, woodwork, pottery, gymnastics, sports, etc. and 
5) Making the parental involvement in the childs early education a central pillar of the CEHIC programme. One parent accompanies their child every day, sits in the classroom alongside the child and learns the techniques and processes which are continued in the home. Thus the school becomes the home and the home becomes the school. 
Today over 600 of our children are studying in regular schools throughout Sri Lanka. The oldest group of past pupils from CEHIC are now young adults and are facing life in the real world with all its challenges. Those who have the ability are encouraged to go into higher education and some have entered university and obtained degrees. Six of our past pupils have graduated from universities in Sri Lanka and two are currently completing their first degrees. For those who wish to enter the world of work, CEHIC is now planning to develop its Vocational Training and Aftercare Centre. The centre has a full-time complement of teachers, administrative and minor staff and also part-time teachers. 
The driving force of CEHIC is the hope it instills in every hearing impaired child that they too have a positive future as equal partners with every other member of society in building a just, prosperous and peaceful Sri Lanka. 
Would you not like to be part of this miracle 
From our founding in 1982 we have been helped financially to find our running costs through the generosity of donor institutions, private individuals, friends and well-wishers both here and aboard. However these donations are not continuous and we have to keep seeking funds from month to month for our day-to-day expenses training of teachers. 
We are committed to continue providing this very special, very expensive and time-consuming education. 
Free of Charge 
This is because we are convinced that charging fees from the children would exclude the very poor from our services. We need to find more than Rs. 450,000 per month for our running costs. The donations will be exempted from taxes. If you agree to join this DONOR Club, please be kind enough to contact the centre at the following email addresses :- info@cehic.lk, gretanewlyn@gmail.com, aloypsj@gmail.com, robertcusz@yahoo.co.uk 
You can complete and hand in a Standing Order from at your bank, or let us know the name of your bank and we will collect the form and bring it to you from completion and your signature and if you so wish, take the signed from to your bank ourselves. 
Be assured that these children who will benefit from your generosity will bring abundant blessings to you, your family and your work,. 
The CEHIC trustees are Ven. V. Kusaladhamma Nayake Thera, Rev. Sr. Greta Nalawatta, Prof. Sarath Amunugama and Rev. Fr. Aloysius Peieris s.j.

MPs allowances to double soon
	
The Government was mulling an increase the office rent allowance up to Rs. 100, 000 per month each on offices maintained by 225 Members of Parliament.
The allowance for attending Parliament, which was now Rs. 500 would also be increased to Rs.2,500 for days of their attendance to Parliament meetings.
The new move has been introduced, instead of the earlier move to pay Rs.75, 000 as office rent allowance and Rs.5,000 attendance allowance for committee meetings.
The new move is due to be presented in Parliament soon by the Ministry of Parliament Affairs, it is learnt. The relevant Cabinet Memorandum had been signed by the minister on Friday according to the sources.
Accordingly a Parliamentarian is entitled for a total allowance Rs 20,000 per month on eight days attendance in Parliament meetings.
It is also learned that steps were being taken to increase insurance coverage offered to an MP and already negotiations have begun with an Australian Insurance Company.
When inquired about the decision to increase the MPs allowances, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said the matter was now being considered and a decision would be taken next week about presenting it to the Cabinet.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)

MPs given Rs.100,000 to help constituents: PM
	
The monthly payment of Rs.100,000 to be given to each MP is not a take-home allowance but one which will be used to help the people in their constituencies, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
He said this allowance would be given to MPs for giving gifts to the people in their constituencies.
"MPs are usually invited to weddings in their constituencies. They attend funerals as well. The proposed allowance is to be used for giving wedding gifts and making donations for funerals," the Prime Minister said.
He emphasized the fact of there being a need to increase the salaries of MPs.
"The Daily Mirror has published the story about the payment of Rs.100,000 to the MPs. Its editor and the others had requested for a pay hike last year. There is no issue when their salaries are increased, but give the impression that it is wrong to increase the salaries of MPs," the Prime Minister said.
"These newspapers encourage extremism and hit out at me because I am not an extremist."
He also responded to a comment made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake, who said the Prime Minister had threatened the Daily Mirror on several occasions.
The Prime Minister said he would not hesitate to hit out at the media if they hit out at him.
"I cannot attack the Wijeya Newspapers or burn the press. These are properties that belong to my uncle. Sirasa belongs to my one-time friend Kili Maharajah who has attacked me several times but did I burn it" he asked.
"I will only hit back verbally if the media hits me and will never go beyond a verbal retort," (Yohan Perera)

Along with the Hambantota Port, the government has decided to sell off the airport under what it called a debt to equity swap. The debt component, obtained by the Government of Sri Lanka for the construction of the airport at that time, is to be absorbed by the company that buys it.
According to a report submitted to the Cabinet, the government has informed the Chinese government that it cannot agree to the conditions laid down by its nominee to develop the airport.

SL, 46 countries moving to fossil free energy
	
Sri Lanka and 46 other countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives, which represent the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) had discussed the need to skip fossil fuel stage and move directly on to green energy, the Independent reported.
The article published on the Independent on Saturday said the CVF countries had used the UN Climate Change Conference held at Marrakech in Morocco earlier this month to discuss how they would skip the fossil fuel stage.
The meeting was convened to discuss ways each country would meet the fossil fuel reduction targets which had previously been agreed at the 2015 Paris conference.
For the industrial nations of the world, the focus was how to turn coal-based economies into green ones. But for many nations who have yet to fully industrialise this is not a problem.
Members of the CVF are some of the poorest nations on earth and they are also amongst the countries most vulnerable to effects of climate change.
Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Congo, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Fiji, Ghana, Gambia, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, Kenya, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lebanon, Saint Lucia, Sri Lanka and Morocco are some of the member countries of the CVF.
According to Science Alert this is known as 'leap-frogging' in economics. For instance this already happens in developing countries which leapfrog the stage in which landline telephones are installed, and citizens' first phones are mobile phones.
The CVF intends to apply this to their fuel usage. What the CVF call 'the Marrakech Vision', is hoping to meet 100 per cent domestic renewable energy production as rapidly as possible, while working to end energy poverty and protect water and food security, taking into consideration national circumstances.
The goals will be reassessed in 2020.

Top brewer says Lankans now consume more hard liquor and toddy
	
The rashness demonstrated by the new regime in making tax policies has not only made the business of brewing tougher than ever but also pushed the people towards hard liquor, which is arguably more detrimental to health.
According to the countrys top brewer, Lion Brewery Ceylon PLC (LION), the alcohol industry has now been made liable for not just the higher excise duty, which was raised back in October 2014, but also for the higher value-added tax (VAT), which came into effect from November 1, 2016, making the total tax increase on beer up to 70 percent compared to the 25 percent increase in taxes on spirits.
The beer industry  to a degree greater than the others in the alcohol sector  has been at the receiving end of this type of ad hoc and incomprehensible policymaking for many years.
With the advent of this government, we hoped things would change and that a more rational approach would prevail.
Unfortunately, this has not been the case and today Sri Lankans consume a significantly greater amount of hard alcohol than they did two years ago, the company said in a note to its interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange recently.
This irrational tax policy by the government appears to have pushed the people to consume more spirits and toddy, while the consumption of beer has reduced by 39 percent. But the consumption of spirits has increased by 9 percent during the same period.
Alcohol consumption in a country could go up either if the population is extremely happy or they have been made extremely poor. While the former condition mostly drives the demand for formal liquor and a milder version of alcohol such as beer, the latter condition could drive the demand for illicit liquor or moonshine.
Therefore, excessive taxing of the formal alcohol industry could in fact boomerang on the government both economically and socially. But successive governments milked both the tobacco and alcohol industries whenever they found their exchequers depleted. 
But analysts point out that this strategy could become futile as the demand will not remain inelastic forever.
