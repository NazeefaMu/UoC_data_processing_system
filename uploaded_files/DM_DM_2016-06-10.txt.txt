Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave instructions to the treasury yesterday not to grant even a cent for the importation of vehicles for ministers and MPs until funds were allocated to build houses to replace those destroyed by the floods and the blast at Kosgama, and to renovate the partly destroyed houses.
He gave this order in accordance with the governments primary policy (in the Yahapalanaya), which is to provide relief to the people.
It was further stated in the prime ministers directive to first calculate the sum required to provide relief to the affected people and that, until this exercise is complete, the treasury should under no circumstances make allocations for the purchase of vehicles for ministers and MPs.
Accordingly, the supplementary estimate to purchase vehicles will be suspended until the requisite funds are allocated to provide assistance to construct houses to replace the destroyed ones and to repair the damaged ones. (Anjula Maheeka Weeraratne)

India imposes 45-day fishing ban on TN fishermen in SL waters
	
The Indian Government has suspended fishing by Tamil Nadu fishermen in Sri Lankan territorial waters for 45 days, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said the Sri Lankan Government would request New Delhi to extend the fishing ban to prevent poaching by South Indian fishermen.
The minister said he would visit New Delhi shortly to convince Indian authorities the importance of continuing the ban because Sri Lanka incurred losses of up to Rs.5,400 million annually because of the illegal fishing by South Indian fishermen who violate Sri Lanka's International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and in the process destroy marine life.
A Sri Lankan fisherman is said to lose between Rs.2 and Rs.4 million annually.
Studies conducted by the Fisheries Ministry has found that South Indian fishermen catch 312,000 metric tonnes of fish annually. The Tamil Nadu Government of Jayalalitha never listens to our requests not to let her fishermen to engage in Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in Sri Lankas territorial waters as the illegal business is carried out by the politicians of her state government, the minister said.
He said the government had arrested 2,313 South Indian fishermen in 2015 and 2016 and taken into custody 460 fishing craft. The fishermen will be released after producing them in courts but the fishing craft will be confiscated.
The minister said the illegal fishing has affected the livelihood of fishermen in the districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Puttalam and Mannar.
He expressed his gratitude to the Indian Central Government for banning fishing in Sri Lankas waters and preventing Tamil Nadu fishermen from leaving South Indian Ports to poach in Sri Lankan waters. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

MRs absence: Clear sign of Govts deal with Rajapaksas
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the Governments deal with the Rajapaksas was clear when former president Mahinda Rajapaksa kept away from yesterdays voting on the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said the investigations against the Rajapaksas were going on at snails pace because of these deals with the Rajapaksas.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa had not singed the no-confidence motion either.
Mr. Rajapaksa should have voted against the no-confidence motion but he evaded it just as he did during the vote on the budget. Though he criticizes the actions of the government, Mr. Herath said.
He said even though Mr. Karunanayake was able to defeat the no-confidence motion, the people would not stop protesting against him.
Mr. Herath said the JVPs vote in favour of the motion did not mean that it had aligned itself with any other party and that the vote was a protest against the government,which is leading the country into an economic crisis. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Tense situation in Barnes Place, Colombo 07
	
A tense situation prevailed at Barnes Place in Colombo 7 between a group of people and the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) officers when they had attempted to demolish some 26 houses.
Though two bulldozers were brought in by the CMC the protest had halted any work being done.
The people who claimed to be the previous owners said they were forced to vacate their homes in 2013, after being threatened by certain politicians.
We were asked to leave our homes by former minister Mervyn Silva and some thugs. We left because we wanted to save our lives, T.L. Jayathilake, one of previous owners told Daily Mirror.
The people claimed that they were not paid sufficient compensation when when compared to the actual value of the lands and the houses.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rizaan who is the current owner of the 26 houses said the CMC had no legal right to damage his property. (Kalathma Jayawardhane, Sanath Desmond)
