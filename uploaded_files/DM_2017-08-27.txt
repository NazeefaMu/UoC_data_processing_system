I will come to politics from UNP: Tissa
	
United National Partys former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said yesterday that he would come into national politics again as a UNP member in the upcoming elections.
Addressing a rally in Geli Oya, Kandy Mr. Attanayake said though he supported former President Rajapaksa during the last Presidential Elections he always remained a UNPer and did not go to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
I feel that this is the correct time to get back into politics. I will always stand with the peoples hopes and represent the general public, he said.
He said he was away from the politics for certain period as it was a transition time in politics and was not the right time to take a political decision.
He said that he wasnt satisfied with the current political situation in the country.
People too doubt the political leadership and their work, he said.
I hope to support the UNP to take the State leadership. Over 23years UNPers suffered without UNP President in the country. As to my belief the justice is not done to the UNPers. It is the peoples hope that a UNP candidate would take the countrys leadership, Mr. Attanayake said.
Meanwhile, he said that the UNP needed a Presidential Candidate, who could win the 2020 Presidential Election. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

No Confidence Motion not an effective way to end corruption -JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said it would vote in favour of No Confidence Motion brought in against Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, although such motions were not an effective way to get rid of corruption.
JVP leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that his party would vote in favour of the motion as Minister Senaratne was not fit to hold the Ministerial portfolio for several reasons.
"The Minister is deliberately delaying the settlement of SAITM issue because his Daughter-in-Law is a student at the said private medical college. This is a conflict of interest," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said his party did not intend to support the Minister for reasons, such as these.
However, he said No Confidence Motions were not an effective way to get rid of corruption.
One must bring in a motion condemning the socio-economic system, instead of playing musical chairs and unseating Ministers from time to time, he said. (Yohan Perera)
