Lionel Messi given 21-month jail term
	
Argentina and Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi has been sentenced to 21 months in prison for tax fraud, Spanish media reported.
His father, Jorge Messi, was also given a jail term for defrauding Spain of 4.1m (3.2m; $4.6m) between 2007 and 2009.
During the trial, prosecutors said tax havens in Belize and Uruguay were used to conceal earnings from image rights.
But Lionel Messi said he "knew nothing" about his financial affairs.
The sentence can be appealed through the Spanish Supreme Court, a statement from the court said.
However, under Spanish law a prison sentence under two years can be served under probation, meaning Messi and his father are unlikely to go to jail.
The court ordered Messi to pay a fine of around 2 million euros ($2.21 million) and his father to pay 1.5 million Euros for the crimes.

New taboos slapped on them irk the employees
	

Employees of a certain independent commission are highly disconsolate over a series of taboos imposed on them by the administration.

The use of the mobile phone inside the office is taboo, they say. They are required to obtain the permission of the head of the administration even to use a land phone.
Employees are also required to give a one weeks notice if they intend going on leave. This stipulation prevents them from obtaining leave for an emergency like the illness of a family member, they say.
Given these taboos, the disgusted employees have begun looking for employment opportunities elsewhere. It is an irony that an institution meant to provide redress to those who suffer injustice has turned a blind eye to injustice being meted out to a section of its own staff, an employee said.

No dog tax in our government: Karunarathna
	
The dog tax was imposed by the former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and it was levied even from State sector employees, Deputy Media Minister Karunarathna Paranawithana said.
While answering a question raised by a journalist at the Cabinet media briefing today, Minister Paranawithana said that Basil Rajapaksa was the only person who imposed the real dog tax to the country.
It was during the former regime that such taxes, like the Poll tax, were imposed on people. Yahapalanaya Government had removed all such taxes and other taxes on essential items and had given the relief to the people, he said.
Six navy personnel were appointed to look after his dogs at his residence, while imposing a dog tax to the Sri Lanka Army, sending the Government sector employees to dogs, he said
Paranawithana added that various taxes had been in existence since the times of kings. Taxes were paid by labour and money during that time.
The force, which Basil is trying to make by breaking apart from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), would automatically become a dog force if he is trying to blame the Yahapalanaya government saying it is trying to impose tax even on dogs, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Oscar Pistorius sentenced to six years for murder of his girlfriend
	
South African Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius has been sentenced to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend in 2013.
He had faced a 15-year sentence. Both the prosecution and defence can appeal.
The verdict comes after his initial conviction to manslaughter was changed to murder last December after the prosecution appealed.
Pistorius, 29, shot Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door in February 2013.
He admitted shooting Ms Steenkamp but said he mistook her for an intruder and acted out of fear.
In an hour-long session, Judge Thokozile Masipa said mitigating circumstances, such as rehabilitation and remorse, outweighed aggravating factors for deviating from the prescribed 15-year sentence for murder.
Pistorius has already served one year in jail.(BBC)

The former strongman attended a series of public functions held in the Panduwasnuwara area quite recently.

Betel leaf party purohitas and Diyawanna members hailing from Wayamba had been invited to these meetings.
The Sports purohita and former Deputy Indika were among the VIP invitees. However, the former Deputy had decided not to attend these meetings and sounded a note of warning to the Sports purohita. Machang, now that we are with the new Big Boss, attending meetings where the former Boss is present can land us in trouble.
The Sports purohita, being a plucky one had shrugged off the warning and attended the first meeting in the series.

On seeing the Sports one arriving at the meeting, a section of the crowd had started greeting him with boos and catcalls. The former strongman had beckoned the Sports one and had him seated by his side, but the jeers and boos had continued.
Finding that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, the Sports one had left the stage with the intention of leaving the scene. However, the hooligans had tried to subject him to further harassment and even manhandle him, they say.

This leading Chinese restaurant in the city was in hot water for defaulting on tax. The dues fallen into arrears had added up to a hefty sum.

The proprietor finding severe punishment staring in his face called on a political authority handling affairs connected with the economy at a bungalow in Kotte to seek his help to find a way out of his predicament. The political high-up assured the restaurant owner that he would settle the matter to everyones satisfaction.
A down-to-earth individual, this political high-up going into action immediately, ordered a white collar bigwig to give a promotion to the tax officer handling the restaurant owners tax file.
The tax file in question was either closed or it may have disappeared later, they say. However, the end result was that the tax problem ceased to bother the restaurant owner any longer.

The UK went to war in Iraq even before all peaceful options for disarming Saddam Hussein were exhausted, the long-awaited official report has concluded.
According to the BBC, Sir John Chilcots report has said the invasion was not the "last resort".
The 2003 invasion was based on "flawed intelligence and assessments" that "were not challenged", it argues.
Tony Blair underestimated the impact it would have on Iraq and the wider region despite "explicit warnings", it adds.
The former Labour prime minister is expected to face fresh calls to apologise from political opponents of the war and the families of the 179 British service personnel and civilians killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009.
The report, which has taken seven years to complete, has been published on the Iraq Inquiry website.

Clear the air over Raj Rajaratnam: JO to CB
	
The joint opposition yesterday urged the Central Bank (CB) to reveal the results of its probe launched in 2009 against controversial businessman Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group and who was found guilty of insider trading charges.
Addressing the weekly news conference of the joint oppositions Economic Research Centre, former external affairs minister G.L. Peiris said reports are spreading linking Dr. Coomaraswamy with Galleon Group and therefore it is vital to clear the air over Rajaratnam and as well as the Galleon Group.
The CB launched a probe in 2009 over the alleged funds received by the Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO) from Rajaratnam and said he had not been cleared from the charges against him. The Wall Street Journal also said he is not innocent. It is time for the CB to reveal whether its probe on Rajaratnam is over and the results of the probe. If Dr. Coomaraswamy had served in the New York-based hedge fund management firm, he should clarify what was his responsibilities there putting an end to allegations, he said.
The Bank Of Ceylon (BOC) was also involved in the first Bond Sale scam as it had released funds to Perpetual Treasuries to purchase CB Bonds. This means higher ranking officials other than the governor had involved in this. We saw high confidentiality was maintained when giving details of the incident to the Auditor General and also to the COPE. Confidentiality should not be used to cover up misdeeds, Prof. Peiris said.
Addressing the news briefing, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said a staggering loss of at least Rs. 150 billion had been incurred by the government in the two Bond Sale scams and said the loss should be recovered from those who are responsible. While lauding the appointment of the new governor, MP Gunawardane said the JO hoped Dr. Coomaraswamy will conduct his duties in an impartial manner.
We hope he will succeed in rebuilding the lost credibility of his institute. We also request him not to make arbitrary employee transfers like his predecessor, but to take measures to increase foreign reserves, to prevent investors from pulling their funds from Sri Lanka and ultimately to improve the countrys financial status, he said.

It looks that the love life has turned stormy for the fair and lovely ones active in politics in our country. In fact, several of them had to say adieu to their wedded bliss in the recent past.

It was only three weeks ago that a fair one from a political family active in politics at provincial level put an end to her wedlock. Her father, a former purohita, hails from Moratuwa.
Soon after untying the knot, the lady had begun talking about gay rights. And the inquisitive ones had begun making discreet inquiries as to why this comely one having said: I do at a grand star-studded wedding not long ago had to undo it so soon.
What they discovered raised many an eyebrow: That a young popular politico from the central hills is the reason for her decision to become a free birdie again. What has surprised them most is the fact that the name of this young politico has surfaced in connection with divorce cases filed by several other fair ones in politics as well!

They said this at the weekly media briefing of the joint opposition held in Borella today.
We should not consider him as a person involved with the LTTE. It is true he worked for Raj Rajaratnam who founded the Galleon Group, an American-based investment fund management firm for some time. But, Dr. Coomaraswamy is not a bad person. He worked for Rajaratnam as a professional. On that basis, we cannot hit out at him, Prof. Vitarana said.

Involvement of Foreign Judges: President has expressed an opinion: Mangala
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has expressed an opinion on the final accountability mechanism and both the President and the Prime Minister would look at all the available alternatives before making a final decision which will be acceptable to the majority of all stakeholders, Foreign Affairs Minister Managala Samaraweera today said.
Responding to a question during a news conference held at the ministry that statements made by President and the Premier seemed they have already decided about certain measures (on an accountability mechanism), he said no decision had been made and the leaders have only expressed their opinions.
Sri Lanka has a democracy where even the leader of the republic has the right to express his opinion. The President has said so and we respect his views. But finally, we know the President and the Prime Minister will look at all the options available and take a decision which will be acceptable to the majority of the stakeholders, he said.
Commenting on seeking foreign assistance in the process of accountability, Minister Samaraweera said there could be areas in which foreign expertise could be needed and said seeking foreign assistance was not alien to Sri Lanka or wrong.
Foreign expertise was sought in the past as well to look into the assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. The President only opposed to the involvement of foreign judges. There are many opinions. A majority including the President expressed sentiments against foreign judges while the TNA and others support the involvement of foreign judges. But, we think there are several alternatives between these two. There is no need to worry. In the final outcome, if this is to work, this must be a credible alternative not an attempt to satisfy ourselves. Im confident that we can come up with such a mechanism once the consultations are over, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ladies man back at his game
	

A story has gone viral that a white collar bigwig of a major body of the Rajarata provincial administration is soliciting sex bribes from young girls seeking jobs in departments coming under its purview.

Audio recordings of amorous suggestions made to some young women over the phone by this white collar one have become a source of much amusement to the employees, they say.
This worthy had earlier held secretarial status in a city-based Ministry and his scandalous conduct at that time too was the talk of the town.
Once during the previous regime, a certain purohita from the South had occasion to report this white collar one to the Big Boss at the time for causing sexual harassment to a female official who happened to be the purohitas niece. Following this complaint, the ladies man had been consigned to the pool.
The man had warmed his way into the graces of some yahapalanaya high-ups on the eve of the last years general poll and managed to secure the highest administrative post in the provincial body soon after the poll. And now he is back at his old game, they say.
