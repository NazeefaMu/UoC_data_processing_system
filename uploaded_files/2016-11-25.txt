Cocaine haul detected on sugar importer's tip off
	
The 200 kilos of cocaine was detected yesterday by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) when checking the containers after obtaining a court order based on the information provided by the sugar importer, Police said.
The PNB officers with the assistance of the Customs officers checked the thirteen suspicious containers which were held at the Rank Container Terminal (RCT) in Orugodawatte.
They said the importer had claimed that the containers had arrived later than the scheduled date and as such he was suspicious of the contents.
The Police said the Customs officers had earlier claimed that it was they who detected the haul of cocaine.
The Police denied the Customs claim that the sugar importer and his wharf clerk had been arrested.
Sugar Importers Association President Parakrama Abeysekera informed Daily Mirror that that the importer who imported this consignment of sugar, was the person who informed the PNB about his suspicions.
?The vessel MSC Julie-SS634R had left Brazil with fifty containers of sugar. It had been transshipped from Portugal on MSC Sabilo. At the point of transshipment which would have not taken more than 24 hours, would have not given sufficient time for the receivers to remove the cocaine from the container. Several thousand container loads of sugar arrive from Brazil,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the sugar importers had unanimously decided to stop all such imports from Brazil. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The minister said the proposals for this purpose would be presented to the Cabinet today.
??The Zoological Garden is more than 100 years old and the manner in which it was operated during colonial rule will not be applicable in this day and age. The practice of caging animals must be discontinued and they should also be allowed to enjoy their freedom,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Fine for overtaking from left a mistake of Minister: Gemunu
	
The decision to impose a steep fine of Rs.25,000 for overtaking a vehicle from the left side was taken by the Transport Minister mistakenly during the meeting at the Finance Ministry, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association President Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Addressing the media yesterday Mr. Wijeratne said that at present no such fine existed in the charge sheet used by the traffic police and there were several issues in regards to overtaking from the left side. ?There is no way to implement such a law. Therefore people should not take this issue seriously,? he said.
?Only small vehicles such as motor cycles and three-wheelers overtake on the left side and therefore this law should not be relevant to buses. They don?t need to overtake on the left side, because buses always use the left side of the road,? he said. ?I have explained all this to the minister and even the police. Accidents happen even when overtaking on the right side. The fine for improper overtaking on the right side was Rs.500. Because of that we agreed with the minister?s decision, as there is no need for buses to overtake on the left side. This will reduce road accidents,? he said.
?Personally, I like this law because by imposing this law it will discourage motorcyclists and other motorists from contravening traffic laws,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

IRF funded Indian IS recruits? trip to Sri Lanka: NIA
	
A probe carried out by the Indian National Investigation Agency (NIA) said that an Islamic State (IS) recruit Ashfaque Majeed?s father has revealed that the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) founded by televangelist Zakir Naik had allegedly funded Ashfaque and his fellow recruits? Sri Lanka trip.
After Abu Anas, another alleged IS recruit from Rajasthan who the NIA believes received a Rs-80,000 scholarship from the IRF, this is the second instance in which the now banned NGO is suspected to have spent its funds on alleged IS recruits, the Indian Express reported on Thursday.
?Ashfaque?s father Kader claims that while leaving for Sri Lanka in February this year, Ashfaque told him that Qureshi of the IRF was funding the tour. In all, 21 people were attending a small course on ?Learning Quran. Qureshi had also paid money to make their passports,? said an official.
According to Kader, on February 23, Ashfaque left for Sri Lanka, where he stayed in Jaffna.
He later returned to India in the first week of March and stayed mostly in Kerala. On May 24, he came to Mumbai for a week, before leaving for Afghanistan in June along with his wife and their 18-month-old daughter.
Based on the complaint by Kader, the Mumbai Crime branch had arrested Qureshi, Rizwan Khan of Al-Birr Foundation and Mohammed Haneef, a maulana from Kerala.
Last month, the case was transferred to the NIA, which is probing the larger case of 21 Kerala-based youth who were allegedly radicalised and then fled the country to join the Islamic State.
Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Police is set to register a first information report (FIR) against Zakir Naik, after the state law and judiciary department sent in its opinion that a case may be made out against him for inciting enmity.
?After it emerged that one of the Bangladesh bombers cited Zakir Naik?s preachings, the chief minister asked the Mumbai Police to prepare a report on whether his speeches incited youth. The report was submitted to the Law and Judiciary department. They have said a case can be made out against Naik under Section 153 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for inciting hatred,? said a senior official from the state home department.
?The department has found at least eight instances wherein a case under the said section of the IPC could be registered,? the source said, adding that the FIR is likely to be registered within a month.
However, the IRF has said they plan to challenge the validity of the FIR filed by the NIA.
?The case under UAPA is based on cases for which an FIR had already been registered, and therefore the new FIR is invalid,? an IRF spokes-person said. The NIA has also written to banks asking them to freeze Naik?s bank accounts.

Malik asks BC to probe allegations
	
Minister Malik Samarawickrama, who reiterated that no funds belonging to the Mahapola Fund had been misused as claimed by the joint opposition, yesterday requested the Bribery Commission?s Director General to expedite an inquiry into the complaint filed by the JO to ascertain the facts.
He told a news conference held at the Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry that they hoped the Bribery Commission would take action against the two JO MPs for making false complaints.
?The allegations are completely false. I?m not surprised that these allegations are being made by bankrupt politicians. The Mahapola Trust Fund is not a property of an individual to misuse. It is being monitored by a board of trustees headed by the Chief Justice. Secretaries of the Higher Education, Education and International Trade Ministries are some of other trustees,? the minister said.
Gihan Jayatilleke, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Wealth Corporation Limited (NWCL) which regulates the Mahapola Fund, said no Mahapola funds had been invested in the companies of SAFE Holding, Asset Trust Management (Pvt.) Ltd or NatWealth Securities Limited as alleged.
However, he said Rs.300 million belonging to the fund had been invested in the primary market with a return of Rs.1billion generated to the Mahapola Fund.
?The NatWealth Securities Limited is only a company which can purchase bonds from the market,? he said.
NWCL Chairman Wickrema Weerasooria said he was shocked by the allegations and he had written to the Bribery Commission?s Director General requesting him to expedite the probe.
The JO alleged that the Mahapola Trust Fund and Schools Development Fund had been misused by Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria and they lodged a complaint at the Bribery Commission seeking action against the two. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Murder of Noori Estate Supdt.- Judgment today
	
The judgment in connection with the horrendous murder of Nihal Perera, the Superintendent of the Noori Tea Estate in Deraniyagala, in which former UPFA Deraniyagala Pradeshiya Sabha chairman Anil Champika alias ?Atha Kota? and 21 others were indicted, is to be delivered today.
The verdict in the case against the 22 accused is to be delivered by Avissawella High Court Judge Devika Abeyratne.
The main accused (the former PS chairman) and 21 others were charged with unlawful assembly and conspiracy to murder Nihal Perera and the commission of the murder. The accused were also charged with causing grievous hurt to three employees of the tea estate.
The trial began on February 24, 2015, and around 20 witnesses gave evidence. The prosecution was led by Senior State Counsel Shanil Kularatne.
Following the murder of the estate superintendent there was a huge public outcry against the police, and disciplinary inquiries were initiated seven policemen, including the OIC (Crimes) of the Deraniyagala Police. The policemen were later transferred. The murder investigation was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID); and officers from the Homicide Division of the CID -- Chief Inspector Rohan and SI Polwatta -- assisted in the prosecution.
Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the first accused, the former PC chairman, while a team of lawyers appeared for the other accused.
According to the magisterial inquiry into the murder of July 5, 2013, Nihal Perera, was first struck with a pole and then cut with a sword. Giving evidence before Avissawella Chief Magistrate D. H. A.Seneviratne, the witnesses said Mr. Perera was taken to a lonely spot on the tea estate and beaten to death. The eye witnesses who had not earlier given statements regarding the murder to the Deraniyagala Police, as they feared that the police were influenced by the accused, revealed during the magisterial inquiry that Mr. Perera was brutally assaulted, and that his mouth was cut with a knife -- after which he was dumped naked on the estate grounds.
Later, employees of the tea estate had rushed Mr. Perera to hospital, where he had died soon after admission. (Susitha R. Fernando)

Proposal to amalgamate two or more provinces
	
A parliamentary subcommittee is reported to have proposed that two or more provinces be amalgamated into a single unit with the approval at a referendum by the people living in these provinces.
The six committees which interacted with the stakeholders on formulating a new constitution submitted their reports to Parliament on November 19.
One such committee had also proposed that such a provision be included so as to enable the merger of two or more provinces with the consent of people.
It had also proposed the reduction of the powers of provincial governors. One of the recommendations was the abolishing of the presidency. In such an event, the Prime Minister will have the authority to appoint governors to the provincial councils. If such a proposal is enacted, the powers of the chief ministers would be strengthened with more independence in governance.
Today, the governors are appointed by the President. They even have the powers to sanction statutes passed by their provincial councils.
The committee has recommended the abolition of the concurrent list under the present constitution outlining subjects coming under the purview of the central government and the provincial councils. Education, health, and environment are some of them.
Parliament will have a three-day debate on constitutional reforms in the second week of January. (Kelum Bandara)

Strict action should be taken against hate speech: CBK
	
Former President and Chairperson of Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said today that hate speech had arisen in Sri Lanka in the recent past, which challenged the initiatives being taken by the government to heal our country after decades of bloodshed and destruction.
Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a statement that hate filled expressions and actions by groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic and religious backgrounds had no place in the Sri Lankan society.
?For the first time in contemporary Sri Lanka, the Government has a stated vision to build One United Nation by promoting reconciliation and a lasting peace. The Government is working towards bringing about reconciliation among all communities, making it the highest priority,? the statement added.
She said the Government and the people of Sri Lanka were presently engaged in the noble task of rebuilding a society in which good governance prevails.
?The challenges faced in realising this are immense. Yet, the new opportunities that have opened up and the favourable socio-political context created since January 2015 must be seized,? she said.
The statement said the active participation and leadership of all patriotic Sri Lankans was essential for the achievement of reconciliation, peace and honest, effective, people friendly Governance if we were to attain political stability, economic growth and progress we so richly deserve as a nation.
She said, short, medium and long term efforts were underway to address the grievances of all communities and to build a sense of respect, equality and pride in every citizen living in an inclusive Sri Lanka, where each person has the opportunity to enjoy the freedom that is the right of every citizen.
She stressed that strictest action must be taken without delay, against persons or groups who act to provoke disharmony by creating divisions among citizens along ethnic and religious lines, and added that President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickrmasinghe and the entire government had categorically reiterated that hate speech would not be tolerated.
It said ONUR, while appreciating the arrest of two individuals from two different communities, accused of hate speech and for inciting racism, urges the relevant authorities to take appropriate action against all such incidents regardless of the social status, ethnic/religious background or political affiliations of the perpetrators.
?We note that there are numerous complaints against hate speech and incitement to racism, where strong evidence is available, yet investigations and prosecutions are pending for some time.We urge the law enforcement authorities to take early action on all these incidents,? it said.

Union Assurance September quarter profit up over higher life premiums
	
Despite the challenging market conditions with pressures rising on disposable incomes and the need of an insurance policy becomes less of a priority, life insurer, Union Assurance PLC (UAL), increased both its gross written premiums (GWPs) and profits during its recent quarter ended September.?
UAL posted a net profit of Rs.70.8 million recording an increase of 39 percent on year but the profits did not include a surplus from the life business, which is actuarially valued?
at year-end.?
The earnings per share jumped to Rs.1.20 from 59 cents a year ago as the company repurchased shares during the period.?
Meanwhile, for the nine months ended September 30, the company made an earning of Rs.3.22 a share or Rs.189.8 million, which is a decrease of 87 percent from a year ago as the corresponding last year?s profit included a one-off gain of Rs.1.22 billion from the sale of its general insurance subsidiary.?
Upon regulatory-driven segregation of the business into life and non-life, Union Assurance sold 78 percent of its general insurance subsidiary for a consideration of Rs.3.66 billion to Fairfax Asia Limited, which resulted in a capital gain of Rs.1.22 billion.?
However, even after ?excluding this transaction, the profit for the period was lower than the previous period due to a decrease in interest income as a result of reduction in funds available due to the share repurchase effected in September 2015,? the company said in a statement. ?
Union Assurance General Limited, now a 22 percent-owned associate company, during the nine-month period contributed with a Rs.85.5 million profit.

We shouldn?t live like frogs in well: Mangala
	
Sri Lankans must not live like frogs in a well, as we have done in the past, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Delivering a speech at the convocation ceremony of Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute (BIDTI) held yesterday, the minister said it was time for Sri Lankans to start focusing on the future.
?The difficult times of conflict are now over, hopefully, for once and for all. We must not be stuck in that past. This does not mean that we must not learn from that past.? We must not live like frogs in a well, as we Sri Lankans have done. It?s time for us to start looking at the future,? he said.
He said Sri Lankans must help each other heal from the painful experiences of the past and that we have to come to terms with the tragedies if we are to move forward with optimism.
Minister Samaraweera said journey towards true reconciliation would not be smooth and that there will be difficulties to overcome as we progress.
?But we must not lose hope. We must persevere. After all, this is our common future that we are designing. Sri Lanka certainly cannot succeed in isolation. We must continue to work in cooperation with countries and also work for a strong rules-based international order,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said he had noticed that sometimes, we spend far too much time complaining about what is wrong in the country instead of looking for ways to improve things.
