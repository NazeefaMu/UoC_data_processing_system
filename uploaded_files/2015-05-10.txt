Elections under PR, even if 20A passed
	
President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) that Parliament would be dissolved if parties failed to reach an agreement on the 20th Amendment, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.
Mr. Dissanayake, who revealed some details on the talks his party had with President Sirisena said the latter also assured that the House would be dissolved any way as soon as the 20th Amendment was approved.
Dissanayake said the President had assured that the next election would be held under the present Proportional Representation system even if the 20th Amendment was enacted.
However, JVP Leader said his party believed that Parliament should be dissolved as the present government had no mandate to govern the country after the 100- day period lapsed.(Yohan Perera)

Expedite probe on Siriliya Bank account funds: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government authorities to question former first lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa immediately on the misuse of Siriliya Bank account funds.
There are allegations of misuse of funds in the bank account of Siriliya programme and several persons involved in them have been questioned so far.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the former first lady should also be questioned. He said this should be done as she was the head of this programme.
He also said an investigation has to be done on the death of a Rugby player at Isipathana Mawatha as there are evidence to suggest that it could be a murder.
Mr. Dissanayake who defended the setting up of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) said as this division was set up as there had been serious financial crimes in the country in the past.
He said new investigation divisions or institutions have to be set up when the need arises. Citing examples, he said a Terrorist Investigation Unit was set up when terrorism began in this country while the Narcotics Bureau was set up after narcotic drugs started coming in. (YP)

Govt. faces financial crisis; can?t even pay salaries - CBK
	
Former president Chandrika Kumaratunge said today that the present government was facing a serious financial crisis and was even unable to pay public servants their salaries.
Addressing a meeting organised by the Sri Lanka Development Officers? Union in Colombo yesterday, she said the government was facing difficulties due to the depleted finances of the Treasury.
She said the crisis had been caused by the lack of transparency in the projects carried out by the previous government.
She said the payment of state sector salaries was difficult because of the lack of funds. ?The government is not able to pay state sector salaries to everyone. It?s hard to expand the sector, and some of the employees have no work,? she said.
She said those opposed to Yahapalanaya (good governance) had begun a counterrevolution against the new government.

Wickremesinghe invites Kanchi Sankaracharya to visit Lanka
	
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has invited the Sankaracharya of Kanchi, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, to visit Lanka to advice the government on Hindu religious affairs and the training of Hindu priests.
The invitation was conveyed to the Sankaracharya by Saman Athuadahetti, Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister, when he met the Seer at the Kanchi mutt earlier in the week.
?At the meeting we sought his advice on ways and means of protecting Hindu religious customs and places of worship in? Sri Lanka, especially the training of priests in the correct agama? tradition,? Athuradahetti told Express here on Sunday.
Asked if the Sankaracharya had accepted the PM?s invitation to visit Lanka, Athuadahetti said: ?He told us that he would let us know.?
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, a Buddhist, is now a believer in Hindu Gods also. Recently, he visited the? Sri Krishna temple at Guruvayur accompanied by his wife, to offer 77 kilos of sandalwood. Earlier, when he was Leader of Opposition, he had had an audience with Sathya Sai Baba.
While Wickremesinghe is visiting Hindu temples in India and seeking the advice of the Kanchi Seer, the defeated Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has stopped visiting Hindu temples and consulting astrologers after the January 8 election. Prior to the elections, Rajapaksa had worshiped at the Venkateswara temple at? Tirupathi and at the Krishna temple in Guruvayur.
Now, he is only visiting only Buddhist shrines. His political headquarters in Colombo is actually Buddhist temple. Rajapaksa told a Pakistani journalist that he has stopped consulting astrologers. He is said to have fixed January 8 as the polling day for the Presidential election after consulting a trusted astrologer, only to come to grief. (New Indian Express)
