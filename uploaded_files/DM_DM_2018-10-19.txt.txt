## Title: Development debacles and illegitimate debt in Sri Lanka

Development debacles and illegitimate debt in Sri Lanka
	

Uma Oya project is a clear example of launching it sans a feasibility study
	
	Sri Lanka has been cited as the latest victim of the Chinese debt trap diplomacy
	
	Hambantota Harbour was built by digging Karagan Levaya

Sri Lanka had several failed and controversial projects in the past decade. Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, Hambantota Harbour, Mattala Airport, Uma Oya diversion, Colombo Port City to name a few. They cost billions of rupees however, but do not produce the expected benefits. Perhaps, many of them were not required for the country. This unwarranted development or over development was the result of political arrogance of the ruling regimes. 
During the recent Environmental Impact Assessment conference held in Colombo, it was revealed that some major development projects did not even have a feasibility study or even a pre-feasibility study. The developers in both private and public projects expect the EIA process to deal with feasibility as well. There is no way that EIA teams can fulfil the task of making both feasibility and the Environmental Impact Assessment. The projects this way lack looking into the more feasible alternatives.
Uma Oya diversion project is a clear example of launching the project during the previous regime without doing a feasibility study. Addressing the gathering on April 29, 2008 on the occasion of the visit of the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Sri Lanka, at Sapugaskanda, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said, Two gifts by Iran to Sri Lanka to build the Uma Oya reservoir project and a modern oil refinery were the noblest gifts we have received recently. Sri Lankans are visibly moved by this great gesture, said President Mahinda Rajapaksa. A reservoir is the noblest gift one could give the Sri Lankan people. However, President Ahmadinejad was not able to lay the foundation stone at Uma Oya due to bad weather conditions. By December 2014, the Iranian gift had become a death trap for the villagers in Bandarawela.

It is unfortunate the development decisions in Sri Lanka has no such public acceptance or not referred for public opinion. There is no educated voice in Parliament or such a dialogue happening in the country to select the development we need

Other than the irrigation water to Wellawaya and Hambantota it was promised to add 120 MW to the generation system with 230 GWh of annual energy generation. It was expected to connect the power plant to the national grid in 2015. The estimated cost of the project was US$529 million and 85% of the total project cost was provided by the Government of Iran through Export and Development Bank as a loan. By now more than 7000 million rupees has been paid as compensation for the affected communities which is not even 20% of the total damage done by the Uma Oya Project. Despite the failure of the project, Sri Lankan citizens will pay this money back to Iran in the next couple of decades. The project had neither a proper feasibility study nor an acceptable EIA with possible alternatives.
Hambantota Harbour was built by digging Karagan Levaya, which was one of the best lagoons for migratory birds that arrived in Sri Lanka. Feasibility study for the harbour was rejected by the ministerial task force since the study was not bankable and no proper feasibility study done in 2002. Yet the project was pushed by the previous regime and it became another white elephant. Total estimated construction cost of Phase 1 of the project was US$361 million out of which, 85% was funded by the EXIM Bank of the Peoples Republic of China. Then Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman boasted that the Singaporean Ambassador in Sri Lanka when touring the site said: Wed better find ourselves another job. Sri Lanka being at the very epicenter of trade routes will be able to accommodate even the largest of ships and cater to their needs. As expected, no shipping line was interested in using the harbour. In July 2017, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) leased out the Hambantota Port to China Merchant Port for a 99-year period at a price of US$1.1 billion.
The SLPA has built an artificial island on the 110 hectares near Hambantota Port at a cost of over $500 million during the previous Rajapaksa regime. This man-made island which has been built as an entertainment facility was also given to a Chinese company.

The accumulation of both legitimate and illegitimate debt in Sri Lanka in the recent times have caused enormous pressure on the country and the citizens who often see it as a tax increase and increase in the price of goods and services
These were just two occasions that Department of National planning and the Ministry of Finance did not play its role when screening the suitable projects for the country. As a result, the Sri Lankan public pay heavy cost to pay back unnecessary and illegitimate debts. 
Sri Lankas total nett external debt exceeded $50 billion in 2017. Sri Lankas large external debt repayments total US$4 billion per year between 2019 and 2022.Under the previous regime from 2004-2015 the government had borrowed 5.17 trillion rupees as loans including 2.16 trillion rupees ($14.06 billion) of foreign loans.
According to the Central banks latest records show Sri Lankas total outstanding debt was 10.3 trillion rupees as at the end of September 2017.
Considering the failed projects such as Mattala Airport, Hambantota Harbour, Uma Oya diversion and some other partly successful projects such as Moragahakanda, Yan Oya, etc., half of Sri Lankas debt could be considered as illegitimate debt. Illegitimate debt includes loans that were knowingly given to oppressive regimes and dictators; caused harm to people, environment and communities; violated human rights; violated basic notions and rules of fairness, and basic assumptions of public contracts; violated democratic principles and exploited the vulnerability, impoverishment and misfortune of others. The accumulation of both legitimate and illegitimate debt in Sri Lanka in the recent times have caused enormous pressure on the country and the citizens who often see it as a tax increase and increase in the price of goods and services. 
In recent months Sri Lanka has been cited by several politicians and the media in other countries as the latest victim of the Chinese debt trap diplomacy. There are many African and Asian countries which struggle to pay the debt accumulated with Chinese investments overseas. China Belt Road Initiative is one of the mechanisms to draw countries to this debt trap. However, it is the ruling regimes of each country that have the right to engage or avoid.

Many African and Asian countries are struggling to pay the debt accumulated with Chinese investments. China Belt Road Initiative is one such mechanisms to draw countries into this debt trap
It is unfortunate the development decisions in Sri Lanka has no much public acceptance or has public opinion been sought. There is no such educated voice in the Parliament or a dialogue happening in the country to select the development we need on a national basis. Unfortunately, development decision-making is in the hands of a handful of corrupted politicians. The past experience shows bureaucrats have no say on these decisions or either they are corrupt too. It is paramount to correct the system and clean the politics before Sri Lanka gets drowned in this debt crisis.

## Title: Does vision struggle darken a childs future

Does vision struggle darken a childs future 
	

The health of children is a key factor which determines their outcome in childhood achievements, which form the foundation for a successful future. Good vision is perhaps the most important parametre in all health indices which helps a child in not only academic activities, but also in extra curricular activities; for example sports. There are more than 100 children who come for investigations and treatment for a variety of eye ailments to the Eye Clinic at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital says Dr. Hiranya Abeysekera, Consultant Paediatric Eye Surgeon with whom we are having the health discussion in this weeks issue of the Health Capsule.
Following are excerpts of an interview done with Dr. Abeysekera.
Q How do you recognise whether a child is having a problem with vision
It is not easy. But there are some reasonable clues which help you to look in children and see whether they have eye problems. School teachers are very good in picking children with visual problems. If your childs teacher warns you to get your childs eyes checked, please do not ignore this call. Children with vision problems usually struggle to copy whats on the blackboard when they sit at the back row. They are much comfortable in a front row seat. At home, some children may go very close to the television, squeeze their eyes as if they are trying to clear the images or they may shed tears when they try to focus on the screen. Some children with vision related problems refuse to go out in the sun as they are sensitive to light. Children dont lie. If they say they cant see, they cant actually see. It is the duty of adults to find out why they cant see.

A vast majority of children will have some degree of increment of the power of the lenses. This is similar to the increment of their shoe size. We are just compensating for the growth of the eye ball to maintain good vision which is a mandatory requirement for their future endeavours

Q Are there any long term effects of childhood eye problems
Childhood is a lifetime opportunity. Once it is gone, it will never return. During childhood, the maturation of the nervous system and visual system continues almost unto 18 years. But most of the neural maturation important for vision is completed by the age of 8. Therefore, if a disruption to the process of visual development occurs before 8 years and if it is not treated promptly it is going to create lifetime defects with vision. If so, the children will be at a disadvantageous position at certain exams, driving licence test and job interviews etc.

Q What are the reasons for children to develop eye problems
Firstly, it is because the differences in the shape of the eye ball. I always say as each individuals face is unique, the shape of the eye ball is also unique. What our eye ball does is it captures light rays coming from an object and focuses on the yellow spot of the retina. The yellow spot of the retina has special nerve endings called photoreceptors and the energy in the light is converted to a nerve signal and transmitted to the special centre for vision in the brain. For us to generate a clear image in the brain the focussing of light rays on the yellow spot has to be good. If the shape of the eye ball is not normal then focusing is also going to be erratic and the image formed is going to be blurred.

Q What are the other causes which can result in vision problems in children
The structure of the eye ball and its nerve connections to the brain are very important in gaining and maintaining good vision in a child. All our body organs form during our stay in the mothers womb. The formation of the eye occurs very early during the pregnancy. Infections affecting the mother during the first few weeks of pregnancy, such as Rubella, can cause defects in the formation of the eye. Genetic changes which affect the manufacturing of the eye also affect the structure of the eye and can cause problems with vision. Trauma is a more common cause which can affect the structure of the eye ball which can reduce the vision. Children play with whatever they get hold of. Some things such as sharps, springs and bullets can cause damage to the eye. Once the eye is damaged we can repair the structure to some degree, but not hundred percent. We can never restore the vision of a damaged eye.

Children with vision problems usually struggle to copy whats on the blackboard when they sit at the back row. They are much comfortable in a front row seat. At home, some children may go very close to the television, squeeze their eyes as if they are trying to clear the images or they may shed tears when they try to focus on the screen

Q Most importantly, how do you diagnose vision problems in children
Eye examinations are done by health professionals in children in various occasions. For an example, at birth every childs eyes are checked by the paediatrician. The vision is checked in all students in grade 1,4 and 7 in government schools. The vision can be checked in any child or any infant. Techniques are used according to their ages and abilities. There is nothing called this child is too young to get the eyes checked.
Q Why do children have to wear glasses
As I told before, problems with distant vision are common in children. What happens in short sightedness or inability to see far is that their eye ball cannot focus light rays on to the retina. If there is no proper focusing on the retina, the signals to the brain are also going to be incorrect. What we are achieving with glasses is that they help the persons eye to focus properly on the retina, so the image formation on the retina is clear. Thus the brain receives a clear image which can be processed properly to provide for good vision.

Q What are the advices you give to kids who wear glasses
Kids wear glasses for reasons that are different from adults. Adults may wear them when they read or use a computer. But kids need to improve their level of vision. So kids have to wear glasses all the time when they are awake. This helps to improve the vision at the level of the brain. Kids who dont wear glasses all the time will have problems in future events such as when facing a driving licence test. Children need to see the doctor or optician more frequently too.
I advice children up to 12 years to get their glasses checked every 3 to 6 months depending on their vision. Children older than 12 years can have their glasses checked once every nine to twelve months. This is because we need to adjust to their growth. Like any other organ in our body, our eye ball also continues growing. Glasses made in keeping with the size of the eyeball may not be suitable one year later. So we have to recheck more frequently and compensate for their growth.

Q What happens if the thickness of the glasses increases
Thickness of the glasses or the power of the lenses changes with their age as I have stated before. A vast majority of children will have some degree of increment of the power of the lenses. This is similar to the increment of their shoe size. We are just compensating for the growth of the eye ball to maintain good vision which is a mandatory requirement for their future endeavours. I always say if the vision is good with glasses, the power of the lenses are immaterial.

Giving false evidence: Ravi can be a suspect: Magistrate
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today clarified his order on Ravi Karunanayake being named as a suspect, observing that the order does not say he cannot be a suspect in the inquiry but questions the process by which he was named a suspect.
He said this when a motion was taken into consideration in the magisterial inquiry on former minister Mr. Karunanayake in connection with giving false testimony at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on August 2 last year.
The Magistrate previously made an order on October 8 directing certain individuals and the Global Transportation & Logistic Ltd (GTL) to provide details requested by the prosecution on or before October 22. In this order the Magistrate had also observed the way in which Mr. Karunanayake had been named a suspect and that it was not legally correct.
Filing a motion at the outset of the inquiry, President's Counsel Shavendra Fernando, who appeared for GTL, which has connections to former Mr. Karunayake, requested Court to allow two more weeks to comply with the October 8 order directing GTL to provide details of bank statements, vouchers, fund transactions, decisions of directors, etc., between January 2015 and August 2017.
However, when the Chief Magistrate asked why time was needed, the defense counsel said they needed more time to obtain more legal advice because the prosecution's request for the details contained some confidential matters as well. The defense counsel said these details covered a period of more than two years and that was the reason for requesting for more time.
The Chief Magistrate observed that the court could not consider the need for more time on an order already given. He said if a party did not agree with the order, there is legal provision to file a revision application in the High Court and seek relief against the order. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

GMOAs shenanigans
	

PEOPLE AS TAX PAYERS DONT HAVE TO FUND HEALTH SERVICE IF THEY ARE IGNORED BY THE SLMC


A NEW MEDICAL LAW TO BE DRAFTED TO REMOVE ALL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE EXISTING ORDINANCE
GMOA WRITES TO ALL EXCEPT THE MEDIA
ENACTING A NEW ORDINANCE IN TWO MONTHS IS TOO SHORT; AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AND PUBLIC DELIBERATIONS NEEDED


The GMOA, under the signatures of their President Anuruddha Padeniya and Secretary Haritha Aluthge had sent a two page letter in Sinhala to President Maithripala Sirisena, with copies to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, to the Speaker of Parliament, to all Cabinet Ministers, to all MPs, to the Attorney General and many others except the media, with the long title To keep you informed of damage caused to the Sri Lanka Medical Council and to the whole health system by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The letter was dated 15 October 2018 and was followed by an Internal Memo on the same day written in English, sent to all GMOA branches titled Abolition of current Medical Ordinance and SLMC, signed by GMOA Secretary Aluthge.
This pleading of a sort made to President Sirisena comes after their very fiery threat made at the media briefing on September 6, 2018 in response to the statement made by Prof. Colvin Gunaratana, who said this the SLMC has to be restructured for the benefit of people.
They warned this government, the GMOA would lead a massive strike never seen in the history of Sri Lanka, immediately and without warning if the SLMC is touched in any manner.
The tone of thuggery with which this threat was shouted out, cannot now be watched and listened to, as this particular video clip has been removed from the official GMOA website. That being out of reference, now comes a very pleading letter, after Minister Rajitha Senaratne appointed a Committee of five by letter dated September 20, 2018, to Draft a new enactment in place of the existing Medical Ordinance within two months, in order to provide the service expected by the public.
The Committee consists of two Professors, Nilanthi de Silva (Actg. President SLMC) and Harendra de Silva, along with DG Health Services Palitha Fernando PC (Former AG) and Dr Palitha Abeykoon. Acting Registrar/SLMC was appointed Secretary to the Committee.
The mandate given to the Committee is plain and clear. A new Medical Law to be drafted to remove all shortcomings in the existing Medical Ordinance to provide for a new SLMC that would serve the people.
Minister Senaratne very clearly says, 02. Examine the legislations that govern the General Medical Council (GMC) of the United Kingdom and other countries comparing with the Medical Ordinance for the purpose of identifying positive developments in the field of regulations of medical and allied health professions in other countries.
Now, what on earth is wrong with that How can such improvements called for, Damage the SLMC and the whole health system as stupidly claimed by the GMOA leadership
The whole 02 page plead made to President Sirisena by the GMOA is a total distortion of facts and events, churned out to maintain their grip on the SLMC and the Health Service, obviously for selfish reasons.
Their pleading to President says, as you are well aware, the main task of the Medical Ordinance is to (1) safeguard the medical profession and (2) to safeguard the standard of medical education. IF that is the purpose of the existing Medical Ordinance, that alone demands replacement of this Medical Ordinance with one, that would serve the people.
We dont have to contribute to safeguard a medical profession that selfishly serves itself and we dont have to safeguard a medical education that turns out medical doctors who can only diagnose illnesses and write out (illegible) prescriptions to mint money.
We need State University medical faculties that can turn out decent, disciplined and well cultured medical practitioners who are truly professionals.
It is interesting and amusing too, that all six allegations levelled against Minister Senaratne by the GMOA and listed in their pleading to the President, tend to say that since 2006 with Minister Senaratne, the SLMC was wholly devalued, the medical education and the required minimum qualifications to enter medical faculties have also been brought down.
The amusing fact is, sadistic medics who allegedly rape and kill innocent young girls (Negombo Hospital case. Read http://transyl2014.blogspot.com/2018/10/blog-post_96.html) medics who allegedly drink and drive, who provide false certifications to clear colleagues of criminal faults and groups of medical professionals who behave like hooligans, fighting for parking slots holding patients as hostage, were all products when the SLMC as the GMOA claims was in better shape before 2006 and before Minister Senaratne.
If the primary purpose of the SLMC under the present medical ordinance is to safeguard the medical profession, the SLMC by now should have suspended all those medical doctors who insulted their own profession from its registry of medical practitioners. But they dont. That itself is proof, the SLMC in the hands of the medical profession does not safeguard standards and ethics in the medical profession.
All that speaks for the public need to revamp the SLMC. The GMOA allegation that Minister Senaratne had not filled the vacant posts of President and Registrar of SLMC was not necessitated, with the new draft law to be finalised in just two months. This SLMC is on its way out.
Bottom line is, it is the people (tax payers) who fund free education, medical education, the public health services including salaries and all perks and privileges enjoyed by medical doctors, their duty free permit vehicles, and the State run SLMC as well.
People dont have to fund any of these, if they are ignored by the SLMC and if the GMOA claims the SLMC is there to safeguard medics.
Their internal memo says:
Dr Senaratne claims that this move is to introduce laymen into the Medical Council in order to ensure high quality inquiries with better outcomes against doctors based on patients complaints.
While there is a serious need to have high quality independent inquiries on complaints against medical doctors made to the SLMC, these are lies and utter lies.
This very statement in their internal memo proves the GMOA leaders would stoop to any low, in satisfying their greed. There is no mention to that effect anywhere in the whole letter that appointed the Committee.
The GMOA leaders seem to suffer from what I diagnose as chronic lie-mania.
As mentioned in their pleading to the President, they also say in their internal memo,
He further claims, that the demand to abolish the Medical Ordinance was made by persons such as Saman Rathnapriya, Ravi Kumudesh and Kusal Perera. No person is named in the letter signed by the Minister appointing the Committee which says:
I am in receipt of number of representations from the members of Parliament, the general public, professional bodies, and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) regarding deficiencies in the existing medical ordinance and the necessity for a new legislation to amend status of affairs of the SLMC in order to provide the service expected by the public. Several members of Parliament highlighted this matter at the debate held on September 07, 2018 for second reading of the Medical Amendment Bill which introduced the Specialist Registry.
While I do not know what the other two persons named by the GMOA leaders had to with this restructuring of the SLMC through a new law, I take pride if the Hon. Minister had heeded my arguments and requests to enact a new law and overhaul the present SLMC to include other professionals and reputed and recognised laymen and women.
A necessary change I lobbied for, through these pages in the DM. In these pages I wrote over one year and six months ago on March 3, 2017 an article titled SLMC needs overhaul that was accessed by over 5,500 online readers wherein I said:
In our culture of professional selfishness and arrogance, the SLMC to be left in the hands of the medical profession alone would be too dangerous to the health of the nation.
Therefore, in providing for an alternate option I wrote:
The way out would be to include other professions as community representations. It has to provide for provincial community representation as well, to make it a nationally representative body. I made references to the Medical Board of Australia (MBA) and to the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) that have federal representations and also to the British GMC. All these bodies have good gender representation as well as lay members who are not medical professionals. On GMOA arguments, these countries must therefore be in a huge medical crisis by having lay members.
Ignoring all the lies and misinterpretations by the GMOA, what needs to be stressed here is that, the Committee appointed by Minister Senaratne should be further improved including few more lay persons and with more women representation.
Health of a country is more about mothers and children. It is also necessary to provide at least six months to the Committee to have public consultations and have the Draft enactment in the public domain for social dialogue, before the Minister goes to the Cabinet with it.
If as the Minister says it should serve the interest of the people and no doubt it should, then the people have the right to discuss it, before it becomes law.
If as the GMOA says, the Minister accedes to my requests, I wish he would accede to this request too, to further improve in producing a law that can serve the people and keep out selfish and greedy professional interests.

As a high political authority arrived at a funeral house, a onetime bigwig of another main party who was there, sloped away making his exit through a rear door, they say.

A typical turncoat, the politico who did the vanishing trick, had quit his original party to secure high office and is said to be putting out feelers these days to return to the fold.
The politico faded from the scene fearing possible questioning about his hanky-panky by the high authority, they say.

Heads of three State institutions refuse to resign
	
Despite a news item that went out from the President's office on Wednesday (17) to the effect that the President had dissolved the Boards of the Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank and the Sri Lanka Board of Investment, as of last night none of the heads of these institutions had resigned from their posts, it was reported.
Unofficial sources revealed that the Chairmen and Directors of these institutions had taken a decision not to resign from their posts as ordered.
The Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank are entities that come under State Enterprises and Kandy Town Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella while the Board of Investment comes under Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.

Healthcare in SL: Is business as usual an option
	
Dr. Rajitha Senaratne presenting Dr Mingui with a copy of the Governments Policy on Healthcare Delivery for Universal health Coverage

Cabinet approves reorganising the system to meet changing healthcare needs
	
	Technical work supporting this policy undertaken by the Health Ministry and WHO
	
	Official says strengthening primary healthcare system will be a major step forward in eliminating TB and AIDS


This week national and international experts gathered in Sri Lanka to discuss the countrys proposed healthcare reforms. The main focus of discussion was the governments policy on the delivery of Universal Health Coverage and how best to implement one of the cornerstones of this policy, an Essential Service Package (ESP), representing a shift in the way healthcare is delivered in Sri Lanka.
The ESP represents a major strengthening of the primary healthcare system of the country. The conference was part of a process that has been going on for a number of months, with consultations on the ESP taking place all over the country.
Inaugurating the conference, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne reminded the audience of over 300 delegates that Sri Lanka boasted a tradition of innovation in healthcare and that there was already considerable momentum behind reorganising the system to meet the changing healthcare needs of the population. Cabinet approval has already been given to this move.

The new approach to healthcare delivery that many delegates called for was underscored by the fact that the conference was run in parallel with the national consultation on the ending of TB and AIDS in Sri Lanka with many of the delegates attending sessions in both

Emerging challenges of an ageing society and non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cancer will need reorganisation of human resources and the ways in which health services are delivered. It will require a change in the mindset of not only healthcare providers but the public at large. Quality, affordable and inter-linked healthcare services need to be delivered close to where people live.
Technical work supporting this policy has been undertaken by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the WHO. Other development partners -- World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the Global Fund -- are supporting this reorganisation.
Dr. Razia Pendse, the WHO representative in Sri Lanka, told the audience that changing demographics and epidemiological challenges meant that the country could no longer afford to carry on business as usual. 
Primary healthcare by design is people-centric and services need to be designed and delivered with focus on people and not individual diseases we need to design these programmes with a people focus rather than being disease focused.
The new approach to healthcare delivery that many delegates called for was underscored by the fact that the conference was run in parallel with the national consultation on the ending of TB and AIDS in Sri Lanka with many of the delegates attending sessions in both. 
WHO Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases, Dr. Ren Minghui emphasised that the twin goals of ending TB and AIDS and strengthening public healthcare were mutually reinforcing and intertwined. He told the audience that Sri Lankas systemic investment in health had achieved much, and had resulted in tangible gains for the country. Strengthening primary healthcare is absolutely essential to make health system sustainable. 
Sri Lankas history of combating communicable disease and success with elimination of many diseases like Malaria, Lymphatic Filariasis and maternal and neonatal tetanus make it one of the leading candidate countries to also end TB and AIDS by 2030. To do that the country needs to take innovative and bold actions.
Reinforcing the governments financial commitment to these changes, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne told the conference delegates that the country was in a commendable position to move forward with primary healthcare reorganisation.

Dr. Susie Perera addressing the conference

By placing a much greater emphasis on the primary system Dr. Paul Nunn, an advisor to the national programme for TB control and chest diseases, was optimistic that the strengthening of the primary healthcare system would be a major step forward in eliminating TB and AIDS from the country with many of the undiagnosed cases being detected by a reinvigorated primary system. 
At the end of the two days, Dr. Susie Perera de Silva, Acting Deputy Director-General (Public Health Services) commented on the success of both the consultation and the conference. A national conversation had started. What everyone was calling for now was nothing short of a paradigm change in the way healthcare in Sri Lanka was delivered. But she believed that the country and the stakeholders supporting it would rise to the challenge.

## Title: International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure

International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure
	

International Infection Prevention Week (IIPV) falls onto the 3rd week of October annually. According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in developing countries and the second major cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, infections have the ability to cause major damage to an individual as well as the society as a whole. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, in this weeks Health Capsule to enlighten readers about the exceedingly timely topic of infection prevention.
Infections
Before talking about prevention of infections, it is important to identify what an infection is. An infection is a disease condition caused by a micro organism which is not visible to the naked eye. Our body contains more micro organisms than it contains human cells, most of which actually help us, so not all these micro organisms are harmful.
Infections can be categorised in a number of ways. These infections can be classified as bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal. They can also be grouped according to the site of the infection; infections in the upper respiratory tract as upper respiratory infections, infections in the urinary tract as urinary infections etc. Infections on the superficial parts of the body are called superficial infections, while the infections in deep structures like bones and joints are called deep infections.

Spread of infection
Infections have survived through the passage of time by spreading from one person to another. Contrary to what people believe in, the mode of the spreading of the disease differs according to the organism and the infection that it causes. Respiratory tract infections are commonly spread through air droplets that are released when the patient coughs or sneezes. Also, if the patient sneezes to the open hand, then shakes hands with another person without washing his hand the second person can get contaminated.
Organisms causing infections in our digestive system commonly enter the body through food and water that are contaminated by infected faecal matter. In addition, flies too can spread infection in the digestive system through contaminating food.
There are infections which are chiefly transmitted through sexual contact. Syphillis, gonrrhoea and HIV are examples.
Some other infections are spread through blood given from outside, as in unsafe transfusions, (which are extremely rare in Sri Lanka due to safety precautions) and in reusing needles contaminated with blood from an infected patient, or in healthcare setting and contaminated needle prick injuries.
There are some other infections where the pathogenic organism is transferred from one persons body to another by a vector. Dengue, which is causing much devastation in our country, and Malaria are examples.

Prevention of infections
As the spread of the infections is individualised to the type of infection, it stands to reason that the methods of prevention of the spread of the organisms also differ according to the infection.
In preventing the spread of respiratory infections and infections like chickenpox which are spread through droplets, its important to avoid crowds where you can infect the others with the disease. Usually the first symptoms to appear in these infections are fever and malaise, so seeking treatment early, getting diagnosed and staying at home in order to take plenty of bed rest are advisable.
Since influenza in most cases resolves on its own, adequate fluid and bed rest bring the best cure. If you have a cough or are sneezing and have to be in the presence of others, the best option is to use a face mask.

Cough etiquette
If you do not have a facemask and have to cough or sneeze in public, you have to follow what is called the Cough etiquette. If you can, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue paper while coughing and sneezing, in order to prevent the droplets from escaping. If you do not have a tissue or a handkerchief, use the back of your arm and not the hands to cover your face, since you can easily contaminate the surfaces that you touch after coughing by accidentally touching them with your hand.

Proper hygiene
Many of the digestive tract infections can be prevented by using proper water sealed toilets, and by washing and drying hands well after using the washroom. Food hygiene is crucial in preventing digestive tract infections. Well cooked, home prepared meals are ideal. Even though salads are good for your health, you have to make sure to clean the raw vegetables thoroughly before preparing salads, especially during the rainy season where the vegetables can be easily contaminated by the flood of dirty water. Keeping the food covered at all times while preparing also will help prevent the contamination of food.
Hands are a major tool that spread infection; therefore hand washing before preparation as well as consumption of meals is important.

Refrigeration
If the food will not be consumed soon after preparation, it is advisable to store them in a refrigerator at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, since in warm countries like Sri Lanka, bacteria can multiply quickly and spoil food. Food can be reheated before they are consumed, but reheating more than once is not recommended. Alternatively, food can be refrigerated and stored in small containers as single helpings, so there is no need of reheating.
Raw food and cooked food should not be shelved near one another because the raw food can contaminate the solid food.

Mosquitoes
In order to prevent vector borne infections like dengue, prevention of the spread of the vector is important. Checking for places where water gets collected in your surroundings and inside your house and destroying them will prevent the growth of mosquitoes through destroyal of their breeding places. While mosquito repellents might help in keeping the vector away, mosquito nets are of not much practical use especially when it comes to Dengue, since the mosquito carrying the dengue virus usually bites humans during day time.

In the hospital
Hospitals are grounds which have a higher risk of giving you an infection, especially because hospitals contain many patients with a variety of infections. Therefore, dont bring young children and immune-compromised people to hospitals unless absolutely necessary. Minimising the contact of the surfaces and objects in the hospital and washing hands soon after returning from the hospital is recommended.
Blood borne infections spread through transfused blood is extremely rare now due to the vigorous screening process of donated blood before transfusing. If you have had an accidental injury from a used needle, or have had high risk sexual behaviours in the past, seeking medical advise immediately is recommended.

Vaccination
Immunization of children from a younger age has helped Sri Lanka prevent many vaccine preventable infections and position us among the developing countries with the best health indicators. Therefore, the timely vaccination of your child is highly recommended. In addition, there are some vaccines available in the private sector like the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, especially for people who have low immune systems.

ISIS took several US & European citizens hostage: Putin
	

(rt.com), 18 October 2018 - The 700 hostages captured in Syria by Islamic State terrorists include US and European citizens and are being killed off 10 people a day, Russiaa President Putin said, criticizing American forces for catastrophic failure.
Islamic State terrorists have delivered ultimatums and made certain demands, threatening  to shoot ten people every day, the Russian leader said, adding that the hostage-takers had already started carrying out their threats and executed ten hostages two days ago.
This is just horrible, it is a catastrophe, Putin said, adding that the US forces that claim to control the area around the east bank of the Euphrates River, relying on the Kurdish armed forces on the ground, stay conspicuously silent on this crisis.
They [the US] have clearly fallen short of their target, Putin said, adding that Washington and its allies apparently failed to combat terrorists in the part of Syria they occupy.

Keeping ends warm with India - EDITORIAL
	
This is a country which is harping on solving its national question; how to find a viable solution to the grievances of the minority Tamils. But despite this question being spoken about in the open, there is a question that seems to be addressed behind closed doors. That question is; how to unite the president and the prime minister
The relationship between Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesignhe was deteriorating over the past several months and reached boiling point just a few days ago.
According to reports tensions rose to the surface at a recent meeting when the President and the Premier disagreed about how to progress with the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port. The Premier informed of his wishes to see the port being developed with Indias aid, but these views were shot down by Sirisena who affirmed that the sea port should be kept within the ambit of Sri Lanka.
These happenings leaking out to the media just prior to the Premiers scheduled visit to India can affect the relationship between the two nations.
Sri Lanka has other reasons to worry about with regard its relations with India. Newspapers were buzzing with the news that about an alleged plot to assassinate President Sirisena. The Presidential Media Division has sent a statement denying that the president had mentioned about an involvement of an Indian Intelligent Service in this regard. In the attempts to do some damage control Sirisena has taken the initiative and got in touch with Modi. Meanwhile the Indian High Commissioner called on Sirisena to seek clarity on the matter.
It is clear that the relationship between the two nations has been healthier after the 2015 presidential elections. India values this healthy relationship and so does Sirisena and Wickremesinghe.
The Premier is hellbent on promoting his ideas to stabilise the depreciating rupee. This is why he wants India to play a huge role in the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port, backing his thinking with the claim that the bulk of the container traffic towards the Colombo Port is originating from Sri Lankas closest neighbour.
Indias interests in Sri Lanka are associated with the Mattala Airport, Palaly Airport, the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port and a Natural Gas Plant in Kerawalapitiya. Premier Wickremesinghes visit to India is aimed at accelerating the progress of East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port.
Both Sirisena and Wickremesinghe have treaded cautiously on the aspect of keeping ends warm with India. The duo is also aware that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also keeps in touch with Indian Premier Narendra Modi. Given this background, the most aggressive claims about the involvement of Indian Intelligence Agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in an assassination attempt in Sri Lanka are being made by the Joint Opposition; a force which is working closely with Mahinda Rajapaksa. India is quite aware of Rajapaksas clout in Sri Lankan politics. Any person with an iota of political knowledge knows that India has a huge interest in who wins the 2020 Presidential Elections.
This story of there being a plot to assassinate the president is being investigated in Sri Lanka and an Indian national was arrested and questioned in this regard.

## Title: Khashoggi killing: We cant worship God and money

Khashoggi killing: We cant worship God and money
	

The United States and Britain killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq and faced no punishment. China has sent one million of its Uyghur population to forced brainwashing camps and dismisses with contempt worldwide criticism. Saudi Arabia massacres children and starves millions of famine-stricken people in Yemen and yet stands tall in world fora. In this horror of rich and arrogant nations crimes, the killing of one journalist may look like no major matter.
The October 2 gruesome killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabias Istanbul consulate underscores the despicable reality behind rules in world politics: The rich and powerful can commit war crimes, kill thousands of people and still strut around as civilised nations commanding respect. International law, rules, United Nations resolutions and sanctions are largely for third world countries like Sri Lanka, Rwanda and Iran.
But mark our words; Saudi Arabia will wriggle out of the crisis, as it has done in the past whenever it had been pushed into a corner. The monarchy loathes democracy and is no respecter of human rights. Even an innocuous tweet can land a Saudi national in jail. Yet every western nation courts its friendship, with an eye on the kingdoms US$ 750 billion reserves.
Since Khashoggi disappeared on Oct 2, no Saudi citizen has opened her or his mouth to condemn the killing though the Saudi journalist was speaking up on their behalf to bring about an element of democracy into the one-family-led feudal form of governance. The Saudis simply say they believe that Khashoggi is still alive somewhere although in their hearts-of-hearts they know the messenger was tortured and killed. They also fear the fate that befell Khashoggi, who was once a close advisor to the royal family, could befall them if they utter a word that does not go with the official statement.
A critic of Saudi Arabias war on Yemen and Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salmans reform process, Khashoggi was named the 2018 Muslim Democrat of the Year by the US-based Centre for Islamic Studies and Democracy. In his acceptance speech in April, he said Saudi Arabias rejection of democracy stemmed from a deep belief that absolute monarchy was the best way of governance.
Khashoggi said democracy in the region was under attack from salafists, extremists, and terror groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda and stressed that the only way out in the Middle East was choosing the path of democracy and getting over sectarianism. Khashoggi said the Gulf nations would keep opposing any democratic movements as the rulers believed that they were hired by God to save these countries.
These views also appeared in his regular column in the Washington Post.
Saudi Arabia does care about its world image. But instead of correcting its ways, it often resorts to hubris, threats and oppression.
In 2006, Saudi Arabia gave the Tony Blair government just ten days to stop a corruption probe launched by Britains Serious Fraud Office. The probe began after evidence emerged that British Aerospace had paid 6 billion pounds to Saudi Royal family members as commissions, to secure a multibillion pound arms deal.
Fearingthe cancellation of the contract described as the biggest [UK] sale ever of anything to anyone, Blair invoked national interest provisions and stopped the probe.That was not the only occasion that Saudi Arabia had flexed his money muscle and political clout. In November last year, Saudi Arabia abducted the prime minister of another country. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri was summoned to Riyadh and kept incommunicado in an undisclosed location until France intervened and secured his release.
In 2016, Saudi Arabia warned the UN that Saudi aid to UN programmes would be stopped if it did not remove Saudi Arabia from a list of nations that had committed war crimes against children. Saudi Arabia has come under severe criticism in human rights circles for its war on Yemen, the poorest Arab nation, where children are caught up in a war that had, in addition to horror and destruction, brought about a famine described as the worst in one hundred years.
Saudi Arabias latest warning is aimed at US President Donald Trump, who is coming under Congressional pressure to take tough action against Saudi Arabia over the murder of Khashoggi. In a puerile bid to show that he was committed to value-based international relations, Trump initially said if the allegations were true, Saudi Arabia would be punished. When Saudi Arabia warned whatever measures the US would take would be met by more severe measures  meaning Saudis by curtailing oil production can let world oil prices shoot up to as much as US$ 400 a barrel  the US President yielded to pressure. He seemed to endorse now the Saudi Arabias narration that Khashoggi could have been killed by rogue killers during the interrogation that went wrong. He dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh for talks with King Salman and Crown Prince Muhammad, may be to work out a way out of the crisis, and to ensure that the Saudi contracts, especially the arms deals, are safe. When urged to stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Trump rejected the call, saying the Saudis would then go to Russia or China.
In a strange coincidence, the day Khashoggi walked into the consulate and into the trap set up by his killers, President Trump in an insulting tone told a campaign rally in Mississippi that Saudi Arabia and its King would not last two weeks in power without American military support and urged the kingdom to pay more for its own defence.
Trump meant business and wanted Saudi money, more of it. Trumps first visit overseas as US president was to Saudi Arabia where he signed US$ 400 billion worth of deals, of which arms purchases accounted for US$ 110 billion. In all probability, the rich nations which salivate over Saudi billions will make sure that Saudi Arabia is left off the hook, may be with mild censure, though this does not augur well for a rule-based international order.
Though the Saudi king carries the title of the servant of Islams holiest places to give some legitimacy to the royal familys claims for the divine right to rule, the rulers have long deviated from the Islamic principles of peace, justice, human rights and good governance. Can they justify the killing of children in Yemen as Islamic Saudi clerics who are quick to condemn other forms of Islam as bida or latter day innovations, conveniently forget that monarchical rule does not conform to the Prophet Muhammads teachings and the practice of his immediate successors, who upheld meritocracy and the spirit of democracy.

## Title: Mahinda Rajapaksas fringe factor

Mahinda Rajapaksas fringe factor
	


It is common knowledge that the JO is nothing without the Rajapaksas
Now the momentum is with those who exist outside the parliament
One simple truism is that people have lost faith in traditional institutions


D.B.S. Jeyaraj, writing on the meeting between Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena held some three weeks ago, suggests that in the coming weeks, G. L. Peiris, the de jure leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), will hand over the party leadership to Rajapaksa, the de facto leader. This will, he further opines, give the man enough clout to negotiate and, presumably, to settle those personality clashes that have widened the rifts within the SLPP. All things considered, these three months hence would probably be determined by the moves the joint opposition makes and the retaliatory measures the United National Party takes. In that sense, the tte--tte between the President and his erstwhile rival is both an expedient move and an exercise in futility.
It is common knowledge that the JO is nothing without the Rajapaksas. G. L. Peiris is the most eloquent parliamentarian we have, but eloquence, no matter how much of an advantage it may be inside parliament, pales in comparison to popularity from outside that hallowed institution. It is of course convenient to say that the SLPP doesnt have much of a presence within the confines of the Diyawanna Oya and that what little parliamentary prestige it has managed to conjure up for itself has been due to the Rajapaksa Factor. And yet, that is the truth.
Given these reduced circumstances, what is out there for the SLPP
In 2015, the political dichotomies were clear: the SLFP and the UNP on one side, the Rajapaksa Proxies on another, the JVP and the TNA on yet another. When the TNA took over the Opposition and the leader of the JVP became Chief Opposition Whip, those were reduced to two; those for the Rajapaksas and those against them.
What 2015 did was create a gulf between parliamentary prestige and populist protest. The lack of disregard for parliamentary procedure, the emphasis on rhetoric over substance, and the demonstrations against the legislature (as an institution, not just a party-driven political body) echoed and spearheaded by the JO made it clear that the real fight was between the MPs, who had been elected, and the stalwarts of the old order, who were being supported on the sidelines. There was a fatal rift, for the latter, between numerical strength and popular appeal. That rift continues even today.
The Rajapaksas were smart. They still are. With each of the three main brothers, the organisers of their party sought to appeal to three different interests. Mahindas appeal was with the rural peasantry. Gotabayas appeal was with what I alluded to in certain articles last year as the professional nationalists, the milieu which had supported the Hela Urumaya and was now disenchanted with the likes of Patali Champika Ranawaka. Basil Rajapaksas appeal, on the other hand, was with a business class touted as nationalist by some, but which in reality idealised a blend of ruthless authoritarianism and efficiency that the Rajapaksas as a whole (allegedly) stood for. In other words, Mahinda would get the village, Gotabaya would get the suburbs around Colombo, and Basil would plan out everything with business moguls and financiers, to the dot.
Obviously, this formula did not and could not work in a context where people looked up to the policies of the current government and their implementation. From 2015 to the latter half of 2016, those who had idealised the government on the basis of how it privileged policy over rhetoric really believed it could deliver. That was why, when Ranil Wickremesinghe and his cohorts contended that Sri Lanka was in danger of falling into a middle income trap and the Rajapaksas had empowered the middle class without setting barricades against the inflationary pressures this would result in, we placed our faith in the Cabinet he and the President had formed.
But then, so in 2017, that rift between mass popularity and parliamentary presence began to work the other way around, for the JO.

It began when the people realised that the current government was not implementing those policies it had harped on and was content on spreading its own gospel

It began when the people realised that the current government was not implementing those policies it had harped on and was content on spreading its own gospel. A population that had been taught about good governance, constitutional reforms and sanhindiyawa began to grow tired. The middle class, the force behind the campaign to get Maithripala Sirisena elected, shifted gears. It had taken a risk and rooted for a maverick, when traditionally it had opted for stability and continuity. That maverick had clipped his own powers and handed over the legislature to a party that had NOT won a mandate to govern from that institution. Worse, his programme, overseen by that very same party, had begun to unravel itself badly.
Our middle class thus did what it was destined to do. Hedge its bets on the only movement that could take us back to the way things were. That movement was not the JVP. It was not the TNA, not the JHU or for that matter not the Frontline Socialist Party either. It was the joint opposition. Having re-branded itself as the Podu Jana Peramuna, it thus soon began to capture the middle class, hitherto the preserve of the UNP and, at least with respect to its more nationalist segment, the Hela Urumaya.
The apathy of the government, the even more pathetic apathy of the Opposition (to call it an Opposition would be to insult the legacy of poorly equipped Oppositions the UNP bequeathed to this country during the Rajapaksa years), and the silence of those ideologues hostile to the Rajapaksas and their brand of nationalism all conspired to empower the SLPP to get in more and more of this particular demographic.
The mainstream polity ridiculed the JO and the SLPP for not having the numbers. That is a problem it is still afflicted with. But as the local elections showed, parliamentary presence can be a poor barricade against popular revolt.
It took an entire week for the storm, that the SLPPs upset victory brought about, to go away. A complacent government that had prepared itself for an insignificant margin of defeat (even those rooting for the Podu Jana Peramuna prepared themselves for a UNP victory) saw the front against the Rajapaksas that had held them together wear away, and eventually collapse. Never again would the President and the Prime Minister look at each other. After their clash, each would let it out that the other would be nothing without him politically: the Prime Minister, because he had to depend on the President for his return to parliament; the President, because without the UNP, he could not have been the common candidate. Talk about the power of fringe parties.
There was another factor. The rise of the Alt-Right. Whether or not commentators are correct in terming Gotabaya Rajapaksa a neo-fascist who should be condemned on the same terms that (neo)liberals condemn Hitler and Caligula with, theres no denying that Donald Trump, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson made it possible for people to see things differently. The world, until then, had been largely determined by globalist financiers who supported centrists no different to the warmongers they were opposed to (a claim made not just by right wing conspiracy theorists and outfits like Breitbart, by the way). A world in which Obama was championed as a President for Peace thus grew disenchanted when, even with the hullaballoo against Donald Trump, it became evident this peace-loving leader of the free world had vastly expanded his countrys drone program. The movement against the interests he stood for, predictably, emerged from outside the Congress, even outside the Republican Party. We know by now what happened later to both ends of the mainstream political spectrum.
What does all this amount to One simple truism; the people have lost faith in the traditional institutions. In 2015, the momentum around the world was such that it was inconceivable that people could vote for a Donald Trump. The faith reposed on the three arms of the state, so strong then, was a legacy of the liberal tradition of the West, the same tradition the UNP sought to impose here in the name of democracy, freedom, and a better deal for everyone. In the end, tragically, all that failed.
The rift between fringe popularity and parliamentary presence befitted the political establishment in a world where liberalism trumped everything else. But we live in different times. Now the momentum is with those who exist outside the parliament. It is with those who can compensate for lack of parliamentary prestige with numbers drawn from outside the legislature. For now at least, that momentum belongs to the SLPP. And behind them, supporting them, there is, not the peasantry the Rajapaksas have always counted on, but a terribly disillusioned middle class.

Most Ven. Brahmanagama Muditha Maha Thera :  A visionary  for all seasons
	

A distinguished Sanghapitru, a father among the Sangha and an erudite scholar
	
	Certainly not the average taskmaster monk who was no fun
	
	Acclaimed in North America as a temple builder and a veritable temple troubleshooter
	
	His sagacity resolved the issues plaguing Hilda Jayawardhanaramayain Ottawa


A distinguished Sanghapitru, a father among the Sangha, an erudite scholar and a sagacious Buddhist monk, Bhante Muditha, is one of the leading Sri Lankan Buddhist monks in the West who has been engaged in Buddhist missionary work among Buddhist communities across North America for over two decades. 
Today, whatever I am, whatever I have accomplished as a simple Buddhist monk, I owe it all to Bhante Mudithas caring, continued guidance and spiritual direction.
Bhante Muditha indeed lives up to his name, Muditha which means feeling happy and joyous at accomplishments and successes of ones fellow beings. Bhante Muditha had recruited over 20 young Sri Lankan monks, thus opening opportunities for them to be actively engaged in Buddhist missionary service and propagation of Dhamma in North America who are doing well today and have brought honour and respect to Sri Lanka and the temples they serve. I, his student from the age 10, am so very fortunate to be one among them-then and now as well!
His elevation to the prestigious rank of the CHIEF SANGHA NAYAKA OF CANADA by the Supreme Sangha Karaka Sabha of the Kotte Samagri Sangha Sabha of the Syamopali Maha Chapter comes at a time in North America when his guidance and counsel are most needed, especially in terms of the increasing numbers of North American seekers of Buddha Dhamma flocking to our Buddhist temples for spiritual guidance both in the USA and in Canada. Today we salute the Most Ven.
Brahmanagama Muditha Maha Thera in filial veneration and wish him our congratulatory blessings!
Born on October 10, 1952 in the village of Brahmanagama in the Colombo District, Bhante Muditha, in his late teens - at the dawn of the flowering season of his adolescence - when youthful fantasies and ambitions become a teenagers priority - had made a firm commitment to dedicate himself to the Buddha Sasana and sought ordination as a Samanera - a novice - postulant to Monkhood. After two years of rigorous training, Bhante Muditha received UPASAMPADA or higher ordination on June 25, 1972 under the Upadhyayaship (Preceptorship) of the late Most Venerable Mawittara Ariyawamsa Maha Thera, with the Most Venerable Anu Nayaka, Kirulapone Somananda Maha Thera and the Most Venerable Paragastota Piyarathana Maha Thera participating as co- preceptors.

Bhante Muditha had recruited over 20 young Sri Lankan monks, thus opening opportunities for them to be actively engaged in Buddhist missionary service and propagation of Dhamma in North America who are doing well today and have brought honour and respect to Sri Lanka and the temples they serve

Bhante Muditha was sent to the Monastic College of Higher Studies, the Maharagama Vajiragnana Dharmayathanaya in the suburbs of Colombo, founded by his eminence and the supreme head of the Amarapura Nikaya, the Most Venerable Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayaka Thera (rector) and the Most Venerable Ampitiye Sri Rahula Maha Thera (Principal of the Monastic College). Having graduated from college, Bhante Muditha was managing the Kandy branch of the college at the Primrose Garden Monastery located in the idyllic and salubrious eastern hills of Kandy training novices/samaneras and newly-ordained Bhikkhus.
It was in 1985 that I met Bhante Muditha for the first time; myself, a ten-year-old samanera postulant from the city of Chittagong in Bangladesh. 
The Most Venerable Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayaka Thera and the Most Venerable Ampitiye Sri Rahula Maha Thera had assigned Bhante Muditha to take care of us, the novices.
In those tender years of my life, but for Bhante Mudithas loving, caring guidance and his endearing ways, most likely, I would not have survived. Amid a terrible feeling of loneliness far away and far removed from my parents and family in a strange land with strange people who spoke a different language, it was our Muditha Hamuduruwo who brought us up playing, an impossible double role of being both a father and a mother to us at that age when we could not do many things ourselves without help. He taught us how to keep our bodies, the environment, the dormitories, refectory and the shrine rooms, halls and the garden etc., clean...
When it was bath time and the taps didnt function well, himself pouring water over our heads and bathing us! He washed our robes, a thing I could hardly handle at ten! He taught us good habits, good manners, those important rules of etiquette, how to talk, exchange pleasantries, how to respect one another and especially the elders, and the rubrics of rituals and committing to memory the Suttas and the Chant (Pirith) and how to preach a sermon or homily and so on and on...! But above all, he taught us the vernacular (Sinhala), the language of the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka starting with the first letter of the Sinhala alphabet, then, Pali, the canonical language and even Sanskrit.
Bhante Muditha proved to be the greatest teacher Ive ever had, given those difficult, growing years of my life. Hes also the most disciplined and no-nonsense, yet the most compassionate and the most lenient teacher I had ever known! He was certainly not the average taskmaster monk who was no fun! We treated Bhante Muditha with such awe that to be punished by him for some misdeed was considered a privilege!
Bhante Muditha is a born teacher! When I sat for the Praacina Panditha examination and the results came and found that I had achieved a First Class Honours, with the award of the Rajakiya (Royal) Pandith title! It was the happiest day of my life! My gratitude overflowing, I remember rushing to Bhante Muditha to break the good news and worshiping at his feet in filial love and reverence! 
In the end, thanks to Bhante Muditha, to my own surprise, I found myself totally transformed into a perfect Sinhala Sri Lankan, although the notion of my Bengali identity as a citizen of Bangladesh lay intact and competing, perhaps, dormant...!
Bhante Muditha arrived at Los Angel is Buddhist Vihara USA in 1989 as an assistant monk in residence helping its Viharadhipathi, Venerable Ahangama Dhammarama Nayaka Thera in the task of erecting the temple at a new site. 
In 1992, invited by the Most Ven. Kulugammana Dhammawasa Nayaka Thera, Viharadhipathi of the West End Buddhist Temple and Meditation Centre, and the Most Ven. Dr. Madawela Punnaji Maha Thera, designated Foreign Missions Director, Bhante Muditha who knew both the monks well from the Dharmayathanaya College days lost no time showing up in Toronto from LA in good time for the launch of the new vihara which was then located in an apartment complex. Bhante Muditha was present at the newly-founded.
West End Temples dedication and blessings in February 1993, presided over by his eminence, the Most Venerable Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayaka Maha Thera. The West End Buddhist Temple honours the three venerable co-founders of the West End Buddhist Temple and Meditation Centre as its THRIMURTHI! 
In 1995, at the suggestion of Bhante Brahmanagama Muditha Maha Thera, who was the Deputy Administrator of the West End Buddhist Temple & Meditation Centre, Viharadhipathi, Ven. Dhammawasa Nayaka Thera invited me to join the West End Buddhist Temple as monk in residence and to pursue secular education at the prestigious University of Toronto where I did my undergraduate, graduate and doctoral studies.
Bhante Muditha is widely known here in North America as a temple builder and a veritable temple troubleshooter! I have heard some comparing him to a king maker who never aspires to be the king! Such is the exemplary spirit of humility of our Muditha Hamuduruwo!

Bhante Muditha proved to be the greatest teacher Ive ever had, given those difficult, growing years of my life. Hes also the most disciplined and no-nonsense, yet the most compassionate and the most lenient teacher I hadever known!

In the mid 90s, while he was the Deputy Administrator of the West End Buddhist Temple in Mississauga, he was assigned the task of looking after the USA Buddhist community. Bhante Muditha moved to the city of Detroit in 1997 and established the now thriving Great Lakes Buddhist Vihara in Michigan, USA.
In 2008, when Ottawas first Theravada temple, The Hilda Jayawardhanaramaya had hit hard times and its devotees sought help from the West End Buddhist Temple, it was Bhante Mudithas sagacity/wisdom and counsel that resolved the issues plaguing the said temple. There a number of temples in the USA and Canada that run under his guidance. 
Not very long ago, a friend-writer drew my attention to an article he had written on The Fatherhood of Lord Buddha! appearing in the West End Buddhist Temple Journal which took me back to my own childhood and tender teens in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka . A great article it was! The article noted that in Sri Lankan Buddhist literature and lore, in common parlance and even in the scriptures, Budhuhamuduruwo had been referred to as Budhu Piya - Father - and Budhu-Meniyo - Mother..! Along with it, he had included this poem by an unknown author:-

FATHERHOOD
Where Father is, theres Love!
When our hearts are light,
The Day is Bright!
With Fathers Love, theres a song
We knew that nothing will go wrong
With his Love, theres always a smile
To make things worthwhile!
With his Love theres quiet and peace;
Yea! We are in a place where turmoils cease!
Once in a while we may be out of touch
But Father would help shape us and do so much!
Father is ones best friend tried and true
Someone we can tell our troubles to!
Father! We never yearned for riches or silver and gold
The treasures you have given me cannot be bought or sold!


This beautiful poem is the very epitome of the Most Ven. Brahmanagama Muditha Maha Thera - embodying his great sterling, Buddha-like virtues that have always been an inspiration to me! 
Yea, we monks dont cry even for joy! So, venerable sir, to YOU - joyously and gratefully, with a tear or two I cannot hide - my guru and mentor, in filial devotion, to YOU I offer this Pooja in veneration in the shrine of my heart! May you deign to accept my poor offering! May YOU live long by the grace of the Noble Triple Gem!
(The writer is The Urban Buddhist Monk, Founder and President of Canada: A Mindful and Kind Nation.
Resident Monk of the West End Buddhist Temple and Meditation Centre, Mississauga, Canada)

MRs confirms judicial independence under this Govt: Ajith P
	
Responding to former president Mahinda Rajapaksas remarks on the Court acquitting former MP Johnston Fernando, State Minister Ajith P. Perera said it showed Mr.Rajapaksa had admitted to the fact that the judiciary independent under this government.
He told a news briefing held at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry that Mr.Rajapaksa and his supporters repeatedly claimed that the judiciary was not independent today and was unduly influenced by the government and therefore they did not trust it.
Both Mahinda and Johnston have now given a certificate of praise to the judiciary. We appreciate and thank them for confirming the independency of the judiciary under this government, the state minister said.
He said the people now realised that the law was being enforced equally without any consideration to wealth or status and that the former presidents statement confirmed it.
The State Minister said he was happy that Mr. Fernando was acquitted of all charges following a proper investigation and trial.
He said there were some 120 important cases of fraud and corruption and 20 of them were in the High Court while the rest were pending indictments.
The people can judge who are guilty and who are innocent when these cases are heard soon. The advantage of hearing these cases daily is that the witnesses will not forget their evidence, the state minister said.
He said there was only one special high court out of the proposed requested Justice & Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorale to set up the rest as early as possible.
To increase the efficiency of the judiciary, the number of High Court judges has been increased to 110 from 75. The number of State counsel at the Attorney Generals Department has been increased from 118 to 218. Their salaries and allowances have also been increased. The Special High Court system to hear the cases daily has been implemented. All these measure have been adopted by the present government to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, he said.
The state minister recalled how the previous administration had insulted and humiliated the then Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake before a committee was appointed to review the charges against her.
He said MP Wimal Weerawansa was also a member of that committee.
He highlighted the fact that the unity government was able to implement good governance and that the former presidents statement confirmed it. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Myths and Misconceptions about Kuja Dosha

Myths and Misconceptions about Kuja Dosha
	

Kuja Dosha which means Mars blemish or the malefic influence of Mars, has been a much-discussed subject in astrological circles for ages.
The question of Kuja Dosha often arises in the context of ascertaining the compatibility of a young couple for embarking on matrimony.

How Kuja Dosha occurs
It is widely accepted that Kuja Dosha arises when Mars is placed in certain Houses in the Rashi Chart. These House are the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th and the 12th.

Differences of opinion
Kuja Dosha also widely referred to as Mangalik Dosha or Bhauma Dosha has also been an issue that has been the subject matter for debate among prominent astrologers in India in particular for years. These astrologers have differed in their opinion on certain factors causing this Dosha, mitigating and nullifying it depending on their experience in practice and their interpretation of the principles relating to it enunciated in classical works. However, they all are one in the conclusion about the arising of this Dosha due to Mars being placed in certain Houses in a Natal Chart.

Misconceptions and misinterpretations
Kuja Dosha, in fact, is a household word for people in this country. It is our experience that misinterpretations relating to the existence of this Dosha continue to cause much unnecessary anxiety to young men and women, young couples in love as well as parents of children in marriageable age in this country. Therefore, it is an imperative for students of Astrology as well as lay persons to have a general understanding about the factors causing Kuja or Bhauma Dosha and those mitigating or nullifying its effects.
The Kuja Dosha both real and perceived may have made the bliss of marriage elusive for umpteen numbers of young men and women in India and Sri Lanka where people set much store by Astrology. However, what is to be regretted is that the misinterpretation of Kuja Dosha by certain irresponsible astrologers may have been the cause for the heartbreak of millions of young men and women by preventing them from tying the nuptial knot to lead a successful married life. 

No marital happiness sans a strong Mars
What is ironic is , however, is that although Kuja or Mars can become an enemy to some young men and women looking forward to matrimony, no marriage would be a success either if Kuja is weak or debilitated in ones Natal Chart. For Kuja is the giver of energy, vitality and dynamism without which no marriage could be a success.
Despite the sharp increase in love marriages in recent times where the practice of matching horoscopes is overlooked, still there are many young men and women who make it a point to have the compatibility with the intended partner is assessed by an astrologer before the marriage.

Cases where anxiety is unfounded
It is evident from the numerous queries we receive from parents as well as young men and women that Kuja Dosha has caused them much anxiety and many cases their anxiety is unfounded. Very often it appears that they are misled by misinterpretations of relevant Astrological principles.

Factors nullifying and counteracting Kuja Dosha
When a young couple is looking forward to leading a happy life together, it would be tragic if their treasured dream is shattered by the prospect of Kuja Dosha coming in their way. However, happily there are many astrological factors that counteract or nullify that Kuja Dosha.
Following are some of the planetary positions that neutralize the Kuja Dosha.
Mars receiving the strong aspect of Jupiter, Venus, strong moon or mercury
	Mars associated with one or more benefics in the same house or the sign
	A strong Jupiter occupying the Lagna
	A benefic occupying a Kendra or a quadrant in exaltation or in his own House
	Lagnadhipati the lord of the Ascendant being aspected by benefics without being subject to the aspect of a malefic or malefics
	Mars in his own sign Aries or Scorpio
	Mars in the 4th House when Aquarius is the Lagna
	The 8th House being where Pisces or Sagittarius sign falls
	Mars in the 7th House when Cancer or Capricorn happens to be the Lagna
	Mars in Capricorn or in Leo.

O! They are above the law!
	

This character, a typical political hanger-on, who was functioning as the Public Relations Officer of a political authority, while driving an official vehicle worth Rs. 15 million had sent it crashing on to a roadside tree causing it extensive damage though he had escaped unscathed. The man had been found fully soaked at the time of the accident.

The mans boss, the political high-up, who failed to hold an inquiry into the accident resulted from his reckless driving, had later appointed him as a director of a development project and given him a new vehicle.
The Ministry authorities concerned too had failed to make any inquiry about the State-owned vehicle damaged in the accident and some sources say it had disappeared after the accident.
The sidekick of the political high-up, who has got a new vehicle for his exclusive use after being kicked upstairs, persists with the habit of driving while being drunk, they say.

Presidents security tightened over alleged death plot
	
Security for Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has been stepped up following the discovery of an alleged plot to assassinate him, two of his advisers said on Thursday.
An Indian national, named by Indian and Sri Lankan media as M Thomas from the southern state of Kerala, was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the plot on September 22. Former Sri Lankan defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also a target, a police officer said.
The president is very serious about this, Shiral Lakthialaka, one of the advisers, told reporters in Colombo.
People in charge have taken measures to strengthen his security. Certainly his security has been beefed up. We need a broad investigation into this. The alleged plot first emerged in late September after a police informant called Namal Kumara published a telephone recording between him and a senior police officer where he said there was a plan to kill Sirisena.
It is not clear whether there are any other individuals that are alleged to be involved.
The plot briefly threatened to cause tension between Sri Lanka and its much larger neighbour India, after a report that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence services of involvement - a claim that New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.
India's The Hindu newspaper said on Tuesday that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of being involved in the plot.
Both Sirisena's office and Sri Lanka's foreign ministry have denied he made the comments.
The office of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said in a statement on Wednesday that Sirisena had called him to say the allegation he had accused RAW were utterly baseless and false.
A coalition between Sirisena's centre-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's centre-right United National Party (UNP) has grown increasingly strained in recent months.
Both coalition partners suffered heavy defeats in local elections in February, and Sirisena loyalists backed a no-confidence motion in April against the prime minister, who survived after a majority of legislators voted to support his coalition government.

Some elements trying to belittle probe: Presidential Advisors
	
Two Presidential advisors yesterday charged that there was an attempt by certain politicians and officials to belittle the investigations into the alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithjripala Sirisena and former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and thereby thwart the successful conclusion of the probe.
Presidential Advisor Shiral Laktilaka said though there was steady progress in the investigations, there were also attempts at the same time by certain sections to make it seem there was nothing to investigate and that police informer Namal Kumara was not a credible person.
Addressing the media in Colombo last afternoon, Mr. Laktilaka questioned as to why certain politicians put aspersions on police investigations and the Government Analyst's work.
We never say, to fully believe what Namal Kumara says. At the same time we request not to judge his exposure with his character and behaviour. Take the substance of what he has said and carry out the inquiries on these statements until the police find the absolute truth behind those utterances. Then the law can take its course and take legal action against those who attempted the plot, he stressed.
Until then no one must come to conclusions on the authenticity or falsehood of the alleged assassination plot and disrupt the investigations and added if the plot was real there may be political or other motives for the crime.
Director General of the SLF, Sarath Kongahage said the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike was assassinated by those who could not do business they wanted under the late Prime Minister.
Soon after the killing the understanding among politicians and the public was that it was a political killing. But, later it was proved that the motive was to revenge for not helping business of some powerful figures that day. Same could happen at this attempt also, Mr. Kongahage stressed.
He also requested not to attempt to sabotage the police investigations by spreading false information and putting aspersions on inquiries. There may be a real attempt on the lives of President and Gotabaya. Please let the law enforcement officers to do their job and expose those involved if any. What we need is only the absolute truth and expose, he added.
He said President Sirisena was also concerned on the allegations and wanted to know the truth behind it.
Asked as to the politicians who wanted to show that there was no conspiracy at all, Mr. Kongahage said probably on both sides, in the government as well as in the opposition.
We will never ever let this to be swept under the carpet and say there was no attempt on the lives of President and Mr. Rajapaksa, he emphasized. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lankan Cricket is going backwards: Mahela
	
Sri Lankan Cricket is going backwards and right now it is right at the bottom, Mahela Jayawardene has told Sky Sports.
"We are going backwards from where we were and right now we are right at the bottom, which shows in our ranking," Jayawardene has said.
Speaking exclusively to Sky Sports Cricket's Ian Ward and Nasser Hussain, Jayawardene said:
"What you have to realise is that it has not gone into the fixing allegation yet - it is just not co-operating.
"So we just need to wait and see where this is heading. You have to give the benefit of the doubt but at the same time it is disappointing.
"You had these guys who were trusted to do a job and to not be able to deliver for your country is a huge disappointment.
"If you don't get this right, if there are any of those things happening in that dressing room or around it, you need to clean it up completely. That should be the starting point.
"Forget about the cricket you play out in the middle. There is no trust in that dressing room if those things are happening. I think the coaching staff and the management are important as well - try to sweep it out.
"It should happen quickly as well. It shouldn't take six to eight months because that is going to directly impact how the Sri Lankan team is going to perform out there because there are a lot of young players, not many senior heads who have played 10 or 15 years.
"You need to start at some point and I think, rightly or wrongly, for these things to come out is a good thing for Sri Lanka - I don't think it's a distraction. It's a positive thing.
"If that's the reason the performance is getting affected, or there's no unity in the dressing room or there isn't the culture there was before, then try to sort that out so we can start planning going forward," he said.

Terrorism charge against SL student dropped
	
Australian Police on Friday dropped terrorism charges against Sri Lankan students in Sydney, Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen, who was accused of an assassination plot targeting Australian politicians, Australian media reported.
Nizamdeen, a 25-year-old PhD student, was charged with creating a document in connection with preparing for a terrorist act but was released on bail on September 28 after spending four weeks behind bars.
Lawyer of the student said that they will now seek students legal costs and compensation.
Mr Nizamdeen, a contractor at the University of NSW, was not present in Sydney's Central Local Court on Friday when prosecutors withdrew the charge after which his lawyer, Moustafa Kheir, said he would apply for his legal costs as well as take action in the NSW Supreme Court.
"What authorities have done to this young man is absolutely unforgivable," Mr Kheir told reporters outside the court.
"We will be seeking justice for him in the NSW Supreme Court SBC news agency said quoting Kheir.
"It's a terrible experience, as a young man who has done everything right in life, he has gone through supermax jail in unforgivable circumstances."
Mr Nizamdeen's costs application was set down for hearing on November 23 in Central Local Court, his lawyer told reporters.
Nizamdeen spent about last four weeks in jail before being bailed last month. His family and supporters maintained his innocence, and the case prompted protests in his hometown in Sri Lanka.
Nizamdeen is in Australia on a student visa while he completes his studies.
He had no criminal history, and he was promoted by the University of New South Wales in its advertising. Nizamdeen also worked as a contractor for the university.
A court earlier heard that no extremist material was found on his computer or mobile phone.

Thebuwana incident A case  of misconceptions and emotional trauma

While I was there we were attacked by the LTTE in 1990 during a training class.

	According to the law of the Police when a case is ongoing, the relevant official doesnt receive promotions or salary increments


The Police have been in the news during the past few days with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) himself making headlines as a result of his behaviour. Amid such a backdrop, another case of a law enforcement officer behaving in an unruly manner, this time as sergeant, was reported from Thebuwana. Sergeant Sanath Gunawardana is an individual who has joined the Police with determination to stand before the principles of the department. For an individual who has served Sri Lanka Police for 29 years getting promoted to a higher rank and the upgrading of payment are possibilities. But in the case of Sergeant Gunawardana it is not so. Held in captivity by the LTTE and after being jailed as a suspect during a firing incident followed by an interdiction, Sanath Gunawardana has remained stuck in the rank of sergeant for the past 27 years. Adding to his emotional pain was the recent incident where he was accused even after doing his duty. What happened after the incident made him observe the limits of what he could endure. Could it have been a misconception after all TheDailymirror sheds light on the incident as follows :

What made me angry was the fact that I felt embarrassed when I was being scolded in front of the Mathugama Police OIC and the general public. What did I do to deserve such treatment After all I was doing my duty
Sergeant Gunawardana

The incident

On September 23, Sergeant Sanath Gunawardana apprehended another vehicle that was transporting sand without a valid permit. Sergeant Gunawardana would have expected the law to be enforced against the vehicle owner and the businessman, but things happened otherwise. Although it was reported that the Officer-In-Charge had to release the vehicle upon being pressured by individuals in power, it doesnt seem to be the case. However, the Daily Mirror learns that the OIC had tried to settle things in a rather diplomatic manner when the Sergeant decided to go berserk. Since no action was taken to file a case against the vehicle owner, Sergeant Gunawardana decided to take a weapon in his hand in response to the injustice he had faced. Armed with a T56 assault rifle, the Sergeant had initially become vociferous in front of the OICs office and aimed the rifle at the OIC before going towards the town. Subsequently, he was arrested and produced before the Mathugama Magistrate. Following the incident he was interdicted while the Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Madduma Bandara instructed officials to submit a report in relation to the Sergeants mental state. However he was released a few days ago and in response to the incident, the President handed a sum of Rs. One million to the Sergeant who was later reinstated at work.

Sergeant and 44 others were heldin captivityfor four years

I joined the police during the JVP riots and amid a backdrop where those who joined the Police and Army were threatened with death, Sergeant Gunawardana reminisced during an interview with the Daily Mirror. This was back in 1989 and after passing out from the Police Training Centre in Kalutara, I started work at the Bambalapitiya Police Station. From there I went to the Oddusudan Police Station during December 1989. While I was there we were attacked by the LTTE in 1990 during a training class. The terrorists released the Tamil and Muslim police officers and held myself and 26 other Sinhala officers in captivity, he recalled.

But he had gone to High Courts since he has an ongoing case. We had to wait and by this time the owner got angry and in turn had complained to the Mathugama Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). When the ASP asked me what had happened I said that the permit is valid, but I needed to show it to the Sergeant
OIC U. Arulanandam

Following that incident, the Sergeant and 44 others were held in captivity for four years. We were then taken to a camp in Mallavi where we were blindfolded and asked to wear sarongs. Once again we were taken to another camp in Thunukkai. Our heads were shaved so they could identify us in the event we escaped. When they remove our blindfolds we noticed that we were in a large hall. There were blood stains and body parts everywhere. We knew it was a torture chamber because there were blood drenched Army uniforms all over the place, he said.
From then onwards, the Sergeant had spent most of his life in hunger and pain. Although he never expected to be released, they were freed in 1994 after they went on a hunger strike. After I was released, I returned to the Kalutara Police Station, he continued. Then in 1995 a Sinhala-Muslim riot took place in Kalutara and while trying to solve the issue, four Muslims were killed. Following this myself and few others were remanded because although we were following the orders of the Officer In Charge, who worked back then, the courts took the stance that such an order wasnt given. The case is still continuing. With that I was interdicted for one and a half years and after being reinstated I worked at Jaffna, Kankasanthurai, Delft, Kopai and Kayts Police stations before I was shifted to Payagala. Then I was at the Kalutara-North Police Station, Cinnamon Gardens and Wadduwa before I was transferred to Thebuwana in 2016. So from then till now I have been working there, he said.

But because we couldnt find him anywhere and because the owner was wasting time we released the vehicle. Since the owner had complained about Sergeant to the Mathugama ASP, Sergeant Gunawardana had to go and give a statement there
OIC U. Arulanandam

We joined the Police because we had that spirit in us, he said when asked why he wanted to join the Police during the riots. Sergeant Gunawardana has a long history with the Police and also carries gruesome memories while he being held in captivity by terrorists.
The LTTE treated us inhumanely, he recalled. For them we were political prisoners and they tortured us from the beginning. When their camps were attacked by the Army, we were beaten till blood oozed out of our bodies. But when more Army personnel were killed in an attack, they would rejoice and would share food with us as well. We were chained from head to toe and there were times when all of us were chained together. It was a dark episode in all our lives, he said.
When asked about injustices he has faced, Sergeant Gunawardana referred to the incident in Kalutara. That changed my life because I was transferred and experienced much issues. Even though we were held in captivity by the LTTE, our service was never appreciated. But when Chandrika Kumarathunga was the President we were given one lakh and I was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. Hence for the past 27 odd years I have remained in this rank and havent got a promotion because of the ongoing court case. According to the law of the Police when a case is ongoing, the relevant official doesnt receive promotions or salary increments, he said.
Speaking about the recent incident, Sergeant Gunawardana said that the sand lorry was at the Police station for a long time and the case wasnt heard in courts.
What made me angry was the fact that I felt embarrassed when I was being scolded in front of the Mathugama Police OIC and the general public. What did I do to deserve such treatment After all I was doing my duty. This compelled me to take the weapon in hand. When the vehicle was released I felt rather discouraged because even after performing my duty I didnt get the backup to proceed with the case, he said.
According to Sergeant Gunawardana, illegal sand mining takes place every now and then and he has even gone the extra mile to report such incidents to the subject minister himself. He has three children and the salary he earns is insufficient as he has to spend for the court case.
I havent received the reinstatement letter as yet, but I will report to work soon, he continued with a smile. Im not on bad terms with anybody. I voiced against the injustice I faced and the public responded to it. As a police officer the way I behaved was inappropriate, but I didnt have anybody to relate the emotional pain I was experiencing. The fact that I never was appreciated during war heroes commemorations, Remembrance Day or any other function affected me a lot. All those officers who were released are now serving in top ranks while I remain a Sergeant. But my message to fellow officers is not to become aggressive during these situations.
There will be officers who will listen to you so reach out to them. Talk about any differences you have with someone before coming into conclusions and taking hasty decisions, he advised.

The President handing a sum of Rs. One million to a member of the Sergeants family

Disciplinary action against OIC
Deputy Minister of Public Administration, Law and Order Nalin Bandara said that the reports regarding the investigation are available. According to the reports we will take disciplinary action against the OIC. In these kind of situations we have to consider both sides to the incident. The way the Sergeant behaved was inappropriate and the way the senior officers responded to it was also wrong. We cannot come into blind conclusions without knowing the facts, said Bandara.
He further said that the Government hopefully will be able to put a and to such incidents from happening in the future.

Cannot decide on media reports

Former Chairman and member of the National Police Commission (NPC) of Sri Lanka Professor Siri Hettige said that the NPC gets involved in matters under different conditions. If theres a public complaint against a Police officer or if disciplinary action has to be taken it comes under the purview of the NPC. But if the officer concerned is at OIC level then its up to the Inspector General of Police to take action. said Prof. Hettige.

According to the reports we will take disciplinary action against the OIC. In these kind of situations we have to consider both sides to the incident. The way the Sergeant behaved was inappropriate and the way the senior officers responded to it was also wrong. We cannot come into blind conclusions without knowing the facts
Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara

When asked about this particular incident Prof.Hettige said that they cannot come to a conclusion based on what has been reported in the media. Already an inquiry is continuing and we have to see the actual facts before arriving at a conclusion. We have to address issues as and when they arise and before arriving at conclusions we have to observe the issue at grassroots level, he said.

Im not on bad terms with anybody. I voiced against the injustice I faced and the public responded to it.

The fact that I never was appreciated during war heroes commemorations
Sergeant Gunawardana


It was a total misconception
One prominent individual among the accused in this case wasOIC U. Arulanandamwho is alleged to have released the vehicle following orders from higher officials. However he related the incident to this writer in the following manner. OnSeptember 28,Sergeant Gunawardana was doing the night shift and he had apprehended this vehicle at4.00am on September29stating that the vehicle was transporting sand without a permit. But they had a permit. By about 8.00 am the owner came to the Police and told me that he had a permit. When I checked he had a permit which was valid from6.00 pm on September 28 to 6.00 am on September 29. But the vehicle was apprehended at4.30amand therefore there was one and a half hours left for it to be an invalid permit. Thereafter I asked the owner to go to the Geological Survey Department and bring a report stating that the permit was still valid.
By Monday, October 1, he returned with the statement from the Geological Department, but before releasing the vehicle I wanted the owner to show it to the Sergeant as well, he continued. But he had gone to High Courts since he has an ongoing case. We had to wait and by this time the owner got angry and in turn had complained to the Mathugama Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). When the ASP asked me what had happened I said that the permit is valid, but I needed to show it to the Sergeant, so that he wouldnt have any misconception about me. But because we couldnt find him anywhere and because the owner was wasting time we released the vehicle. Since the owner had complained about Sergeant to the Mathugama ASP, Sergeant Gunawardana had to go and give a statement there.
Then the next day, the Sergeant came with his weapon, loaded it and aimed it at me, shouting in filth and asking why the vehicle was released, Sergeant continued. I ducked under my desk because I didnt want to be shot at. He fired twice, but nobody reported that those shots were aimed at me. People are of the view that I released this vehicle taking bribes. But I have served in the Police for28 yearsand have never been involved in such shady acts, saidOIC Arulanandam.
OIC Arulanandam is fromBatticaloaand his father was taken away by the terrorists during the height of the war. To date,OIC Arulanandamdoesnt know his whereabouts. After the incident my children didnt go to school for a week because they were scared. I was threatened by the people because they questioned as to how I could release one vehicle when I have apprehended their vehicle, also for a similar incident some time ago. Following death threats I had to keep senior officials informed because my family is in Colombo and I work here. However, it is a total misconception that reached another level, he added.

They wonder why she has gone missing!
	
Normally politicos -be they Diyawanna or not -have a hankering to do the honours at opening ceremonies for these are ideal occasions for them to cut a figure. However, a lovely fair Diyawanna member, who was in active politics until recently seems to shun public functions on her home turf these days, they say.
She had either developed many segments of roads in her area, but she had failed to attend any of the functions held to mark their opening and in fact, some roads developed with funds from her budgetary allocation had been opened to traffic informally without any fanfare, they say.
People in the area appreciate the saving of public funds by doing away with formal opening functions, but wonder why the lady has stopped visiting her voters let alone attending public functions in the area, they say.

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said it was the present government that rescued Sri Lanka from the Chinese debt trap and thus ended the era in which not only our land but also its airspace of was entrusted to China.
However, China announced earlier that Chinese loans only accounted to ten per cent of Sri Lankas total debt burden.
The minister said this at a function to mark the opening of a grain storage facility in Embilipitiya. He said though some elements accused the present government of ensnaring the country in a debt trap, this administration only resurrected the country from it.
The minister said similar grain storage facilities would be set up in different parts of the country.

Top Afghan official killed in shooting
	

KANDAHAR REUTERS Oct 18 - Gen. Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistans most powerful security officials, was killed on Thursday when a bodyguard opened fire following a meeting in the governors compound in the southern province of Kandahar, officials said.

Gen. Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan who had been at the meeting with Razeq only moments earlier, was uninjured in the attack, but the local commander of the NDS intelligence service was killed and the provincial governor was severely wounded.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they had targeted both Miller and Razeq, who had a fearsome reputation as a ruthless opponent of the insurgents. 
The brutal police chief of Kandahar has been killed along several other officials, a Taliban statement said. 
Razeq was criticised by human rights groups but highly respected by U.S. officers.

SAMPANTHANS PREFERENCE OF GANDHI OVER PRABHAKARAN


SAMPANTHANS BLOWING HOT AND COLD INDICATES THE PREDICAMENT THE TAMIL LEADERS ARE GOING THROUGH
THE FREEING OF PTA DETAINEES, THE RELEASE OF OCCUPIED LANDS AND THE ISSUE OF MISSING PROGRESSING IN SNAIL PACE
THE CONFESSION ON THE ARMED STRUGGLE LAST WEEK WAS HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL GROUND SITUATION

It is natural for one to recall the leaders of the constituent parties of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) crowning of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) some time ago as the sole representatives of the Tamil people, when the TNA leader Rajavarothyam Sampanthan said last week that Tamils could have won their rights through a nonviolent struggle, rather than resorting to an armed struggle.
Yet, he seems to be sincere when he confessed on behalf of his community about the armed struggle that went on for over thirty years.
Opposition Leader Sampanthan made this remark while speaking in Parliament during the adjournment debate on the motion of tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, on the latters 150th birth anniversary.
While complimenting the great Indian leader, who pioneered Indias Independence struggle, Sampanthan said:
Tamils would have achieved self-rule in their areas had they followed values of Ahimsa (nonviolence) in line elucidated by Mahatma Gandhi, instead of resorting to an armed struggle.
He said:
There was a considerable number of Tamils elected to Parliament in 1977. We won all seats in the North and the East at this election. If we had resorted to ahimsa or a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign rather than going in for an armed struggle, we would have achieved a sufficient amount of self-rule in our areas.
Mr Sampanthan seems to have forgotten that he had expressed a diametrically opposite view some four months ago  exactly one week before former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran made her controversial statement that the dream of the Tamils is to see the revival of the LTTE.

One cannot help recall the leaders of TNA crowning of the LTTE as sole representatives of the Tamil people, when TNA leader Sampanthan said last week that Tamils could have won their rights through a non-violent struggle, rather than resorting to an armed struggle
Speaking at Veerasingham Hall in Jaffna  the same venue Ms Maheshwaran made her statement- on June 24, when a book penned by Northern Chief Minister under the title Neethiarasar Pesukirar (The Justice Speaks) was launched, the Opposition Leader said that what the LTTE had launched was a just struggle and accused the international community of destroying the organisation.
Sampanthan and some other TNA leaders have in the past as well expressed their commitment towards the nonviolent form of struggle to win the rights of Tamils.
But here he is for the first time confessing that the armed struggle, which was launched first by so many Tamil armed groups and later became the monopoly of the LTTE, was wrong.
It was in a way rejection of the armed struggle by the Tamil armed groups as a waste.
The LTTE still draws a considerable amount of sympathy and support from the people in the North, which is well demonstrated by the ovation former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran received when she made her controversial statement.
Hence, it is astonishing to note that nobody had come forward so far to condemn the TNA leader over his restrained rejection of the armed struggle waged by the LTTE in the name of the Tamils.
Northern Province Chief Minister and TNAs other adversaries who are always awaiting even a slip of the tongue on the part of the TNA leaders to take political mileage did not seem to attempt to rouse the Tamil sentiments over the statement made by Sampanthan.
In a way, it is difficult for the TNAs northern rivals to condemn this statement under the present circumstances.
If one is to contest Sampanthans contention that Tamils would have achieved their rights by following Ahimsa instead of resorting to an armed struggle, he or she would have to endorse the LTTEs war against the Sri Lankan State and glorify the organisations activities.
It was only days ago that Ms Vijayakala Maheshwaran was enlarged on bail after being arrested over her statement made on June 2.
The incident might have prevented others from defending the LTTEs war, at least for the moment.
A statement similar to that of Sampanthan was once made by none other than the Advisor of the LTTE Anton Balasingham. During a function to declare open a courts complex of the LTTE in Kilinochchi in 2003, Balasingham said that the LTTE could have accepted the set of proposals presented by the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government in 1995.
The proposals generally called then Package, provided for the devolution of powers to the provinces, with the nature of the country being described as a Union of Regions instead of Unitary State. 
The difference between the statements by Sampanthan and Balasingham is that Sampanthan says the whole armed struggle by the Tamil groups was unnecessary whereas Balasingham said that the LTTE shouldnt have continued the war after June 1995.
The package was drafted by the then Constitutional Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris in collaboration with Dr Neelan Thiruchchelvam, a legal luminary and a respected leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).
Dr Thiruchchelvam was killed by an LTTE suicide bomber at Kynsey Road in Colombo in 1999 for this offence which Balasingham later valued. 
Sampanthans statement was so important because the war between the armed forces and the LTTE had claimed thousands of lives- most of them were Tamils.
When one rejects that armed struggle, he is in some way holding those waging the war responsible for those lives. But the moderate Tamil leaders cannot absolve themselves from that responsibility as it was they who developed the theoretical background for the armed struggle for a separate Tamil State.
Despite the fact that Velupillai Prabhakaran killed former Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappah in 1975 for being a supporter of the then United Front Government, it was the famous Vaddukkoddai Resolution in 1976 that laid the ideological foundation for the Tamil Eelam demand.
At the 14th Convention of the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi held in Batticaloa in 2012, Sampanthan said:
The Tamil United Liberation Front, of which our party was a member, took the historic decision to establish the Separate Government of Tamil Eelam in 1976. Based on this decision of our party, and the need to place ourselves in a position of strength, Tamil youth decided to oppose violence with violence and began to rise up as armed rebel groups.
Countries have been divided through nonviolent political processes. Norways secession from Sweden in 1905 and the division of Czechoslovakia into republics of Czech and Slovakia after the dismantling of the Soviet system in the East European countries in 1991 were cases in point.
However, there was no such a political atmosphere in Sri Lanka when the said resolution was passed at the special convention of the TULF in Vaddukkoddai on May 14, 1976.
The realisation of the resolution inevitably had to go through a violent process. When the leaders who passed the resolution were idling, the Tamil youth indoctrinated by the resolutions ideology took to arms, declaring the very leaders who passed the resolution traitors. 
However, in 2,000 some unidentified force reunited them and the moderate Tamil leaders except those of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) accepted the LTTE as the sole representatives of Tamils and started to justify all actions by the latter.
Sampanthans blowing hot and cold on the activities of the LTTE indicates the predicament the Tamil leaders are going through now.
The justification of the LTTEs war four months ago was the manifestation of the frustration in them over the snail pace progress in releasing the PTA detainees,
releasing of the lands occupied by the security forces in the North and the issue of persons gone missing during the war.
On the other hand, the confession on the armed struggle last week was his understanding of the real ground situation.

The sign boards which were displayed in the premises of the Koggala Martin Wickremesinghe Museum and Children Park by the Community Police Unit in Habaraduwa restricting tourists with swim-wear, were removed by the police following objections by the people on social media, police said.
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) yesterday said the Authority was concerned about the displayed notice by the Community Police Unit in Habaraduwa.
The public notice shows a picture of two women in two-piece bikinis with a message urging visitors to dress appropriately and respect the Sri Lankan culture.
While posting a message on Twitter, the SLTDA expressed its concern.
The notice said the Dress code policing was not needed and unwarranted for tourists enjoying the scenic beaches of Sri Lanka. The SLTDA has taken this up with all relevant authorities. We expect to see progress soon, the post said.
Meanwhile, the Habaraduwa Police said the sign boards were erected after a decision taken by the Habaraduwa Community Police Unit to protect the culture of the country.
After receiving several objections from social media, the boards were removed. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

What the Lines and Signs on Mounts say  Part 1
	
      Human Hand  Trailblazer of Human Civilization     

We earlier presented a series of articles on the favourable and unfavourable yogas formed on the palm.
The Palmistry had developed as a branch of Vedic Astrology in India and the sages in ancient India had not only named the Mounts on the palm after the planets, but also named the line and sign formations on the Mounts after the specific yogas that come in Astrology, applying the very same astrological principles as applicable to Astrology.
A new series based on the principles of Modern Western palmistry
The series of articles on the yogas formed on the palm carried on this page earlier was based solely on the Indian Palmistry.
Palmistry had greatly developed in the West in the 19th century mainly due to the fame gained by the French palmists C.S. dArpentigny and M. Desbarrolles as exponents and practitioners of the science mostly among the royalty and the nobility in Europe at their time.

Fathers of Modern Western Palmistry
Several works on Palmistry including the manual, Science of the Hand written by the doyens of the modern science of the hand dArpentigny and Desbarrolles brought about a new surge of interest in this occult science in the West.
Later the celebrated work, The Study of Palmistry by the French palmist Comte C de Saint-Germain published in 1897 won a worldwide readership.
Desbarrolles (1801  1886) who was greatly inspired by the writings of dArpentigny had devoted 50 years of his life to the study of the subject and while engaged in research, had made himself available for daily consultations.
It is also on record that the findings of the studies conducted by dArpentigny had made a major contribution towards laying a firm foundation for the Modern Palmistry as a science.

A new series beginning with this article
Beginning with this article, we propose to introduce to our readership a new series of articles on What the Lines and Signs on the Mounts on the palm say based on principles of the Modern Western Palmistry.

A fun way to keep legs and feet strong
	
			What is podiatry
			Podiatry is a branch of medicine which includes the study, diagnosis and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle and lower extremity. Podiatrists treat a wide variety of foot and lower extremity conditions, through nonsurgical and surgical approaches. The American Board of Podiatric Orthopaedics and Primary Podiatric Medicine (ABPOPPM) offers a comprehensive board qualification and certification process in podiatric medicine and orthopedics. Podiatric Medicine and Orthopaedics is the medical specialty concerned with the comprehensive and continuous foot health care for patients.
			
		
The feet and legs are as important as every other part of our body. But do we take enough care of our feet In most instances our feet are neglected to the point that as we age we become less stable and the legs become weak. This is why regular exercises and exercises especially aimed at the feet, ankles and the lower feet are important.
In an attempt to spread awareness on podiatry, Singapore-based Senior Podiatrist Timothy Maiden recently visited Sri Lanka upon an invitation by the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association (SLGGA). Tim is currently employed at The Foot Practice and is a visiting podiatrist at the Haoma Medical Clinic Singapore. During his brief visit to Sri Lanka, Tim checked over 65 patients with various ailments relating to the lower foot.
			Foot and Ankle Conditions treated in Podiatry
			
			Some of the conditions treated by podiatrists include :
			Ankle trauma
				Athletes foot
				Bone spurs
				Bunions and hammertoes
				Foot issues related to diabetes
				Flat feet
				Foot and heel pain
				Fractures
				Injuries
				Neuromas
				Plantar fasciitis/tendonitis
				Plantar warts
				Foot and ankle deformities
				Tendonitis
				Toenail problems
			
		
Knee pain, heel pain and bunions are common in Sri Lanka .
I came across knee pains, heel pains and bunions, Tim said in an interview with Health Capsule. The symptoms were presented in a very similar manner and included loss of strength, tissues, instability issues in the ankles, weakness in the legs and instability in the foot which put more stress on the joints. I have mostly checked the conditions of women since we work with the SLGGA. We have seen children below ages five or six and elderly women in their 80s and 90s, he observed.
Through podiatry, Tim plans to introduce a fun way of improving the symptoms and to show them that by doing exercises they can see improvements regarding those ailments. Lifestyle could be one of the reasons why they are experiencing these conditions. But it is multifactorial. A surgery will bring about a short-term remedy. But even after a surgery if your body is stronger, the recovery will be much quicker. So we are trying to analyse their ailments and give them exercises to do. We check the places where they have the weakness  whether it is from the calf, the thigh etc. and then we move into stretching, strengthening and other mobilizing techniques, he added.
Maiden has worked in India, China and Singapore and currently he is involved in training athletes, cricketers and other sportsmen at two sports clinics. There the approach is slightly different where they have introduced running analysis on treadmills and other activities.
Whenever there is an ailment, read-up on it, he advised. Walking makes one fitter, but not stronger. So patients need to focus on strengthening the leg muscles; 25% of the bones in your feet carry your body weight. If we continue to strengthen the legs we put less stress on the feet  if you strengthen the feet the stability increases. So its about strengthening, stretching and flexing. Therefore it is important to seek a second opinion before going in for a surgery, he said.

## Title: Are you suffering from pain outlasting periods

Are you suffering from pain outlasting periods
	

Periods! This is yet another name for pain in some of us women which can be awful enough to take 3-5 beautiful days off a month, due to discomfort and pain. Most of us with such unbearable features during periods would just lie on a bed, doing nothing-which in turn would affect the productivity of our lifestyles, efficiency and thus the overall quality of life.
Periods or menstrual bleeding occurs when your womb gets ready to conceive a fertilized ovum (after the fusion of an ovum from mother and sperm from the father during sexual intercourse), by making its walls proliferated and comfortable enough to provide room for the fetus to grow and sheds when the expected ovum doesnt arrive as promised! The walls comprising layers of tissues would shed under the influence of various hormones and exit as menstrual bleeding.
Cramping pain associated with menstrual bleeding is usually due to mild contractions of your womb, while shedding off the unwanted tissues. In addition to that, these contractions will result in the reduction of blood supply to the area-thus making it oxygen deficient-leading to release of various pain-triggering chemicals like Prostaglandins. Less commonly, this period pain can be a result of an underlying pathology like Endometriosis.
So in this weeks Health Capsule, we are going to discuss about Endometriosis with Dr Suranga Hettipathirana, Consultant Obstetrician & Gynecologist, Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), who has years of experience in treating patients with this condition.
Endometriosis is a common condition among females nowadays which is known to result in severe cramping pain and lasting over a long period. Endometriosis is defined as a condition where functional endometrial lining is present in sites other than the uterine cavity (womb). These sites can include, ovaries, utero-sacral ligament, umbilicus, nasal passage and pleural cavity. So as discussed earlier, when fertilization doesnt occur and endometrium in the womb starts shedding under the influence of specific hormones, the sites where this ectopic endometrial lining is present will also start bleeding resulting in severe pain-characteristically experienced before menstruation, during menstruation and after menstruation, there by referred to as pain (dysmenorrhea) outlasting periods.

How is this condition
Endometriosis is a condition which is quite common among females-accounting for 10-15% cases where as 30-40% of subfertile patients would present with the same pathology which gives rise to their subfertility.

The underlying mechanism
Several theories have been put forward with regards to the etiology of endometriosis, but none of this confirms any clear-cut initiation.
Genetics and family history Endometriosis tends to run in families and is commonly seen among first degree relatives, so if you grandmother or mother or both got the disease, which might not be severe enough to present clinically, you are also vulnerable to have it.
Retrograde menstruation and implantation  When tissue lining of the womb sheds off and flows through the fallopian tubes it tends to embed itself on the organs of the pelvis rather than leaving the body as bleeding.
Lymphatic and vascular spread- Endometrial cells can spread through-out the body along with blood circulation or lymphatic system and result in ectopic sites with endometrial tissue lining E.g. Pleural cavity, nasal passage
How would you present
Pain (dysmenorrhea) outlasting (before periods, while on periods and after periods) periods
	Pain during or after sex (deep dyspareunia)
	Pain when peeing or passing stools during your period

Constipation
Pain or blood in urine while on period
	Difficulty in getting pregnant (subfertility)
	Nasal bleeding (rare-when the ectopic endometrial tissue is present in nasal cavity)
We cannot really say that a patient with endometriosis will present with all these symptoms, but if any of these, especially the pain outlasting periods is worrying you and is severe enough to keep you on bed, all through, it is always better to seek medical advice.

Endometriosis and subfertility
Endometriosis and subfertility always go hand in hand as a significant percentage of females (30-40%), affected by subfertility would have an underlying endometriosis which needs early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.
Some of the reasons why endometriosis leads to subfertility include,
Distorted adnexal anatomical structures which inhibit the capture of ovum after ovulation
	Impaired fertilization
	Interference with oocyte development or early embryogenesis
	Reduced endometrial receptivity
	Destruction of sperms reaching the ova due to various chemical mediators

Diagnosis of Endometriosis
A complete history-from the attainment of menarche until the last episode of periods, along with how it presents, regularity of your cycle, amount of bleeding (flow, passage of clots), number of sanitary pads you normally use, pain and other associated features, family history etc. are highly important in making the diagnosis of Endometriosis.
Vaginal examination and Digital rectal examination will also be helpful to assess the extension and severity of the condition.
Once a clinical suspicion of endometriosis is made, various investigations including blood tests (full blood count-haemoglobin levels to see if you are anaemic due to excessive blood loss, CA125 to exclude malignancy) and imaging studies like trans-vaginal scan or ultra sound scan-abdomen followed by diagnostic Laparoscopy will be carried out, in order to come to an accurate diagnosis.
There are several other disease conditions presenting with similar features which include, Pelvic inflammatory disease, Adenomyosis and Tubo-ovarian abscess hence it is crucial to exclude them while arriving at a diagnosis.

Treatment
After the diagnosis is confirmed-the best treatment modality will be decided, considering various factors like your age, the most affected aspect to be addressed-whether it is the pain or subfertility or something else, the necessity to reserve fertility (how soon you are expecting to become pregnant) etc.
The available treatment options:
Pain killers  Like Paracetemol
	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-Like Mefenamic Acid
	Hormonal medicines and contraceptives Combined oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, an intrauterine system (IUS) and medicines called Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues
	Surgery-Cystectomy to drain ovarian cyst and excise the inner lining, diathermy and adhesiolysis to excise the patches of endometrial tissue located in ectopic sites
	Abdominal hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy to remove the specific part or parts affected by endometriosis.

Take home message
Endometriosis can give rise to various critical complications including sub-fertility and long term pain and suffering, ultimately resulting in a negative impact on the quality of your life, so it is always better to seek EARLY medical advice without waiting so long thinking that period pain is something a female is cursed with and you have to bear it up no matter what-because early diagnosis and on-time medical or surgical interventions could do miracles!
