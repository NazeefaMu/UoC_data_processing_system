## Title: Clerical Predators: The Church Challenged by According to Matthew

Clerical Predators: The Church Challenged by According to Matthew
	
My wife and I watched the much delayed, long awaited movie According to Matthew at the Majestic. We were surprised that the house was full given the specialized nature of the movie. It turns out however that the movie has much entertainment value in addition to the historical interest that churchmen might have. 
It is also a disturbing movie about a real life Anglo-Catholic priest  i.e., one who upholds the Catholic side of the faith of the Anglican Church, by accepting everything from the Roman Catholic Church except principally the doctrines of Papal Infallibility and the Assumption of Mary into Heaven. This priest, Matthew Peiris (MP), in the 1970s had a love affair with a young married woman Dalrene Ingram, and subsequently killed her husband and then his wife by overdosing them over a period using diabetes drugs. 
It was rather chilling to know that a priest could act as MP did. My own family and my wifes had different views of MP. He as an Anglo-Catholic was a good friend of my fathers. As such I have met him twice, and he was held in high esteem. So the disappointment was great, and the sense of let-down even greater. My wifes side felt vindicated because when my father-in-law was warded at Colombos cardiac unit and my mother-in-law ran to MP at St. Pauls Kynsey Road nearby for prayers, she was asked to come back with Rs. 10 for prayers to be offered. 
The film itself is not historically accurate or complete. The MP I remember had grey hair unlike in the movie. It is not brought out that in his better days he converted and baptised Somarama Thera (another murdering priest) by the name of Peter into the Anglican Church, just two days before he was hanged for assassinating SWRD Bandarananaike. MPs lover Dalrene Ingram, at the end of the movie, is sentenced to death, with no mention of her conviction being overturned on appeal. Nor is it mentioned that MP was pardoned and released in the 1990s. Educated in England, his intellectual side, including leadership of the Anglo-Catholic wing of the [Anglican] Church of Ceylon, is not brought out except for those who can discern the meaning of his black cassock and pectoral cross.
Perhaps that is why Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has disavowed the film, saying people will not know the difference between the Anglican MP and his own Roman Catholic (RC) clergy. The point made by the movies devout Anglican Director Chandran Rutnam (son of historian James Rutnam who has brought to us J.R. Jayawardenes and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes true ancestries) is precisely to expose sexual abuses by clergy of all denominations and religions. Rutnam, MPs parishioner, adds in an interview that MP used to abuse girls who went to him for confession. 
Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith cannot take the high horse saying his RC clergy are better. We are all aware of struggles facing the worldwide RC Church as child abuse is being exposed, including the shocking story of a priest who ejaculated in a young boys mouth and gave him mouthwash as documented by the RC Church herself in America.
The Cardinal surely is aware that in a careful assessment by the Boston Globe, eight percent of RC clergy are identified as child abusers. I have a friend, Paul, who went to a Catholic Seminary in India where he saw priests and nuns misbehaving. When he complained he was told that such is yathaartham (how reality is). Paul dropped out of seminary and is now a journalist.
Abusers of women and children, whatever their religion, will see clerical office as giving them easy access to victims. Victims are afraid to complain against iconic figures. Even if they do, they fear being disbelieved. A crassly abusive priest was once heard to boast, Have you ever heard of a priest raping women No, it is because women come to us. That is the power of priestly office.
An oxymoron is that these priests are good even as they are bad. Like MP on the Catholic side of the Anglican Church, I know others who exude charisma from the Protestant side of the Church. With their charisma, their sermons carry convincing messages that attract a following. This makes women open to seduction. A so-called evangelistic Anglican priest has won as many converts to Christianity as the number of occasions he has been disciplined and confined by the Bishop of that time to the cathedral precincts on Bullers Road in punishment for violating women. I have heard Christians excusing him saying but he has done good work winning souls.
Matthew Peiris was well educated, but an evil cynic. Todays cynical predator priest is of a different genre  much less sophisticated but as much evil. These are days when we rue the fact that clergy standards have dropped. While Chandran Rutnam has done a good job of cautioning us not to trust clergy just because they are clergy, the crasser priests today are using the movie to argue that priestly standards were always poor. Perhaps so; but I assess that standards are poorer today because we increasingly feel the need to protect the culprits to protect the reputation of the Church. 
The film itself is not historically accurate or complete. It is not brought out that in his better days he converted and baptised Somarama Thera (another murdering priest) by the name of Peter into the Anglican Church, just two days before he was hanged for assassinating SWRD Bandarananaike
As an Anglican I am aware of a priest who asked a carpenter for a Rs. 600 rupee receipt after repairs for Rs. 300, of priests who committed adultery, of priests accused of murder, etc.  all in the last 20 years. These were all covered up.
For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged (ironically from St. Matthews Gospel) and He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone, are both used to make us not talk about the misdoings of priests. One such priest, who is possibly in line to be Bishop, when confronted by a woman about his abuse of a lady who came to him for marriage counselling, called his accuser a disgrace to the Church, presumably for going against these two lines from the Bible.
It is long accepted theology of the Church that these lines are to guide our own behaviour and not an excuse for wrongdoing. When priests violate the laws of the church, they surely have forgiveness if repentant, but cannot be sustained as priests.
This, todays church finds difficult to digest, because too many priests are involved transgressions. The credibility of the priesthood is at stake when those needing Gods forgiveness, pronounce that forgiveness to us.
Few qualified men of faith are offering themselves to the Church. The Anglican Church has therefore accepted those who failed their OLs for the priesthood, and then credential led them through her dubious Training Institute and Seminary. With this dire shortage, if predatory priests are put out, there will be few left to serve. So enervating of the Church is this policy of retention of predators that MP was not defrocked, and he continued celebrating Holy Mass on death row and offering Gods forgiveness as Christs Vicar. 
When I defied my then Bishop and raised the issue of reports of some men being trained as priests at our seminary at Pilimatalawa, allegedly sexually harassing Methodist Church women also being trained there, I was threatened with excommunication for tarnishing the reputation of the Church through falsehood. My Bishop demanded proof, and I barely escaped excommunication only when I gave him the proof just as he got ready to act. It turned out that he knew all along of these incidents and had suspended the wrongdoers as Chairman of the College.
Yet the Bishop was defending the reputation of the Church and its ministers and Bishops to-be. In doing so, he risked the traditional reputation of the Church in defending the powerless victims of abuse.
The Archdeacon of Colombo, a very senior cleric, apologetically told me (after I discovered the names of the abusers and the abused) that he knew these things happened and knew that the Bishop also knew, but he could not speak up at the Standing Committee to contradict his Bishop. I then realized that the corruption of power is what sustains clerical abuse. The Holy Father in Rome is learning this truth the hard way.
This Christmas season, Advent, saw senior clerics continue to fall for sexual misconduct. Pope Francis has removed Australias most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal George Pell, from his inner circle after he faced prosecution in Australia for historical sexual offences. The Anglican Communions head is the Archbishop of Canterbury. His representative to the Holy See (namely Archbishop Bernard Ntahoturi, former Anglican primate of Burundi) had to resign following accusations of sexual misconduct.
These tactics of silencing criticism allow rogue clergy to rise up the church hierarchy to Canon, Archdeacon etc. as has happened in my Church with few lay members knowing their past except those of us integrated into Church governance. Parishes that do not know and to which marauding predator-priests are transferred, are set up to be victims of these repeat offenders  exactly as happened to the RC Church. Avoiding discussion of clerical abuse and ecclesiastical cover-up is to set the rest of us up to be victims.
So long as there is no room for faith in the Church any more, we are doomed to suffer numerous more Matthew Peirises. NGOs do better.
The author is a fifth generation Anglican and has served as an elected member of the Church of Ceylons Constituent Assembly, and has been and is an elected member of the Standing Committee of the Colombo Diocese of the Church of Ceylon, its chief governing body. He has also served as a licensed Lay-Eucharistic Minister here and in the US where he was also a Vestryman andDiocesan Councillor.

277 elephants dead in 2018 Jumbo issues take jumbo shape
	
Elephants, the once treasured beings of the wild, have become a threat to mankind as of today. History relates numerous instances when elephants were utilised to do work which couldnt be performed by humans. In Hinduism, the elephant represents wisdom and Lord Ganesh is one of the most popular deities in the religions pantheon. Sri Lanka also includes a considerable number of its population that pay homage to Lord Ganesh. But the elephant in the wild isnt on safe ground. During 2018, 277 elephants were found dead due to various reasons; most of which are related to humans. Issues such as the use of Hakka patas, poisoning, railway accidents and shooting for ivory remain unsolved. As the newly appointed Minister of Wildlife and Tourism recently resumed office, conservationists and officials at the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) feel that there is still some hope of saving the rest of these majestic beings. As such the Daily Mirror takes a closer look at the number of elephants that bid farewell during this year and what could be done in future tosave them.
Mugalan, known to be the youngest tusker at the Udawalawa National Park, was shot dead during early December
	One death has also been reported as a result of poisoning. So far, investigations are underway to identify the suspects
Although these fences have been put up, they are not properly maintained. It is the duty of the Civil Defence Service to take care of maintenance
Incidents of jumbo deaths during 2018
In September this year, a battle between two elephants at the Kalawewa reserve left one dead. Wildlife officials confirmed over 20 stabbings from a tusk which would have been the cause of death. The most intriguing part of this battle was to see a large number of elephants gathering around the corpse of the elephant in a gesture to pay their last respects to the leader of their herd.
HEC escalates in Polonnaruwa
The corpses of seven elephants were found in a swamp in Periyaaru, Polonnaruwa in early September. According to area residents, they would have walked from the Somawathiya Forest reserve in search of water. In Polonnaruwa alone, 51 elephants and 19 people have been killed due to the Human Elephant Conflict (HEC).
Elephant-train accidentsand deaths
A number of elephants succumbed to their injuries after being hit by trains moving along the Colombo- Batticaloa railway line. Most deaths were reported from Habarana, Palugaswewa and Welikanda areas. An SMS alert service was recently introduced to minimise elephant-train accidents, but to what extent it has been successful is yet to be reported.
Mugalan shot dead
Mugalan, known to be the youngest tusker at the Udawalawa National Park, was shot dead during early December. The reason for its shooting is yet to be revealed as investigations are underway. However, environmentalists claim that it had a unique pair of tusks.
SMS alert service to minimise elephant-train collisions
As one of the solutions to minimise elephant-train collisions, the Railway Department recently introduced an SMS alert service which notifies engine drivers about elephants romancing near railway tracks. A special operations centre will also be established to coordinate the messaging service.
People not actively involved in reporting elephant-related incidents: DWC
By the end of November, 277 elephant deaths have been reported, said U. L Thaufeeq, Deputy Director - Elephant Conservation at the DWC. Out of these, 39 have been shot, 31 elephants have been electrocuted, 54 of them were killed due to hakka patas, 15 were killed due to railway accidents, 19 from other accidents such as falling into pits, 29 natural deaths and 42 due to wounds that werent cured over a period of time. In addition to that, the postmortem reports havent been able to identify the cause of death of 39 other elephants. One death has also been reported as a result of poisoning. So far, investigations are underway to identify the suspects attached to Mugalans death. It was found dead within the Udawalawa National Park, but it may have been shot elsewhere. said Thaufeeq.
When asked about the use of hakka patas by farmers to get rid of elephants, Thaufeeq further said that a bill has been circulated to spread awareness in areas where people have experienced these incidents frequently. But people are not actively involved in reporting these incidents. We are also awaiting a final report on Dalaputtuwas death. he said.
Some fences are bordering villages and there are issues when it comes to lands owned by the DWC. It takes time to solve these issuesU. L Thaufeeq
Sri Lanka also witnessed an alarming increase in elephant deaths on railway tracks. Following this, several conservationists came forward with a proposal which was presented to the previous Minister of the Department of Wildlife and Conservation. When this proposal was presented people criticised it and therefore we put up a notice calling for the public to present papers suggesting solutions regarding these elephant deaths. Tentatively we have introduced an SMS alert service along with the Railway Department. he added.
Thaufeeq further said that there are land issues when it comes to erecting electric fences. Some fences are bordering villages and there are issues when it comes to lands owned by the DWC. It takes time to solve these issues. Some fences which were scheduled to be put up during this year are yet to be installed due to these issues, he said.
It has also been observed that most of these fences do not have electricity and elephants tend to uproot them and charge towards surrounding villages. In response to this issue, Thaufeeq said that although these fences have been put up, they are not properly maintained. It is the duty of the Civil Defence Service to look into the maintenance aspect of electric fences. We have discussed with the CDS and will provide a solution in the near future, said Thaufeeq.
Each issue needs to be addressed individually: Jayawardene
There are a number of solutions, but the problem lies in whether they are being implemented, said Jayantha Jayawardene, a naturalist, elephant expert and Managing Trustee of The Biodiversity and Conservation Trust. An SMS alert service has been introduced and engine drivers have been pre-warned, but these dont really work. Sometimes these drivers are drunk. Solutions dont really work until each issue is addressed individually. The DWC is conscious of working with conservationists, but they should choose people who are competent in providing solutions. Elephants walk through villages because their migratory routes may have been blocked or because they are restricted to pockets of jungles due to development activities in the surrounding areas, explained Jayawardene.
When asked whether we are equipped with technology to address these issues Jayawardene pointed out that we have to first be equipped with a determined group of experts to solve this problem. The DWC has to obey the orders of the Minister and now that the Minister has changed they have to do what he says. But I sincerely hope that the Minister would be able to get some advice from those who are competent in addressing elephant-related issues. he affirmed.

Will examine progress of existing projects : Amaratunga
The Minister of the Department of Wildlife and Conservation is responsible for all matters related to wildlife. But with changing regimes and existing political issues ministers usually cannot complete their full terms in office. Even if they do so, they cannot solve all issues related to wildlife. Yet, much more needs to be fine-tuned in terms of efficiency and practicality in solving wildlife related issues. Just when the previous subject Minister Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka was trying to implement a few effective solutions, the political climate changed for the worse. But with a new Minister appointed, conservationists are harbouring hopes again.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the newly appointed subject minister John Amaratunga said that he would meet all DWC officials and examine how much they have moved forward with existing projects.

General election not necessary
	
Referring to a statement made by UNP National Organiser Navin Dissanayake that the party was gearing itself for a general election in April 2019, UNP MP S.M. Marikkar said today such an election was not necessary.
We need a presidential election first instead of a general election. In any case, a general election cannot be held till February 17, 2019 because the current Parliament completes four-and-a-half year term on that day. You need to approve a resolution with a two-thirds majority to hold an election before that. Given the current circumstance, there is no way that a two-thirds majority can be secured by any party in Parliament, Mr. Marikkar told a media briefing.
He said the President could declare a presidential election after January 8, 2019 and that it was preferable to hold a snap presidential election rather than a general election.(Yohan Perera)

Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Malta ban curry leaves from SL
	
The Sri Lankan Consulate in Catania, Sicily in Italy had informed Sri Lankan passengers not to bring curry leaves from Sri Lanka to Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Malta because the EU had prohibited curry leaves under the EUROPHYT notification.
Issuing a notice on December 24, the Consulate office said the European Union (EU) had banned curry leaves from Sri Lanka to the EU countries on the grounds of harmful organism content.
During November, the EU and the Italian Customs had on many occasions detected that curry leaves had been brought in the baggage of Sri Lankans who arrived at Italian airports, mainly the Catania Airport. Due to the increasing number of detections of curry leaves from passenger baggage the non-compliance of this rule would result in a negative impact on Sri Lankas import of food items to Italy and other EU countries, it said,
The Consulate office has instructed the Sri Lankans living in Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Malta to avoid bringing down the curry leaves from Sri Lanka in their baggage.
The Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) will also screen personnel baggage for this purpose and if you do not adhere to this requirement, you will not have a smooth departure at the Customs clearance at this end, the notice said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Matthew Between the devil and the dark blue sea

Matthew Between the devil and the dark blue sea
	
Chandran Ratnams Matthew, based on Fr. Matthew Pieris/Dalrene Ingram trial in the late 1970s, is a relatively novel phenomenon to Sri Lankan film, films based on real life crime stories. The only previous precedents are Wasantha Obeysekaras Dadayama, based on the Adlene Vitharana murder case which took place in 1959, and Titus Thotawattes Haralakse based on the Turf Club robbery of 1948 and the murder of Armstrong Garage driver John de Silva. Then there were several, based on the lives of true life criminals and gangsters such as Maru Sira and Alfred de Soysa.
Matthew Peiris acquired a reputation as an exorcist, and toured other countries, performing such rites. But this aspect of his life, a crucial element, is not given enough play in the film
	Chandran Ratnam is an experienced film maker and its hard to understand this lacklustre approach towards what is a riveting real-life murder mystery
	The story as presented in the film, raises a fascinating question: did Dalrene Ingram actually know that Matthew Peiris was calculating and murdering her husband as well as his own wife, or was she a duped victim
	The film picks up its pace after the murder of the friars wife, at which point the police investigation begins
	The police would have had no interest in proving her lack of culpability, even if they believed her to be a victim
Whereas Dadayama was in a contemporary setting, and the crucial murder scene was a wild fantasy far removed from the actual incident, Matthew is filmed in a period setting, and the script follows the actual incidents as far as one can gather (the names are fictitious except in the case of Matthew Peiris). Fr. Peiris and his paramour Dalrene Ingram are played by Alston Koch and Jacqueline Fernandez. Koch is a pop singer now living in Australia, and it isnt known if hes got previous acting experience. Fernandez has made a breakthrough into Bollywood cinema, though this is her first experience acting in a Sri Lankan movie.
As for Ingram, her mind is a vacuum, making her look and sound stupid. That she may have been in awe of the friar is without any doubt
They carry it off, but just. The trouble is with the films script, which leaves a lot to be desired. I viewed the Sinhala version, not the English. But there is no reason to believe that language will make any difference as long as its the same script, which fails to give much depth to the character of a man with a diabolical mind and the charm of a devil.
As for Ingrams character, Fernandez is ever the obliging wife of a nice, handsome man who gets murdered, and the equally obliging mistress of a madman in a friars cloak. Didnt Dalrene Ingram have a mind of her own
Matthew Peiris acquired a reputation as an exorcist, and toured other countries, including Australia, performing such rites. But this aspect of his life, a crucial element, is not given enough play in the film.
We see him performing just one exorcism, and that looks very unconvincing. Chandran Ratnam is an experienced film maker and its hard to understand this lacklustre approach towards what is a riveting real-life murder mystery.
The film picks up its pace after the murder of the friars wife, at which point the police investigation begins. However, the story as presented in the film, raises a fascinating question: did Dalrene Ingram actually know that Matthew Peiris was calculating and murdering her husband as well as his own wife, or was she a duped victim 
We have to assess the friars mind through those Bible passages he reads aloud. That doesnt mean much to those who dont know the Bible
This is what the film seems to suggest. If so, her conviction and incarceration would be a miscarriage of justice. The police would have had no interest in proving her lack of culpability, even if they believed her to be a victim.
As for the defence lawyer, he was hired by the friar to defend both, when the prosecution assumed that both parties were guilty. He couldnt have argued otherwise even if he believed Dalrene Ingram did not knowingly support the friars diabolical double-murder plan.
However, that might be, the script sounds bland much of the time. We have to assess the friars mind through those Bible passages he reads aloud. That doesnt mean much to those who dont know the Bible. As for Ingram, her mind is a vacuum, making her look and sound stupid. That she may have been in awe of the friar is without any doubt. He lorded over people and would have been her lord as much as her lover. But what did they talk about

She was surrounded by people who distrusted and disliked the friar, but she seems to be blissfully unaware of his dark side. Without such raison detre, the film fails to be convincing.
As for Ingrams character, Fernandez is ever the obliging wife of a nice, handsome man who gets murdered, and the equally obliging mistress of a madman in a friars cloak
The musical score works on and off, sometimes rising to the occasion and sometimes wandering away. The cinematography is effective without being remarkable, and one puzzling thing: the names of the main actors were given at the start, but the titles at the end seem to have missed something.
After a parade of producers, the names of technical staff and those scores of people who work to make a film failed to appear, as they usually do in a feature film.

Muslims should reconstruct damaged Buddha statues: Marikkar
	
Muslims should reconstruct the Buddha statues which were vandalized in Mawanella recently to prove their sincerity and innocence, parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar said today.
The Muslims should do so as a gesture of goodwill and to show their willingness to co-exist in peace and harmony with other ethnic groups, he told a media briefing last morning.
I am also willing to attend to any repairs if I get a chance to do so, the MP said and denied allegations that he had influenced the police not to investigate this incident.
However, I did speak to IGP and asked him to carry out investigations on the hate speech that is being spread via social media and arrest those who are behind it and also to arrest those who are behind the incident in Mawanella, he said.
Mr. Marikar said he enjoyed a good rapport with the Buddhist clergy as he has been providing financial assistance to temples even before taking up to politics. (Yohan Perera)

Nuisance parking; tough action needed
	
A phenomenon noted by everyone with the rise in the number of vehicles on the roads is the mushrooming of garages in every nook and corner in the Colombo suburbs. Almost 75 percent of these are tiny, shady spaces and probably without even proper licences.
With the latter came another occurrence - the parking of thousands of garage vehicles on pavements and also on the roads, including main roads and by roads, causing a major nuisance to motorists and creating traffic snarls. Other than cars and jeeps, the parked garage vehicles sometimes include even buses and trucks.
Besides disturbing the smooth flow of traffic, they also put the lives of pedestrians in jeopardy. When garage vehicles are parked on the pavement, pedestrians have no choice but to get on to the road. If the vehicles are parked on the corner lane of the road, pedestrians are compelled to walk on the middle lane amidst traffic.
The other group of culprits of this nuisance includes customers of cafeterias. Often eateries are seen allowing their customers to park vehicles on the pavement, and also on the road. Although there are by-laws regarding parking of vehicles, hardly anyone seems to take note of it. Such a practice by a restaurant in Colombo, near the St. Bridgets roundabout, causes traffic jams daily throughout the day. However, police and local authorities have turned a blind eye to that for reasons best known to them. 
The lack of space for parking is never an excuse to flout laws and become a nuisance to others. One way of addressing this is to take local bodies to task. These councils only need to get the police to patrol the main roads, by roads, and even lanes, to check nuisance parking at least for a week. If a fine is imposed on the offenders, and police implement this rule to the last letter, the habit of parking on pavements and roads will come to an end. 
The other is checking the legality of the garages in suburbs. Its likely that a large number of them do not have licences. Even those who do, ideally should not have got their permits if they did not have adequate space to park at least four or five vehicles.
The local bodies should have checked the availability of space before issuing permits. The same should be applied to restaurants as well.
There should be at least two parking slots for eateries where sit-down meals are available. Its perhaps too late to correct the mistakes that the authorities have already made. However, that would not in any way mitigate the gravity of the issue  traffic chaos created by them in suburban Colombo and even some areas in Colombo city.
Although today we boast of being a second world nation, the impunity with which the traffic laws are flouted surely calls for greater attention by the government. The radar of the law, it seems, is either dim or dying when it comes to parking. 
The fact that theres no consolidated plan either by the municipal councils or the police calls for the attention of a bigger authority to sort out this mess. Perhaps its time the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development took the matter into its hands, and put an end to this nuisance.

'Only Middle East Countries' passports -- Issuance to end on Dec.31
	
In view of Sri Lanka introducing the e-passport service to its citizens, the issuance of passports valid 'Only For Middle East Countries' would no longer be issued from December 31 this year, the Immigration and Emigration Department said today.
Immigration and Emigration Controller General M.N. Ranasinghe said only passports valid for 'All Countries' will be issued from January 1, 2019.
He said the department was hoping to implement the e-passport project soon with an electronic chip that carries the owner's biodata.
Most Sri Lankans who have passports valid only for 'Middle East Countries' have to obtain another passport when they need to travel for jobs in countries like South Korea and Cyprus. We have placed orders for only 'all countries passports' to be issued until the implementation of the e-passport project, Mr. Ranasinghe said.
However, the department had earlier reported a shortage of new passports because of the delay in implementing e-passports scheduled for early this year. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Policeman's phone rings in woman's bag inside police station
	
The theft of a mobile phone belonging to a police officer who was inquiring a clash between two women inside the police station was reported in the Mawathagama area recently.
A woman who was fighting with another woman has made a complaint with the police.
Both parties were summoned to the police station and the inquiry was conducted by a police officer.
Concluding the inquiry the Police Inspector was looking for his mobile phone which was lying on the table a moment ago. As he could not find the phone, he had asked one of his colleagues to ring his phone.
To his utter surprise, the phone rang from inside the handbag of one of the women who was summoned for the inquiry.
The Inspector searched the handbag and recovered his phone whilst the owner of the handbag turned red in sheer embarrassment. (Kanchana Mala Bandara)

Presidential vs Parliamentary elections Govt. divided  on which poll  to have
	
President Sirisena categorically has asked the Central Committee of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to rev up the partys engine ahead of elections next year.
Though President Maithripala Sirisena reappointed United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, he vowed that he would not have political ties with the new Government. True to his words, he declined to swear in anyone from his United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the new Cabinet despite requests made by the UNP. He also turned down a request to form a national unity Government.
The affirmed position of the President was reflected once again on his decision to delay the assignment of subjects to the new Ministries. The Gazette notification is yet to be released announcing the subjects and the institutions coming under each Ministry. It has handicapped the Ministers who wish to carry out their work diligently.
The President is not cooperating with the Government
	Accordingly, the President seems to be asserting himself in full measure
	The UPFA has renewed its efforts in terms of re-organising
The President is at present on an overseas visit, and expected in the country next week. The assignment of institutions can be expected only after his return. Until such times, the newly sworn in ministers will remain tightened in the discharge of their duties, barring the execution of normal routine work.
The assignment of subjects and institutions are also difficult tasks this time. Compared with the Cabinet of the Government that existed before October 26, each Minister has a wider scope. The subjects and the institutions that were spread among a few Ministries have to be placed under the purview of one minister or ministry this time.
For example, there were separate ministers for northern development and vocational training in the previous Cabinet. As of present, both have been brought under the Prime Minister since the size of the Cabinet has to be restricted to 30 members. Probably, this is also a reason for the delay in gazetting subjects and institutions. Yet, it is not impossible to do it within a short span of time if the President is fully-hearted with the Cabinet at this hour.
The UPFA is keen to see a snap general election which can possibly come about only through a parliamentary declaration by two-thirds approval
The President is not cooperating with the Government. He indicated it first by refusing to stand for a group photo with the new Cabinet of Ministers. Secondly, he disregarded some nominees by the Prime Minister for Cabinet posts. Now, he has delayed the assignment of subjects.
According to the 19th Amendment, the President has to appoint ministers to the Cabinet in consultation with the Prime Minister. However, the President has more authority in the assignment of subjects to them. Accordingly, the President seems to be asserting himself in full measure. 
On a bumpy road
Therefore, the Government is expected to travel on a bumpy road when its members get to charge their duties. Importantly, the next year would be an election year, and the political parties are now bracing for it. The Presidential Elections are due to be conducted by the end of 2019. Besides, elections are overdue regarding six provincial councils.
The UPFA, which is virtually a combination of factions led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, is keen to see a snap general election which can possibly come about only through a parliamentary declaration by two-thirds approval.
Besides, the UNP is agitating for a snap presidential election. Of course, the President can declare such an election at any time after January 8, next year if he wishes to seek a fresh mandate for himself to run for a second term only. Otherwise, the Presidential Elections have to be conducted by the end of 2019 according to the election calendar. Therefore, the parties would make every possible move to appease voters; that is by giving relief and avoiding unpopular policy decisions.
On this score, the UNP would avoid policy clashes with the President as much as possible. In fact, it will opt for a fully pledged Budget early next year with a host of relief measures for people as part of its preparations for the elections on the cards.
Already, Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera has announced that he will present a Budget during the first quarter of next year. During the first three and half years of its rule, the UNP tried to implement its economic reforms, an act that riled constituents on some instances. Tax reforms, the leasing out of the Hambantota Port and the plan to lease out the Mattala airport and the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm were such measures that were not populist. Now, the UNP is unlikely to resort to such moves. Instead, it would allocate more money in the upcoming Budget for investment in the public sector. Also, there will be relief measures for farmers and public servants. Practically speaking, it will be difficult for the UNP to proceed with its reform agenda because the President stands in the way. Alongside, a sizeable number of UNP MPs are carrying out an internal struggle for a new leadership to steer the party at the future elections. Some of them even make open remarks to this effect. Recently sworn in Non-Cabinet Minister Ajith P.Perera, at a function in Kolonnawa, referred to Minister Sajith Premadasa as the President to be in a few months time. The UNP enters the New Year with preparations for elections while grappling with an internal struggle for a new leadership.
Though the UNP, in general, seeks a presidential election, a section of the party is in favour of a resolution to be adopted by Parliament to conduct a snap parliamentary election. But, it is resisted by others within the party. Come what way, the Government will proceed with its work next year bearing in mind the vital national elections, be it presidential or parliamentary.

The UPFA has renewed its efforts in terms of re-organising to position itself to contest elections. President Sirisena categorically asked the Central Committee of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to rev up the partys engine ahead of elections next year.You have to consider the next year as an election year, he told the Central Committee. Also, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa  has decided to launch a re-organization campaign.
The SLPP and the SLFP are also in touch with each other these days on the formation of a new political alliance. Instead of the UPFA, these two parties will register a new alliance under a fresh symbol next year. The faction, loyal to Rajapaksa, decided to stand by the President in case the UNP moves to impeach him.An impeachment motion against the President will be moved by the UNP only in the event of the President becoming increasingly hostile towards it.

Resolution of political crisis shows resilience of democratic institutions: Cwealth Chief
	
The way in which the political crisis in Sri Lanka was resolved is a testament to the strength and resilience of Sri Lanka's democratic institutions, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said.
In a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, on his new appointment as Premier, she said the commitment of political stakeholders to the democratic process was also reflected by the way the crisis was resolved.
I write to welcome the peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka and to congratulate you on the occasion of your swearing in to mark your re-installation as Prime Minister. In particular, I commend you and other political stakeholders for your steadfastness in defence and support of the rule of law and the constitutional framework, she said.
She also said the Commonwealth remains ready to support Sri Lanka's efforts to improve political reconciliation, progress constitutional reform, and entrench the rule of law.
I trust we will be able to progress a number of engagements which we are hoping to take forward with Sri Lanka, and very much look forward lo building on the longstanding and fruitful partnership between your country and the Commonwealth Secretariat, she said.

## Title: The 19A as the UNPs plaything

The 19A as the UNPs plaything
	
It is reported that the Government has decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on the possibility of increasing the size of the Cabinet of Ministers to 32. The argument is that the President and Prime Minister should not be included in the 30 member cabinet, as limited by the 19th Amendment. The Government is therefore seeking a green light considering the legal ambiguity. 
Interestingly, one of the main figures in the making of the 19th Amendment, Jayampathy Wickramaratne, claimed recently that The National Government which allows Parliament to decide the size of the cabinet, continued to exist despite the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) withdrawing from the government, because, in his words, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) continues to be in it. 
If this constitutional expert of the United National Party (UNP), who also helped author the 19th Amendment, believes that we still have a national government, why is Ranil Wickremesinghes government sweating over numbers, one must ask. 
When the 19A was tabled in Parliament, a dissolving clause was included, probably in view of the SC determination
The 19th amendment is a remarkable piece of legislation. For all the wrong reasons, one must add. The authors were first rapped on their metaphorical knuckles by the Supreme Court (SC) which determined that sections of the draft were unconstitutional and would require two-thirds support in Parliament plus endorsement through a referendum in order to hold. Interestingly, the SC probably drew from a determination it had delivered way back in 2002 in a case filed by Wickramaratne himself, where he pleaded that the Presidents powers to dissolve Parliament cannot be taken away by Parliament. When the 19A was tabled in Parliament, a dissolving clause was included, probably in view of the SC determination. That was the genesis of the confusion. In essence, then, the SC revoked an earlier decision when it determined that President Maithripala Sirisena did not have the power to dissolve Parliament, rendering the dissolution article meaningless. We have to conclude that the 19A was a piece of legislation that was written and voted for by sophomoric lawmakers. Wait, theres another explanation: it was a deliberate exercise in constitutional tinkering for partisan reasons; in other words for the benefit of the UNP! 
Some basic questions would put the matter to rest. First of all, why couldnt the likes of Wickramaratne and Sumanthiran come up with a draft that was ambiguity-free with regard to dissolution Secondly, why did they offer a vague definition of national government that made it possible for people like Wickramaratne to come up with the absurd claim that a UNP+SLMC arrangement would fulfil national government criteria Thirdly, why did they make a mockery of independence when legislating the composition of the politician-heavy Constitutional Council 
It is against all this that we need to examine the current dola-duka of the UNP government regarding increasing cabinet-size. Clearly, that party doesnt give two hoots about promises made to the electorate. Thats not surprising since one of the key leaders of the UNP, Mangala Samaraweera, once brushed aside manifestos as being irrelevant once elections were done. This is obviously not something that is important to the sad bunch of pro-democracy activists who came out of the woodwork recently when it appeared that Sirisena had well and truly trumped Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP. 
The 19th amendment is a remarkable piece of legislation. For all the wrong reasons, onemust add
Why 32 Whats this fascination with increasing cabinet-size Who does Wickremesinghe want to pencil in What checks are being submitted by whom for what kind of services rendered, are we permitted to ask 
The composition of the Cabinet itself is a damning indictment on the Prime Minister and his government. Starting from the top, we have Wickremesinghe, who is close to 70 years of age, as Minister of Youth Affairs. We have a ministry for Kandy Development which begs the question, doesnt the logic require ministries for every major city in the country Ravi Karunanayake, who is either the man at the centre of the Central Bank bond scam or at best a front-man for Wickremesinghe, has a portfolio  need we say more We could say more. Rishad Bathiudeen, accused of illegal and communalist settlement exercises is the Minister of Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons. Theres a ministry for Dry Zone Development. Why not ministries for the development of other climatic zones Malik Samarawickrema didnt want a ministry, but he got one. 
To be fair, Wickremesinghe has not done any worse than his predecessors, dating back to J.R. Jayewardenes time. Then again, the UNP in its good governance avatar was supposed to do things differently. Cannot Will not Will not, obviously! 
To be fair, Wickremesinghe has not done any worse than his predecessors, dating back to J.R. Jayewardenes time
As things stand, then, we can safely conclude that the democratic credentials of the UNP are toilet wash. We can conclude that not only was the 19A a careless piece of legislation thats marked by multiple flaws, the errors were deliberate and designed to favour the UNP. 
Today, ladies and gentlemen, what we see is the UNP and Ranil Wickremesinghe stretching or contracting the 19A in accordance with their political needs. Those who operate in this way do not deserve to be protected, and those who have and continue to protect them (in the name of democracy) have to be considered accessories after the fact of constitutional tinkering, crass political expedience of an anti-democratic political formation and twisting of mandates for partisan reasons. 
Today, ladies and gentlemen, what we see is the UNP and Ranil Wickremesinghe stretching or contracting the 19A in accordance with their political needs
Yes, the 19th Amendment is a remarkable piece of legislation and one that should be studied carefully by students of politics, law and constitutional reform. In terms of process and product, it stands out as an excellent example of how not to write laws.

TNA fighting for post to get new Constitution passed: SLPP
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is fighting hard for the opposition leader's post so that they could get the new Constitution passed in Parliament, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said yesterday.
MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told a news conference that the TNA had even written to the European Union and the United Nation asking them to intervene so that it could get the opposition leader's post.
The TNA wants to return to the time when the opposition was an ally of the government in parliament so they can get the draft of the new Constitution approved, he said.
The MP said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had accepted former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader.
However, the Speaker is yet a give a final ruling on the opposition leader's post because the TNA Leader who previously held the post, had opposed it.
The MP said the new opposition which is led by Mr. Rajapaksa was stronger and would not allow the new Constitution to be approved as long as it included detrimental clauses.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: When reading the pulse  of the people is vital

When reading the pulse  of the people is vital
	
The Xmas spirit in Sri Lanka was dampened somewhat due to both manmade and natural disasters. Much of the north is affected by adverse weather which had left 26,314 families and over 80,000 people displaced by Wednesday(December 26) morning. We heard Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith Perera appealing to the people to provide aid to these displaced people. He said that it was the duty of the people to do so and to focus on this responsibility even though the country was celebrating Christmas. The Cardinal, it seems, is quick to respond when the country is effected by a natural or political disaster.
The manmade disaster was the 52-day chaos that the country plunged into. Normalcy was restored when the Supreme Court ruled that the decision taken by President Sirisena to dissolve parliament before the completion of a four and half year period was unconstitutional. The new Cabinet sworn in on December 20 (Thursday) has a herculean task at hand to resurrect the economy which is burdened by heavy foreign debt.
Maheswarans appointment as a state minister raises eyebrows
	But Sri Lankan politics is such that the bad reigns over good
	The Government has hinted that there would be many surprises in the 2019 Budget
	Though the UNP won its battle within parliament it is set to face mounting challenges outside it in the future
But the challenge for the new Cabinet under President Sirisena would be to work along with the Executive, who is ill-disposed towards its ministers. Premier Wickremesinghe has to continue wearing his thinking cap given that the president rejected a request made by the UNP Leader to reactivate the previous national government. The UNPs motive in making this request was to team up with the SLFP and strengthen the Cabinet.
The UNP has its concerns about the future because as many as 15 government ministers were absent when the last Vote on Account took place. This is very serious and amounts to a breach of trust because the UNPs political future depends on the support of several minority parties. For the record there were several TNA parliamentarians among the 116 who were absent during the voting for the Vote on Account.
He has warned that the Muslims have lost this power to bargain because they have accepted ministerial posts in the new government. This is food for thought for the UNP which is hell-bent on tapping the minority parties
The end of the Christmas celebrations leaves us counting the days till we usher in the new year. But the countrys citizens, focused on 31st Night celebrations are also watchful because among the newly appointed ministers are the names of those who are associated with so much controversy and negativity. Some of the individuals who we would least wish to see as lawmakers are Ravi Karunanayake, Arjuna Ranatunga, John Amaratunga (Cabinet Ministers), Vijeyakala Maheswaran (State Minister) and Palitha Thewarapperuma (Deputy Minister).
Karunanayake was forced to resign as Finance Minister over a controversial Penthouse issue while Ranatunga was time and again embroiled in disputes with the employees of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development during his tenure as its minister.
Good and the bad in politics
Maheswarans appointment as a state minister raises eyebrows because she is a lawmaker who almost brought curtains down on her career as a politician after making the controversial statement that the LTTE should be resurrected in the north. Karunanayake too ran the risk of being eliminated from politics due to his alleged involvement in the Penthouse issue. But Sri Lankan politics is such that the bad reigns over good. In other words those who walk straight are destined to be ousted while those who walk crooked generally enter parliament.
This is why Cabinet Minister and Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ajith P. Perera has stressed that the UNP should play the second innings it has got very cautiously. Perera is of the opinion that the Green Party must serve the people within the limited time it has to ensure it gets a third innings to play in politics.
Despite the UNP getting set to deliver during the upcoming 2019 new year, all eyes are on the new Budget to be presented by the Wickremesinghe government. The Government has hinted that there would be many surprises in the 2019 Budget. But whats inauspicious is that the UNP controlled Kandy Municipal Council Budget for 2019 was defeated a few days ago.
The UNP has its concerns about the future because as many as 15 government ministers were absent when the last Vote on Account took place. This is very serious and amounts to a breach of trust
The UNP led government has to pick up these signals if it is to read the pulse of the people and make necessary adjustments. Another disturbing news is that as many as six provincial councils have gone public in saying that they would not support the new government. Though the UNP won its battle within parliament it is set to face mounting challenges outside it in the future.
The TNA for now offers its support to the UNP. But it has put down many conditions for the support it extends. The UNP might not be able to meet all these demands. In this wake there is another minority party, the United Peace Alliance, which has made a very strong point. Its Chairman and former minister Basheer Segu Dawood has affirmed that the Muslims have bargaining power only till they remain in the opposition. He has warned that the Muslims have lost this power to bargain because they have accepted ministerial posts in the new government. This is food for thought for the UNP which is hell-bent on tapping the minority parties by offering them ministerial posts for its survival.
