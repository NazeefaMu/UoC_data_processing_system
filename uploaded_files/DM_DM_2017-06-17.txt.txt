BAs computer meltdown will cost at least 80m
	

(Daily Mail), 15 June 2017 - The fiasco that left British Airways passengers stranded will cost the airline at least 80 million. 
Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA owner International Airlines Group, shared the full cost of the disruption with shareholders at the firms annual meeting yesterday, and promised to update them with further details when appropriate. 
Around 75,000 passengers were grounded and 726 flights cancelled, over the bank holiday weekend in May when the airlines IT system failed.Walsh said the company was working hard to ensure that affected passengers would be compensated as soon as possible. 
British Airways, which commissioned an independent investigation into the outage, alongside its own internal probe, also dismissed claims the systems failure had been caused by the outsourcing of its IT department.

Bond sales: AG's selections contains miscalculations: Counsel
	
The document prepared by the Auditor General in selecting samples of 'Treasury Bond Auctions' he would audit with regard to the Central Bank bond sales contained miscalculations, it was revealed yesterday during cross examination.
Initially, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe was required to conduct a special audit on bond auctions held between February 27, 2015 and May, 2016.
He had chosen two TB auctions held on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016, which depicted strange issues.
He had decided to conduct the audit on the two particular auctions based on a document prepared by him using data on the CBSL bond sales during this period.
At the cross examination led by Senior Counsel Shanaka de Silva, who appeared for former Governor it was revealed that the Auditor General had selected sample auctions unfairly because he had only decided to conduct audit those betwee February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016 and that the decision was taken based on inaccurately prepared documents.
It was revealed that the Auditor General had computed wrongly in the document when deciding percentage of excess amount of bids accepted on March 29, 2016 comparing to the offered amount of the bids.
The value of the bids offered by the CBSL initially at the auction (March 29, 2016) was Rs. 40 billion but had unusually accepted Rs. 77.732 billion bids exceeding Rs.37.732 billion by the CBSL.
The miscalculated percentage of excess amount of bids accepted depicted in the AGs document as 326%, where it should be 190% compared to the offered amount of bids at the particular auction, explained Mr. de Silva.
Mr. de Silva was of the view that the AG was biased when selecting sample auctions for auditing.
The AG had responded saying his miscalculations had not affected his final recommendations in the audit report submitted to COPE, therefore they were not serious.
Nevertheless, the PCoI said the matter revealed by the counsel representing the former governor was a serious matter since the commission would rely on the data submitted by the AG and therefore a correction was required in case of miscalculations. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Ex-N. Korea  detainee suffering from loss of brain tissue: Doctors
	

CINCINNATI - Otto Warmbier, who was medically evacuated from a 17-month detention in North Korea this week, has extensive loss of brain tissue and is in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, University of Cincinnati doctors said Thursday afternoon. 
Doctors said they dont know what caused the brain damage. When asked whether it could be the result of beating or other violence while in prison, they said that Warmbier did not show any obvious indications of trauma, nor evidence of either acute or healing fractures. 
The doctors said they are not aware of anything from his previous medical history, prior to his time in North Korea, that might cause cardiopulmonary arrest. One of the more common causes of cardiopulmonary arrest is respiratory arrest, said Jordan Bonomo, neurointensivistand emergency medicine physician at UC Health. That cessation of breathing could be triggered by several things, including intoxication or a traumatic injury.

Govt. advt. calls for uni students to follow right path
	
The government in a newspaper advertisement yesterday made an appeal to all university students to attend all lectures and focus on their studies by following the right path to success without wasting their time by protesting on the streets.
The Presidential Secretariat, Higher Education Ministry and the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry had jointly made this appeal to university students.
We often see university students wasting their time protesting on our roads: exposed to the weather and tear gas. They chant slogans written by somebody else on matters they dont fully understand. Their behaviour causes massive traffic jams affecting millions. What a waste of time all around, the advertisement said.
It also questioned why university students allowed themselves to be used as scapegoats by political opportunists.
It said the hard working parents had supported their children to learn, graduate and become productive citizens and not to go astray like this.
The government spends millions to produce each medical doctor. Students who miss their lectures to take part in demonstrations are squandering taxpayers' money and their own futures. They also become a public nuisance, it said in the advertisement.
It said that the government wanted to equip its youth with quality education to meet tomorrows challenges and a responsible government had to make decisions with all citizens interests in mind and take the broader view on higher education.
Dont idle on the roads! Take the right path to success, it added.

I was provoked excessively: John
	
Responding to the allegation that he had attempted to assault a journalist, Minister John Amarathunga said he was provoked excessively by the journalist and it was beyond the limit of his patience.
Commenting on the recent incident that took place at his house in Kandana, at a media briefing at UNP Headquarters Sirikotha yesterday, the minister said journalists should not abuse the freedom they have and that he had warned this journalist on several occasions earlier as well.
I have had connections with journalists for a long period of time and never experienced such an incident. Journalists should be disciplined and moderate in their behaviour but some acted in an arrogant manner . He has also complained to the Human Right Commission- but he cannot do so as this incident happened in my residence," the Minister said.
He also said some tried to take these incidents as opportunities to go abroad. I had asked them to leave as they were trying to send us beyond the limits of our patience
The incidents in the past when the journalists were suppressed are known to us and this recent event is comparatively simple, he said. (Sujith Hewajulige)

Lands in which landslides have occurred and which are at the risk of experiencing landslides will be acquired by the government, Minister Thalatha Atukorale said yesterday.
Addressing a function in Ratnapura, Minister Atukorale said that the government would provide these people with lands after acquiring their lands. The government has decided to offer a housing allowance of Rs. 7 500 per month to people who had lost their homes until they get new homes, she said.
She said that they would offer this housing allowance to disaster affected people even though it would take five or six months for the reconstruction of their houses.
As a government, we have taken all the necessary steps to provide relief to these people. We also think of the education of students in disaster affected areas, she said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

NPC CM has stirred up hornets nest: Sampanthan
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan said yesterday Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran had created an unnecessary crisis by opting to take action against two provincial ministers not found guilty of any allegation.
He said this in reference to the no-confidence motion submitted against the CM by the members of the Ilankai Tamil Arachu Katchi (ITAK).
Mr. Sampanthan told Daily Mirror that the CM had appointed a committee comprising two retired judges and one senior civil servant to look into corruption allegations against the NPC ministers.
He said one minister was found guilty of corruption while another of administrative lapses but the other two ministers were not found guilty of any charges.
Yet, the CM asked these two ministers to vacate their posts and go on leave. There is no provision for that. The ministers must resign or are removed from their ministerial posts. The action by the CM was not acceptable to the ITAK, Mr. Sampanthan said.
He said the CM stirred up an hornets nest by making a statement regarding these two ministers.
The CM can take action against those found guilty and it is a matter for him to resolve, Mr. Sampanthan said. (Kelum Bandara)

Regime Change in Ceylon: 1815
	
The West won the world, not by the superiority of its ideas, values or religion but, rather, by its superiority in applying organised violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-westerners never do -- Samuel R Huntington
History matters. Obeyesekere relates events, two centuries after they had occurred and a century after the Russian Revolution. Yet they are all so contemporary! Confused by memories, living in a very unpredictable past and troubled by Fukuyamas statement that all had ended, Obeyesekere has given a fillip to re-interrogating the relevance of history. Both Hegel and Marx considered History to be teleology, moving to a purpose. The impact of Portugal and Holland on Sri Lanka was akin to the placid non-movement in a cemetery: 1815 regime change, headed by the leading country of the Industrial Revolution, promised traction to a stalled Hegel and Marx. 
It is desirable to learn history, but, it is more enchanting to make it. Needed societal change- the making of history- takes place, not by pensively contemplating the navel or delivering profound statements from pulpits or their equivalents, but through actions which necessarily entail violence and pain. History making without violence is like having rice without a spicy curry. Force is the midwife for every old decaying society pregnant with the new. It is a birthing of history. 
A regime change was introduced by the British in 1815, in the governance arrangements of the Kandyan Provinces of Ceylon (Sri Lanka, since 1971). Obeyesekere is the recorder of the 1815 birth event. Obeyesekere claims that the 1815 regime change in Sri Lanka is, probably the most momentous event in Sri Lankan history. The British, pushing democratic slogans and expressing concerns for the People, were specialists at inducing violent regime change round the world, all the while preaching morality.In 1952, the elected prime minister of Iran- Mossadeg- was removed by Britain, claiming popular demand. He was replaced by the reviled ex-Shah, booted out earlier to huge acclaim by the People. (Iran is yet paying the price for this British atrocity). Today, Britain is in Afghanistan fighting to introduce democracy, despite being booted out of that country on four occasions. 
The 1815 regime change is a 9/11 event. A 9/11 event is not an individuals biography writ large, a great mans involvement in making history; history is not biography. A 9/11 event is a fulcrum point, giving the future a possibility, like the seething promise offered in 1917, which begat the Bolshevik revolution. A successful 9/11 event leads to all encompassing systemic changes, a full blown rehash of all aspects of the prevailing political economy of a society- politics, power relations, economics, social relations and culture. It could be progressive or retrogressive, depending on the value system of the viewer. History is tenacious, more than Fukuyama would care to know. 9/11 is a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. Unfortunately, Obeyesekeres study restricts itself to the input- the mechanics of take-over of territory but not the stabilisation of take-over- for example, the inhuman crushing of the reaction to 1815, or, the output- long term exploitation of the resources taken over. If not for the regime change of 1815, todays Sri Lanka would be a Nepal. 
Prior to 1505, Sri Lankas migrant streams were sourced from within the Indian sub-continent. From 1505, this migrant catchment widened, to cover the European continent. After 1505, the Portuguese and the Dutch ruled the Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka, for periods of 150 years. In 1796, the British East India Company took over the Maritime Provinces from the Dutch, under a diplomatic deal called the Treaty of Amiens, and incorporated them as part of the Madras Presidency, a commercial company exercising sovereignty! (It is a supreme irony that this company, is, today, fully owned by an Indian citizen). This bastardly governance arrangement could not last: in 1802, this brand was re-imagined and nationalised. The Maritime Provinces were then placed under the British colonial secretary. There were now two polities in Sri Lanka, the Maritime Provinces under the British and an independent Kandyan Kingdom, under her own King. (The map on page 24 presents the cartography). 
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, (SVR) (1798-1815), the King of the Kandyan Provinces and Frederick North (1798-1805), the Governor appointed by the British authorities to head of the newly acquired Maritime Provinces, assumed their positions of responsibility in 1798. SVR and North (sequentially succeeded by Maitland (1805-1811) and Brownrigg (1812-1820)), were the dramatis personae in this gripping prose drama written by Obeyesekere. From the beginning, the only objective of the British was to make the Kandyan Kingdom a subordinate political entity to the British crown, mostly for international reasons, and prevent the Kandyan King from breaking out of her landlocked geography. This was Britains dedicated imperial project. The objective of the Kandyan Kingdom was the opposite. It was a zero-sum game. The fall of redoubtable Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1799, further whetted Norths appetite for Kandyan conquest. 
The British tried many soft approaches to gain her objective, primarily using the talent of a Cambridge educated intelligence chief, John DOyly, working under Maitland and later Brownrigg. Without suffering any moral anguish, he cynically catered to the whimsical self-development objectives of leading Kandyan nobles. He suborned personalities and dissatisfied Kandyan upper strata, which included Pilimatalawe- the first Adigar-, and later Ehelepola, his successor. The British sponsored pretenders to the Kandyan throne- Muttuswami was one of them, pushed one-sided draft treaties, supported anti-Tamil programs in the Kandyan areas. There were demonising psychological warfare campaigns- psycho-ops- to induce mass sentiment change against the King. Using a copious flow of alternative facts, SVR was painted a foreigner, an unacceptable Tamil. There was an active disinformation drive. When everything failed, the British opted for the hard approach of war. 
The first, the 1803-1804 war, was a humiliating defeat for the British, North having to declare martial law in his own Maritime Provinces. The British partially burnt down the Dalada Maligawa, a precursor to the ashing of the Jaffna Library. Obeyesekere records these hard and soft strategies in meticulous detail. Eventually, persistent British efforts bore fruit, SVR falling victim to multiple dark arts of subversion. The ethic of the playing fields of Eton were not too evident in these strategies. The deck was stacked too heavily against the King. The British declared war again in 1815 on trumped up charges. It ended shortly and swiftly. 
After SVRs defeat, he departed to Vellore, drummed into exile by the British, supported by a bunch of undercutting and collaborating Kandyan aristocracy, Ekneligoda being the despicable worst. A Shakesperean dramatist could have written an entrancing play of this period, portraying the interplay of intrigue, violence, power, ambition, betrayal, treachery and sheer bloody-mindedness. As Obeyesekere drily remarks, the European world at that time, and in our own times, was a world of violence and bloodshed, and it needed a great deal of self-deception to say that the British of 1815 was the exemplar of tolerance and humanity, as the British like to represent themselves. With SVRs departure, the long and distinguished history of Sri Lanka as an independent country was over, ended with her evisceration by Kandys brightest and the best. 
From all accounts, SVR was a popular king devoted to infrastructure development, a compulsive builder of dams, ponds, and irrigation works. He rebuilt the Dalada Maligava, partially burnt by British forces in the 1803-04 war. He built the Octogon and the Kandy Lake. He had a spacious vision for a Cosmic City of Kandy, like the vision the government has for todays Colombo city. He had a reputation for sensuality, indulgence, depravity, brutality and evil which could partly be a labelling effect, produced by propaganda spurning any sense of objectivity. He had his enemies, who were determined to bring him down and replace him with one of their kind, if they could decide who that person was to be. SVR was the Premadasa of his age, the latter surviving a deposition by impeachment. An example offered of SVRs evil, was the Pounding Episode, the cruel punishment imposed on Kumarihamy, the wife of first Adigar, Ehelapola. 
Kumarihamys family tragedy occupies significant space in Obeyesekeres narrative, as it should. It is an example of the building of a myth model. According to Obeyesekere, myth models are those forms of life with an event from a powerful story or a myth which is then employed in a variety of contexts. Myth is sometimes equated with falsehood but in Obeyesekeres specific usage, it deals with profound or symbolic truths that nevertheless operate in everyday life------Thus a myth model occurs when some powerful event from the past is replicated in the present, the latter becoming a myth model based on the former. 
The Pounding Episode is an example of the visceral simplicity of myth formation. Kumarihamy, was the wife of the first Adigar (Chief Minister) Ehelapola. Ehelapola succeeded Pilimatalawa, against whom there was a proven case of traitorous relationships with the British. Pilimatalawa was unmasked, tried and executed, after which Ehelapola was appointed to the post. With the British, whose unremitting endeavour was the deposition of SVR, Kandy became the intrigue capital of Sri Lanka. Hot- house Kandy was the equivalent of Vienna of post WWII intrigue- depicted well in Orson Welless black and white film, The Third Man or Berlin of the cold war- depicted in Le Carres The Man Who Came In from The Cold. Rumour and counter-rumour swirled, many of them centering round the unsated ambitions of Ehelapola. Eventually, these rumours were confirmed. Before the King could take action, Ehelapola fled to Colombo, without obtaining the Kings approval to leave Kandy, which he was obliged to do. In such a situation, the law was that the family could be incarcerated as hostages, pending the return of the fugitive or suffer the same penalties as a traitor.
Ehelapola did not return and the rule of law was applied. Obeyesekere quotes Thoen, a Dutch gunner who reported that,  four children of Ehelapola Adigar had their heads cut off, the youngest being torn from their mothers breast for the purpose. Their bodies were dragged through the streets of Kandy and the heads put into a mortar, the pestle of which was forced into the mothers hand, and she was obliged to pound the mangled bodies of her own children. (It was said later that she had agreed to do so under duress. If she had not complied, she was threatened with ravishment by a Rodiya, an unheard of indignity). She, with three more women relations of the Adigar, were then led to the brink of a large tank, by some female slaves of the palace, their hands and feet being bound a stone tied round the neck of each. They were thrown into the lake, where their bodies still remain.
Obeyesekere, in the best traditions of a critical academic, casts doubt on the pounding episode. Thoen was not an eye witness to render this vivid account, as he was the prisoner of the King, incarcerated in distant Uva. Father Ehelapola, did not refer to the pounding nor did DOyly, though, if the story were true, they would have been the first to give it widespread publicity. Neither Brownrigg nor Thoen made any attempt to spread this story among the people. The childrens beheading did take place but the pounding is untethered by fact. 
Obeyesekere attributes the behaviour of some of the Kandyan nobles, like Ekneligoda, to being suffused with Ressentiment. Ressentiment is not a fancy French noun to depict resentment. Obeyesekeres glossary clarifies, Ressentiment as an important term invented by Friedrich Nietzsche, to denote extreme and unrepentant malevolence. In page 306-307, Obeyesekere writes, Ekneligoda is an Iago or Richard III typecharacter and exemplifies what Nietzche brilliantly diagnosed as ressentiment, a man who carries a deep grudge or a sense of indubitable wrong done to him, a person with a venomous eye. This characterisation is partially correct but misleading. Re-sentiment is the psychology of a superfluous person, educated into a sense of hope and entitlement (in Sri Lanka free education) but rendered adrift by his limited circumstances and abandonment, and, thereby, open to feelings of weakness, inferiority and envy, which could ferment into malevolence. He is spiritually unmoored. He could be a member of the JVP, never the Kandyan nobility. 
Obeyesekere should be congratulated on his presentation of the complex events of this period and with fidelity. His book should be read not only for the minute of the details of the regime change of 1815, but also for the alerts it provides. If historys lessons were not heeded, Mankind is surely destined to consumed by them.

Russian army says it may have killed IS chief
	

MOSCOW AFP June16, 2017  -The Russian army on Friday said it hit Islamic State leaders in an airstrike in Syria last month and was seeking to verify whether IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed. 
In a statement, the army said Sukhoi warplanes carried out a 10-minute night-time strike on May 28 at a location near Raqa, where IS leaders had gathered to plan a pullout by militants from the groups stronghold. 
Senior commanders of the military groups of the so-called IS military council, 30 mid-ranking field commanders and up to 300 militants who provided security for them were eliminated, it said. The elusive IS supremo Baghdadi has not been seen in public since proclaiming himself caliph in the Iraqi city of Mosul three years ago.

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan today urged Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran to take early remedial action in regard to the two ministers who were not found guilty by the board of Inquire of the chief minister.
In a letter to Mr. Vigneswaran, the TNA Leader said the board of inquiry conducted investigations in respect of the four council ministers but only two ministers have been found guilty and two others have not been found guilty.
"You stated in the Provincial Council that you would act on the basis of the report of the board of inquiry. You have called for the resignations of the two ministers found guilty. No one has complained about that decision.The complaint is about the action taken by you against the other two ministers in regard to whom there is no finding of guilt by the board of inquiry. This action is being seen as a violation of the principles of natural justice and unwarranted," the MP said.
The letter sent by the TNA Leader
16.06.2017
Hon. Justice CV Wigneswaran,
Chief Minister Northern Province
My Dear Wignes,
Thank you for your letter of 14.06.2017 with copy of speech made by you.
I wish to state the following. The board of inquiry appointed by you conducted investigations in respect of four ministers. The inquiry had been concluded and their report submitted to you. Two have been found guilty and two others have not been found guilty.
You stated in the Provincial Council that you would act on the basis of the report of the board of inquiry.
You have called for the resignations of the two ministers found guilty. No one has complained about that decision.
The complaint is about the action taken by you against the other two ministers in regard to whom there is no finding of guilt by the board of inquiry. This action is being seen as a violation of the principles of natural justice and unwarranted.
I called you on Tuesday the 13th to convey to you that such action could be resisted by the two ministers not found guilty and the members of the provincial council and suggested caution.
I also expressed concern that while you had been in touch with the other leaders of constituent parties in the Tamil National Alliance you had not discussed this matter with Hon. Mavai Senathirajah Member of Parliament and Leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK). You have called him later in the day and he had conveyed to you that action should not be taken against Ministers not found guilty.
On Wednesday the 14th you announced punitive action even against the two ministers who had not been found guilty. Whatever that happened thereafter was as a result of your aforesaid action.
It is my view that to bring things to an end it is necessary to first take remedial action pertaining to the two ministers who have not been found guilty.
Unwarranted action should not be the cause for promoting disunity and disturbing the functioning of the Northern Provincial Council.
I would urge you to take early remedial action in regard to the two ministers not found guilty by your board of inquiry. This would not deter you from holding any further inquiry.
Sincerely,
R. Sampanthan
Leader of the Tamil National Alliance

The annual intake of the College of Education has been limited to 15,000 since 2010, though the university is capable of recruiting 20,700 students annually, the Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) said yesterday (16).
FUTA acting President Aruna Kumara said that about 5,000 students had been deprived of university entrance annually for six years from 2010 to 2015 as a result.There is a huge requirement for science teachers at present. In several schools the authorities have been forced to shut down the science sections due to the lack of teachers for the subject, he said.
Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers' Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said there was a delay in enrolling students to colleges of education. New students have only been enrolled for 2014 up to now. Students belonging to the 2015 and 2016 intake are still waiting for their turn, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

To battle the demons within
	

Sri Lankan film maker Jude Ratnams dbut documentary, Demons in Paradise, got the rare red-carpet honour at the Cannes Film Festival recently, but he is certain that he will be called a traitor for making it. For me, the film was a way of confronting the questions I have had since childhood about my Tamil identity, he told The Hindu in an interview in Colombo. 
As a five-year-old, Mr. Ratnam fled the capital with his parents to escape the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots. His formative years were spent in the Tamil-majority North-East of the island nation where, as a displaced boy, he witnessed different Tamil militant groups organising themselves.
The young men with guns, preparing to fight the oppressive Sri Lankan Army, looked like heroes to me.

Returningto the roots
Later, his family moved to Kandy in the central highlands where his father, an Anglican priest, was stationed, before returning to Colombo. More than three decades later, the filmmaker took the train to the north, just as his family had in 1983, for his 90-minute film on Sri Lankas civil war through the experiences of his own family. 

NGOs think that reconciliation happens when you put five Sinhalese and five Tamils in the same hall of a five-star hotel. How can that ever work without factoring in our histories and the politics of the war How can Tamils reconcile with the Sinhalese before reconciling within the Tamil community first


Take the question of caste. Contrary to what many say, the LTTE never eradicated it; they merely brushed it under the carpet. Otherwise why would we see caste-based discrimination emerging as a major challenge in post-war Tamil society

In its largely autobiographical first half, Mr. Ratnam draws on some vivid childhood memories to narrate how the war impacted his family. My mother would wipe off her pottu (bindi) and my father dressed in sarong to look like the Sinhalese. And those days our family spoke Tamil in hushed tones for the fear of being heard and killed, the 39-year-old filmmaker recalled. 
All the same, the film is not about the Ratnams alone, whose ancestors came to Sri Lanka from Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu six generations ago. He uses his familys past as a peg for a larger story  of a Sinhala majoritarian state that victimised Tamils; of the birth of Tamil armed militancy; of the path it took the Tamil community on; and of the nagging questions that persist eight years after the war ended. 
He goes back to eye-witnesses and people seldom heard in the narratives of war  like the Sinhalese photographer who captured the iconic image of a Tamil man being stripped naked at a bus stop in the heart of Colombo in 1983, shortly before he and others like him were murdered; and the railwayman who witnessed scores of Tamils escaping to the north, including some who were callously thrown off the train. 
It took Mr. Ratnam ten years, and enormous conviction and family support, to make the film. I had to work very hard to convince some people to talk. It was when [Mahinda] Rajapaksa was in power. There was a climate of fear, many were scared to speak candidly about the past, he said. 
This project came out of his disillusionment with the human rights sector  where he had worked  that he felt was severely flawed in its approach. NGOs think that reconciliation happens when you put five Sinhalese and five Tamils in the same hall of a five-star hotel. How can that ever work without factoring in our histories and the politics of the war How can Tamils reconcile with the Sinhalese before reconciling within the Tamil community first he asked. 
These are the questions that dominate the second half of his film. Here, Mr. Ratnam probes the Tamil communitys political choices and militancy using the story of his uncle Manoranjan, who discouraged him from joining the armed struggle. Like many young boys I too toyed with the idea. But he had been there, done that and knew where it was headed. 
Mr. Manoranjan, who was raised in Kandy and speaks fluent Sinhala, moved to the north as the war intensified, where he made an unusual move of joining a small left-wing group, the National Liberation Front of Tamil Eelam (NLFT). But after a few years, with the LTTEs growing hegemony and the repression of other organisations, he decided to give up the gun and continue his political work as a journalist. Following death threats from the LTTE, he was forced to leave Sri Lanka and relocate to Canada. The film shows him visiting the country after many years, re-uniting with the Sinhalese neighbours in Kandy who had given refuge to his family following communal violence; and revisiting some traumatic memories of bloodshed and brutality in Jaffna. 
In this segment, the film turns its lens on the complex impact of the armed struggle on the Tamil community, including through a rare critique of the LTTE from one of its former cadres. We were so cruel you cannot accept that in the name of the struggle, says Vasudevan, now living in the U.K., when recounting his participation in the LTTEs massacre of some 900 militants from the rival Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) in the internal violence that gripped the Tamil polity.
Elsewhere, Mr. Manoranjan breaks down when recalling the LTTEs execution of two dissident student activists  Selvi and Manoharan  who had saved his own life and the lives of others from the Tigers. In an eerily dramatic scene, former militants from different Tamil organisations sit in the dark around a fire, reflecting on how Tamil civilians suffered at the hands of other Tamils who were weeding out rivals and dissidents in their midst.

Need for introspection
This sort of introspection  of the past and its manifestation in the present  is in Mr. Ratnams view indispensable for meaningful post-war reconciliation. Take the question of caste. Contrary to what many say, the LTTE never eradicated it; they merely brushed it under the carpet. Otherwise why would we see caste-based discrimination emerging as a major challenge in post-war Tamil society he asked. 
Asked about the lesser emphasis on state violence in the second half of the film, which depicts the time when the Sri Lankan armed forces turned more brutal as the war heightened and resorted to endless shelling to capture territory held by the LTTE, the filmmaker said: I didnt mean to underplay the atrocities of the Sri Lankan state or the armed forces. In fact, my appeal through this film is not just to the Tamils. But to everyone  are we ready for honest self-introspection 
Mr. Manoranjan also hopes that the film will open some doors in breaking the taboo around the pain inflicted by Tamils on fellow Tamils and Muslims. Tamil society is struggling within itself to do a truthful self-examination of what went wrong. Though it is slowly happening among the ordinary masses, the Tamil media, the academic community, the religious entities and the political parties are still adamantly maintaining silence, he told The Hindu via email. 
While the film subtly points to this apparent silence, it makes no pronouncements. That is because I dont have definite answers. I started off with my own discomfort about being a Tamil and that led me to many questions, said Mr. Ratnam, for whom working on the documentary was cathartic. 
At the end of it, I think I have come to terms with my Tamil identity, shedding the fear and guilt I have had for long, he said. 
Though sceptical about whether many would be willing to screen or distribute the film, he is steeling himself to be labelled a traitor by many Tamils, as the LTTE and its supporters branded its critics within the Tamil society. Not just in Sri Lanka, I want to ask film viewers in India, and particularly in Tamil Nadu, who shed tears for Eelam Tamils, if they have the courage to watch this film made by a Sri Lankan Tamil who lived here all through the years of war.

Trump lashes out at  Russia probe; Pence hires a lawyer
	

A heightened sense of unease gripped the White House on Thursday, as President Donald Trump lashed out at reports that hes under scrutiny over whether he obstructed justice, aides repeatedly deflected questions about the probe and Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged hiring a private lawyer to handle fallout from investigations into Russian election meddling. 
Pences decision to hire Richard Cullen, a Richmond, Virginia-based lawyer who previously served as a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, came less than a month after Trump hired his own private lawyer. 
The hiring of Cullen, whom an aide said Pence was paying for himself, was made public a day after The Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III was widening his investigation to examine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice. 
A defiant Trump at multiple points Thursday expressed his frustration with reports about that development, tweeting that he is the subject of the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history. 
Trump fired off several more tweets in the afternoon voicing disbelief that he was under scrutiny while his crooked Democratic opponent in last years election, Hillary Clinton, escaped prosecution in relation to her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

World Cultural Day
	


The culture of a community is the way it has shaped up its inherent customs and traits, schools of thoughts and attitudes, and faiths and belief. To this end the Ministry of Cultural Affairs gave a glimpse of the beliefs and attitudes of the country at the Pallekelle
Council auditorium. 
The Chief Minister who was the Chief Guest on this occasion said that the language we speak, religion we believe in, our arts and crafts and our customs and rituals handed down several generations, impact our creativity and life styles in a meaningful manner. He also said that man has created culture from the beginning and that countries such as Greece, Egypt and Babylonia with the most ancient histories, boast of rich cultures. He said that Sri Lanka could prove this, and there is evidence that a cultured society existed in this country before 1900 BC. Hence Sri Lanka has a history that we are proud of. 
The Chief Minister added that all these cultural values directly address the peoples hearts, intelligence and souls. He said that Sri Lanka had a multi ethnic, intelligent, discerning, sophisticated and progressive society enriched with mental and spiritual qualities and values. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaranatunge had always believed in peace through consensus. She has done a great deal of work to ensure that other ethnicities were respected and their cultural identities were shared. At the National Thai-Pongal festival held at the Ranabima Royal College, thousands of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim students enjoyed Pongal rice, cultural events and songs together. 
A cultural presentation was held at the auditorium,where special items pertaining to cultural values were presented by schools. The Sri Lanka Air Force presented an Angampora presentation. A exhibition of paintings by school children were
also presented .
