CA Sri Lanka, SAFA, WB and ADB deliberate on accrual accounting
	
As accrual accounting continued to gain ground, South Asia too has begun to extensively deliberate on adopting this methodology for the public sector during a high profile event organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA), World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank.
Speaking at the event, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that accrual-based accounting standards ensures greater transparency and accountability in the public sector, and also helps better monitor
government debt. 
It is important for governments to focus on establishing trust, and to establish trust, it is important for governments to provide accurate and complete information pertaining to the expenditures and transactions in order to demonstrate accountability and professionalism, he told the event which brought together over 200 delegates from across South Asia.
Karunanayake said that in the current context, the role of the accounting professional and their accountability in ensuring good governance is significant. Therefore the regional event on accrual accounting is very appropriate, he said.
World Bank Country Director Idah Z. Pswarayl-Riddihough said South Asian countries have made remarkable progress towards achieving millennium development goals, particularly in poverty reduction, gender equality, and access to primary education, with the region recording a impressive 7.1 percent growth which is expected to increase to 7.3 percent.
However, according to her, despite the unprecedented growth in South Asia, resources still remained scarce, and accountability needed enhancement, and it was also important to create an environment that boosts jobs while also protecting the poorest. ADB Country Director Sri Widowati said that ADB recognizes that investment in socio and economic infrastructure are much more effective and efficient when good governance practices such as a sound public management system is in place.
ADB with other development partners have imparted the importance to most borrowing countries to shape their accounting system from cash based accounting to accrual accounting to enhance the quality of financial reporting in the public sector, she said.
President of SAFA Naeem Akhtar Sheikh said that the road to accrual accounting is the road to prosperity. We accountants strongly believe that accrual accounting is the way forward. And in fact it is the mother reform to take the country forward. The early adoption of public financial management and accrual-based accounting will enable the governments with financial information to make informed decisions and let them know whether they are using the resources effectively and also increase their ability to raise finances,
he said.
Sheikh noted that this financial information will also help in measuring the performances of governments and making them more transparent and accountable. Thus enabling the use of public money in most efficient and effective manner.
President of CA Sri Lanka, Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that even though the public sector directly falls under the purview of a government, it is not only the responsibility of a government to help strengthen this sector. As professional organizations, and international agencies, we all have a responsibility to help enhance the public finance management in our respective countries, he said.
He said that if financial management is effective, it no doubt will lead to enhanced economic development in South Asian countries and the region as a whole.
In recent years, accrual accounting has been a subject that has been widely discussed. Therefore, there is no doubt that accrual accounting is a timely topic even for countries from South Asia, Wickremasinghe added.
The regional event this month held in Colombo brought together policy makers, preparers and users of financial statements, regulators, public auditors, professional accountancy organizations, academia, think tanks and other relevant stakeholders from across South Asia to stimulate thinking on how the region can move financial reporting practices in South Asia to the next level.

Cargills Bank turns a profit in September as margins rise, loans grow
	
Cargills Bank Limited, the financial arm of diversified CT Holdings PLC, turned a net profit of Rs.27.6 million or 5 cents a share during its September quarter (3Q16) from a net loss of Rs. 78.7 million a year ago, the interim financial
accounts showed.
The performance was supported by the relatively higher loan growth and the significant improvement in
interest margins.
The bank for the quarter under review earned a net interest income (NII) of Rs.310.5 million, an increase of 210 percent from the same period last year.
When the industry margins were coming under pressure, Cargills Bank on a standalone basis increased its net interest margin to 6.06 percent from 3.22 percent at the beginning of the year. The bank gave loans of Rs. 5.2 billion during the 9-months to September, 2016, which included Rs.800 million worth of money market loans.
The bank has a total loan book of Rs.12.4 billion and an asset base of Rs.18.6 billion, an increase of
39 percent.
This is despite maintaining a quality portfolio as the gross non-performing loan ratio was only 0.67 percent, an improvement from 1.31 percent at the start of the year. However the bank is still at its early stage of growth and has a lot of scope for its expansion in the
loan book.
The industry average gross non-performing loan ratio is 3.0 percent. 
The capital base stood stronger as both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios (CARs) remaining at 63.43 percent and 61.99 percent, respectively, when the regulatory minimums are at 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent. 
During the 9-months the promoters, Cargills (Ceylon) PLC and CT Holdings PLC, injected a capital of Rs.5.8 billion by allocating 400.14 million shares under special approval received from the Monetary Board of the Central Bank in response to calls to increase the minimum core-capital level to Rs.10.0 billion by the start of January 1, 2016.
The promoters together have a total stake of 64.99 percent in the bank while the state controlled private sector pension fund, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) held 4.98 percent stake being the third largest shareholder.
However, Finance Minister in the 2017 budget proposed to raise the minimum core capital level of the banking sector up to Rs.20.0 billion, probably from early 2019. The bank also increased its deposits by Rs.3.4 billion to Rs.7.3 billion but the low cost current and savings account (CASA) ratio edged down to 19 percent from 20.6 percent at the beginning of the year.
Meanwhile, the bank, for the 9-months ended September 30, incurred a net loss of Rs.96.2 million or 15 cents a share. However this is lesser than the Rs.238.9 million or 52 cents a share loss incurred during the same period
last year.
The NII for the period rose by 141 percent Year-on-Year to Rs.695.7 million and the net fee and commission income rose by 68 percent to
Rs.45.6 million.
Cargills Bank in 2014 bought 73.39 percent stake in the licensed finance company, Capital Alliance Finance PLC in a Rs.400 million deal.
The bank now operates with a branch network of 11 and 323 employees.

Demonetize Rs. 5,000 note- PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today urged the government to follow the example set by the Indian government to destroy the black market by demonetizing the Rs. 5,000 note.

Speaking to the media, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammampila said demonetization would reveal the identities of those who have black money in the country. We can see if it is with the Rajapakses or the Central Bank thieves, he said. 
He said the government had appointed a committee to find stolen state assets. However, despite spending large amounts of public funds travelling the world the government has not been able to find even a rupee of the funds that were stolen.
Sri Lanka had demonetized the Rs. 100 note in 1973, when Prof. N. M Perera was the Finance Minister. This brought in a lot of funds to the reserves, the MP said.

Janashakthi September quarter net profit up 13% despite higher claims
	
Sri Lankas third largest general insurer by gross written premium (GWP), Janashakthi Insurance PLC, (Janashakthi) saw its group net profit for the quarter ended September 30 (3Q16) rising by 12.8 percent from a year ago to Rs.159.2 million despite higher claims, the interim results showed.
The earnings per share for the quarter was 29 cents against 39 cents a year ago. 
During the quarter, the life business GWP grew by 26 percent to Rs.762. 2 million from a year ago, while the non-life GWP rose by 37 percent to Rs.2.56 billion.
The total GWP rose by 34 percent to Rs.3.32 billion from
a year.
Further, the investment income grew by 29 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.465. 6 million as the interest rates rose.
Since the acquisition of AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited in a deal worth Rs.3.2 billion in October 2015, Janashakthi became the third largest general insurer with a market share of 17.5 percent based on GWP.
In recent times the Sri Lankas overcrowded insurance industry saw some form of consolidation, particularly by way of disposing of less profitable general insurance businesses post segregation of the businesses to life and non-life in early 2015. During the last two years, Union Assurance PLC and Asian Alliance Insurance shed their general insurance businesses to fully concentrate on their
life businesses.
Meanwhile, for the quarter under review Janashakthi paid claims and benefits amounted to Rs.1.73 billion, which is an increase of 30 percent.
During the nine months to September, the claims and benefits amounted to Rs.4.95 billion, an increase of 37 percent which resulted from flood
related claims.
Achieving significant financial growth despite the spike in claims expenditure, resulting from the recent floods, further reaffirms our strong fundamentals and prudent reinsurance structure, said Janashakthi Managing Director, Prakash Schaffter in a statement.
For the nine months ended September 30, the company made a net profit of Rs.789.3 million or Rs.1.45 a share, up 124 percent from the same period.
The GWP rose by 34 percent YoY to Rs.9.83 billion out of which non-life business recorded 40 percent growth in GWP at Rs.7.7 billion, while the life segment grew by 16 percent with GWP of Rs.2.1 billion.
The investment income during the period was up by 32 percent YoY to Rs.1.39 billion.
As of September 30, 2016 Schaffter family holding company, Janashakthi PLC held 75.92 percent stake in the company while another family-controlled company, Dunamis Capital PLC, held 3.17 percent stake being the second largest shareholders.
Bank of Ceylon held 2.03 percent stake being the third largest shareholder.

It does not matter which party rules the country. Be it the SLFP, UNP, JVP or any other party, but democracy should be compulsorily included. This countrys development and its whole future are in the hands of the democracy. Therefore we cannot afford to lose it, he added. (Bimal Shaman Jayasinghe)
