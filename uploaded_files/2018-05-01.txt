A lighthouse that illuminated the  path of Dhamma (contd)
	
Interview with German-born scholar monk Bhikkhu Analayo
While in yesterday?s interview the most Venerable Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva shared memories of his monastic life with the late Most Venerable Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde ?a<U+1E47>ananda Mahathera, today we present the interview of another disciple of the Mahathera, Venerable Analayo, a German-born bhikkhu.
The Venerable Analayo was ordained in Sri Lanka 23 years ago (1995) under the late Ven. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Mahathera. He completed a PhD thesis on the Satipa<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>hana-sutta at the University of Peradeniya (published by Windhorse in the UK) and a Habilitation research at the University of Marburg, Germany in which he compared the Majjhima-nikaya Discourses (Suttas) with their Chinese, Sanskrit and Tibetan counterparts.? ?
?
?At present, Bhikkhu Analayo is a professor at the University of Hamburg, the co-director of the Agama Research Group at the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts (Taiwan), and a core faculty member of the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies (Mass., USA). The venerable spends five days a week on solitary retreat, and dedicates the weekend to translations, research work and teaching. He has been instrumental in bringing the late Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde ?a<U+1E47>ananda Mahathera?s teachings to a larger audience, notably in English-speaking academia and the Western Dhamma scene.? ?
Excerpts:? ?
QCould you recount how you came to know about Ven. Katukurunde ?anananda and then went on to meet him?
As I remember it, the first time we met he had come to the Lewella Meditation Centre ? a small meditation centre at the outskirts of Kandy that I was in charge of. He had been brought there by Mr. Mapa, his chief disciple- and at that time the Public Trustee of Sri Lanka, later the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Myanmar. Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde ?a<U+1E47>ananda was on a casual visit to the place and doing a little sightseeing. So I think that was the first time we met in person, although I had of course already heard about him and knew about his ?Concept and Reality?.? ?
I believe, not too long after that, he had made an English translation of the first of his famous Nibbana Sermons given originally in Sinhala at Meetirigala Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya. He had done that just on a cassette tape and given it to, I think, Mr. Mapa. Mr. Mapa had then passed it on to Godwin Samararatne, or may be Ven. ?a<U+1E47>ananda gave it directly to Godwin, I don?t know. But through Godwin from Nilambe Meditation Center, who was my kalya<U+1E47>amitta, I came to hear this English translation of the first of these thirty-three Nibbana Sermons. I was electrified. I had never come across such clear and profound teachings and expositions on the PaliSuttas. It might have been on the same day, or immediately afterwards, I went there right away. He was staying in Kegalle, living in a cave. I said ?Bhante, you just keep translating, I do all the rest. I will type it out and do whatever needs to be done?.? ?
And so from then on, for the next, I believe, ten years, the venerable would in his cave translate his own Sermons from Sinhala into English and record them on a cassette tape. I would then get this cassette tape, sit there at the Lewella Meditation Center and transcribe them. I would also find all the references ? because I had a computer, and at that time the Pali Canon had been already digitalized. So it was fairly easy to type in the Pali text and search. His Pali pronunciation was very clear, and I could find all the references and then provide all the annotation required to direct the reader to the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali passages Ven. ?a<U+1E47>ananda was quoting in the Sermons. And so in relation to this transcribing and annotation work I would go to visit him, may be every two to three months, taking the occasion to ask all the thousand and one questions that I might have had in relation to the sermons or other parts of the PaliSuttas. He was always very obliging to discuss and explain things to me. Together with Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde ?a<U+1E47>ananda has been my second main teacher; I consider these two bhikkhus to have laid the foundation to all my work.
?
?
Q What would you say is the single most important point of Dhamma that was clarified or transmitted to you by the Maha Thera?
I think the single most important point ? which is a little bit difficult to identify because I have learned so much from him ? is his relentless emphasis on Nibbana. He clarifies in what way all the different teachings eventually point to one thing, the total liberation from all defilements and destruction of craving which is Nibbana.? ?
Q How has the encounter with the Mahathera inspired your life and practice as a scholarly and meditating monk?
I think I have answered that question a little bit already. Bhikkhu Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde ?a<U+1E47>ananda and Bhikkhu Bodhi, together, have been the two most important influences in my life as a monastic and in particular in understanding the PaliSuttas. Ven. ?a<U+1E47>ananda has also deeply inspired my meditation practice. Not so much in the sense of actual meditation instructions ? the practice that was being followed there at Kegalle by him and the disciples who were living there with him, was not the practice I was following at that time ? but, much rather, in terms of taking the Discourses seriously, taking seriously what they have to offer, looking at them in their own right and through the lens of later tradition.? ?
With all due respect to the Commentaries and later scholastic works, which have no doubt made very important contributions to our understanding and practice, and certainly are closer to the time and world of the original delivery of the Discourses than we are, it is refreshing to be able to set them aside for the time being in order to create space and look at the Discourses in their own right. What do the Pali Discourses have to say on central meditation practices? What do they have to offer us for understanding the deep aspects of the Dhamma? I think this is probably the most important impact the venerable had on me. Certainly neither the venerable nor I would advocate a sort of Sutta or Early Buddhism fundamentalism wherein the Theravada tradition is rejected; it is more a matter of treading a middle path between complete reliance on textual orthodoxy and complete reliance on personal opinions and the potential arrogance of subjectivity.? ?
But I have to also say that the transcribing of the Nibbana Sermons ? you know, when you transcribe you listen again and again ? has been in a way a guided meditation of some sort for me. I listened and relistened to these sermons, and caught finer points on certain aspects that he pointed out. Because of his own relentless emphasis on Nibbana, this always in some way or the other influences my own practice.? ?
Q You have recently started an e-learning programme on the Nibbana Sermons at the University of Hamburg ? one of the most prestigious institutions for the study of Buddhism in the West ? in collaboration with the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies ?which is in turn the oldest centre for insight practice in the United States. How do you present the Sermons? What kind of students are participating in the course?
The main purpose of presenting the Nibbana Sermons at these two very well-known and influential places, the Numata Center for Buddhist Studies of the University of Hamburg in Germany and the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies in Massachusetts in the USA, was primarily to draw more attention to them.? ?
So I thought doing an online course which would draw more attention to them, and the advantage is that as a university online course there is no charge, it?s all free, and so it preserves the venerable?s spirit of not wanting any kind of selling or buying to be associated with his teachings, but at the same time it makes them stand out much more prominently than free-distributed publications that are not always readily available outside certain circles. And it makes them more noticeable internationally by people who have earlier maybe not even heard of him, let alone of his sermons. We did this in three years. We did Sermons numbering 1 to 11 last year and just now we are doing from 12 to 22, and then the rest, the final eleven, will be done next year.? ?
We go through the Sermons and I sometimes provide additional comments on them, in particular from my own area of expertise, which is the comparative study of the Early Buddhist Discourses. In addition to the Pali Discourses we also have the final products of the same type of oral transmission preserved in other languages, such as Chinese, Sanskrit and Tibetan. This is my own area of study and research, particularly comparing the PaliSuttas with their parallels in the Chinese Agamas (the counterparts to the PaliNikayas), which can often help us to identify some passages that might have suffered from transmission errors in one way or the other during the course of the textual transmission, or to clarify knotty passages. I usually point out what the perspective is based on such parallels.? ?
The students who are participating in the course are foremost, of course, those at the University of Hamburg or enrolled in similar Buddhist Studies programs in other universities worldwide. But there are also quite a number of meditators and Dhamma-practitioners who have heard of these online classes. Last year we had over 600 students enrolled in the course ? not all of them of course coming to the virtual classroom to listen to every single lecture, but there is a very lively online dialogue in the discussion forum. And at this forum there is an exchange between participants focusing on both doctrinal and practice-oriented, contemplative topics related to each sermon. Usually at the beginning of each lecture I take up a few of those comments. At the end of the course, the lectures are freely available online, so that anybody who has not been able to enroll in the course could still follow the presentation at whatever time the individual finds suitable.? ?
I believe that this attempt to give more emphasis and wider publicity to the Nibbana Sermons has been very successful and I really hope that these powerful teachings by Ven. ?a<U+1E47>ananda would continue to inspire other practitioners and students of Buddha Dhamma in the world.?

Allegations against Judiciary:  Sugandika given two weeks to submit evidence
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) today said that it had given two weeks to Attorney-at-Law Sugandhika Fernando to produce the evidence to prove her allegations against the Judiciary.
BASL Chairman U. R. de Silva PC said BASL?s attention was directed to a statement made by Ms. Fernando last month, where she referred to the injustice caused by some officials of the Judiciary and the Police.
He said, though she had made such a remark, she had not complained to the BASL about such incidents.
Mr. de Silva said the BASL had written to Ms Fernando on April 26, informing her it would take necessary legal action against the wrongdoers irrespective of their positions, if Ms. Fernando could provide evidence to support her claims.
?We do not say that any of the officers are perfect. But criticizing everyone at random can lead to a collapse in the jurisdiction and the rule of law,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Appointing Appeal Court Judges -- High Court judges to complain to President
	
The High Court Judges Association which convened a Extra Annual General Meeting on Saturday has decided to inform President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe about injustice caused to career judges when appointing Appeal Court judges.
The Association is to request for an appointment to meet the President this week to discuss their grievances.
The Association which convened an Extra AGM at the Colombo High Court on Saturday unanimously decided to express their concerns on the injustices caused to the senior High Court judges by appointing Appeal Court judges from outside. The High Court judges are also hoping to complain to the Constitutional Council on this matter.
Recently, the Chief Justice recommended the names of three High Court judges to two vacancies at the Appeal Court.
The normal procedure with regard to appointing Appeal Court judges is that the Chief Justice recommends from among the senior most senior HC judges. But this procedure had been changed. At the recent appointment of an Appeal Court judge, the CJ had nominated three High court judges for the posts of two Appeal Court judges. However only one name had been accepted by the Constitutional Council and disregarded the other two names and selected an officer from outside the judiciary.
The High Court judges have said there are four career judges in the Court of Appeal and two career judges in the Supreme Court and that if this trend continues the system will collapse. The High Court judges have also said the Constitutional Council is continuing to appoint Appeal Court judges from the Official Bar without considering the career judges.
The Association had earlier met the President and some members of the Constitutional Council to discuss this matter but as their grievances were not considered the High Court judges are going to meet the President and the other members of the CC once again.
?Before taking any action on this matter we want to meet the President and the members of the CC once again,? a High Court judge said.(Susitha R. Fernando)

At this rate any buffalo can steer the Govt: GL
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today that at this rate any buffalo can steer the government when considering what is happening today.
Party Chairman G.L. Peiris said Minister Lakshman Kiriella had once said that any buffalo can fight the war.
?However, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa defeated the ruthless LTTE and showed the world what no one else could do. Today, we say that any buffalo can steer the government in this manner. No action is being taken by the government to revive the economy and the cost of living is sky-rocketing,? he said.
Prof. Peiris criticized the decision taken to increase the price of a cylinder of LG gas and said there was no justifiable reason to do this on the basis that gas prices in the international market had dropped drastically.
He said depreciation of the rupee would have adverse effects on the economy as the value of the rupee had declined by 21% in the last three years.
?The value of the rupee against the US dollar is on the verge of exceeding Rs.160. People find it difficult to exist and to meet their daily expenses, but the government continues to impose taxes. Sri Lanka's national debt is increasing at the rate of Rs.3,000 a day. However, there seems to be no mechanism to address these issues,? Prof. Peiris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Britain?s Home Secretary quits takes responsibility for misleading MPs
	
?
British Home Secretary Amber Rudd, finally bowed to massive pressure last night and quit saying she had to ?take responsibility? for misleading parliament over deportation targets for illegal migrants.? ?
With no sign of the scandal blowing over, the Home Secretary decided to fall on her sword rather than facing more humiliation.? ?
?I feel it is necessary to do so because I inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee,? she said - admitting she ?should have been aware? the targets existed.? ?
The dramatic departure will be a huge blow for Theresa May - and potentially leaves her personally vulnerable. Ms Rudd has acted as an lightning rod for her predecessor in the Home Office amid the outcry over the Windrush immigration debacle.? ?
It appears that Ms Rudd took the decision to quit herself, despite Downing Street previously trying to prop her up. She telephoned the PM to inform her of the move late on Sunday.? In her response to Ms Rudd, Mrs May said she was ?very sorry? to receive the resignation. The premier said she still believed Ms Rudd had answered questions from MPs in ?good faith?.? ?
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: ?I see Amber Rudd is carrying the can for the person originally responsible for this scandal - Theresa May.?? The timing of the resignation took Westminster by surprise. There was intense speculation that Ms Rudd might go on Friday night after the emergence of a leaked Home Office memo that had been copied to the minister.? ?

?Enemy rockets? hit Syrian bases
	
?
DAILY MAIL, 30th APRIL, 2018- The Syrian government said its territory has been hit by ?enemy rockets? during ?new aggression? last night.??
The country?s army said rockets had struck several military bases in the Hama and Aleppo countryside, according to state television.
In a news flash, state television said the missile attacks took place at 10.30pm.
?Syria is being exposed to a new aggression with some military bases in rural Hama and Aleppo hit with enemy rockets,? an army source was quoted as saying without elaborating.
Earlier, state television said successive blasts were heard in rural Hama province and that authorities were investigating the cause.
The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) recorded a 2.60-magnitude earthquake in the area after the huge blast.
An opposition source said one of the locations hit was an army base known as Brigade 47 near Hama city, widely known as a recruitment centre for Iranian-backed Shi?ite militias who fight alongside President Bashar al-Assad?s forces. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria through activists on the ground, reported loud explosions in the Hama countryside and Aleppo province resulting from missiles targeting a base of the 47th Brigade in Hama that houses Syrian government and allied Iranian forces.?
It also reported missiles hitting positions near the Nairab air base and Aleppo airport. It said the source of the missiles was not immediately known, and had no information on casualties.?

FCA condemns attack on journalists in Afghanistan
	
The Foreign Correspondents? Association (FCA) of Sri Lanka strongly condemned the twin attacks in Afghanistan where 10 journalists were killed and urged the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest.
The FCA said they were deeply shocked by the killing of the journalist colleagues in the attacks.
?The FCA strongly condemns these cowardly attacks and urges the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest,? it said in a statement.
?The FCA conveys its deepest sympathies to the families of BBC journalist Ahmad Shah, 29, and AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, 41, and the families of the other journalists who were killed on Monday. The BBC?s Shah was killed in the eastern Afghan province of Khost hours after the other nine journalists, including AFP?s Marai, fell victim to a suicide bomber who had disguised himself as a press photographer. The attacker targeted journalists who had rushed to report on the first suicide bombing in Kabul. We also wish a speedy recovery to those injured in the senseless violence,? the statement added.
The FCA said it was aware of the serious challenges faced by reporters and photographers in Afghanistan who were working under some of the most dangerous conditions in the world.
? In Sri Lanka, dozens of journalists and media workers were killed during its decades-long separatist war which ended in May 2009. We wish to express our support to all our colleagues in Afghanistan at this very difficult time and wish them the courage to carry out their duties without succumbing to terror tactics of the perpetrators,? it said.

Govt: Stop squabbling, get down to business
	
Another Cabinet reshuffle is scheduled for today reportedly after intense discussion between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is going to be the third change in the Cabinet this year and there is no assurance that it would be the last for the year, as there are reports that the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have been wrangling over the UNP?s attempt to absorb Ravi Karunanayake into the Cabinet.? ?
According to the lead story of Daily Mirror yesterday, UNP leaders want Karunanayake, who resigned as Foreign Affairs Minister on August 10 last year after the exposure of his links with Central Bank bond scam suspect Arjun Aloysius. Mr. Aloysius was implicated in the Central Bank bond scam which was investigated by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. President Maithripala Sirisena is said to be firm on rejecting these overtures by the UNP.? ?
Meanwhile, the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP, which make up the government are also struggling with their internal problems compelling the leaders of the two parties to dedicate most of their time to sort out those issues. The UNP is now fresh from a party reorganization process where a number of top posts except for the post of Party Leader have been changed. However, it is not clear whether there is a change in the decision-making powers of the office bearers.? ?
Nevertheless, it is also not clear whether the changing of office bearers would bring the internal wrangling of the party to an end, as there are signs of several prominent party members such as Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake being disappointed. They want a change in the leadership of the party which seems to be a remote possibility given the composition of the party?s decision-making bodies, such as the Working Committee. Besides, under the UNP?s constitution, the party has to go through a difficult process to bring about any major changes.? ?
The SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena also seems to be struggling to survive after the recent resignation by 16 SLFP ministers, deputy and state ministers from their ministerial posts and Thilanga Sumathipala from the post of deputy speaker. They have said they will sit in the Opposition while being the members of the SLFP though their penchant to team up with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa is very clear after the recent local government elections. However, the SLFP group which is still with the President seems to be attempting to pull them back into the government?s fold, by offering ministerial posts. If at least one or two of them are agreeable to it, the government will again be compelled to reshuffle the Cabinet.? ?
The bickering within the government and within the two main parties in the ruling coalition has cost a lot to the country as well as to the people. For the past five months since last December the government, political parties, the media and the people have been preoccupied with this political conundrum without concentrating on development or other meaningful topics.? ?
Even before that, we were obsessed with the startling exposures by the Presidential Commission on the Central Bank bond scam. Then the local government elections were announced towards the end of the last year. The election results brought about a crisis situation in almost all local government bodies. It seems it would last till the end of the tenure of these councils as well as after the next elections, unless the recently amended law is re-amended in the near future. Hard on the heels of the elections, the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saw a string of crises within the government, between the two ruling parties, and within those two parties.? ?
The country does not need governments or political parties to continue with their internal squabbling and it is high time for the leaders of the concerned parties to end the tug-o-war and get down to the serious business of running the country. Certainly the leaders would have to make sacrifices so that Sri Lanka and its people would be the ultimate winners.? ?

This person heading a key establishment in national education had got this high post thanks to a high political connection and he had stooped to all kinds of corrupt practices ever since taking up this appointment.

This worthy serving under a five-year contract is said to have been making money by resorting to corrupt practices in awarding tenders for janitorial and cleaning services at the headquarters and the two establishments coming under his purview.

## Title: Independence of Indian judiciary at stake with Govt. breathing down its neck

Independence of Indian judiciary at stake with Govt. breathing down its neck
	
The framers of the Indian constitution were wedded to the concept of separation of powers and wanted the judiciary to be independent of the executive. But within two decades of independence, the higher Indian judiciary had come under unprecedented pressure to conform to the political diktats of the government, then dominated by the awe-inspiring Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.? ?
Indira wanted the Supreme Court to interpret the law and constitution according to her path breaking leftist and populist ideology. She openly sought a ?committed judiciary? and appointed judges of her political and ideological hue.? ?
However, being a never-say-die democracy, India put paid to such gross forms of interference by the second half of the 1970s. But the spread of democracy and the increasing competitiveness of Indian politics inexorably led to the politicization of institutions which were previously apolitical.? ?
Politicians increasingly felt the need to control more and more institutions, including the judiciary. The latter kept coming under duress from the government from time to time.? ?
Appointment by Judges? Collegium?
The system of appointing judges acquired a political dimension which resulted in candidates pandering to the whims of powerful political lobbies. Since appointments were a delicate matter involving the political interests, there were delays, which, in turn, resulted in the creation of a large number of vacancies in the courts.? ?
The inadequacies of the judicial structure led to corruption which in turn led to an erosion of faith in the judicial system.? ?
To protect the independence of the judiciary from political forces and the Executive, the Supreme Court, in 1993, directed that judges be chosen by a ?collegium? of judges of the High Courts (in the first instance), and then a collegium of judges of the Supreme Court in the final stage. The government was required to accept the recommendations and make the appointments.? ?
The collegiate system appeared to work well until a High Court judge, C.S.Karnan, charged members of the collegium of secrecy, corruption, and caste biases. An intemperate person, Karnan brazenly sentenced to imprisonment all the five members of a Supreme Court bench.? ?
To protect itself from such challenges, the Supreme Court?s justices banded together to sentence Karnan to six months jail in 2017. But many wondered if it was right to wholly condemn Karnan because there was a felt need to have a mechanism to control the goings on the judiciary which were not always wholesome. Left out of appointments since 1993, the government and the major political parties had also started targeting the collegiate system.? ?
NJAC and MOP
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress combined to establish, by law, a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) to control appointments. Threatened, the Supreme Court promptly annulled the NJAC saying it violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers.? ?
After the National Judicial Appointments Commission was rejected in 2015, the BJP government proposed the adoption of a Memorandum of Procedure (MOP) to appoint judges.? ?
But there was a snag there. The MOP had a clause saying that the government could reject a candidate on grounds of ?national security?. It further said that it would inform only the Chief Justice of the exact nature of the national security threat.? ?
The collegium rejected such selectivity. Stumped, the government came down a notch and said that it was prepared to negotiate the MOP.? ?
Delaying Tactics
The government also began to use its power to delay acceptance of the collegium?s recommendations and to send back recommendations for reconsideration.? ?
The most recent example of the exercise of such power is the way the BJP government has treated the collegium?s recommendation to appoint K.M.Joseph (Chief Justice of the Uttarakhand High Court) as a Supreme Court judge.? ?
The BJP government did not want to elevate Joseph because in 2016, he had disallowed the sacking of the Congress government and the imposition of President?s Rule in Uttarakhand.? ?
Peeved by this snub, the BJP government sat over the collegium?s recommendation to appoint Justice Joseph for months. It then sent it back for reconsideration.? ?
As grounds for reconsideration, it said that Joseph is not senior enough; that his State of Kerala is over represented; and that there is no representation of Dalits or depressed castes in the bench.? ?
Bench and Collegium Divided
But can the Supreme Court and the collegium pick up the gauntlet and resist the government?? ?
The current Supreme Court bench and the collegium are divided houses. Four senior judges are ranged against Chief Justice Dipak Misra on various grounds. Senior Justices J. Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph had only recently publicly challenged Misra?s arbitrary style of functioning and accused him of being a hand maiden of the government. But Misra has argued that he has the power to do what he has been doing.? ?
Given the disunity it is feared that the collegium may not be in a position to over-ride the government, even though the government will have to go by its recommendation if it reiterates the recommendation.? ?
Predictably, Chief Justice Misra held that the government is entitled to seek reconsideration of a recommendation by the collegium. Misra has also made it clear that he will not opt for a ?judicial response? to the government?s move, because, in his view, the issue is not ?judicial? but ?administrative?.? ?
?
He brushed aside Justice Chelameswar?s contention that the government?s sitting over the collegium?s recommendations has become the new norm, and acting on its proposals is an exception.? ?
The four disgruntled judges had urged Chief Justice Misra to hold a full court meeting on the issue. But Misra did not act until the government sent a letter urging the collegium to reconsider its recommendation relating to Justice K.M.Joseph. The collegium will now meet on Wednesday.? ?
Demand to Resist Interference
The media and the legal fraternity have warned that failure to resist the government in the case of Justice Joseph will only encourage it to keep ignoring the collegium?s recommendations. It may ignore Justice Ranjan Gogoi?s claim to be Chief Justice when Misra retires in October.? ?
Former judges, lawyers and the media have condemned the government?s move and appealed to the Supreme Court to sink its internal differences and assert its independence from the executive.? ?
?The government?s action strikes at the very heart of the independence of the judiciary?, said former Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha.? ?
Former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court A. P. Shah said: ?Bit by bit, the primacy of the collegium is being conceded.?? ?
Capitulation Feared
But given the alleged closeness of Chief Justice Misra to the government, the legal fraternity and the media wonder if the Supreme Court under his tutelage would resist the government.? ?
When the opposition Congress party recently submitted a Motion of Impeachment against Misra in the Upper House of Parliament listing several grave charges against him, the Chairman Venkaiah Naidu of the BJP refused to admit the motion.? Again, only recently, Justice Misra had dismissed a Public Interest Petition seeking re-investigation of the death of Judge B.H.Loya who was handling a murder case which allegedly involved the ruling BJP?s President, Amit Shah.? ?

Lester?s  reel comes  to an end

It is with great sorrow that I write about the death of Sri Lanka?s greatest film director Lester James Peries!? ?
The doyen of Sinhala cinema who celebrated his 99th birthday on April 5th passed away at a private hospital in Colombo on Sunday April 29th.
? ?
The nonagenarian filmmaker had been ailing for several weeks since celebrating his 99th birthday. Though the news of his ailment was known to a few it was kept under wraps on the advice of the doctors who felt he should not have visitors, given his condition. Lester?s wife of 54 years, Sumitra Gunewardene Peries- a renowned filmmaker in her own right- attended to him till the very end? ?Their last collaborative venture ?Vaishnavee?- a film directed by Sumitra on a story written by Lester- was released on April 5th to denote Lester?s birthday.? ?
Those of us who were aware of Lester?s health condition were hoping against hope that the pioneering filmmaker would survive the current ordeal and celebrate his 100th birthday next year? ?Destiny however ruled otherwise.? ?
Funeral arrangements are to be notified later.? ?
My heartfelt condolences to his soulmate and partner Sumitra who herself is an octogenarian? ?
Some years ago in an article about Lester James Peries I wrote thus ? ? If I were to pose the question ?Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the best Lankan filmmaker of them all?? to my personal magic mirror, the answer would be in three words ? Lester James Peries!? ?
Though Sri Lanka has produced many brilliant film directors over the years ? and I do enjoy their movies ? I have always been of the firm opinion that the greatest director of Sinhala cinema is Lester James Peries. There was a time when my friends used to have fun at my expense by belittling Lester?s films as second-rate mediocre stuff. I would retort angrily and they would laugh gleefully.? ?
I have written many articles about Lester and his films and will continue to do so. This article however is a tribute to a man who is to me the greatest pioneering director of Sinhala cinema.? ?
In a film making career spanning more than five decades Lester had made 20 feature films inclusive of ?Pinhamy? in 1980.? ?
The first of his feature films was the path-breaking ?Rekava? or line of destiny in 1956. His final feature was ?Amma Waruney? or an elegy to a mother released in 2006. Lester has also made 11 short films, most of them in documentary mode. The first of these short films was ?Soliloquy? made in 1949 and the last ?Kandy Perahera? filmed in 1973.? ?

Pioneer Of Authentic Sinhala Cinema
The greatness of Lester however cannot be measured by the quantity of his output. It is the qualitative nature of his films that elevated him to commendable heights. Lester is acknowledged as the pioneer of authentic Sinhala cinema. It was he who created in every sense of the term an indigenous cinema in both substance and style. It was also Lester who first gained worldwide recognition for Sinhala cinema. Lester became a national icon identified with the sphere of Sri Lankan cinema over the years.?Rekava? (Line of Destiny), ?Gamperaliya? (Changes in the Village) and ?Nidhanaya? (Treasure) are widely accepted as the three finest films made by Lester. In 1997- the golden jubilee year of Sinhala cinema- the Government of Sri Lankan (GoSL) identified ten films as among the best made in the 50 year history of Sinhala cinema. Lester?s Rekava, Gamperaliya and Nidhanaya were included in that list.? ?
Lester was born on April 5, 1919 in Dehiwela to Catholic parents from an affluent Westernised background. His father Dr. James Francis Peries had studied medicine in Scotland. His mother Ann Gertrude Winifred Jayasuriya was the first student to pass the Cambridge senior exam at St. Bridgette?s Convent. Lester had three siblings, Erica, Ivan and Noel.? ?
Lester had his schooling at St. Peters College. His parents wanted him to become a lawyer or a doctor while his teachers wanted him to be a Catholic priest. Lester however wanted to study literature and began writing stories, poems and plays from his student days. He was also an incurable film buff. Lester dropped out of school at the age of seventeen and became a journalist. He worked at ?Daily News? and later at ?Times of Ceylon?. Lester also reviewed books for ?Radio Ceylon?. It was then that he began dabbling in drama by joining a theatre group called the ?Drama Circle?. It is said that the legendary Lionel Wendt realised Lester?s creative potential and advised his parents to allow him to do whatever he wished.? ?
Lester went to London in 1947 to join his brother Ivan a reputed painter. The brothers lived together for some years and apparently led a Bohemian way of life bordering on the avant garde. Lester wrote a column from Britain for the ?Times of Ceylon? in Colombo, then edited by Frank Moraes. It was titled ?Letters on the Arts from England?. While working as a correspondent of ?Times of Ceylon?, Peries also engaged himself in making short films and documentaries. A short film, ?Soliloquy? made in 1949 won an award for artistic and technical merit from the Institute of Amateur and Research Filmmakers of Great Britain in 1951. He also produced another award winner ?Farewell to Childhood?. It was based on a short story he had written when in Sri Lanka, but on film he adapted it to English surroundings.? ?
It was the eminent film maker Ralph Keene who was instrumental in persuading Lester to return home. ?You should make films in your own country, about your own people,? Ralph told him. Returning to Ceylon in 1954 Lester joined the Government Film Unit (GFU) and began churning out documentaries on several subjects including malaria and vehicular traffic. In the process he was exposed to new experiences of life. He discovered his roots and became appreciative of the island?s cultural heritage, something which his upper middle class anglicised existence had restricted earlier.? ?
Associated with him at the GFU were cameraman Willie Blake and editor Titus Thotawatte. Yearning to create meaningful films the trio resigned from the GFU and embarked on the ?Rekawa? venture.
?
?
The greatness of Lester however cannot be measured by the quantity of his output. It is the qualitative nature of his films that elevated him to commendable heights. Lester is acknowledged as the pioneer of authentic Sinhala cinema
?
?The trio broke up later, with Blake migrating to Canada and Thotawatte becoming a film director in his own right. Thereafter Peries worked with a number of different artistes and technical personnel in different pictures without being tied down to a particular team for long.? ?
The first Sinhala movie was ?Kadawunu Poronduwa? (Broken Promise). Made in India, it was released in 1947. Most Sinhala films during the first decade were heavily influenced by Hindi and Tamil masala movies. It was said that the only things Sinhala about them were the actors, dialogue and the words in the songs. The pioneering departure from this trend was by Lester in 1956 when his maiden feature film ?Rekava? (Line of Destiny) was released. Shot entirely in Sri Lankan outdoor locations, the path-breaking film altered the destiny of Sinhala films. It was hailed as a turning point in the decade-long evolving history of Sinhala cinema.? ?
Satyajit Ray?s Closest Relative East Of Suez
Analogies have often been drawn between the South Asian contemporaries Satyajit Ray of India and Lester of Sri Lanka. India?s greatest film maker Ray had burst upon the global film scene before Lester. Ray?s ?Pather Panchali? was made in 1955 and ?Aparajito? in 1956. Since Lester?s Rekava was released in December 1956 many reviewers wrongly assumed that Ray had inspired Peries. Ray himself considered Lester to be of the same mould as him and once referred to the Sri Lankan director as his ?closest relative East of the Suez.? In spite of the creative affinity between the two, Peries was not influenced by Ray when he made his first film.? ?
Renowned writer and scholar, Regi Siriwardena once told me in an interview that Lester had not seen ?Pathar Panchali? or ?Aparajito? when he first made ?Rekava?. Regi, who has worked as scriptwriter with Peries on some films, told this writer that the first Ray film viewed by Lester was ?Aparajito? and that too was only after ?Rekava? was made. ?It is a classic instance of two great Asian directors being of the same creative wavelength and proceeding on a parallel course independent of each other,? stated Siriwardena then.? ?
?
If we adopt the Auteur theory to review the body of work of Lester, what stands out is his humanism. Humanism has been defined as ?Any system, mode of thought or action in which human interest, values and dignity predominates
What then inspired Lester to quit the Government Film Unit along with colleagues Willie Blake (cinematographer) and Titus Thotawatte (Editor) and embark upon the venture to make an authentic and realistic Sinhala film?? ?
Three film factors deeply influenced and motivated Lester in this yearning to make a realistic film amidst a rural setting. Firstly there was the semi-fictional documentary ?Nelungama? made by Lester?s boss at the GFU Ralph Keene. Lester had co-written the script and the dialogues for it. While filming, Lester was exposed to village life and longed to make a film in a rural environment. Secondly was the impact of Italian neo-realistic cinema, particularly the films of Vittorio de Sica, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini. Thirdly was the film ?Do Bigha Zameen? (Two acres of land) by Indian Director Bimal Roy that brought rural life to the screen in a realistic manner.? ?
Lester?s early training as a documentary filmmaker as well as his penchant for creative literature were reflected in his films. According to Regi Siriwardena, the twin hallmarks of Lester?s auteuristic film making approach were his stylistic ?construction of narrative? and ability to ?capture and project actualities in a realistic manner.?? ?
Underlying humanism?
Lester?s films capture emotions and moods vividly. These expressions are two-fold in the sense that they consist of clearly articulated or manifested emotions on the one hand and also of unarticulated, underlying feelings on the other. Complex relationships, poignant moods, tense undercurrents, etc. are portrayed in auteuristic style that is simple and comprehensible. What is outstanding in his films is the underlying humanism.? ?
Dr. Sarath Amunugama focused on the Auteur theory and on Lester?s humanism when he delivered the Lester James Peries Oration in 2012. Here is a relevant excerpt:? ?
?If we adopt the Auteur theory to review the body of work of Lester, what stands out is his humanism. Humanism has been defined as ?Any system, mode of thought or action in which human interest, values and dignity predominates?. While similar ideologies have prevailed in many regional traditions, we are here concerned mostly about humanism as it developed in western society after the Renaissance and became a strong influence on Lester. While he progressively delved into Sinhala Society and culture he was also a cosmopolitan intellectual. A similar claim can be made about Ray. Philip French calls Ray ?a great film maker rooted in his complex Bengali culture and at the same time a detached cosmopolitan intellectual.?? ?
Though a citizen of the world with a cosmopolitan background, Lester succeeded greatly in portraying the existential realities and nuances of rural Sri Lanka and its ontological veneer. Lester excelled in transforming on celluloid popular novels and short stories. He also experimented with psychological topics that had not been dealt with before on the Sinhala screen. The nature of his films has been described as the ?cinema of contemplation? and his narration the ?language of silence? by film writer connoisseurs.? ?
Lester?s films do not have a very overt political content. The political message if any is quite subtle. As Lester himself explained it, ?I cannot make intensely political films. Politics is there on the periphery, in films like Yuganthaya, where there is reference to the tension between labour and capital. All my themes are about the Sri Lankan family. I use the family as a microcosm through which the problems of a larger world are reflected upon. I understand my limitations and work within this. To me the battles within the family are more important and far more intense than anything outside of it.?? ?
Though he filmed several novels, Lester was able to break away from the bondages imposed by strictures of literature and the stage. Economy of dialogue was a hallmark in most of his films. His narrative style blended cinematic images into the story with telling effect. There are long gaps of silence between dialogue. It is said that Lester had a shooting script, but deviated from it as the film was being shot. He improvised with innovative spontaneity as shooting proceeded.? ?

??Gamperaliya? (Village Upheaval) Won Gold In India and Mexico? ?
After ?Rekawa? in 1956 , Peries made ?Sandesaya? (Message) in 1960, a historic drama set against the Portuguese conquest of the Island. Then came ?Gamperaliya? (Village Upheaval) in 1964 that made its mark in the Third International film festival in New Delhi by winning the Golden Peacock award. This was the first time a Sinhala film had won an international award. Gamperaliya also won the Golden head of Palenque award in Mexico. Lester had placed Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, on the Global Cinema Map.? ?
?Gamperaliya? was the first of a trilogy based on novels by the late Martin Wickremasinghe, a Sinhala literary colossus. The others were ?Kaliyugaya? (Era of Kali or Kaliyug) and ?Yuganthaya? (End of an era). The three films made after long intervals of time depicted on celluloid the collapse of the old order and the emergence of the new. Together they comprise an epic of transition portraying vividly on screen the struggle between a dying world and another struggling to be born.? ?
?Gamperaliya? was produced by Anton Wickremasinghe with Lester and Sumitra as co-producers.While Lester directed, Sumitra edited the film. Lester and Sumitra married in 1964. Their?s was a praiseworthy professional and personal partnership. Sumitra edited many of Lester?s films in the early years. Later Sumitra ventured into film directing herself and made her mark as one of Sri Lanka?s finest directors in her own right. Lester collaborated with her on some films as producer and writer. Sumitra?s latest film ?Vaishnavee? is based on a story written by Lester some 25 years ago. Sumithra blossomed into a successful film director who could portray feminine, but not necessarily feminist, issues sensitively on screen. She also served as Ambassador to France where her husband received the French Legion D? Honour.? ?
Lester?s greatest movie however was ?Nidhanaya? (Treasure) made in 1970. Based on a novelette by G. B. Senanayake, it won the Royal Lion award at the Venice film festival. It was also included in the global list of 100 best films to be ever made that was compiled by the Cinematic Institute of France to mark the World Film centenary. Nidhanaya also won the award at Sri Lanka?s Golden Jubilee of Independence for being the best Sinhala movie in 50 years. It also won critical acclaim as one of the ten top Asian films of all time.? ?
Though a citizen of the world with a cosmopolitan background, he succeeded greatly in portraying the existential realities and nuances of rural Sri Lanka and its ontological veneer. Some of his milestones include ?Delovak Athara? (Between Two Worlds), ?Golu Hadawatha? (Silent Longing) ?Ran Salu? (Golden Robe), ?Akkara Paha? (Five Acres) ?Ahasin Polowata? (From Sky To Earth) and ?Beddagama? (Village In The Jungle).? ?
The only English film made by Peries was ?God King?, a Sri Lankan-German co-production. With a blend of foreign and local artistes, the film was shot in Sri Lanka. The story revolved around a Sinhala monarch Kassyapa who built the Lion Fortress- palace rendered famous by its frescoes on Mount Sigiriya. The stipulations of a foreign-funded movie restricted Peiris?s creative control and cramped his style severely. The result was quite visible in the finished product which was not one of the director?s best works.? ?
From Rekawa in 1956 to ?Ammawarune? in 2006 the auteur left his celluloid imprint through 20 films in a productive career that topped half a century in years. Rekava? (Line of Destiny), ?Gamperaliya? (Changes in the Village) and ?Nidhanaya? (Treasure) are widely accepted as the three finest films made by Lester. I have seen all three films and they are certainly path-breaking masterpieces of cinema. However the film that I liked (and still like) most among Lester?s creations is ?Golu Hadawatha? (Silence of the Heart).? ?
?Golu Hadawatha??
Evocative of Akiro Kurosawa?s ?Rashomon,? the story of ?Golu Hadawatha? too was told in flashback sequence with the two chief protagonists narrating their version of events. There were two specific reasons which endeared ?Golu Hadawatha? to me. Firstly ?Golu Hadawatha? was the first Lester-directed film that I saw. It was after seeing this film that I saw Lester?s earlier movies on re-runs at provincial or suburban theatres or at benefit shows in Colombo. ?Rekava,? ?Sandesaya,? ?Gamperaliya,? ?Delovak Athara? and ?Ran Salu? were all films I had seen during their re-runs after I had seen ?Golu Hadawatha,? which I saw during its first round of screening. Being the first Lester movie that I saw, ?Silence of the Heart? still has a special place in my heart.? ?
Secondly, the ?Golu Hadawatha? film story was one that I could easily comprehend and understand because the Sinhala screenplay had been translated into English and was serialised in the ?Sunday Observer?. It was published along with still photographs of scenes. This helped me greatly to understand this film and relate to it. I told this once to Regi Siriwardena who had written the screenplay for the film and naturally, he was very pleased. It was my good fortune to be associated with Regi Siriwardena during the years 1985 to 1988 at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES) in Colombo.? ?
?Golu Hadawatha? was adapted from a novel by Karunasena Jayalath. The music was composed by ?Master? Premasiri Khemadasa. The Producer was P.E. Anthonypillai. Interestingly there was a song connected to ?Golu Hadawatha? that was very popular during those days. It was written by Karunasena Jayalath himself and sung by Indrani Wijebandara and Sisira Senaratne. The duet had the lines ?Aadarei mama aadarei ? Dhammi thavamath aadarei, Sugath thavamath aadarei?. But the song was not included in the film.? ?
?Golu Hadawatha? was a romantic story and the fresh-faced couple Anula Karunathilake as Damayanthi Kariyawasam (Dhammi) and Wickrema Bogoda as Sugath Weerasekara (Sugath) made a huge impact. Anula as the vivacious ?Dhammi? stole our hearts then.? ?
The nature of Lester?s films has been described as the ?cinema of contemplation? and his narration the ?language of silence? by connoisseurs. As a pioneer of authentic Sinhala cinema, the trail-blazing Lester has been inspiring two generations of film makers in the country. He has also introduced a number of artistes and technicians who went on to make a name for themselves. He has been on the jury of several international film festivals. Peries has also been conferred honorary doctorates by several institutions.? ?
In the year 2000, Lester was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 31st International Film Festival of India in New Delhi.It was fitting indeed that the doyen of Sri Lankan film directors was honoured so in New Delhi because it was that city which catapulted Peries to International fame in 1964 when his ?Gamperaliya? received the Golden Peacock award for Best Film.? ?
?Lifetime Achievement Award Was Crowning Glory Of Productive Life? ?
In 1997 at a ceremony held to mark the golden jubilee of Sri Lankan cinema, Lester was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award by then President Chandrika Kumaratunga. After the event in an interview given to veteran journalist Roshan Peiris, a visibly-moved Lester said: ?I treasure this award a lot given for my contribution to the local film industry. It is a distinction that does make me feel that my film career has been worthwhile.? The Lifetime Achievement Award in what is probably the crowning glory of a hectic, eventful and productive life.? ?In an interview published decades ago, Lester was asked to comment on his career. Lester?s response reflected his characteristic humility.This is what he said then. ?There is an old French saying that in order to understand life you have to see it backwards.This is how I saw through my work. I have done features in the last 40 years and have been in films for fifty years in all. The most important lesson is that you begin to realise how little you know.?? ?
Consensus is perhaps an elusively unattainable word in the Sri Lankan political lexicon. Mercifully, there are several things about which there is a national consensus cutting across race, religion, caste and creed. One such phenomenon would be in the appreciation of the creative genius of Sri Lanka?s foremost film director as a national treasure and icon.. Lester liberated Sinhala cinema and guided it to new vistas where the medium of film was understood and appreciated.It is widely acknowledged that Lester was indeed the pioneer who went off the beaten track and proved to be an inspiring beacon for those who followed him.? ?
The guiding light of Sri Lankan cinema has gone out, but the glow will continue to brighten the Sri Lankan silver screen.(ENDS)? ?

May appoints new home secretary amid immigration scandal
	
?
DPA, 30th APRIL, 2018- Sajid Javid will be Britain?s new home secretary, replacing Amber Rudd, who resigned late Sunday amid a growing scandal about migrants denied residency and other rights, despite having lived in Britain for more than 50 years.
Javid, 48, whose parents moved to Britain from Pakistan, has spoken of his ?deep concern? for the plights of hundreds of former migrants from the ?Windrush generation? who moved to Britain from Caribbean and other Commonwealth nations in the 1950s and 1960s.
The choice of Javid, the former local government and communities minister, was announced by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday.
Rudd, who had been home secretary since 2016, resigned after admitting she had ?inadvertently misled? parliament about whether she was aware of government targets for the removal of migrants.
But opposition politicians said May, who was home secretary when the tougher immigration rules were introduced in 2012, bears ultimate responsibility for the scandal.

Self-serving politicians causing problems for SL: President
	
Sri Lanka is currently facing various problems because of the personal agendas of politicians, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
He said this at a ceremony to mark the 25th death anniversary of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa at Hulftsdorp last morning.
?Many politicians forget the aspirations of the people and give priority to their personal goals. They give priority to their personal dreams. This is the political culture we have in this country today. I had a good rapport with with President Premadasa though I was an opposition MP during his tenure as the President of this country. He rendered a yeomen service to the poor and the marginalized. He gave priority to the needy instead of his own needs. President Premadasa underwent a lot of suffering which a person who rose up from grassroots level has to undergo. He faced several problems because he was not from the elite and was assassinated in the end. This is the common fate of leaders who emerged from the grassroots have to face,? the President said.
He said it was important to determine why the people in this country decided to change the government on January 8, 2015 and in August the same year. ?It is important that we do not commit the mistakes which we have made before. We have to complete the task which people wanted us to fulfill in 2015,? the President said.(Yohan Perera)

?Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. Some have greatness thrust upon them? Reflections of President Ranasinghe Premadasa
Ranasinghe Premadasa was born on June 23, 1924 in Colombo. He completed his education at St. Joseph?s College, Colombo 10. He was interested in social service for the welfare of the poor and downtrodden. He was the architect of the Sri Sucharitha Movement, an organization with the objectives of uplifting the economic, social and spiritual development of the low income people. These youth who enrolled in his development movement refrained from taking liquor and avoided smoking and gambling. R. Premadasa was a teetotaller.?
He had been the Deputy Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council. He was elected second Member of Parliament at the general election held in 1965 for the same seat and was appointed Chief Government Whip besides being appointed Parliamentary Secretary of Local Government. Later he was raised to the position of Minister of Local Government. In the following general election held in 1970, he was elected first MP for Colombo Central and sat in the Opposition with late J.R. Jayewardene, the then Leader of the Opposition.??
Premadasa was elected first MP for Colombo Central in 1977 and became the Leader of the House and the Minister of Local Government. He was appointed the Deputy Leader of the UNP. When JR Jayewardene became the first Executive President of the country, Minister Premadasa became the Prime Minister on February 23, 1978.??
Part of his political programme was shelter for the poor, after the United Nations declared a Year of Shelter. Other policies included Jana Saviya, the instrument he used to help the poor, a foster parents scheme, the Gam Udawa project, the mobile secretariat whereby he took the central government bureaucracy to the peasants, the Tower Hall Foundation for drama and music, and the pension schemes he initiated for the elder artistes. On the economic front, the garment industry project that he initiated became a forerunner in earning foreign exchange and provision of employment in the villages.??
He was elected second Executive President of the country when late JR Jayewardene stepped down. He led the UNP to victory at the general election held in 1989. He survived the attempted impeachment by some of his party men together with opposition Members of Parliament. He focussed on building the economy, in which exercise too he was successful as seen by the improved position of the country?s economy during his tenure.??
However, Premadasa?s greatest achievements were in the field of housing, poverty alleviation and the upliftment of the down- trodden. He was the architect of many innovative development schemes, such as, the Gam Udawa, Presidential Mobile Service, 200 Garment Factories programmes amongst others.??
Premadasa proposed at the UNO in New York to declare a year as International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. The proposal was unanimously accepted at the 37th session of the United Nations General Assembly and 1987 was declared the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.??
He launched the Gam Udawa scheme all over the country. He was the founder of the Janasaviya, now the Samurdhi scheme.??
During his presidency, Premadasa took action to reduce poverty in the country. He encouraged the building of model villages with clean water, decent roads, schools and health centres. He encouraged the placement of small-scale industries, mostly garment-related, in poor areas by giving factory owners low-interest loans and a share in textile quotas for the United States and Europe.??
Premadasa was well known for the humble life led by him in his simple home, away from his luxurious official residence. He perhaps travelled less than anyother leading Sri Lankan politicians.??
President Premadasa was assassinated on May 1, 1993 at a May Day rally in Colombo. Even after 25 years since his death, he is still remembered for his simplicity and great vision.

There's no alternative to the national Govt: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickermesinghe said today at the ceremony to mark the 25th death anniversary of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa held at Hulftsdorp that there was no alternative to the national government.
He said there were many who criticised it but none of them were able to come up with an alternative form of governance.
"We will implement a speedy development programme in the wake of today's Cabinet reshuffle taking into consideration the message given to us by the people at the local government elections," the Prime Minister said. "We are facing the same challenges as we did during the tenure of President Premadasa. Developing industries and generating employment is time consuming. President Premadasa wanted me to take over the Ministry of Industries. He had a discussion with me on these matters. We provided tax incentives to industrialists. Later he wanted more employment opportunities in rural areas. He came up with the 100 garment factory concept. I asked him how it could be implemented because rural areas do not have infrastructure facilities. But he went ahead with his concept and implemented it within one month. Later he extended it but was unable to complete it because of his assassination."
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said former President Premadasa was deeply committed to bringing about peace and harmony among peoples of all communities.
"He wanted all Sri Lankans to live in an undivided, indivisible nation. President Premadasa felt that the 13th Amendment is not the final solution to the national question. This why the Mangala Moonasinghe committee was appointed," he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said former President Premsdasa did not consider political differences as a barrier when implementing social welfare programmes. (Yohan Perera)

WhatsApp CEO quits over privacy disagreements with Facebook
	
The chief executive and co-founder of WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging app, is leaving the company over disagreements about privacy and encryption.
Jan Koum will also step down from Facebook?s board of directors, a role he negotiated when WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, according to the Washington Post.
?It?s been almost a decade since Brian [Acton] and I started WhatsApp, and it?s been an amazing journey with some of the best people. But it is time for me to move on,? wrote Koum on his Facebook profile.
?I?m taking some time off to do things I enjoy outside of technology, such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee. And I?ll still be cheering WhatsApp on ? just from the outside.?
Koum and his co-founder Brian Acton developed WhatsApp with a focus on user privacy and a disdain for advertising. When it was bought by Facebook, he promised users that these values wouldn?t be compromised.
?You can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication. There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product,? he said at the time.
However, Facebook has been under pressure to make money out of the free, encrypted messaging service, which now has 1.5 billion monthly users. Facebook has been taking steps that have chipped away at some of WhatsApp?s values.
In 2016, WhatsApp announced it would start sharing some user data, including phone numbers, with Facebook ? a move that was deeply unpopular among European regulators, who ordered Facebook to stop collecting data from WhatsApp users and fined the company.
Since then WhatsApp has started building and testing free tools to help businesses use WhatsApp to reach their customers, with the view to later start charging businesses. (The Guardian)

You said nothing, yet you saw everything
	
At the end of Akkara Paha, the film of the Madawala Ratnayake novel, we see the protagonist, Sena, and his lover, Sandawathi, run off to catch sight of his sister, who has just married. The two of them look on, from one side, as they wave at the newly-weds on the other, and contemplate on their own lives; Sena, the wayward prodigal, realises perhaps that he?s in for a life of misfortune (since he gave up every opportunity he got because of his inability to cope with life in the city he moved to). But for an instant at least, all that is forgotten, and as the film ends, and they walk away towards that life of misfortune, we hear Amaradeva croon a dirge on the inevitability of separation and reconciliation.
fjka fjkjd'''??
h,s yuqfjkjd'''?
Akkara Paha is, I think, one of the most underestimated great works of Sinhala cinema ever made, and it was made by Lester James Peries, who passed away last Sunday at the age of 99. Not many today have seen it, just as not many have seen Lester?s other great works, including the one that won him an entire nation after years of financial misfortune, Golu Hadawatha. The shift from his debut, Rekawa, to these films did not mean that he gave up being what Philip Cooray called a lonely artist. He remained lonely, right till the end. But far from being a weakness, a defect, this remained his legacy, because in being lonely, he taught everyone, anyone, the power of the cinema in recording the lives we had led.??
Lester James Peries was, until his last, a book waiting to be written, chaptered, and categorised in great detail. No one took the time. It?s not that no one wanted to, but that times had changed from those which he lived in and with changing times people were content in seeing what he had done and appreciating what he had filmed. All things considered, his movies remain a pretty good record of life as it was lived at a particular time, and even his historical romances, especially Sandeshaya, contain a tinge of authenticity in how their characters walk and talk.??
Lester was the last of the generation that helped create and sustain the cultural revolution that was 1956. He was the last proof that such a thing happened, and that the historic eventuality that particular revolution revolved around, free education, helped unleash fully the art forms which had been cut off from the people for a long, long time. Movies, at the outset, never bothered to record life. Lester provided us with a reference point there. And although Rekawa was castigated in several quarters ? even Dr. W. Dahanayake critiqued it ? the man learnt quickly. And in learning quickly, he advanced quickly. He was nimble, agile.??
His movies are great in this sense not just because of how they appeal to our world view ? through the techniques they thrive on, along with the motifs that crop up like from a symphony in all of them ? but also because of how they capture the subtlest nuances, the gentlest moods and gestures, thereby capturing the dramatic in the un-dramatic. The sequence of Sugath coming across Dhammi at the carousel; the sequence of Sena coming across Theresa in her bedroom; the sequence of Willie Abeynayake dancing in an apotheosis of quiet, contained ecstasy with the woman he married to offer as a sacrifice: in these, the camera transcends its physical limits and records a mood, a gesture, a way of life that we can only hear through silence. It?s no coincidence that Golu Hadawatha and even Delovak Athara were movies which could have gone down the (always easy) path of histrionics and hysterics. They needed Lester to be toned down.??
Reconciliation and separation: that?s what makes up nearly every story he worked on. From the condemned son in Rekawa to the estranged mother in Ammawarune, his characters prefer to reveal their feelings in the subtlest way possible, and in so doing, they achieve a fulfilment of their deepest desires, even if not in the way they hope to achieve them: Nissanka (Delovak Athara) with his realisation that confessing to the police is the best option he has left; Sugath with his eventual reconciliation with Dhammi; and Sena with his understanding of Sandawathi, the only woman who truly loved him. If the family seems to loom largely in Lester?s work here, it?s because in Sri Lanka, the family remains a kind of cornerstone, a point of reference, for all of us. So when it breaks away ? as it does in Kaliyugaya and Awaragira ? we are moved not to fear, but to horrified compassion, since that act of breaking away implies what might have been; familial bonds, even when absented, remain a potent truth in his world.??
It has been said of Cartier-Bresson that he took so many photographs because he loved human beings. If this is true, I think it can be applied to Lester too. Not because he was sentimental about the characters he shot and their real-life counterparts, but because he came from a tradition which eschewed the overtly political for the gently, suavely humanist. If by humanist you mean an artist who portrays the lives of ordinary people, caringly, then I see no problem in applying that term to Lester, who on countless occasions said, and noted, that he owed Jean Renoir and Vittorio de Sica for what he continued to do in the industry.??
We can say that he was charitable, that he helped everyone who came to him, even when they forgot him. But we can also say that among those people, there was one who never left him or gave up on his efforts. That was his wife, Sumitra.??
But neither Lester nor Sumitra found it easy to live or to work. 20 movies over 50 years can hardly be considered prodigious; and if we are to fault these two for that I think we are making the most egregious error we can make. Those 50 years, a long, long time for any film-maker, were spent wading through immense difficulties. And not just financial. They were let down, constantly, by people who promised them everything and went away; one of Lester?s unrealised projects, which may have been a masterpiece if it were shot, was a biopic of Robert Knox, which went down the drain the moment one of its financiers, affiliated to a German TV station, was found to be siphoning off money from the project. Lester?s career is filled with several setbacks like that. Who hasn?t faced them? Who wouldn?t? The important point is that the man never made those setbacks an excuse to go back. He always returned, he always gave. To us.??
Like motifs from one long symphony, Lester?s films can be discussed separately or collectively. I remember Rajpal Abeynayake writing once that what makes his films stand out is the fact that they represent a body of work that is not diffuse, that is not disjointed, and that is instead well formed and cohesive. When Lester won a Lifetime Award at Cannes, and journalists and writers contended that the man had finally stepped away from the sidelines, Rajpal was not a little sceptical. ?He may have been forgotten in Cannes,? he wrote, ?But he is not forgotten in Sri Lanka? ? in which, I think, we can sense a kind of irony, because, for many years, many of us subscribed to the notion that the world had revered the man, while we, his countrymen, had forgotten him. He WAS forgotten, of course: by the political pamphleteers, who lambasted him, and even by those who sought his advice, crossed terrains, made strides, and then cast him away because he and Sumitra were expendable to them. What was marginalised was the fact that Lester and Sumitra were the only professional purveyors of art cinema that we had. Yes, ?art cinema? is hardly a term you use when discussing his works. Perhaps categorising the cinema he stood for is an exercise in futility.??
He was a man who could make a film about a peasant and a walawu karaya on equal terms. Like the men he revered in his day, especially Renoir, whom he revered more than anyone else, he did not view human beings as set pieces and props to be labelled and turned into propaganda. That the lovers of Golu Hadawatha had the luxury of a comfortable, privileged life to return to, that the protagonist of Delovak Athara hailed from a bourgeois background in Colombo 7, could not have bothered discerning audiences who saw these films and felt and cared about the characters in them. When Pauline Kael wrote of Renoir?s Grand Illusion, that while its message was for universal brotherhood and compassion (Renoir was an avowed Socialist), it was also an elegy for the European aristocracy, she might have been describing Lester himself, who, like the Frenchman, elegised and eulogised the aristocracy in film after film. No other movie-maker here has been as able to turn the rich and the privileged into figures of empathy; that says a lot about where he came from, and where we come from.??
So yes, we knew this day would come. But for the life of me, we didn?t want it. Frankly, I know I didn?t. But it had to come. Which is what makes the pain of knowing that the man is no more, that he is gone, all the more painfully evident.?
