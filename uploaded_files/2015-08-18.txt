?Be prepared to face both applause and boos!?
	
This Betel leaf politico hailing from the Kegalle area, once a close loyalist of the former strongman threw in his lot with the Maithri camp when the party was in turmoil. By a bizarre turn of events, his onetime boss on whom he turned his back eventually became his campaign boss. There were several Blue party candidates in the same boat with him and some of them were hooted at by the crowds when they appeared on the same stage with the former strongman.
This particular politico knew the same ?hoot treatment? was in store for him if he appeared on a campaign stage in the company of the former strongman. And plagued by a blue funk of being a target of cat-calls, he had to avoid attending a series of propaganda rallies in his district.
The politico in utter desperation had later appealed to the former strongman to save him from a possible embarrassing situation at the final Betel leaf party rally in the district. The politico had bucked up some courage to face the worst, when the former strongman told him: ?When you are in politics, you have to face both applause and boos alike. Otherwise, you should quit politics!?
Our worthy finally decided to make his appearance on the stage at the Betel leaf party final rally in the district. And as he got on to the stage, he was greeted by a deafening din of boos and cat-calls.? The crowds had later stopped booing following an appeal by the former strongman himself, they say.

Capital infusion ends up in political henchman?s bank account!
	
This institution was established years ago with a view to providing essential goods to consumers at a fair price.? Always run by political appointees and often described as a den of corruption it was on the rocks as usual when the yahapalanaya government took office.
The new government had recently pumped several billions of rupees into the floundering institution in a bid to put it back on its feet.? Eagle-eyed trade unionists have now discovered that a certain powerful secretarial one had transferred a large part of this capital infusion to the bank account of a political stooge.
As a result, the institution is back in the red, and is short of funds even to pay for goods such as rice, coconuts, dried fish and lentils supplied by local dealers, they say.
Employees say that they are at a loss to understand why the successive administrations have made it a practice to appoint political hangers-on with dubious track records to run the state-owned enterprises!

MR concedes election defeat
	
	Former president Mahinda Rajapakse told AFP today that he had conceded defeat in parliamentary elections, but he will work as an opposition member of the legislature.
	"My dream of becoming prime minister has faded away. I am conceding. We have lost a good fight,? Rajapakse told AFP. Rajapakse accepted that his United People's Freedom Alliance had lost even before Elections Chief Mahinda Deshapriya could announce the final results.
	"We have won eight districts and the UNP (ruling United National Party) has 11 (out of a total of 22), it means we have lost. It was a difficult fight, ? Rajapakse said.
	Official figures showed the same breakdown of results. Remaining three districts were dominated by a minority Tamil party, officials said, adding that no party was set to secure an absolute majority of 113 seats in the 225-member parliament following Monday's election.
	Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said he expected the release of the final party positions by midday Tuesday, while individual votes garnered by candidates would be announced later. Rajapakse cast his ballot on Monday, he expressed confidence that he could return to power as Sri Lanka's prime minister just months after he was toppled as president.election commissioner Deshapriya said the vote, called a year ahead of schedule by President Maithripala Sirisena who ousted the veteran leader in January, had been one of the most peaceful in Sri Lanka's history. His surprise victory over his former mentor, Sirisena has struggled to impose his authority over his United people's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) party and was powerless to prevent Rajapakse from standing as one of its candidates.

?Didn?t you bring us presents?? the boy asked the former strongman.
The former strongman reached inside his pockets and found nothing that he could offer the boy.
?Sorry, son. I have nothing on me that I can give you as a present now. But I will send you something as soon as I get back to Colombo,? an apologetic former strongman consoled the boy who looked highly disappointed.?????

The boy with his eyes filled with tears said: ?I was in the front here for a long time waiting for you, because I thought you would bring us some presents.?

Video: We should have performed better: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which admitted to the fact that it had not performed as expected at yesterday?s election said the party would however function as a vibrant and effective political party while being in the opposition.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that his party would play an active role as members of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in the new Parliament.
However, Mr. Dissanayake said the JVP would not be involved in supporting the party which forms the next government or participate in any political games being played by UPFA factions.
He said the party which won the most number of seats would attempt to woo others into their fold to make up the numbers while the other parties in the opposition might attempt to woo others into their fold to topple the government.
Mr. Dissanayake, however said the JVP would not participate in any of these political games. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
