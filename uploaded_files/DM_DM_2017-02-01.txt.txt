An Authors Writing Cannot Ease His Hardships
	
Norman Saranaweera is a blind, retired English teacher and the author of the English Language book, Easy Way Of Learning English Grammar and Composition. His purpose for writing such a book is so that both children and adults alike will have access to a simple and comprehensive way of learning the English Language, so that they too will be able to enjoy what the language has to offer. The book is written simply and is easy to understand and provides comprehensive knowledge on the correct use of the grammar. He hopes that those who find it difficult to learn the language will turn to his book for help and it will allow them to obtain knowledge from various avenues. 
Mr. Saranaweera believes that children in Sri Lanka are unable to study English effectively due to their insufficient knowledge of grammar. Likewise, he believes that teachers too face difficulties in teaching the subject because they too lack the same knowledge, During my teaching career, I was able to find that a lot of students face difficulties in studying English. Knowledge of grammar is essential when learning and understanding a language. That is why after my retirement from the post of teaching I made up my mind to write this book.On the other hand, most of the English teachers are not good at teaching English grammar in particular. Teachers with superficial knowledge of English are appointed by the government to schools as a job giving programme without thinking of the student population living in Sri Lanka. To mitigate this situation my book is very helpful in the matter of teaching English grammar in particular. 
Mr. Saranaweera has had a flourishing career for over 29 years. It took him two years to finish writing his grammar book and he faced many difficulties on the way. The book was written in braille and had to be dictated to a typist who entered it into the computer. He had also developed a condition called peripheral neuropathy, which makes him unable to stand on his own and makes it difficult to walk. However, he did not allow his hardships to get in the way of his book being published and the thought of helping the students of Sri Lanka drove him and gave him strength in order to complete it. Although he faced many hardships he is determined to write a second book based on idioms as he feels the knowledge on the subject is inadequate. 
Born as a blind child in 1953 to a poverty-stricken family in a then primitive village called Oluvara, Mr. Saranaweera was not admitted to school until the age of ten due to parental apathy. He received his primary and secondary education from the School for the Blind at Ratmalana, where he learnt to read and write in English Braille. As a result, he liked to read a lot of books in English which sparked his interest in the language. After studying at Harischandra Vidyalaya of Negombo for his Advanced Level exams Mr. Saranaweera was accepted to the University of Peradeniya where he studied English as a subject. After graduating from university in 1983,he was given an English teaching appointment by the government under the Graduates Placement Scheme. Later he was also selected to follow a one year diploma course in TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) through a competitive placement test by the NIE (National Institute of Education at Maharagama). Furthermore, he was selected through a same test to read for the Post Graduate Diploma course in Education laying a main emphasis on TESL by the faculty of Education of Colombo University. Finally, in 2001 he followed an MA course, entirely in the English medium on Buddhist studies at the Pali Buddhist Post Graduate Institute. 
At present I am very interested in engaging in the process of long-life education in order to update my knowledge on the important current affairs of the world. Therefore, I am voracious and avid reader of current affairs such as Buddhism, politics, and some other current news in English in particular, he added. 
Although Mr. Saranaweera is a qualified government teacher who has taught in 5 schools, he had to retire in 2012/13 due to the development of his condition, peripheral neuropathy. His only income is from his book and his pension which is not sufficient to make ends meet. He is married with two children, one who is in University and the other studying for his A/Levels. He currently has no land to his name and lives on rent which is an added expense to his medical and living expenses. Mr. Saranaweera lives a life of disability and poverty which is the most difficult type of life to live, I do not have my own house of residence to live with my family in this country and I am leading a poverty stricken life. In the last regime I requested a house from the housing minister who turned his blind eye and deaf ears to my problem without giving any reply for the request. At present I am highly depressed and in mental agony because I do not have my own house to live in with my children until my death comes. If there is any philanthropist who wishes to help me in any way, it would be highly appreciated by my family including myself. 
Mr. Saranaweera currently resides in Seeduwa and can be contacted through email,suadorganization12@gmail.com or telephone: +94 71 724 3649 or 011 3 476258

Both sides should act responsibly: Minister
	
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara today said he regretted if Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary had to face any inconvenience because of the phone conversation with Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake.
Issuing a statement after meeting between Sri Lanka Administrative Services Association (SLASA) officers, the Minister said it was the responsibility of both the Government and the State employees to look at the situation in an impartial manner without being aggressive.
He said a discussion was held with the SLASA representatives recently over the issue. The dignity of their services and security had also been discussed.
As a responsible member of the Government and a Minister, we are dedicated to the protection of State employees and their reputation, the Minister said.
Commenting on the controversial incident, he said it appeared that the Deputy Minister was inquiring into an environmental issue, which affected the people.
Minister Maddumabandara said it was only natural for a peoples representative to act emotionally when it came to an issue like this.
However, it doesnt mean I approved what had happened. Yet, again, the Deputy Minister had appeared on behalf of the people, not to raise a personal matter, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Canadas Justin Trudeau, the open-armed anti-Trump
	

By Avi Selk 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became the open-armed anti-Trump to millions of people over the weekend when he publicly welcomed refugees to Canada, hours after the U.S. president barred many from his shores. 
Some wondered whether Trudeaus invitation was just talk. Last nights apparent terrorist attack on a Canadian mosque was just the sort of horror that President Donald Trump had said his ban would protect against. 
But Canadas government has made good on Trudeaus words - offering temporary residence to any traveler who is stranded in Canada as a result of a controversial and confusing travel ban, the Globe and Mail reports. 
As noted in the papers handy guide to Trumps executive order - Ive been stranded. What can I do - the offer wont do much good for people stuck in countries that arent Canada, including those who arrived in the United States with U.S. visas, only to be detained and face deportation. 
But some travelers were hit with the ban while en route from Canada to the United States, the Globe and Mail reported. They can now stay in the north - at least until Americans sort out the chaotically implemented order. 
Trumps executive order, which was signed Friday, bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for three months, with longer restrictions on refugees.
The president said the bans would give his administration time to strengthen vetting procedures and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States - though The Washington Post reported that Trumps aides keep citing terrorist attacks that the ban would not have prevented, and others have accused Trump of trying to make good on his campaign promise to bar Muslims from the country. 
Canadian officials also reported confusing and conflicting responses from the White House, according to the Globe and Mail. 
Even Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was unable to answer basic questions about the ban when his Canadian counterpart first asked him about it, the newspaper reported. The confusion left Canadian politicians questioning what steps to take next. 
For some stranded travelers, theres now a solution: Live in Canada, for a while,if you want. 
Canadians are proud of our long history of acting with compassion and humanitarianism to those seeking refuge for themselves and their families, said immigration minister Ahmed Hussen - who the Globe and Mail noted was born in one of the countries whose citizens are barred from the United States.

The Diyawanna group of the Green party had its regular powwow the other day with the Green leader in the chair.

The main items of the days agenda duly disposed of, the members were given time to air grievances related to their constituencies.
A talkative young member from the city whose name reminds one of a founding leader of a SAARC nation pointed out that the construction work on a school in his area was yet to get off the ground despite years having gone by since laying the foundation stone. I understand that no funds for this have been released so far, he said and added: Trenches dug for laying the foundation get filled with water. They have to use a motor pump to drain out this water practically every day!  A voice from among the members was heard before anyone responsible could give a reply: There is a severe drought on and theres a scarcity of drinking water! From where do these trenches get so much water that necessitates a motor pump to drain it
Loud guffaws greeted this query and a smiling Green leader said: Let us get on with the next question!

## Title: Four more men accused of smuggling 72 Lankan into Canada go on trial

Four more men accused of smuggling 72 Lankan into Canada go on trial
	
Less than a week after four men accused in a human smuggling case involving Tamil migrants walked free, four more men charged in a similar case saw their trial open in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.
Last Wednesday, a jury found three men charged with smuggling 492 Sri Lankan Tamils into Canada aboard the MV Sun Sea in 2010 not guilty. The judge in the case declared a mistrial for the fourth accused.
On Tuesday, four more men  Francis Anthonimuthu Appulonappa, Hamalraj Handasamy, Jeyachandran Kanagarajah and Vignarajah Thevarajah  entered not guilty pleas after re-electing to be tried by judge alone instead of by a jury.
The four accused in the second trial allegedly smuggled 72 Tamil migrants into Canada aboard another ship, the MV Ocean Lady, in 2009.
Some of the same issues involved in the first trial are expected to be at the heart of the second trial.
At the first trial, the accused argued that they were either acting for a humanitarian purpose or had been misidentified by the authorities.
In her opening statement Tuesday, Crown counsel Margaret Loda said that the main issue will be whether the actions of the accused fall within or outside the exceptions to human smuggling under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, those exceptions including providing humanitarian aid.
"At the end of the day, the Crown will be arguing that all four men helped move 72 undocumented migrants into Canada and that their primary motive was financial," Loda told B.C. Supreme Court Justice Arne Silverman.
Loda said that in September 2009, the ship left the shore of a small port on an island just north of Jakarta, Indonesia, travelling towards Canada through the Gulf of Thailand.
At the time the MV Ocean Lady left Indonesia, it had about 40 Sri Lankan Tamils aboard. Somewhere in the Gulf of Thailand, it picked up about 35 more migrants, who met the ship on the open seas aboard small fishing trawlers.
"The price tag for most of (the migrants) was between $30,000 and $40,000, with an average $5,000 down payment," Loda told the judge.
The ship was a coastal vessel that was intended to accommodate only 10 crew members and was not designed to cross the ocean, she said.
Handasamy was the captain of the ship and Thevarajah was the chief engineer, in charge of the engine room, said the prosecutor.
"The Crown's theory is that these two men were in charge of the ship and all of the people on it."
On one occasion, some of the migrants were threatened that if their payments didn't come through, they would be sent back to Sri Lanka, said the Crown.
The two other accused  Appulonappa and Kanagarajah  had important jobs on and off the ship, said Loda.
"They each helped the migrants travel to the ship, one operating in Indonesia and one operating in Thailand."
Appulonappa also worked in the engine room and Kangarajah was responsible for distributing water to the migrants, both of them receiving reduced fares for the trip, said Loda.
The second trial has had a protracted journey through the courts.
In January 2013, Justice Silverman ruled that the human smuggling law was unconstitutional and dismissed the charges against the accused.
In May 2014, a three-judge panel of the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned Silverman's ruling and ordered a new trial.
But that ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which found that acts of humanitarian assistance or aid between family members do not amount to smuggling. Canada's highest court ordered a new trial for the four men. (calgaryherald)

His daring scares away top bureaucrats
	

There is a certain purohita who is said to be highly upset these days due to a problem that defies a solution.

None of the secretaries appointed to his Ministry ever since his first secretary going on retirement had stayed put in this key post for more than a few days. A senior bureaucrat who succeeded the retired one had tendered his resignation shortly after assuming duties. Another mandarin from the provincial service appointed to fill the vacancy too had quit office a week after taking up the post. So the purohita has made a desperate appeal to the authorities in the highest echelons to appoint a secretary who would stick to the post.
Some parties who had been wondering as to why the top white collar ones have come to shun a high post like this in public service like the plague think that they have found an answer to this riddle; their strong aversion to certain goings-on in the Ministry and fear of being hauled before courts at a future date if the Ministerial orders are carried out.
No wonder no sensible white collar high-up would want to work under a purohita known to have the daring to resort to Wilpattu-type of activity, informed ones say.

Illegal vehicle assembly complex raided: 54 vehicles found
	
At least 54 vehicles, which were illegally assembled, causing a loss of Rs. 325 million to the government, were recovered by the Panadura-Walana Central Anti-Corruption Unit and the Sri Lanka Customs during a raid yesterday.
The Panadura-Walana Central Anti-Corruption Unit launched an investigation under the instructions of DIG Ranmal Kodithuwakku in connection with a petition which stated that vehicles parts were being imported illegally and sold after they were assembled in the country.
Investigations had revealed that Vehicle Lanka Private Limited had assembled the vehicles at a complex situated in the Minuwangoda Industrial Zone. The complex had also been used to store vehicles without engines and vehicles which were returned by Customers, police said.
The company had assembled the vehicles at the premises and then sold them in the local market before it was released by Sri Lanka Customs, officials said.
Police spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said the company had violated the Customs Act and caused a large financial loss to the government by exporting vehicle parts illegally.
The police had obtained a search warrant from the Minuwangoda Magistrate Court and raided the premises with the assistance of the Customs officials.
Police recovered 29 cars, 22 jeeps, two vans and parts of another vehicle during the raid. Police said an administrative officer at the company had failed to produce any documents when the raid was carried out.
The vehicles recovered in the complex were given to the Customs Department for further investigation as they were illegally brought into the country.
Customers of Vehicle Lanka Private (Ltd) who suspect they have been scammed by the company are requested to call the Panadura-Walana Central Anti-Corruption Unit via 038 -2234314 and 039- 2234315.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Is a top head about to roll
	

Political circles are abuzz with the talk about a reshuffle of the top team these days.

There is a strong demand by the opposition to sack a certain purohita holding a key portfolio and this demand is being backed by a sizable section from the government. This has fueled the speculation about a shake-up of the top team in the offing.
Meanwhile, there is a growing general consensus that an astute and well educated person completely free from the taint of corruption should hold this key portfolio, they say. In the wake of the speculation that the unpopular purohita is going to be dumped, two Green hopefuls from the Colombo district have already entered the running for the coveted office. One of them is a young academic and the other a mature intellectual, they say.
However, a high political authority is said to have indicated his preference for a senior Green man hailing from the Kegalle area. A clearer picture about the situation is expected to emerge within the coming fortnight, they say.

## Title: New mosquito that can transmit malaria discovered

New mosquito that can transmit malaria discovered
	
Children with severe malaria frequently develop severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria
	Malaria is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoe
	In adults, multi-organ involvement is also frequent. 
	The first symptoms are fever, headache, chills and vomiting. 
	There are more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquito; around 30 are malaria vectors of major importance
	Symptoms appear 7 days or more (usually 1015 days) after the infective mosquito bite in a non-immune individual

Malaria is a life-threatening disease transmitted by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There have been several malaria epidemics in the past and a major attempt in eradicating the disease failed and consequently there was a resurgence of the epidemic . The worst malaria epidemic was recorded between the years 1934 and 1935 when there was a severe drought, food shortages and a malaria outbreak in the wet zone which is an area supposed to be malaria free. 
In 1945 regular spraying of DDT started in malaria endemic regions and the number of malaria cases decreased strikingly that it gave hope of eradicating malaria. Yet an epidemic broke out once again in 1968 and vectors resistant to DDT were discovered. This raised serious concern as by 1980 all efforts to control malaria proved to be futile as it reached a situation similar to the pre-DDT period.
Subsequently health authorities started using malathion instead of DDT and there were effective changes in the Anti-Malaria Campaign as well. The struggle to control and eradicate malaria persisted through the civil war and ultimately last year, the World Health Organization(WHO) certified that Sri Lanka has eliminated malaria and is malaria free as there were no infections reported in the preceding three years. The eradication of malaria in Sri Lanka has given hopes for more than 30 countries as it shows that persisting commitment can remove malaria. 
However the discovery of an Anopheles stephensi mosquito in Mannar recently which can transmit Malaria has raised concern among health authorities and they are taking possible precautions to prevent a resurgence of the disease. 
Speaking to Daily Mirror Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the Deputy Director General of Health Services said an Anopheles stephensi mosquito was identified in Mannar. This mosquito is predominantly found in India. This is an urban mosquito as it can survive in the urban environment. Usually the Anopheles mosquito is found in rural dry areas, he said. 
If this particular type of mosquito spreads in the country there is a probability of contracting malaria in urban areas as well. This mosquito has to suck the blood of a malaria infected patient to be able to transmit it to another, he added. 
Precautions taken
We have started fogging the area, and putting abate, a chemical, in breeding places. We are doing entomological surveillance to find out if there are more mosquitoes of this type. We are also spraying Indoor residual insecticides, Dr. Amunugama said adding that the health authorities were taking all actions to prevent transmission. He requested the people in Mannar to assist them in preventing the spread of the mosquito. 
To diagnose the disease it is necessary to get a blood film and test it for malaria parasites, he said. He believes that the discovery of the mosquito in Mannar will not affect the malaria-free status in the country.

Pakistan cracks down on group linked to Mumbai attacks
	

Pakistan has placed the chief suspect behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks under house arrest as it cracks down on the group linked to the carnage.

Firebrand cleric Hafiz Saeed, who heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) group and has a $10 million US bounty on his head, is to be placed under preventative detention, according to the Interior Ministry order. JuD is listed as a terror outfit by the United Nations, considered by the US and India to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the group blamed for the attack on Mumbai. 
Police took Saeed away from a mosque in Lahore late Monday and escorted him to his residence where they appear to be holding him under house arrest, an AFP journalist reported.

Pedagogue goes off at a tangent
	

A delegation of chief purohitas the other day called on the former strongman at his official residence in the city.

The chief purohitas, all from the Betel leaf party were bent on negotiating an agreement with the former boss to contest the upcoming local and provincial polls as a unified entity.
The talks were proceeding on a cordial note when a Diyawanna member, a well-known pedagogue, going off on a tangent launched a long-winded lecture on the countrys economic crisis and several topical issues like the bond scam. Finding that the discussion was moving on a wrong track, one of the chief purohitas who happened to be a past pupil of the pedagogue pointed out that they were veering away from their subject.
However, the pedagogue continued to hold fort regardless. At this stage, the chief purohita interposed: Sir, I am a pupil of yours. Your lecture is certainly interesting and we dont mind listening to it. But not now, but at some other time! Now let us get back to our subject under discussion!
And that exhortation from the pupil silenced the voluble politico and negotiations were soon back on the track.

Solomon Islands to probe Sri Lankan over accident
	
Solomon Police have been urged to investigate a Sri Lankan, who was involved in an accident at the Mendana Avenue in Honiaraon the night of October 29, 2016, Solomon Star reported today.
The Sri Lankan who was in his mid-40s was an Information Technology (IT) Manager of the Pan Oceanic Bank (POB) and was reportedly drunk at the time of the accident.
Sources have relayed the information and urged the police to investigate him after noticing that the investigation into the accident has vanished completely - where they think some fishy dealings might be the cause.
Solomon Star was tipped about the incident in early December 2016, where an inquiry was carried out thereafter.
Pan Oceanic Banks Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was asked on 14th December 2016 about the incident.
He replied and confirmed the accident which also involved a girl who was correspondingly a staff of the bank.
We are aware that there was an accident involving a local staff member on holiday, outside normal working hours.
Bank will do whatever it takes to ensure the wellbeing of any staff member of the bank, the CEO stated in a reply email to the Solomon Star.
The couple hit a street light post located opposite the Honiara Casino, when travelling eastward to town in a black car owned by the bank  both were believed to be drunk.
The suspect and the local girl were then taken to the police station for questioning and remanded in the police custody.
They were later released the same night.
According to sources within the bank, the Sri Lankan was supposed to go to court on a given date but he did not turn up.
Solomon Star was told that the suspect left the country towards the end of November, seeking medical attention in Australia after falling ill after the accident.
After over a month away from the country, he returned on January 18, a fortnight ago.
When this paper contacted him to comment on the incident, he denied being involved in any accident.
On January 19, he visited the Solomon Star headquarters at Henderson insisting that news about the accident did not go into print.
I have other issues with the bank. My return here is to question my status as an employee of the POB. When I reached here, I was restricted entry into the bank premises, he said.
When questioned about his involvement in the accident, he declined to comment but stated that the police have already taken care of the matter.
He then returned to see the Solomon Star editor on January 20 to ensure that the article was not published.
Knowing that the paper is well aware of the incident, he said he did not want to comment but will send a response to the Solomon Star by email.
To this date, this paper did not hear anything from him, though he was given the opportunity to respond.
Solomon Star also received photographs of the location of the accident and the vehicle that was involved.
Meanwhile, the informants have insisted and urged that police officers that are handling the case to continue with the investigation honestly as this is their mandated job.
Solomon Star was informed over the weekend that the suspect received his marching orders from the bank last week  he was previously suspended following some other issues he formerly had with the bank that are currently under investigation.

Special certificate a must for bus drivers from June 1: DMT
	
All SLTB and private passenger bus drivers must possess a special driving certificate issued after a special training provided by the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) with effect from June 1, Motor Traffic Department Commissioner General Jagath Chandrasiri said today.
This would be along with the driving licence, he said.
Addressing media at the DMT head office the Commissioner said the Gazette notification related to passenger transport had been issued on February 6, 2016.
Accordingly all the drivers, who transport passengers, should obtain the special certificate issued by DMT.
Three-wheeler drivers and school van drivers would be trained in the second stage.
The department had taken this decision to streamline the driver discipline and to reduce road accidents, he said.
The special training had already been given to all Sri Lanka Transport Bus (SLTB) drivers. So far, 17,000 drivers of private buses had been given with the help of the Transport Board and the National Transport Commission (NTC).
From June 1, bus drivers should have the new certificate to drive passenger buses, he said.
Newly issued driving licences will have PT printed on them to indicate that the driver had obtained the special training. Others should possess their licence and certificate with them, he said.
Bus drivers who dont have the certificate will not be allowed to take to the wheel. From last August 1 this process is in effect. It is an essential certificate for the traffic Police to check during an accident, Mr. Chandrasiri said.
He said the bus drivers were trained in the first stage of the special passenger transport driver training programme while three-wheeler drivers and school van drivers would be trained in the second stage. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Student with far-right sympathies charged  in Quebec  mosque attack
	

By Alan Freeman, Lindsey Bever & Derek Hawkins 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
QUEBEC CITY - Canadian authorities on Monday charged a 27-year-old university student known for his far-right sympathies with six counts of first-degree murder in a mass shooting the day before at a local mosque. 

Alexandre Bissonnette, was described by neighbours and acquaintances as a socially awkward introvert who had recently adopted virulent political views. 
He was charged late Monday afternoon with five counts of attempted murder with a restricted firearm. The five surviving victims were still in the hospital, with two of them in critical condition, although hospital officials said their injuries were not life-threatening. 
Handcuffed, his feet manacled and wearing a white prison jumpsuit, Bissonnette reportedly looked at the floor throughout the court hearing, aside from casting a brief glance at his lawyer. The prosecutor, Thomas Jacques, indicated that terrorist charges could be added later to the murder and attempted murder charges. 
The attack, which took place just as about 50 worshipers at the small mosque in the suburb of Sainte-Foy near Laval University had completed evening prayer, sent shock waves through Canada. Accustomed to seeing violence as a phenomenon taking place in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, Canadians found themselves in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was clear that his government considered the shooting a terrorist act. This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith, Trudeau told the House of Commons. Make no mistake. This was a terrorist attack. 
Bissonnette was described in media reports as an ardent nationalist and a strong supporter of the French far-right politician Marine Le Pen. He was known to activists in Quebec for taking positions against feminism and refugees, Franois Deschamps of the pro-refugee group Bienvenue aux Rfugis said on his Facebook page. 
The suspect was captured by police about 15 miles from the scene of the attack after he called 911 and offered to surrender. The police initially said they had also arrested a 29-year-old engineering student at the mosque. By Monday afternoon, they had released him and called him a witness to the event. 
It turned out the witness, Mohamed Belkhadir, had left the mosque at the end of prayers and was near the building when he heard shots. Returning inside, he called 911 and began helping a friend who had been shot. When he saw armed police arrive, he panicked and ran off and was quickly stopped. He said the police had treated him well. 
On Rue du Tracel, a quiet crescent of modest houses in suburban Cap-Rouge about a 15-minute drive from the mosque, Rejean Bussieres knew something was up when several police cars descended on his street Monday morning. Having heard of the shooting, he said, he immediately thought it could be Bissonnette. 
He used to like to break things as a kid, said Bussieres, who has been a neighbour of the family for 30 years. He was turbulent. 
Bussieress 23-year-old daughter, Rosalie, said the twins had reputations as nerds who were obsessed with violent computer games and were bullied at school. They were always just with each other. Its sad. They were always home alone, she said. 
According to Torontos Globe and Mail website, Vincent Boissoneault, a friend of the suspects who also studied at Laval University, said that Bissonnette had been uninterested in politics until Le Pen visited Quebec City last year. Soon Boissoneault was clashing with his friend over his support for Le Pen and Trump. 
I wrote him off as a xenophobe, Boissoneault told the newspaper. I didnt even think of him as totally racist, but he was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement.

The executive order is a shameful stain on our country

By Petula Dvorak 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
When they came through the arrivals gate at John F. Kennedy Internationl Airport in 1968, my parents could have been seen as a threat.  It was the middle of the Cold War, and my parents - my mom was 21 and my dad was 23 - had spent their entire lives behind the Iron Curtain in a communist country. And 1968 was the bloodiest year yet for American troops in a war being fought to contain communism. Nearly 17,000 Americans died that year in Vietnam. 
And here came my parents through the airport gates in the middle of all of that, in the fanciest clothes they owned, two people with paperwork - Czechoslovakian passports - that linked them to communism. 
They were not detained, they were not questioned. They were allowed into a country symbolized by the Statue of Libery. 
That was the America of 1968. It is not the America of today. 
My parents watched this weekend, in horror, by the scenes unfolding across this 2017 America, as people like them - refugees with nothing more than suitcases and dreams - were treated so differently when they walked through those airport gates. 
It was the second weekend of Donald Trumps presidency, and, once again, hed generated a wave of protests in Washington and around the country. This time the outrage was aimed at his decision to sign an executive order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Trumps Muslim ban, basically. 
At the White House, up Massachusetts Avenue to the Islamic Centre of Washington, outside the Trump International Hotel and at airport arrival gates across the region and the nation, thousands of people gathered to show support for refugees, green card holders and even American citizens who were suddenly banned from America. 
My mom imagined what would have happened if, back then, President Lyndon B. Johnson had signed an executive order banning all citizens of communist countries from
entering America. 
A chunk of American would have bought that, for sure. Fear sells. Communists were the enemy. 
But reason, empathy and humanity won.  Because when my parents left everything in Czechoslavakia behind, when they got green cards, and when they raised their hands to pledge allegiance to America, the immigrants of my parents era were seen as dissidents, heroes, even. 
Of course, it helped that my mother and father are white and from a Christian country. And it helped that our confrontations with communism didnt take place on American soil, for the most part. So they were celebrated for rejecting the enemy and embracing America. 
America 2, Communism 0. USA! 
This weekend, we became a country that detained a 5-year-old Bethesda, Maryland, boy at Dulles International Airport, kept him from his Iranian-born mother for hours to make sure he wasnt terrorist threat. 
Artiman Jalali was born in the United States and has dual citizenship with Iran. He was traveling back from visiting relatives with his 25-year-old cousin. Both were detained. 
His mother, Shohreh Rahnama, said she waited for him hours, until he and his cousin were finally released around midnight. He was hungry and he was thirsty, and I could not see him, she said. 
How can a 5-year-old be banned Just because his parents are Iranian We are American, too, she told my colleague, Michael Alison Chandler, at a protest outside the White House. I almost died in that airport. I can say it was the worst day of my life. 
We became the kind of place that treated Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had a valid U.S. visa and worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq, like a criminal when he flew into JFK airport. Overnight, America reneged on promises of citizenship and sanctuary to hundreds of people - translators, engineers, IT specialists, fixers. Some of them risked their lives for our military. 
A friend of mine who has worked in Afghanistan and Indonesia was stunned by this development. Over time, hes helped five people come to the U.S. from Afghanistan, all of them risked their lives helping fight terrorism in their home nation and in turn, he helped them find new lives here. 
He marched on Sunday, and as the crowd went past the Islamic Centr eof Washington, a woman handed out water bottles to the marchers and thanked them for her support. One of the marchers hugged her. 
And she buried her head in (the marchers) shoulder and began crying about how scared she is, he said. It is tragic to see the human toll on people who are already part of the fabric of America. 
This executive order is a shameful stain on our country, yanking the American dream out from under families who have been here for decades and from families in dangerous parts of the world who sold everything and endured years of vetting to join us. 
Why a sudden executive order To stop terrorism , Trump said. 
There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Trump tweeted Monday morning. 
It was wrong as part of his campaign, and its wrong now.

Trump fires defiant Acting Attorney General
	
Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, at the Justice Department in May 2015 in Washington, D.C.(The Washington Post/Evelyn Hockstein)  

By Sari Horwitz 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   
Acting attorney general Sally Quillian Yates, a longtime prosecutor from Atlanta, began her tenure as an Obama appointee two years ago by saying that pursuing justice was more important to her than bringing federal cases in court. 
Were not the Department of Prosecutions or even the Department of Public Safety, Yates said in May 2015, the week after she was confirmed as deputy attorney general, the second-highest-ranking position in the Justice Department. We are the Department of Justice. 
On Monday night, only days away from stepping down from her 27-year career in the Justice Department, Yates defied President Trump, ordering federal attorneys not to defend the controversial immigration order issued Friday. 
Within hours, Trump fired her. In a news release, the White House said Yates had betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who told The Washington Post he would enforce the presidents directive until Trump nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is confirmed. 
Yates, 56, struggled with her decision over the weekend, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. By Monday, though, she had concluded that she could not ask her federal attorneys to defend the order. 
Yates could not be reached for comment. She sent a memo to the civil division of the Justice Department and U.S. attorneys across the country saying she was not convinced the order was lawful, and that the department will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so. Hours later, at about 9:15 p.m., Yates received a hand-delivered letter from the White House that the president was removing her from office.

She did what she believes was the right thing to do and then she gets fired for it, the official said. This is not how she would have preferred to end her 27-year career. But she did what she had to do. 
Those who know Yates well said that her action was consistent with the independence and commitment to the rule of law they say she has exhibited throughout her career. 
For nearly three decades, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has served Presidents of both parties, defending the Constitution and holding terrorists and other criminals accountable, said former labor secretary Tom Perez, who was head of the civil rights division in the Obama administration. 
Acting Attorney General Yatess record is simply beyond reproach, said Perez, who is running to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. 
But Trumps senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, blasted Yates on Fox News after the acting attorney general was fired. 
It cant be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the presidents order, said Miller, who accused Yates of refusing to defend the lawful power of the president. He added that he had no doubt about the legality of the order. 
For the past two years, Yates has been responsible for the day-to-day running of the 113,000-employee Justice Department. She was also been responsible for overseeing the Justice Departments work on the prior White Houses clemency initiative, in which the president granted commutations to thousands of nonviolent drug offenders who met certain criteria set out by the administration.
She also wrote a new policy two years ago that became known as the Yates memo, which made the prosecution of individual executives - not just the corporations that employ them - a top priority for federal prosecutors. 
Former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said that Yates was known in the department for voicing her opinions when she thought the administration was going in the wrong direction. Pierce said Yates was particularly vocal during a debate over government access to encrypted communications during criminal investigations, when some officials wanted to make it harder for law enforcement to access the locked information. 
She advocated very strongly as a one-woman show for law enforcement and made the Obama administration pause on policies she thought would be harmful, Pierce said.

Trumps ban: Sri Lankans too detained at JFK
	
In the chaotic aftermath of US President Donald Trumps controversial immigration ban, 71 individuals from 20 countries including Sri Lanka were detained at New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday, Asian Correspondent said today.
According to the No Ban JFK, a coalition of volunteer attorneys camped out at JFK, those detained include a Malaysian and a Chinese national, as well as travellers from Turkey, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, France, Algeria, Jordan, Qatar, Senegal, Switzerland, Algeria, Egypt and Guinea, which were not on the US travel blacklist.
Others in the lawyers list released on social media include travelers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan and Libya, five of the seven countries named in Trumps ban. The remaining two are Yemen and Somalia.
Camille Mackler, Director of Legal Initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), pointed out in a statement that the detentions prove the ban affects more than just the seven targeted countries.
And the turmoil inflicted by this sudden disruption is spilling over into the broader United States, as family members desperately seek to reunite with their loved ones.
Students and professionals continue to be blocked from their homes, schools and workplaces, she said in the statement released by No Ban JFK.
She added that the attorneys at JFK have stayed put since Trump issued the executive order on Friday, offering legal assistance to those caught in the US governments immigration dragnet.
We are especially concerned with individuals being prevented from boarding flights at points of departure, Mackler said.
The team of pro-bono lawyers and volunteers at JFK are being coordinated by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and NYIC.
Asian Correspondent has contacted the group for updates on the situation at JFK. A press statement is expected by tomorrow.
Trump signed the executive order that banned citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US for the next 90 days. The order also suspended admission of all refugees for 120 days.
Over in Southeast Asia, politicians in Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia expressed concern as the ban took effect, although the two countries were not named in the list.

Two dissidents were held back
	

On hearing that two Deputies were set to attend the Nugegoda JO rally, the yahapalanaya high-ups had swung into action to hold them back.

One of them hailing from the Puttalam district had received a call asking him to get ready to make a visit to the United States.
After giving the call, the interested parties in yahapalanaya had done a rush-job of arranging the jaunt for January 26. It was no secret to the high political authorities, this Deputy had been a despondent one for some time and was poised for the jump. The other Deputy who had planned to attend the Nugegoda rally, a character from the South appears to have had second thoughts at the eleventh hour,they say.
However, according to JO sources, this member has not changed his mind and his crossover is just a matter of time.
